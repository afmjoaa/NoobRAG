This is because the feature for logos is a logical argument.\nHow do you appeal to logos?\nLogos is about appealing to your audience‚Äôs logical side. You have to think about what makes sense to your audience and use that as you build your argument. As writers, we appeal to logos by presenting a line of reasoning in our arguments that is logical and clear.\nWhat is an example of the logos appeal?\nLogos is an argument that appeals to an audience‚Äôs sense of logic or reason. For example, when a speaker cites scientific data, methodically walks through the line of reasoning behind their argument, or precisely recounts historical events relevant to their argument, he or she is using logos.\nWhat are methods of appeal?\nThere are different ways a speaker or writer can appeal to his or her audience: 1) logic or reason (logos), 2) emotion (pathos), and/or 3) ethics and morals (ethos).\nWhat is definition of ethos?\nEthos is a greek word which roughly translates to ‚Äúmoral character‚Äù. The idea of ethos as a means of persuasion was conceived by the Greek philosopher Aristotle in his work Rhetoric (sometimes called On Rhetoric). In Rhetoric, Aristotle establishes three primary modes of argument: ethos, logos, and pathos.\nWhich of the following questions should a writer ask himself when trying to determine his ethos?\nSome of the questions you can ask yourself as you evaluate an author‚Äôs ethos may include the following: Has the writer or speaker cited her sources or in some way made it possible for the audience to access further information on the issue? Does she demonstrate familiarity with different opinions and perspectives?\nWhat are the 4 rhetorical appeals?\nThe modes of persuasion or rhetorical appeals (Greek: pisteis) are strategies of rhetoric that classify the speaker‚Äôs appeal to the audience. These include ethos, pathos, and logos.\nHow do ads use logos?\nWhat is logos? Logos is the persuasive technique that aims to convince an audience by using logic and reason. Also called ‚Äúthe logical appeal,‚Äù logos examples in advertisement include the citation of statistics, facts, charts, and graphs.\nWhat is Logos and examples?\nLogos is the persuasive technique that aims to convince an audience by using logic and reason. Also called ‚Äúthe logical appeal,‚Äù logos examples in advertisment include the citation of statistics, facts, data, charts, and graphs.\nHow can logos build ethos?\n- Ethos. The first part of ethos is establishing your credentials to be speaking to the audience on the specific subject matter.\n- Logos. Here‚Äôs how Leith describes logos, the next link in the chain:\n- Pathos. Your logical argument will be that much more persuasive if it‚Äôs wrapped up with a good dose of emotion.\nWhy do we use logos?\nLogos are a point of identification; they‚Äôre the symbol that customers use to recognize your brand. Because a good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about your brand that the name of your company alone might not.\nHow do you define logos?\nLogos is a rhetorical or persuasive appeal to the audience‚Äôs logic and rationality. Examples of logos can be found in argumentative writing and persuasive arguments, in addition to literature and poetry.\nWhat are the 3 types of appeals?\nEthos, Pathos, and Logos are referred to as the 3 Persuasive Appeals (Aristotle coined the terms) and are all represented by Greek words. They are modes of persuasion used to convince audiences.\nWhat is emotional appeal examples?\nIn general, an effective way to create emotional appeal is to use words that have a lot of pathos associated with them. Pathos is an emotional appeal used in rhetoric that depicts certain emotional states. Some examples of ‚Äúpathos‚Äù charged words include: strong, powerful, tragic, equality, freedom, and liberty.\nWhat happens if an appeal is granted?\nGenerally, the losing party in a lawsuit may appeal their case to a higher court. The higher court then reviews the case for legal errors. If an appeal is granted, the lower court‚Äôs decision may be reversed in whole or in part. If an appeal is denied, the lower court‚Äôs decision stands."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2f72b5b-a648-4dbd-8fe1-c9d8cf223b64>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between blade baits and lipless crank baits when it comes to their dropping action during fishing? üé£","answer":"The key difference is that blade baits are typically allowed to drop naturally on a limp line, with most fishermen agreeing this is the most productive technique, while lipless crank baits are designed to sink and can be fished through the water column until an active fish is located. Blade baits' dropping action is often controlled, with some anglers even stifling or interrupting the natural drop, while lipless crank baits are specifically mentioned as sinking baits that can be used to fish any depth with ease.","context":["One of the best fall lures for fooling a variety of fish is one of the simplest: the blade bait. Consisting of little more than a metal head or belly molded to a thin blade stamped into the profile of a baitfish, blade baits are easy to fish, can catch any gamefish that likes to eat minnows, and are particularly productive when water temperatures begin to drop in the fall‚Äîor rise in the spring.\nPopular blade baits include the classic Heddon Sonar, the Vibe-E, Reef Runner Cicada, the Gay Blade from Cordelle, and Worden‚Äôs Showdown, to name a few of nearly a dozen makers of the metal lures.\nBlades can be cast and retrieved or trolled conventionally, but most anglers prefer to jig them vertically, using a simple lift-and-drop motion. That said, there is a wide range of lift speeds and distances that anglers use to fool autumn fish, and some anglers even stifle the drop or fall part of the retrieve, interrupting what would be a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù drop by adding action on the way down, or controlling its pace by keeping the line tight and dropping the lure at a slower-than-normal speed. Most fishermen agree that simply letting the metal blade drop at its own pace on a limp line is the most productive technique‚Äîand often when the take occurs.\nIn the autumn, when fish such as walleyes, crappies, bass, and trout are holding tight to structure, the late Ohio-based blade flipper and angler extraordinaire Jim Corey would cast to the shallows from a boat positioned just off the deeper edges to locate active fish. His hopping retrieve from the shallow flats to the depths beneath his boat imparted a leaping motion to the lure, which he made sure came into contact with the bottom between each short jump. After each hop, he recommended allowing the lure to flutter back to the bottom on a controlled slack line. Once the blade bait was worked back to below the boat, Corey would impart a vertical jigging action, allowing the lure to pound the bottom, sending up clouds of silt or ticking off gravel to attract fish in the area. After he determined the depth at which the active fish are holding, he focused on the productive blade presentation, either vertically jigging or casting.\nWhen running his beloved blades, Corey was careful to match his tackle to the weight of the lure he was using. When fishing blade baits weighing 1/8- to 3/8-ounce in shallower inland waters, he preferred a six-foot, medium-action spinning rod. When angling deeper, open waters with blades that may weigh 1/2- to 3/4-ounce, Corey switched to a medium/heavy-action bait casting outfit. On the reels of both, he spooled Berkley Fireline, 10-pound-test on the spinning reel, and 14-pound-test on the bait caster, which he preferred for its casting capabilities and sensitivity. Using a double Uni-knot, he attached a leader of fluorocarbon and used a round-nosed snap to attach the lure. His leaders would test 10 pounds with the spinning rig and 15 pounds with the bait casting outfit, and were 18 to 20 feet in length.\n‚ÄúThe Fireline alone sinks too fast, and the long fluorocarbon leader slows down the descent of the bait, which triggers more strikes,‚Äù Corey explained to me. ‚ÄúAnd when a fish is at the boat, I don‚Äôt like having a knot between me and the fish. The long leader means the weakest link‚Äîthe knot‚Äîis on the spool when I‚Äôm landing the fish.‚Äù\nMake sure you have an assortment of blades aboard your boat this fall, fish ‚Äôem like the late blade runner himself, and you‚Äôll be reaching for the landing net in no time.","LURES FOR CATCHING MURRAY COD\nMurray Cod will eat just about any lure when they are in the mood. There are a variety of lures that are proven \"fish takers\" and they all fall into one of the following 5 categories.\nHard Bodied Lures......................\nLipless Crank Baits..................\nHard bodied lures are by far the most popular lures when it comes to trolling. They are available in lengths from 5cm up to a whopping 20cm and beyond. The later are suited to targeting Murray Cod. Spinner baits can also be trolled but are better suited to casting. Tip Keep your lures as close to the bottom at all times. Lures that are floundering mid water will go un-noticed and you fishless!!\nBelow: When fish like this hit trolled lures, you really know about it!\nSurface lures are for those who want real excitement from their fishing. It must be said up front that the hook up rates are very poor but it's the \"Boof\" you're fishing for. One major advantage of fishing surface lures, is that they can be fished over the top of submerged structure and draw strikes where other lures would become snagged. At night they come into their own. Shallow water should never be ignored as plenty of good sized fish have come from water that is ignored by day. These lures are simple to use and can be used to cover all types of water. Get more info on our timber surface lures.\nBelow: Meter fish off the surface...It doesn't get better!!\nBelow: Even smaller fish can be extremely aggressive when taken off the surface!\nWarning! Surface fishing for Murray Cod can be extremely frustrating!\nTip Don't be in a hurry to start your retrieve, let your lure sit for a few seconds. Strikes will often happen on \"splash down\".\nBelow: A great example of a \"Splash Down\" strike.\nSpinner Baits are best used for casting rivers or impoundments. As they are a sinking lure they can be fished in any depth of water with ease. Casts made to large logs in a river situation will soon reveal if a fish is on the \"chew\". Murray Cod will often hit these lures before you have a chance to wind the reel into gear so be prepared.\nBlade configurations vary from single Colorado, one round blade, to four bladed models that really send out plenty of vibration for the fish to home in on. My favorite combination is the twin Colorado with over sized blades. They are easy to work but most importantly allow you to keep in touch with the lure. Twin willow blades do not push nearly as much water by comparison. Tip To avoid snagging, keep your spinner bait off the bottom and always stay in touch with the lure. Braided line is best for this type of work.\nBelow: This fish was taken on the cast and at around the 100lb mark, is the wholly grail for all MC anglers.\nSoft Plastics are not widely used on their own when chasing Murray Cod, however, they are used in conjunction with spinner baits to add \"Bulk\" to the lure. When a stinger hook is added to a spinner bait, it allows the soft plastic to be rigged in a way that it adds to the overall appearance and can entice more strikes if the fish are not fully co operating on the day.\nLipless Crank Baits burst onto the scene several years ago and gave lure casters an extra and potent weapon in their kit. Their first main targets were Bass, in the impoundments along the East coast of Australia.\nLike the spinner bait revolution, these lures allow the angler to fish any depth with ease as they are a sinking bait.\nIn dams, weed beds that line the shores and others that are found throughout the dam, can be fished through the water column until an active fish is located. In a river situation, heavy cover like logs, rocks and ledges can be fished vertically and present to active fish, an easy meal. Some crank baits have rattles and others are silent. Special attention needs to be made to hooks when targeting Murray Cod using lipless baits. Standard hooks should always be upgraded."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:869471c0-d6d7-4b0b-aa76-a3e1c0f6672a>","<urn:uuid:e7161b53-6404-4c6c-bc90-a40ca3d6a324>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Analyze in detail how equipment storage/transport methods compare between modern horse show participants and Civil War cavalry - focus on bags & containers pls?","answer":"Modern horse show participants use tack trunks and show boxes to store and transport their equipment, with specific items organized for both home storage and away shows. Their storage focuses on separating schooling gear from show equipment, including separate compartments for items like crops, spurs, gloves, and horse care items. In contrast, Civil War cavalry used a more compact and military-specific system. They relied primarily on blackened leather saddlebags with smaller compartments, which had to contain essential items like body brushes and hoof picks. They also used haversacks (tarred US issue bags) slung over the shoulder or saddle, and would store additional items in their shelter halves and tents. The modern system emphasizes convenience and organization for competition purposes, while the military system prioritized mobility and essential battlefield functionality.","context":["Ever just stood in front of an empty tack trunk, not quite sure where to start?

{"question":"How do traditional farming methods in developing countries compare to modern Western agricultural practices in terms of crop diversity and genetic preservation?","answer":"Traditional farming in developing countries maintains significantly higher crop diversity compared to Western agricultural practices. For instance, while English supermarkets may offer 4-5 potato varieties, Andean farmers grow up to 70 varieties in some areas. Traditional methods involve farmers cultivating multiple crops fine-tuned to specific climates and soil conditions over 14,000 years of experimentation, with ongoing development through crossing wild varieties with domesticated crops. In contrast, Western farming technology has moved innovation from the farm to the laboratory, promoting uniform varieties dependent on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This modern approach, while producing high yields, has led to the erosion of genetic diversity and threatens the biological resources needed for future crop evolution. Traditional farming systems contribute to food plant biodiversity, of which Europe has lost 80% in the last century. Unlike modern hybrid varieties, traditional open-pollinated varieties are naturally pollinated, adaptable to climate change, and can be used to develop local varieties while maintaining genetic diversity.","context":["Growing Diversity: Genetic Resources and Local Food Security edited\nby David Cooper, Renee Vellve and Henk Hobbelink, Intermediate Technology,\npp 192, ¬£19.95 hbk, ¬£9.95pbk\nAlthough biodiversity was once the preserve of the cognoscenti, everyone\nhas been chattering about it since the Earth Summit at Rio. But practical,\nsound advice on how to help to save species is still needed. For example,\nwhile the bureaucrats struggle to reduce food mountains produced by Western\nfarming systems, little concern is expressed for the erosion of the genetic\nresource base of our food plants. Now the introduction of high-yielding\ncrops and Western agricultural practices threatens varieties of plants bred\nfor thousands of years by farmers in the developing world. The excellent\ncontributions to Growing Diversity suggest some obvious solutions to avert\nthis folly, and try to put the record straight on behalf of the small farmer.\nWe are reminded, for example, that it took early European farmers about\n4000 years to catch on to the first agricultural revolution. And it was\nthe Muslim farmers to the east, with their multiple cropping systems and\ncopious varieties of crops, who later taught their Western cousins how to\nquadruple harvests. The current Western contribution to agriculture, the\ntechnological revolution, has led to bountiful harvests, but at the expense\nof variety and the biological resources on which the further evolution of\nour food plants depends.\nDiversity is still the key to traditional agriculture in the developing\nworld. While you may now buy four or five kinds of potato in an English\nsupermarket, this would not impress Andean farmers who grow up to 70 varieties\nin some areas. A diversity of crops brings variety to the taste and texture\nof foods, but for the farmer in the developing world, this diversity is\na matter of survival.\nCrops are cultivated for their resistance to pests or drought, for example,\nor for the time they take to mature, and their capacity to store well. After\n14 000 years of experimentation and innovation, farmers typically cultivate\na wealth of species fine-tuned to specific climates or soil conditions.\nAnd research and development on the farm continues: wild or weedy varieties\nare crossed with domesticated crops in a never-ending quest to improve.\nBut now, Western farming technology is removing innovation from the\nfarm, and placing it firmly in the laboratory. The uniform variety from\nthe research centre, with its dependence on chemical fertilisers and pesticides,\nis displacing the farm-bred varieties. Once these traditional varieties\ndisappear, the knowledge of their cultivation and use is also lost. And\nwhile there is increasing recognition in the West of the danger of reducing\nthe genetic resource base on which our survival depends, institutions have\ntraditionally applied the ‚Äòmuseum‚Äô approach to conservation. Valued ecosystems\nare fenced off, plants are kept in botanical gardens and germ plasm is stored\nin seed banks.\nAs the editors point out in the introduction, gene banks only preserve,\nthey do not conserve. Gene banks are plant mausoleums, isolated from the\nreal world. It is only rarely that plant breeders use material from these\ncollections. In any case, there is no point in preserving a variety unless\nyou also preserve the farming system that produced it, with its particular\nclimate and soils, and the farmer‚Äôs accumulated knowledge of its cultivation\nThere are other problems with gene banks. Agricultural relevance is\nnot necessarily a major factor in the decision as to which varieties are\npreserved. The varieties which are easy to collect (not too far from a road,\nand not in a war zone) and which can withstand the conditions of preservation\nare most likely to be selected. Even language plays its part. Farmers‚Äô selections\nare denigrated as ‚Äòland races‚Äô, while laboratory bred elites are labelled\n‚Äòhigh-yield varieties‚Äô. It is also expensive to preserve germ plasm in a\nBut Growing Diversity is no Luddite tract nor a plea to return to some\nromantic notion of rural ways. Rather, the call is to integrate the best\nfeatures of both systems: the formal skills of the plant breeder, and the\ninformal knowledge and expertise of the local farmers.\nSuch an arrangement, with the final tests carried out on the farm, would\nproduce a continuous process for tailoring heterogeneous varieties to the\nconditions of specific locality (and allow quick adaptation to changing\nclimates). It would focus on local priorities, ensuring the development,\nuse and, thereby, the conservation of locally important plants. Furthermore,\nthe genetic resource base would be safely, and relatively cheaply, conserved\non millions of farms throughout the world.\nGrowing Diversity also publicises the role of small farmers in the development\nof our crops, and the maintenance of a secure food supply in a changing\nworld. The authoritative contributors write from conviction rooted in experience,\nand provide insights that should provide a basis for action. For anyone\nwith an interest in the conservation business, it is one of those rare books\nthat is essential reading.\nPeter de Groot works for the science council of the Commonwealth Secretariat,\nLondon. He writes in a personal capacity.","Note: All heirlooms, amateur and conservation varieties are open pollinated\nThe following text is meant as a guide to help achieve a successful outcome for saving seeds. This subject is big because many plant species have their own particular requirements concerning seed saving and many books have been written extensively on the subject. For more in-depth technical information please see bottom of page for list of literature.\nSetting the scene\nOpen pollinated varieties:\n- are naturally pollinated ‚Äì by insects or wind; no enforced pollination or in-breeding.\n- contribute to food plant biodiversity (of which we have lost 80% in Europe this last Century)\n- are adaptable ‚Äì they are genetically variable and therefore able to adapt to climate change, to particular landscapes and environmental conditions and evolve along with them.\n- can be seed-saved by farmers, market gardeners, home gardeners and allotment holders.\n- seed saved will breed true-to-type plants, resembling parent plants ‚Äì unlike hybrids.\n- can be used to develop local varieties.\n- are of course non-GM, non-hybrid and non-patented.\nPlant species and plant varieties\nThe word species concerns the whole range of for example carrots,onion and tomatoes. But within the carrot,onion and tomato species we find numerous carrot, cabbage and tomato varieties. These we may know by name and can buy from seed companies and garden centres.\nThe seed: the seed hides everything about itself as a plant until it is released into its entire form. Know where your seed has come from, whether it came from a friend or from a seed catalogue or seed swap and seek to know its name. This will give you some idea and hopefully assurance of what to expect from it.\nAs a principle nature relies on diversity to maintain herself and her survival possibilities and plants readily cross pollinate where they can. Even self-pollinated types are not 100% self-pollinating 100% of the time which leads to the occasional mixing of characteristics which can be a bonus or not as case may be.\nAs people we have the tendency to do just the opposite, to create uniformity and homogenise for the sake of convenience and simplicity. This is seen so clearly in the case of breeding F1 hybrid varieties. F1 hybrid breeding is all about homogenisation and uniformity, a procedure which discards diversity in the process. Therefore to bring back genetic diversity we must strive to find the balance which on the one hand maintains genetic diversity and on the other distinguishes variety, upholding productivity. All of which was done before the hybrid era. Working with open pollinated varieties achieves this wonderfully and gives us the flexibility needed.\nYour choice of seed crop, 1: Allotment or home gardeners.\nThere are several factors to consider when saving for seed. For small areas like allotments and home gardens self-pollinated species are easiest to manage since they don‚Äôt require many plants for saving seeds and also they don‚Äôt readily cross pollinate. However make sure you know whether your species does require protection from another same species growing close by. See seed saving below for individual species requirements.\nHaving said that it may be possible to obtain enough good plants from cross pollinated species in an allotment or home garden situation to select out the best specimens and keep for seed.\nYour choice of seed crop, 2: Professional vegetable growers.\nThe professional grower is usually in a good situation as high numbers of plants are easily achieved whether these are self-pollinated or cross pollinated species. Here up to several hundred plants can be selected for seed without difficulties.\nCross pollination from neighbouring farms or gardens is something to be aware off. Especially with wind pollinated species like maize / sweet corn and the beet family but also insect pollinated crops of the brassica family and other species. See specific crops on seed saving below.\nPure Line variety. All varieties which we can buy from seed catalogues or garden centres have been bred to be distinctly different from other varieties. These are called pure line varieties and for identification reasons have been given names, which help us all to know our varieties. It is important to keep maintaining our open pollinated pure line varieties so we can continue to enjoy and appreciate the characteristics associated with them.\nCrop familiarity: It is best if you are familiar with the variety or type of vegetable, cereal or other crop which you want to grow for seed. For example, carrots are identified according to types such as Nantes, which are early sowing and early maturing. Chantenays, which are later sown but are early main crops. Berlicums and Autumn king types which are also later sowing types and recognised as main storage crops. Your lettuces for example are categorised as butterheads, crisp heads, cos types, loose leaf types and batavias. Each one representing their particular characteristics and values. These are all important to be aware of.\nYou need to be able to distinguish your type by its size, shape, skin colour and texture, flavour if possible, foliage attachment, colour, how many weeks and months to maturity and note these down for yourself. These are observations which make a good gardener / grower in any case.\nVegetable plant propagation\nWhen setting out to save seeds its crucial to know how your species propagates.\nOur vegetables reproduce either through cross pollination (cp), self-pollination (sp) or a combination of both (cp/sp). Most species are insect pollinated with a few being wind pollinated like sweet corn, spinach, beet root, chards and sugar beet.\nCross pollinated plants require usually a minimum of 25 ‚Äì30 plants to maintain genetic diversity within cultivars. A population of 25-30 plants carry many characteristics that make up a cultivar so the more plants the better to ensure proper vigour and upholding of characteristics.\nWith self-pollinated plants it is different, here just a few will do but as each plant may genetically be a little different it is recommended to save several plants to get a mix of seeds.\nMost plants are perfect flower plants or hermaphrodites with both pollen producing stamens and with stigmas to carry the pollen to its seed bud within the flower where the fruiting part / seed will develop.\nSome plants are dioecious like sweet corn, courgettes and pumpkins which mean they have separate male and female flowers on their plants. And monoecious plants like true spinach and asparagus for example are either male plants producing only pollen or female plants, producing only the fruiting / edible part. This is important to know when growing plants for their seeds.\nThis is in fact breeding or maintenance breeding, keeping your variety by saving its seeds.\nThere are several factors effecting plant growth. Environmental factors like warmth, light, water, soil types and soil fertility all affect the plant in its phenotype, the phenomena shaping the plant. Then genetic factors determine the plant‚Äôs ability to reproduce itself according to its own make up and its interaction with the environment. Plant health, vigour, plant size and tolerance of diseases under adverse circumstances depend also on its genetic makeup and capability. The environment and genetic makeup of a plant has an interactive relationship.\nOnce you have chosen your crop for seed, mark out the best specimens at point of harvest. Keep the most vigorous and healthy looking plants for seed. Make sure you keep your variety true to type by selecting plants that display similar traits to one another. Keep a notebook or seed diary for information, dates and observations relating to the crop to save seed from. It will come in useful.\nSeeds keep best when their humidity / moisture level is low. A general rule is if the sum of relative humidity + farenheit is below 100. For example 60 farenheit and 37 % humidity then the seeds are stored well.\nTraits to bear in mind when selecting your seeds for saving\nPlants size, shape, skin smoothness, inner colour, outer and inner texture, flavour, scent of edible root, scent of leaf, fruit and seed parts. Shape, size and colour of plants leaf system, leaf gestures whether upright, fanning out, horizontal, open, closed, compact, rigid, semi rigid or flexible is also important. Further are disease tolerance, soil moisture tolerance, air and soil temperature tolerance, soil type and soil fertility utilisation ability, daylight altitude and latitude tolerance. Within all of those lie numerous variations besides.\nSeed saving literature: Recommended.\nThe Organic seed grower: A farmers Guide to Vegetable Seed Production.\nJohn Navazio.

{"question":"I am studying medieval literature tradition. What is interesting difference between scops in Beowulf and Dante's writing style for telling stories? Both seem important for their cultures.","answer":"The scops in Beowulf were Anglo-Saxon composers and storytellers (similar to minstrels or bards) who preserved and performed folk epics orally, as Beowulf was initially told out loud with an unknown author. In contrast, Dante took a more deliberate and innovative literary approach, consciously creating a new poetic form called terza rima specifically for the Divine Comedy. While scops worked within traditional Germanic storytelling conventions, maintaining warrior codes and cultural values through oral performance, Dante wrote as an individual author, deliberately choosing to write in his Tuscan vernacular rather than Latin, and crafting a personal vision inspired by his love for Beatrice.","context":["The Divine Comedy, finished by Dante Alighieri in 1320, is one of the most famous literary works of all time, and its author is considered the father of the Italian language. In the Inferno, it is well known, Dante singled out corrupt leaders and political enemies, but the poem as a whole was actually inspired by unrequited love.\nAs a young man, Dante tried to woo a beautiful and devout Florentine girl of his own age. Since childhood they had exchanged in passing the one word their families would allow‚ÄîSalute! (Health!). Then one day, the young woman, Beatrice, in reaction to rumors of the poet‚Äôs increasingly worldly ways, refrained from the greeting, causing anguish in the young Dante. Shortly thereafter, Beatrice died. Dante was transformed by his grief and vowed to write in Beatrice‚Äôs honor a poem unlike any ever written. Thus began Dante‚Äôs famed journey, one that would take him through the depths of hell. As a one-time admirer of the troubadour poets, Dante was well versed, pardon the pun, in the intricate forms then in practice, such as the sestina, but his paean to Beatrice called for something new and even more demanding, a flexible and muscular form he invented precisely for the new undertaking, the terza rima. Dante wrote his masterpiece on the move, banned from Florence by political enemies. In exile, he paid homage to his true love, Beatrice, and by choosing to write in his Tuscan vernacular instead of Latin, transformed the Italian language.\nHaving been a bookseller for more than a decade, I know that one of the most frequently asked questions from readers is, Which translation should I read of Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy? It can be overwhelming to see so many versions all lined up, spine to spine, along a shelf in a literary bookstore, or to scroll through pages and pages of different editions online. Talking about a translator‚Äôs approach and methodology can help answer the question.\nLet‚Äôs start a comparison of translations with the first three lines of Canto I of the Inferno (there‚Äôs no hiding for the poor translator, with the original Italian usually on the facing page). It may be grossly unfair, I admit, to try to judge merely on the first canto or even the first or second stanza, but decisions made in the first few stanzas determine the shape of the rest of the work. Here‚Äôs Dante‚Äôs original:\nNel mezzo del cammin de nostra vita,\nmi ritrovai per una selva oscura\nch√© la diritta via era smaritta.\nEven without an Italian dictionary at hand, most of the words in these lines can be puzzled out by English speakers, except, perhaps ‚Äúsmaritta,‚Äù which means something along the lines of ‚Äúobliterated‚Äù or just ‚Äúlost from view.‚Äù An amateur literal translation can go a long way but doesn‚Äôt sing.\nIn comparing translations, you notice quickly if there‚Äôs an attempt to duplicate Dante‚Äôs terza rima, in which the first and third lines rhyme, and the second line rhymes with the first line of the following stanza. That interlocking pattern continues throughout the cantos and is one of the work‚Äôs most distinctive aspects. Dorothy Sayers rendered the first stanza this way:\nMidway this way of life we‚Äôre bound upon\nI woke to find myself in a dark wood,\nWhere the right road was wholly lost and gone.\n(And ‚Äúwood‚Äù is rhymed with ‚Äúrude‚Äù at the end of the first line of the next stanza, so we know Sayers is attempting to replicate Dante‚Äôs rhyme pattern of aba, bcb, cdc, et cetera.)\nAllen Mandelbaum‚Äôs translation goes like this:\nWhen I had journeyed half of our life‚Äôs way,\nI found myself within a shadowed forest,\nfor I had lost the path that does not stray.\nMandelbaum is writing in blank verse (although here the first and third lines rhyme, that is not indicative of the whole), so you‚Äôre faced with a choice: Do you trust the efforts, strained at times, of the translator who remains loyal to the form, or opt for a more natural-sounding version?\nIn comparing these two translations, the Sayers version seems to win out in two ways‚Äîit matches Dante in form and, to a degree, in content. By starting with ‚ÄúMidway this way of life we‚Äôre bound upon,‚Äù she remains faithful to the starting point, ‚Äúnel mezzo,‚Äù while Mandelbaum pushes this to the middle of the first line. Sayers adds ‚Äúbound upon‚Äù (not, strictly speaking, in the original), which allows her to make the rhyme in the third line with ‚Äúgone.‚Äù But Mandelbaum is more faithful to the directness of the original, not stretching the meaning or introducing words to make the rhyme. His metered language often seems more natural than Sayers‚Äô and more in keeping with the diction of Dante, which favored solid vocabulary and straight-forward syntax. Mandelbaum, will, in fact, interject rhyme if it‚Äôs not forced (as he does with way and stray). In spite of first impressions favoring Sayers, most readers who choose to make the entire journey from inferno to purgatory and finally paradise ultimately find the Mandelbaum translation more satisfying.\nMichael Palma‚Äôs 2003 translation of Inferno begins this way:\nMidway through the journey of our life, I found\nmyself in a dark wood, for I had strayed\nfrom the straight pathway to this tangled ground.\nHis translation keeps the ‚Äúnel mezzo‚Äù element up front and duplicates the terza rima, continuing the next stanza with, ‚ÄúHow hard it is to tell of, overlaid . . .‚Äù.\nThis nineteenth-century blank-verse version by Longfellow sounds surprisingly modern:\nMidway upon the journey of our life\nI found myself within a forest dark,\nFor the straightforward pathway had been lost.\nHe remains faithful to the wording, but for reasons of meter he delves into unnatural word order, inverting what Palma has as ‚Äúdark wood‚Äù to become ‚Äúforest dark.‚Äù Palma or Longfellow? A tough call. Again, it might come down to your trust in a translator‚Äôs skill in keeping up the rhyme pattern.\nClive James‚Äôs 2013 Comedy uses quatrains and augmented quatrains as its building blocks, while Mary Jo Bang‚Äôs 2012 translation of the Inferno in colloquial American English, carries elements of her own style, and is unrhymed. Both versions are vibrant and deal adroitly with some enigmatic aspects of the original text.\nMy preference for a rhyming attempt wins out over Mary Jo Bang‚Äôs exuberant rendering, but only by a smidgen. Here are Clive James‚Äôs first lines:\nAt the mid-point of the path through life, I found\nMyself lost in a wood so dark, the way\nAhead was blotted out.\nThese lines have the virtue of being faithful to the original content, and then the next line continues with a rhyme (‚ÄúThe keening sound . . .‚Äù) that keeps the pattern going forward, naturally to the ear.\nMary Jo Bang starts out this way:\nStopped mid-motion in the middle\nOf what we call our life, I looked up and saw no sky‚Äî\nOnly a dense cage of leaf, tree, and twig. I was lost.\nHer creative leap is to begin with the word ‚Äústopped‚Äù and end the third line with ‚ÄúI was lost,‚Äù emphasizing the predicament in the original and elaborating the image of the dark wood. Her methodology comes from picking up a book of poems by Caroline Bergvall and reading ‚ÄúVia (48 Dante Variations),‚Äù a ‚Äúfound poem,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúcomposed entirely of the first three lines of the Inferno culled from forty-seven translations archived in the British Library as of May 2000). . . . I wondered how else one could say ‚ÄòMidway through our life, I found myself in a dark wood; the right way was lost.‚Äô‚Äù\nBoth James and Bang are poets. James writes in the introduction to his Comedy, ‚ÄúI wanted the rhyming words close enough together to be noticed.‚Äù His devotion to language leads him in one direction, aiming even to end each book of the Comedy with a couplet whose final word is ‚Äústars,‚Äù as Dante did. ‚ÄúBut in English,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúthe word ‚Äòstars‚Äô has very few words with which to rhyme. Rather than write a strained couplet to close each book, I wrote a final line in which the stars indeed show up, but not as the last word.‚Äù Bang is led in another direction, hewing to a definition of translation by Walter Benjamin: ‚ÄúA translation, instead of resembling the meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the original‚Äôs mode of signification, thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language.‚Äù\nTranslator Robert Wechsler observed that ‚Äúthe foreign writer‚Äôs work looks like gibberish, or would if we ever saw it. Just like a musical score to someone who can‚Äôt read music. But the musician‚Äôs performance doesn‚Äôt look anything like a score; the two couldn‚Äôt be any more different. The translation is so similar, the result is a palimpsest, two works, one on top of the other, an original and a performance, difficult to tell apart.‚Äù Seeing translation in this light, may help decide which Dante to read. It may also soften the oft repeated and harsh judgment traduttore, traditore or ‚Äútranslator, traitor.‚Äù","Presentation on theme: \"Beowulf: The Beginnings of English Literature.

{"question":"How does international law regulate military intervention for humanitarian reasons?","answer":"Under international law, military intervention is strictly regulated by the UN Charter, which demands that states refrain from using force against other states' territorial integrity or political independence. Military force is only legally permitted in two circumstances: when authorized by the Security Council, or in cases of self-defense. Notably, humanitarian grounds alone do not provide legal justification for military intervention. Even if a state commits humanitarian violations, other nations cannot legally intervene without Security Council authorization.","context":["As a legal matter, the Syrian government‚Äôs use of chemical weapons does not automatically justify armed intervention by the United States‚Ä¶ Syria is a party to neither the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 nor the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993‚Ä¶ Syria is a party to the Geneva Protocol, a 1925 treaty that bans the use of toxic gases in wars. But this treaty was designed after World War I with international war in mind, not internal conflicts.\n[And] the conventions also don‚Äôt mean much unless the Security Council agrees to act. The United Nations Charter‚Ä¶ demands that states refrain ‚Äúfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.‚Äù The use of force is permitted when authorized by the Security Council or for self-defense ‚Äî but not purely on humanitarian grounds.\nOf course ethics, not only laws, should guide policy decisions‚Ä¶ if the White House takes international law seriously ‚Äî as the State Department does ‚Äî it cannot try to have it both ways. It must either argue that an ‚Äúillegal but legitimate‚Äù intervention is better than doing nothing, or assert that international law has changed ‚Äî strategies that I call ‚Äúconstructive noncompliance.‚Äù In the case of Syria, I vote for the latter.\nHurd is right about a great many things: that Syria‚Äôs obligations under treaty law are weaker than people want to think; that there are legal tensions here that the US cannot and shouldn‚Äôt try to wish away; and that a decision must be made between doing something and doing something lawfully; and that the robustness of international norms around both R2P and chemical weapons are at stake in how the US and UK frame the discussion.\nBut I think Hurd is both under-stating the case about Syria‚Äôs international legal obligations, and over-stating the case about US options in framing a potential military intervention. International law indeed is ‚Äúchanging‚Äù ‚Äì but the relevant changes he describes apply to Syria‚Äôs responsibility to its civilians, not to the US‚Äô right to reinterpret the UN Charter. And ultimately, as he points out, even Syria‚Äôs violations of law don‚Äôt make it lawful for the US to intervene without a Security Council resolution ‚Äì however ethically right such an intervention may be. The two are really separate legal questions so I‚Äôll address them separately below.\nFirst: did Syria‚Äôs use of chemical weapons put it in violation of international law? I should begin by pointing out that Syria is still only suspected of having used these weapons, and the UN investigation into the source of the attack is still ongoing. However, let‚Äôs assume for the sake of argument that the attack came from the Syrian government and not from insurgents aiming to provoke a Western intervention. As a ‚Äúlegal matter,‚Äù Hurd is right to point out that Syria is not technically in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) or the Rome Statute of the ICC (which also codifies the chemical weapons taboo), being a non-signatory to both treaties, as states are only bound by treaty obligations they agree to. Syria is, however, in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions which outlaws arbitrary killing of one‚Äôs citizens in peacetime or of noncombatants ‚Äì even in civil wars. Moreover, despite not being bound by current treaty law on chemical weapons, Syria is arguably in violation of the international customary law prohibiting their use. The CWC is so widely ratified, the prohibition on use so frequently cited in war crimes jurisprudence, the behavior of most states so consistently in compliance that this ‚Äúnorm‚Äù is in fact considered by the International Committee of the Red Cross to have the status of customary law. Indeed, the fact that Syria is bending over backward to deny its use of the weapons strongly suggests that it too considers itself beholden to these rules.\nBut as Hurd secondly points out, none of this really matters to the question of the legality of a US strike against Syria, since military strikes against other states are governed by a completely different set of rules: the UN Charter which in almost ll circustances renders dispute resolution by force unlawful (Article 2). Except in cases of self-defense (Article 51), only the Security Council can legalize the use of armed force (Chapter 7), so I see only three ways at best in which a strike against Syria for internal, humanitarian reasons could be considered ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù First would be the highly unlikely event that both China and Russia could be persuaded to abstain from a veto in the Security Council. Second would be a Uniting for Peace Resolution in the General Assembly ‚Äì also unlikely and arguably a weaker legal position given the non-binding authority of the GA. Third, states subject to significant refugee flows as a result of the crisis could undertake an intervention on the basis of ‚Äúself-defense.‚Äù Note that this argument would be agnostic in terms of chemical weapons per se so it would be a very different kind of intervention; and it implies that Turkey or Jordan would take the lead, not NATO [as an organization or other Western] powers. By contrast, if Western powers led the attack without the Security Council or the General Assembly, it is hard to argue that it would be legal ‚Äì regardless of what Syria has done inside its borders.\nThat said, there are a number of reasons to think an intervention might be considered normatively legitimate in empirical terms, despite its technical illegality. There is the precedent of Kosovo, where NATO failed to seek a UN resolution but where Russia also failed to pass a resolution condemning the air war ‚Äì a sign Nicholas Wheeler has argued demonstrates the existence of a humanitarian intervention norm despite its absence in law. There is the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, affirmed in numerous soft law instruments and in the behavior and rhetoric of the Libya intervention. There is the inter-subjective horror of chemical warfare shared by international society and the sense that this is a crime not just against individual human beings but against all humanity. Whether or not a majority of the global community would react to affirm the use of military strikes even without a Security Council authorization to enforce this taboo is something we can only know in hindsight. However the refusal of the Security Council to condemn NATO‚Äôs illegal air war in Kosovo because it was widely seen as an enforcement of the anti-genocide taboo suggests this could be the case. In each of these cases, however, it would not change the fact that the war itself would be a violation of the UN Charter. It is only an question of whether international normative sentiment would be sufficient to trump international law.\nThat‚Äôs an empirical question. The important policy question is whether it suits US interests to affirm international law, or to trump it on ethical grounds when warranted. I agree with Hurd‚Äôs claim that the US can‚Äôt easily find legal cover for a strike. But of the remaining two options ‚Äì admit this is an ethically appropriate but unlawful strike, or claim the ‚Äúlaw has changed‚Äù ‚Äì I don‚Äôt agree with Hurd that the latter is the right course of action. The law on chemical weapons may have changed to the point that it supercedes the absence of Syrian treaty obligations; but R2P remains an incipient norm, not a law, and remains in tension with codified UN Charter law which binds the US. Trying to pretend otherwise will only undermine US moral authority, and sounds too much like other creative re-interpretations of international law by the US in recent years around torture, extrajudicial execution, and detainee status.\nIf the goal is to affirm international norms, the far better way to frame a potential military strike is in terms of ethics and norms, not law. The US could argue (I‚Äôm not saying I agree) that the chemical weapons norm is so strong and so vital to global security interests that enforcing it justifies the unlawful use of force. I am not saying that this is the right policy ‚Äì in a future post I will analyze more clearly why the US might consider other options for ‚Äúnorm enforcement and affirmation‚Äù before jumping to military strikes if the goal is to enforce the chemical weapons norm rather than to protect civilians per se. But I will say that, as Hurd points out, the US can‚Äôt have its cake and eat it too on this legal question."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f9f1761-292e-432d-99da-07a2c3a37427>"],"error":null}

It‚Äôs probably the most talked about and emotive problem and it‚Äôs certainly the most common search on this website. But after years of talking about shark finning, surely things have moved on. Why is it still an issue after all these years? The truth is, the picture is changing. With partners across the world, we‚Äôve been at the centre of fisheries reform for over 20 years. Thanks to awareness-raising campaigns and governmental conservation commitments, there‚Äôs been significant progress in shark conservation and fisheries management. So, what‚Äôs the current state of affairs? What is shark finning? Shark finning applies to the practice of removing fins at sea and returning the fin-less shark to the water. This is a highly wasteful practice. And it's a major barrier to effective fisheries management. Fins can‚Äôt be easily identified on their own. So, when finning occurs, we lose valuable information on which species have been caught. But it‚Äôs worth noting that not all shark fishing involves finning. Removing fins from the shark and bringing fins and carcass to port is NOT classed as finning, neither is removing fins once ashore. Has it been banned? Finning has been banned by many major fishing nations (including the EU) and by all of the international high seas management bodies (RFMO‚Äôs). It‚Äôs estimated that about 70 individual nations have adopted finning bans and that number continues to grow. Finning bans vary between nations but generally take one of two forms: Full Utilisation ‚Äì this is where fins may be removed at-sea but body and fins must be brought ashore for sale and use. The weights of fins and carcasses should be within an accepted ratio. Under these types of bans, fins can be stored separately from the body before being brought ashore. In some cases they may even be ‚Äúlanded‚Äù in different ports. This can make the bans very difficult to enforce. Fins Naturally Attached ‚Äì this is a stronger measure which requires that fins remain attached to the body until brought to land. These bans have been hard-fought. For example the adoption of the strengthened EU finning ban in 2013 was the culmination of a 6 year campaign by the Trust working as a partner in the Shark Alliance. The campaign gained a huge amount of public support from across Europe. Its success represented a massive step forward for shark conservation. What‚Äôs the problem then? There are 2 main problems; There are loopholes in the full utilization approach. Unscrupulous fishermen can exploit the fin to carcass ratio to continue finning for part of their catch. This not only increases overall catch but also complicates management. Illegal fisheries ignore bans and best practice. Here there are issues of detection and enforcement which undermine all efforts to control finning and manage shark fisheries. This is why we continue to push for universal adoption of Fins Naturally Attached (FNA). It ends all at-sea fin removal, eases enforcement and aids science-based management. Our Stop Shark Finning Campaign targets the universal adoption of FNA. And aims to reduce IUU fisheries and ensure enforcement of shark fisheries control measures. You can find out more about our work on high seas fisheries through the Shark League. Should we ban shark fin? The important thing to bear in mind is that banning finning is not the same as banning fins. For all the reasons above, we're absolutely opposed to finning as a wasteful practice that prevents responsible management of fisheries. But, in theory, it‚Äôs possible to have finning bans enforced, fisheries being appropriately managed and still have shark fins coming to market. Simply banning the sale of fins doesn't stop shark finning nor does it reduce the overall mortality of sharks. What should I do about Shark Fin Soup? We believe that positive change is possible and that we should be able to envisage a future where cultural traditions can sit alongside environmental sustainability. This might seem a long way off but we have to hold it as a long-term goal. In the meantime it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll encounter responsibly sourced shark fin soup and so shark fin should be avoided. If you‚Äôre concerned about a restaurant or retailer selling shark fin or any other shark product, then ask them about their sustainable seafood policy. If they can‚Äôt satisfy you that they're sourcing responsibly then make an alternative choice and politely let the management know about your views. With continued support for sustainable products, retailers and restaurants will seek out supply chains that can satisfy their customers. What are the Shark Trust doing now? We have to keep pushing for sustainably managed fisheries aligned with responsible trade and consumption.

{"question":"How do social factors and delayed medical care both contribute to negative health outcomes - in childhood obesity versus early pregnancy?","answer":"Both conditions are significantly impacted by social factors and delayed care, but in different ways. For childhood obesity, social factors include limited physical activity, excessive screen time (with only 20% of children having vigorous play twice weekly), and poor eating habits like consuming meals while watching TV. In pregnancy, social factors like difficult work schedules and financial considerations often lead to delayed prenatal care. Delayed care in pregnancy can result in higher complications and maternal mortality, while missing early obesity interventions can lead to long-term health issues. Studies show over 25% of first prenatal visits occur after 8 weeks gestation, when organ systems have already developed, similar to how delayed intervention in childhood obesity can lead to established unhealthy patterns.","context":["Childhood Obesity (cont.)\nJohn Mersch, MD, FAAP\nDr. Mersch received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, San Diego, and prior to entering the University Of Southern California School Of Medicine, was a graduate student (attaining PhD candidate status) in Experimental Pathology at USC.

These measurements allow calculation of the body mass index (BMI). It is important to consider the physique of the individual. While having a weight in excess of what would be expected for a certain height is most commonly a documentation of excessive fat tissue, certain individuals may be overmuscled (for example, weight lifters). With the exception of very rare bone diseases, the idea of an individual's excessive weight due to being \"big boned\" is an urban myth.\nWhat are risk factors for childhood obesity?\nThere are several substantial risk factors for the development of pediatric obesity.\n- Genetics: While several genetic syndromes are associated with obese stature (for example, Prader-Willi syndrome), genetics are not responsible for the obesity epidemic currently taking place. There has been no change in the gene pool over the last 30 years. Most recent studies indicate that if one parent is obese the likelihood of having an obese child is three times higher than otherwise. If both parents are obese, the likelihood is 10 times higher.\n- Social: Limited school athletic activities coupled with excessive time-utilizing social networks, TV, and computer games are a prime reason for pediatric obesity. Watching TV while eating a meal as well as the excessive consumption of takeout/fast food are also both risk factors for both pediatric and adult obesity. Recent studies indicate that only 20% of children experience more than two episodes of vigorous play per week, and 25% of these children watched more than four hours of TV per day. This does not include additional time engaging in computer games, texting, or talking on the phone with friends. Having a TV in the bedroom is a strong predictor of pediatric obesity.\n- Cultural: Many societies follow either a healthier food palate (traditional oriental, Mediterranean, etc.) or eat smaller portions of higher-fat-content foods (European). The Americanization of such foods coupled with excessive portions is a prime cause of obesity.\n- Diseases: Thyroid disease, polycystic ovary disease, brain tumors, mental retardation, and other conditions are a small contributor to the risk factors for obesity.\n- Medications: Chronic oral steroids, some classes of antidepressants, and other drugs may also contribute (in a very small way) to pediatric obesity.\n- Psychological: Many individuals overeat in an attempt to deal with emotionally stressful lifestyles. Often the excessive weight further aggravates their emotional turmoil.\nFind out what women really need.","by Dr. Michele Brown OB/GYN\nYou just found out you're pregnant! You rush to call your husband, then your mother, email your Aunt Annie and text your best friend. Excitement, celebration, hugging and kissing! But before the excitement cools, there's still one more person that wants to hear your good news, your OB/GYN!\nDon't Delay Early Prenatal Care!\nThe purpose of prenatal care is to optimize the chances of a healthy baby while ensuring the physical and emotional health of the mother. In order to best accomplish this, it is essential that there is early initiation of the first prenatal visit. Reports from Center for Disease Control have shown that delayed or no entry into prenatal care can result in a higher rate of complications with resultant severe maternal morbidity and or mortality. In addition, for the baby, studies have shown a direct association between early comprehensive prenatal care and increased birth weights.\nWhat are some of the important reasons for having an early prenatal visit?\n- Establish more accurate dating\n- Counsel and educate patients about diet and exercise\n- Obtain a detailed medical history and physical so medical conditions both current and from previous pregnancies can be detected and managed early in the pregnancy\n- Discussions about avoidance of dangerous medications and harmful habits such as smoking, drinking, and the use of drugs\n- Detect early signs and symptoms of miscarriage or possible ectopic pregnancy\nUnfortunately, recent studies have shown a trend that women are delaying the scheduling of their first prenatal appointments.\nObstacles to Early Care and Why We Delay...\nDon't recognize symptoms: Mothers sometimes avoid scheduling early appointments because they don't realize they are pregnancy. Over the counter pregnancy tests are extremely accurate so make sure you know the signs of early pregnancy and then use one. It's very easy to ignore these signs but it‚Äôs very important that you are seen before the fetus begins developing.\nDifficult work schedules: Inform your employer that you're pregnant. Perhaps they can help rearrange your work schedule to find time for your very important prenatal visits.\nFinancial considerations: Ask the physician's billing department if the practice offers terms for newly pregnant families. Make sure you understand your insurance policy and if not, call your carrier and have them go over your options in detail.\nDifficulty in the doctor's office accommodating the new pregnant mother: If the receptionist cannot accommodate an early appointment, make sure the doctor knows you believe you are pregnant. Your doctor may have some slots available for a newly pregnant woman. If you can't get an appointment with the doctor, ask if a physician's assistance, midwife or a nurse practitioner can initiate your prenatal care. Alternatively, some practices now have Group Prenatal Care for low risk patients and multiple people can be seen together for the preliminary visit. This can be fun, a great way to meet other pregnant women and you can obtain the early, very important information and advice you need.\nIt has been found that over one quarter of all first prenatal visits are occurring after 8 weeks gestation when all the organ systems have already developed in the fetus and toxins or certain medical conditions have already taken their toll.\nIf You're Not Yet Convinced\nIn a recent article by Arnold Cohen, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a suggestion was made to have a mini-triage system established for all pregnant patients who called the office for a first prenatal appointment by a competent and skilled health care provider. By asking certain key questions that pertain to dating the pregnancy, and known risk factors such as medical illness, medications, and previous pregnancy complications, it can be decided which patients take precedence and require very early initial prenatal appointments and which patients are more routine and can be delayed. In this way, more time and effort can be expended to improve prenatal care to those who most need it. Too often the questions currently being asked revolve solely around patient insurance issues and hospital coverage.\nThe United States spends 35% of all infant spending on prematurity and also ranks at the bottom of the developed countries in the world on infant mortality. I think it is very reasonable to try and identify high risk pregnancies very early in the game in the hopes of preventing adverse outcomes through education and careful, frequent monitoring by a qualified health professional right at the very beginning of the pregnancy.

{"question":"In what ways can personal identity expression be challenging in international settings, and how can focused meditation techniques support emotional well-being during these experiences?","answer":"Personal identity expression in international settings can be challenging, particularly for LGBTQ individuals, as some locations may be more open than the US while others may be less accepting of sexual orientation or gender identity expression. Students must consider local attitudes, social perceptions, and legal differences regarding LGBTQ identity. To support emotional well-being during these challenges, focused meditation offers significant benefits. It helps individuals build awareness of thought patterns, reduces stress, and decreases symptoms of anxiety and depression - as demonstrated in university students who practiced it for six weeks. The practice is highly adaptable, can be done anywhere quiet, and helps rewire neural networks in the brain. This meditation technique allows practitioners to acknowledge and process thoughts without being defined by them, which is particularly valuable when navigating complex cultural and personal identity situations.","context":["LGBTQ Students and Study Abroad\nStudying abroad is an amazing opportunity that 25% of Webster undergraduate students eagerly anticipate. It is an excellent opportunity to learn about world cultures as well as your own. As a LGBTQ student, there are some additional things you may want to consider before departure. Various countries around the world have different perspectives on the LGBTQ community. In order to maximize your experience abroad, you should research and get to know your host country before departure. The resources below are designed to help you in that process.\nCultural Differences Abroad\nNo matter where you decide to study abroad, you will experience cultural differences. From the different languages you will hear to the different food you will eat, you will be immersed in a new lifestyle, one that you will need to be accustomed.\nIn some study abroad locations, students will find that expression of sexual orientation or gender identity will be more open than in the US or on Webster's campus.\nHowever, in others, Having a gender identity or sexual orientation that conflicts\nwith social expectations may not be as accepted. Openly expressing gender identity\nStudents may want to ask themselves how they would like to express their sexual orientation in their study abroad location\nStudents are recommended to consider these questions:\n- In the study abroad location that I am interested, what are the attitudes towards the LGBTQ community?\n- What may make the coming out process different in the host country compared to the U.S.?\n- What is the social perception of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people in my host country? How are LGBTQ people socially defined? What roles do transgender people play in the host culture?\n- Do the laws of the location differ from those of my home country?\n- What are the social norms and expectations within the LGBTQ community in my study abroad location?\n- What resources are available to those in the LGBTQ community in the international location, such as friendly establishments, newspapers, or on-line resources?\nIt is extremely important that students research both the local laws and culture to make sure that a particular location is the best place for them. Students will need to make sure that they will feel comfortable no matter where they study. Study abroad in itself can be a challenge because of the cultural differences that students will face, so Webster would like for students to become aware of extra difficulties that LGBTQ students may face.\nIt is also important that students do some research on interpersonal communication of their study abroad location. Factors like eye contact, touching, personal space and even smiling may have different significance in other cultures. From culture to culture, terms of ‚Äúappropriate behavior‚Äù and sexual identity are widely interpreted. It is recommended that students do some research on local norms to ensure that they will feel comfortable in their new international home before departing.\nBelow are some links to help LGBTQ students and their families during the study abroad process.\n- How to Apply\n- Financial Aid & Scholarships\n- Study Abroad Advising\n- Diversity Abroad\n- Health Abroad\n- While You Are Abroad\n- When You Return\n- Student Experiences\n- Resource Connections Podcast\n- Study Abroad\n- Resource Connections Podcast","Focused Meditation and Its Benefits for Addiction Recovery\nFocused meditation contributes to our internal arsenal of meditation techniques, that can help us in so many ways during our journey of addiction recovery.\nThe art of meditation has been practised for thousands of years. Today, it serves as a form of alternative healing and its benefits are seemingly endless.\nFocused meditation helps to build more awareness of our thought patterns and come to understand that they do not define us. It can help us relax in moments of chaos.\nThe ability to observe our own thoughts is a major catalyst for increased growth during the recovery process. For instance, building ‚Äòfocused awareness‚Äô can help us acknowledge the kinds of thoughts we have that trigger cravings.\nBy discovering what our thought patterns and internal monologues are, we can even step outside of ourselves and learn how to stop reacting to internal and external triggers. This is just one of the many benefits focused meditation offers when practised consistently.\nWhat Is Focused Meditation?\nFocused meditation is a type of meditation in which you place your focus on one particular sensory stimuli. Whether that be an object, sensation, or sound.\nTraditionally, when we think of what it means to meditate, we think of clearing our minds. With focused meditation, there is less focus on clearing the mind, and more focus on, well, focusing !\nThis form of meditation is great for beginners because it isn‚Äôt guided and doesn‚Äôt require facilitation. It also serves as a perfect introduction into meditation as it helps to slow down the mind with the assistance of a focal point, rather than having nothing to anchor on to.\nYou can practise this form of meditation at home, at work, at the park, and truly anywhere that isn‚Äôt overly crowded or noisy. It will be much easier to practise focused meditation in a place that is quiet and still.\nThis particular meditation can be practised for as long as you can maintain, or for as little as a few minutes. It is truly a highly adaptable form of meditation.\nThe Benefits of Focused Meditation\nThere are many benefits of this type of mindful meditation for the brain and the body. Research shows that focused meditation helps to reduce stress. One study even indicated that practising focused meditation was able to help relieve pain in patients experiencing chronic lower back pain\nAnother study showed that university students who practised focused meditation for six weeks experienced a decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression. A follow-up conducted 6 months after the conclusion of the study revealed that the students who continued to practise the meditation continued to experience a decrease in symptoms.\nAfter 12 months, students still engaging in the practice were observed to have a continued reduction in their symptoms of anxiety and depression. The study concluded that focused meditation is a formidable psychosocial tool that can benefit university students greatly\nFocused meditation does wonders for the brain, and has the ability to rewire neural networks. Over time, it also actually causes areas of the brain to thicken, including the mid-prefrontal cortex and the mid-insular part of the brain. This can be invaluable for us as we work to heal our brains from the long-term effects of substance abuse and prolonged exposure to stress .\nThe benefits of focused meditation:\n- Great for beginners\n- Can be practised without an instructor\n- Can be practised anywhere\n- Rewires neural networks in the brain\n- Increased concentration levels\n- Helps increase patience\n- Fosters mindfulness\n- Reduces stress\n- Relieves pain\n- Decreases symptoms of anxiety\n- Decreases symptoms of depression\nStep-By-Step Focused Meditation for Beginners\nAre you ready to give focused meditation a try? Below is a step-by-step outline to help get you started.\nBefore the Meditation\nIn order to prepare for a focused meditation, be sure that you are in a calm environment, as it will be more difficult to practise focused meditation in loud or over-stimulating surroundings.\nRemove any distractions, such as the sound of the television, and switch your phone to silent. Wear comfortable clothing to encourage relaxation.\nDuring the Meditation\n1. Select a focus object.\nMany practitioners suggest starting with your breath as your initial focus object. If you would like to focus on something external, you can select a candle flame or a sound bowl. You can choose anything that engages your senses.\n2. Sit or lay in a comfortable position.\nIf you choose to sit for your meditation, you can sit on the floor or on the edge of a chair. Keep your back straight to maintain posture. Rest your hands wherever they naturally fall and feel comfortable. If you prefer to lay down, you can do this as well. Just be sure that you don't try this when you are feeling extra tired, or you may run the risk of falling asleep mid-meditation!\n3. Relax your body.\nOnce you find yourself in a comfortable position either sitting or laying down, close your eyes. Do a brief body scan to relax the muscles in your body. Start from the top of your body and work your way down, observing each body part, such as your arms and fingers, and releasing any tension you may feel. Drop your shoulders if they are raised and drop your tongue from the roof of your mouth. Do this for your entire body.\n4. Begin to focus.\nNow, we begin the focused aspect of the meditation. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve decided to use your breath as your focus object. During the experience, you are observing your breath, how it feels when the air flows in through your nose, and how it feels when the air flows out of your nose. You can observe that your stomach rises and falls with each breath, that your chest rises and falls in the same fashion. It is important to not think about your breathing, but to simply be present and observe it.\n5. Let your thoughts pass.\nWhilst focusing on your breathing, you‚Äôll undeniably begin to think about what you should eat for dinner tonight. Or maybe you‚Äôll think about work, and an upcoming deadline that you have. This is completely normal! It isn‚Äôt easy to still the mind, even if there is a focus object involved. Thoughts will flow into your mind, and the important thing to do here is to acknowledge that that have happened. Acknowledging that you are experiencing a thought is a massive step, as it indicates that you‚Äôre practising mindfulness. Once you‚Äôve observed the thought, let it go. You can place the thought on a cloud and watch it float away, and then continue to focus on your breathing. It is important to not feel resistance to thoughts coming in and out of your mind, but rather to acknowledge them, accept them, let them go, and continue focusing.\nAfter the Meditation\nGently move your upper body, and then gently move your lower body. Gradually transition from an inward focus to an outward focus. Mindfully pay attention to how you feel after the meditation. Do you feel calmer? More relaxed?\nWhile in this state, take time to reflect on what the experience of focused meditation was like.\nWas it difficult to maintain focus? Was it easier than you imagined? What kinds of thoughts were coming in?\nWhether you practised for 3 minutes, 10 minutes, or 30 minutes, you should commend yourself for doing it. The mind is like a muscle, and it will become easier to focus for longer intervals of time as you practise more.\nAdditional Tips for Practising Focused Meditation\n- Begin with short sessions. Instead of diving in headfirst and trying to practise focused meditation for 30 minutes on the first go, try to practise it for 5 minutes instead. It is important to start with shorter sessions so as to not overwhelm yourself. Small steps are key when developing a long-term, enjoyable and sustainable meditation practice.\n- Find a time of day that works best for you. Some people choose to practise meditation first thing in the morning before work or school. This helps set them up for the day with a clear and grounded mind. Others choose to practise at night in order to wind down and relax after a busy day. You can even have a pop-up, 5-minute focused meditation session in the middle of a hectic work day to re-center and slow down internally. This is one of the many positive benefits of focused meditation - it is completely flexible based upon you and your needs!\n- Be gracious with yourself. Developing the meditation muscle takes time and practise. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for having those thoughts coming in and out (just keep putting them on clouds!), and don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you‚Äôre having trouble focusing. The whole point is to use this form of meditation to develop that ability, among so many other things as we‚Äôve discussed. Start with short sessions and a schedule that is feasible for you, feels realistic to maintain, and doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming. Always give yourself loving words of positive encouragement after a session, even if you feel you couldn‚Äôt keep focus for more than a few seconds. It truly does get easier! You will be able to practise focused meditation for longer intervals and longer periods of time as long as you keep practising.\nSources for Accessing This Meditation Practise\nOur Recoverlution Wellness hub is dedicated to increasing your wellbeing and offers many methods of mindfulness, breath work and meditation for you to use.\nRemember, the beauty of focused meditation is that you can practise anywhere at any time, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be guided.

{"question":"What are the key details of the new endoscopy unit being built at York Hospital?","answer":"The new endoscopy unit is a ¬£10 million project that will be one of the most modern and largest endoscopy units in England. The project is expected to take approximately one year to complete and will increase capacity from three treatment rooms to seven. The unit will be constructed as an additional storey above the hospital's existing physiotherapy department and will be connected to the hospital at First Floor level. This expansion reflects the growing national need for endoscopic investigations.","context":["Increasing the load-bearing capacity of concrete slabs for York Hospital\nWork to build a brand-new endoscopy unit at York Hospital is now underway, and when complete will be one of the most modern and largest endoscopy units in England. It is a ¬£10 million project that is expected to take around a year to complete and will increase capacity from three treatment rooms to seven, reflecting the growing need for endoscopic investigations nationally.\nThe brick-built York Hospital was constructed in the early 1960s, although many parts have been significantly refurbished since this time. However, the site of the new endoscopy unit will be an additional storey built above the hospital‚Äôs existing physiotherapy department, which will be connected into the hospital at First Floor level. This existing building was constructed upon concrete pad foundations and engineering surveys conducted on site found that these existing foundations would not be sufficient to bear the weight of the extra building storey and would therefore require their load-bearing capacity increasing considerably.\nWith York Hospital a teaching hospital and providing a comprehensive range of acute hospital and specialist healthcare services for approximately 800,000 people, any solution had to be non-disruptive, with little or no impact on day-to-day operations. It had also to be fast and extremely cost-effective.\nKier Construction was contracted to build the new endoscopy unit, with Curtins Engineering the consulting engineers for the project.\nThere were very few alternative options available to increase the load bearing capacity of the concrete slab that could meet all the criteria; being fast and effective but above all be minimally disruptive on the day-to-day workings of the busy hospital. One option would be the complete demolition of the existing structure and re-build; however the timescales and costs would increase significantly.\nFor projects such as this, Geobear was the ideal solution to solve the problem presented ‚Äì that of increasing the load-bearing capacity of the concrete slab foundation to bear the additional weight of the extra building story, whilst also dealing with all the challenges presented of working in and around a busy and live hospital.\nThe solution offered by Geobear was extremely quick and effective for the type of project, but more importantly had little or no impact on the normal operations of the hospital. It was also an extremely economical proposition.\nOur methods are ideally suited to any work site with limited access and where operations need to be maintained. The process we used involved the injection of our Geopolymer material directly beneath the foundation pads.\nWith our mobile unit adjacent to the hospital building, we could pump material through hoses to the injection points at 40 pads throughout the building. Our highly expansive, yet dense material is injected at multiple points beneath each of the foundation pads, the material solidifies within the ground forming a firmer base for foundations and provides the capacity to withstand additional loads.\nDynamic cone penetrometer tests were used to ensure the requisite improvement to the ground was made. Geobear improved the ground strength to 250 kilo newtons per square metre on 40 foundation pads, meaning the structure could comfortably house the new second storey."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:19761c86-fa54-4f37-91c3-09dc310b3fb7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do spiritual practices in Taoism and Zen Buddhism differ in their approach to achieving inner harmony? Compare their core meditation techniques and philosophical foundations.","answer":"Taoism and Zen Buddhism have different approaches to achieving inner harmony. In Taoism, the focus is on following 'The Way' (Tao) through a simple and balanced life, emphasizing harmony through understanding the complementary nature of opposites (like in the Yin-Yang symbol). Taoists incorporate practices such as meditation, martial arts (particularly Tai Chi), and seek to achieve harmony through physical exercise and understanding mysterious, esoteric concepts. In Zen Buddhism, the primary practice is zazen meditation, which focuses on simply existing without grasping or aversion to immediate experience. Zen practitioners follow the Bodhisattva Precepts as ethical guidelines and emphasize freedom from suffering through maintaining a spacious mind during physical sensations, thoughts, and emotions. While both traditions value meditation, Taoism integrates physical movement and balance, while Zen Buddhism emphasizes stillness and direct experience of the present moment.","context":["Taoism is an ancient Chinese philosophy of life whose teachings are ascribed to Lao Zi, an ancient philosopher who lived in the 6th century BCE. It is said that he was the author of the Tao Te Ching, the main scripture of Taoism, that deals with the esoteric knowledge about the Tao or ‚ÄúThe Way.‚Äù The Tao or Way cannot be really described or explained in any way, everything is a mystery, and this book and later writings just tried to emphasize on the need for a simple and balanced life. Harmony should be pursued in order to live a happy and long life, and this is clearly exemplified in the Taoist symbol of Ying and Yang, representing how the opposites (masculine-feminine, hot-cold, tall-short) when united, complement themselves in perfect balance. Whoever follows a simple life and understands these concepts it is said can achieve immortality. Later on, it became a religion with many gods, incorporating practices such as meditation, martial arts (Tai Chi), and magic, attracting many people and evolving up to modern times where it is even practiced in the United States.\nWe could say that Americans approach Taoism in many ways. For some people, it is just a philosophy of life, while others just take from it the tai chi or martial arts practice. Especially after Bruce Lee‚Äôs movies became quite popular in the 1970s people just felt attracted to anything Chinese. That is why it is not strange to drive around some parks and recreational areas in the States and see some people, especially old, doing some exercise and wearing some shirt with Chinese letters, they probably are practicing tai chi. ‚ÄúOne issue facing Daoism is the culture of religious syncretism in the United States. Many Americans may take an aspect of Daoism and incorporate it into their own spiritual practice. Practitioners of Healing Tao may belong to or identify with a different religious tradition and often do not consider themselves religious Daoists, even as they seek to enjoy the benefits of taiji and qigong. This trend leaves many American Daoists grappling with the question: Should such a practitioner be considered a ‚ÄúDaoist‚Äù?‚Äù(1) As we can see, Taoism is practiced in a very freeway in the United States. People do not need to go to any temple or perform any rituals, some Americans could simply wake up one day and feel the Tao is calling them and they just follow it. I could ascertain this when one time I visited the Taoist Tai Chi Society of Temple Terrace and discovered that the instructor was an American woman and most of the students were old American ladies, no one Chinese, only one was Korean, I do not know if that counts. When I asked for a Chinese instructor, they just said they communicate with him online and that they joined the Taoist Tai Chi Society because they felt attracted (I guess the Tao called them), and for the health benefits of physical exercise. One thing I can say, they were very happy and looked like indeed had achieved harmony following the way of the Tao.\n- ‚ÄúAmerican Daoism in the 21st Century‚Äù, The Pluralism Project, Harvard University website, accessed June 19, 2020, https://pluralism.org/american-daoism-in-the-21st-century\nAuthor: Yoel Benhabib (History professor)","About zen practice\nThe fundamental practices of Zen Buddhism are zazen meditation and the Bodhisattva Precepts.\nIn essence, zazen is simply existing without grasping or aversion to our immediate experience.\nZazen is not a means to an end, but the ongoing practice of freedom from suffering. By keeping a spacious mind through whatever physical sensations, thoughts, and emotions arise, we are awake to their transparent, transforming quality and at the same time come into a direct feeling- intimacy with the texture of ourselves, Thus, we become increasingly able to flow in connection with the inevitable changes and difficulties that life brings.\nThe Bodhisattva Precepts are guidelines for ethical practice that embody a clear mind and connected heart animated by the intention to live a life of compassion and deep respect for all beings. The 16 Bodhisattva Precepts are:\nThe Three Pure Precepts\nI vow not to commit evil.\nI vow to cultivate goodness.\nI vow to help others.\nThe Three Refuges (Three Treasures)\nI take refuge in the Buddha.\nI take refuge in the Dharma.\nI take refuge in the Sangha.\nThe Ten Grave Precepts\nI vow not to kill, but to cherish all life.\nI vow not to steal, but to respect that which belongs to others.\nI vow not to misuse sexual energy, but to be honest and respectful.\nI vow not to lie, but to speak the truth.\nI vow not to misuse drugs or alcohol, but to keep the mind clear.\nI vow not to gossip about others‚Äô faults, but to be understanding and sympathetic.\nI vow not to praise myself by criticizing others, but to overcome my own shortcomings.\nI vow not to withhold spiritual or material aid, but to give freely when needed.\nI vow not to unleash anger, but to seek its source.\nI vow not to speak ill of the Three Treasures, but to cherish and uphold them.\nJukai is the process and public ceremony of taking the 16 precepts, committing to practicing them in everyday life. People take jukai after some years of practicing with the community, establishing a relationship with one of the teachers, and taking part in sesshin.\nPractice at Home\nThere are three essential elements for successfully practicing at home:\nspace, time, and community.\nSet Aside a Space\nHome practice is greatly enhanced if the meditation space is dedicated to meditation. Ideally in this space no other activities take place, and it remains undisturbed when not in use. Of course this isn‚Äôt always possible, but it is very powerful. Another important element is cleanliness. The act of cleaning the meditation space is a reminder of the importance of meditation, and the ever-returning dust speaks of the necessity of returning to meditation again and again.\nAn altar can bring power and dignity to a meditation space. The various items on the altar are placed there because they have meaning, and serve as reminders of spiritual aspiration. Common items for an altar are a small bowl of fresh water, a small bowl with rice or some other food offering, fresh flowers, an incense bowl, a photo of a teacher or inspiring person, and a spiritual image. There are no rules for a home altar, but it should be kept clean and tidy. Fresh flowers are a wonderful addition to an altar; be sure to change them when they begin to wilt.\nDecide How Much Time to Meditate\nHome meditation practice is well served by consistency and it is helpful to meditate at the same time every day. Choose a meditation time that is reasonable, preferably when interruptions are unlikely. Many people wake a little early to meditate first thing in the morning, another common time is just before bed. Some people meditate on lunch break, or at other quiet moments in the day.\nIt is important to meditate for an amount of time that can be done daily. Choose a length of time that is unquestionably possible, rather than one that feels like a stretch. It is better to meditate for five minutes per day than for one hour every week. Of course when the meditation period ends it‚Äôs fine to continue meditating. This should be done with a mind of enjoyment and appreciation, rather than a sense of ‚Äúshould‚Äù or obligation. Once a time of day and length of time have been decided and established, commit to that schedule. Making a firm commitment allows meditation practice to become a habit, rather than something that is done only when it‚Äôs convenient.\nMeditate with a Community (Sangha)\nSitting with a sangha is a great addition to a home practice. Sangha is a reminder that there are many, many people in the world who also believe that meditation is important, and are willing to commit time and life energy to the practice. The experience of meditating with a sangha is different than sitting alone, and this difference is very interesting and revealing. A sangha is also an environment to connect with other people, some who are inspiring and some who are challenging.\nThe ZCO sangha includes teachers, and interacting with a teacher can be a great catalyst for spiritual practice. A sangha also offers an opportunity to benefit others with the fruits of meditation. Listening attentively or supporting someone in need are great gifts to share, and enhanced by meditation practice."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5222859e-7a74-4db6-9089-95f93e6174ef>","<urn:uuid:42aacf48-0494-4673-9d27-5d077980852e>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What's the impact of delayed antibiotic treatment on sepsis mortality rates?","answer":"Research has shown that mortality increases by 8% for every hour's delay in antibiotic treatment for sepsis patients.","context":["Now a new clinical toolkit, developed jointly by the College of Emergency Medicine (CEM) and the UK Sepsis Trust, aims to help A&E teams to become more aware of the significant morbidity and mortality due to sepsis and provide the knowledge and skills for early recognition of its presence.\nDesigned to provide operational solutions for reliable sepsis identification and management the toolkit also complements clinical toolkits designed for other clinical areas and also offers guidance on screening and response to sepsis.\nDr Jeff Keep, a consultant in Emergency Medicine and Major Trauma at King‚Äôs College Hospital in London and a member of the Quality in Emergency Care Committee at the CEM, hopes the kit will bring clarity for emergency doctors over the different definitions of the severity of sepsis. ‚ÄòTime can be wasted diagnosing the severity of sepsis and by making the diagnosis simpler and having the confidence to treat sepsis before a definitive diagnosis has been made, we should improve door-to-antibiotic times,‚Äô he explains. ‚ÄòRecognising sepsis is often easy when the patient is very unwell, but we want to recognise sepsis early on and this can be very difficult; the toolkit contains useful ways to achieve this.‚Äô\nWith emergency departments (EDs) using Early Warning Scores (EWS), performed very soon in the patient‚Äôs journey in the ED, an EWS of three or four, or higher, should trigger a sepsis screen, he said.\nThe toolkit also summarises some key recommendations for better organisation of the hospital and its sepsis management. Dr Keep: ‚ÄòSepsis is a time-critical illness. Researchhas shown that early treatment with antibiotics has a significant impact on mortality, which increases by 8% for every hour‚Äôs delay.\n‚ÄòMany patients with sepsis present to the ED and therefore the ED should manage sepsis patients as it does other time-critical illnesses, such as major trauma, myocardial infarction and acute stroke. In the UK, if managed properly, we estimate that we could save 12,500 lives from sepsis every year.‚Äô\nAt present some 37,000 people die from sepsis annually in the UK, but steps are being taken to cut tackle this in bringing together professional organisations such as the College of Emergency Medicine, the College of Paramedics and the Royal College of Physicians to jointly tackle sepsis and advise a group of members of parliament (APPG) on how to fix sepsis.\nThe Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman published a report on sepsis last year, the NCEPOD (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) is conducting a review of sepsis patients, and UK health guidance and advisory body NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) has fast-tracked sepsis through its system and will be issuing guidelines in the near future.\n‚ÄòNHS England [The National Health Service] has also joined the fight against sepsis and the momentum is currently strong and very positive. Of course, it is ultimately down to the individual healthcare providers to recognise sepsis early and start treatment, but the broad support from within the UK healthcare system is invaluable,‚Äô Dr Keep stated.\nIn 2009, CEM developed national criteria and standards for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock, and conducted the first national audit of these standards in 2011/12 and a second in 2013/14.\n‚ÄòThe results have improved, and more patients with severe sepsis or septic shock are receiving IV fluids and antibiotics within an hour of attendance,‚Äô Dr Keep said.\nHe stressed the importance of data coding as being critical in combating sepsis and added: ‚ÄòIf every hospital collected accurate data on sepsis then it would be easier to monitor improvements and manage sepsis more effectively.\n‚ÄòDiagnosing the source of infection is also important and strategies for early investigations are crucial to patient survival. By identifying and treating sepsis earlier, costly treatments such as ITU admission can be avoided and these resources should be invested in hospital ‚ÄòSepsis Teams‚Äô that can respond rapidly with the necessary skills to diagnose and treat sepsis and not allow the patient‚Äôs condition to deteriorate further.‚Äô\nJeff Keep MD is a consultant in Emergency Medicine and Major Trauma at King‚Äôs College Hospital, London, and a member of the CEM‚Äôs Quality in Emergency Care Committee.

{"question":"Can you explain the technical limitations of commercial drones reaching space and compare this with Titan's potential for biological activity? ü§î","answer":"Commercial drones cannot reach space primarily due to Earth's thinning atmosphere at high altitudes, which reduces propeller efficiency, with the highest recorded altitude being only 11,000 feet (3.35 km). The thin air and cold temperatures affecting lithium-ion batteries make space unreachable for standard commercial drones. In contrast, Titan presents an environment where complex chemical processes could potentially support life, despite not having liquid water. The moon's surface contains hydrogen cyanide that can form polyimine, a polymer capable of forming various structures from flat sheets to complex coils, which could catalyze prebiotic reactions and potentially host life-forming processes under its unique atmospheric conditions.","context":["Online we can find different videos where people are testing their drones to go as high as possible. This led myself to question, how high can business drones fly? When we buy a drone, the very first thing we look at can be how long the electric batteries can last, how quick a drone can go, what range it offers, and the quality from the camera. But what people often forget to take into consideration when purchasing a rhyme is a how higher that drone can fly. Therefore , can there be at least some treadmill on the market that can reach space?\nSo Can Drone Reach Space? Short answer is not any! Drones cannot achieve Space for couple of reasons. One of the main reason is the Earth‚Äô ring atmosphere, where the air is much slimmer at high altitudes. Drones are powered by propellers that use air density and push that same air down to maintain the drone at that height.\nWhat is the Top Altitude a Drone Can Fly?\nDrones, like airplanes, have the problem of flying with very high altitudes due to the thinner air upward in the atmosphere. Because of this, rotors have much less efficiency and more energy is required to keep the drone at that height. Also one of the aspects is the temperature that is getting lower the further we move, which is the problem meant for lithium-ion batteries which usually do not tolerate really low temperatures.\nRegarding commercial drones, t he greatest elevation ever documented and holding the particular record is eleven, 000 ft (3. 35 km) . That height has been achieved with the DJI Phantom 2 drone. The time it took for the drone to achieve that height has been three and a half a few minutes. However , today‚Äô ring drones have a security system that limitations these heights, and the only way to bypass this is to disable the software restrictions that have been set. Most drones such as DJI have restrictions, and are started fly 1 . five km above ocean level, while the lawful limits are much smaller than that and are usually 500 feets (150 meters).\nCan a Drone Work in Space?\nThe brief answer is INDEED! For many years, NASA continues to be working to improve its technology, which is based on exploration of other planets, and they already have available drone technology that is used for such tasks. But the biggest problem is that drones on Earth can‚Äô t be used exactly the same way they do in space, because they don‚Äô t have the ability to drive air , which creates a thrust, which is also the 3rd Newton‚Äô nasiums Law. But if we all take as an example the moon that has a really low gravity and a very low air density, it can cause a lot of troubles to create thrust, keeping that drone steady in the air.\nNevertheless it comes to the galaxy itself, that is, the area between the planets, there is no air at all so that the thrust required to maintain the drone on a few desired path would not exist. As an example, we could see Elon Musk and his experiment which usually he did with his Tesla RoadSter which usually he launched in to space, and that model moved along the route he gave your pet, and after that it no more had any impact on changing direction. If you want to learn more, read my write-up: Can Drones Work in Space .\nNASA is Exploring Area Using Drones\nFor the purpose of discovering new planets, NASA has launched task management where it would send its drones and robots into space for the exploration of various other planets using new technology. NASA‚Äô s Kennedy Space Center is definitely working on various methods to explore other planets, because there are places exactly where NASA rovers are already out of reach for many years as well as the drones remain only solution for now. These drones are quite just like the classic quadcopter through Earth, but their mode cannot be applied within space. The reason is there is no air in space, and classic quadcopers need atmosphere to use a propulsion system to keep them airborne. NASA therefore uses an aircraft system instead of a propeller to navigate and direct these drones in the desired direction.\nWhat they are also trying to achieve is the fact that this drone flies autonomously, that is, no one needs to navigate it. NASA‚Äô s prototype drone is approximately 5 feet wide and made of exclusive materials using a THREE DIMENSIONAL printer. As we mentioned, the main goal of the drones would be to entry inaccessible places such as the interiors of several volcanoes that the exoplanets might otherwise have got. NASA is therefore still working on figuring out how to make the most effective drone that will have these many abilities for the purpose of such scientific research.\nDrones on a Mission to Explore The Moon\nDrones have proven to be extremely capable of completing many tasks that have been set for them so far. This is why the need to use drones with regards to space missions has arisen, because there are still many places which have not been discovered, both in space and on various planets. NASA has so far used different types of rovers that will explored the surfaces and interiors associated with planets, but these rovers had limited gain access to and encountered various obstacles such as steep mountains, interiors, voids, and the like. What drones could contribute to is to overcome these hurdles and thus offer brand new research opportunities. Therefore , drones can circumvent all these obstacles and offer a completely different look at.\nDrones have got explored almost every part of the earth up to now, which is because they are able to navigate whatever problems come their way. But what drones can do on earth is completely different because of the environment that exists in the world, and so they use air flow displacement whereby air moves and maintains that drone in the air. But this method can also work on Mars besides the Earth, because this world also has an environment. If there is no environment, no support for that air mass might be made unless there was some kind of rocket propulsion. Rocket propulsion is not the best solution since it discharges very quickly and is of short time-span.\nIs it feasible For Drone to achieve the Mars?\nThe only ones we can say to know with certainty the answer to this question are usually are NASA designers. Drones on the Planet have been in use for many years and are based on the standard of electricity used to power the engines, and therefore the rotors are keeping that drone in the air. However , since the gravity on Mars is much smaller than that on Earth, and is 3. 7 m/s2, then they should be quite easy to perform ‚Äì but it‚Äô nasiums not! We have currently said that drones make use of their rotors to produce a thrust of air directed downwards and thus resist gravity, but the bad news is that the atmosphere on Mars is much denser than that found on soil (about 60 times).\nThis means that the drone needs to provide much more thrust with its rotors than it is on the floor so it can take off on Mars. 1 possible solution to this might be to increase the rotor radius, rotor depend, or simply increase the rotator speed. But this solution also techniques new problems because as Mars is a lot farther from the Sunlight than Earth, less solar power is available, plus electricity is required to maintain that drone up.\nThe continuing future of Drones in Room\nWe are already well conscious that drones have got conquered the Earth and their next location is the solar system. NASA has a plan to launch a drone in the space which drone will travel to other planets for your next 6 years. The main mission for that treadmill (Dragonfly) is to visit Saturn‚Äô s moon, Titan. Titan includes a very low gravity and it has a dense environment. Dragonfly will calculate various parameters upon Titan, such as the composition of Titan components, temperature, air denseness, etc . at the various locations.\nDragonfly is scheduled to launch in 2026 and head to Saturn‚Äô s moon Ti (symbol), and should arrive at the default location around 2034. He will invest a couple of years circling our planet for the purpose of collecting numerous data that will be analyzed later. The amazing facts about Titan are usually that the air is up to 400 times heavier than Mars and it is mostly nitrogen. This will definitely be a difficult mission, as it will fly in peculiar conditions.\nWhat we should can see is that the drone world is growing at incredible velocity. They‚Äô ve looked into almost every corner of the Earth, and now it‚Äô s time so they can take over the whole world. NASA is focusing on specially designed drones which will be capable of exploring both universe and planets and collect a number of data. As for business drones, they do not have the ability to reach space, because of the thinner density of air, as we increase in the atmosphere. This is one of the main reasons why commercial drones that are designed like that will never be able to reach area ever.","Saturn‚Äôs largest moon Titan is a truly fascinating place. Aside from Earth, it is the only place in the Solar System where rainfall occurs and there are active exchanges between liquids on the surface and fog in the atmosphere ‚Äì albeit with methane instead of water. It‚Äôs atmospheric pressure is also comparable to Earth‚Äôs, and it is the only other body in the Solar System that has a dense atmosphere that is nitrogen-rich.\nFor some time, astronomers and planetary scientists have speculated that Titan might also have the prebiotic conditions necessary for life. Others, meanwhile, have argued that the absence of water on the surface rules out the possibility of life existing there. But according to a recent study produced by a research team from Cornell University, the conditions on Titan‚Äôs surface might support the formation of life without the need for water.\nWhen it comes to searching for life beyond Earth, scientists focus on targets that possess the necessary ingredients for life as we know it ‚Äì i.e. heat, a viable atmosphere, and water. This is essentially the ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit‚Äù approach, where we search for conditions resembling those here on Earth. Titan ‚Äì which is very cold, quite distant from our Sun, and has a thick, hazy atmosphere ‚Äì does not seem like a viable candidate, given these criteria.\nHowever, according to the Cornell research team ‚Äì which is led by Dr. Martin Rahm ‚Äì Titan presents an opportunity to see how life could emerge under different conditions, one which are much colder than Earth and don‚Äôt involve water.\nTheir study ‚Äì titled ‚ÄúPolymorphism and electronic structure of polyimine and its potential significance for prebiotic chemistry on Titan‚Äù ‚Äì appeared recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In it, Rahm and his colleagues examined the role that hydrogen cyanide, which is believed to be central to the origin of life question, may play in Titan‚Äôs atmosphere.\nPrevious experiments have shown that hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules can link together to form polyimine, a polymer that can serve as a precursor to amino acids and nucleic acids (the basis for protein cells and DNA). Previous surveys have also shown that hydrogen cyanide is the most abundant hydrogen-containing molecule in Titan‚Äôs atmosphere.\nAs Professor Lunine ‚Äì the David C. Duncan Professor in the Physical Sciences and Director of the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science and co-author of the study ‚Äì told Universe Today via email: ‚ÄúOrganic molecules, liquid lakes and seas (but of methane, not water) and some amount of solar energy reaches the surface. So this suggests the possibility of an environment that might host an exotic form of life.‚Äù\nUsing quantum mechanical calculations, the Cornell team showed that polyimine has electronic and structural properties that could facilitate prebiotic chemistry under very cold conditions. These involve the ability to absorb a wide spectrum of light, which is predicted to occur in a window of relative transparency in Titan‚Äôs atmosphere.\nAnother is the fact that polyimine has a flexible backbone, and can therefore take on many different structures (aka. polymorphs). These range from flat sheets to complex coiled structures, which are relatively close in energy. Some of these structures, according to the team, could work to accelerate prebiotic chemical reactions, or even form structures that could act as hosts for them.\n‚ÄúPolyimine can form sheets,‚Äù said Lunine, ‚Äúwhich like clays might serve as a catalytic surface for prebiotic reactions. We also find the polyimine absorbs sunlight where Titan‚Äôs atmosphere is quite transparent, which might help to energize reactions.‚Äù\nIn short, the presence of polyimine could mean that Titan‚Äôs surface gets the energy its needs to drive photochemical reactions necessary for the creation of organic life, and that it could even assist in the development of that life. But of course, no evidence has been found that polyimine has been produced on the surface of Titan, which means that these research findings are still academic at this point.\nHowever, Lunine and his team indicate that hydrogen cyanide may very well have lead to the creation of polyimine on Titan, and that it might have simply escaped detection because of Titan‚Äôs murky atmosphere. They also added that future missions to Titan might be able to look for signs of the polymer, as part of ongoing research into the possibility of exotic life emerging in other parts of the Solar System.\n‚ÄúWe would need an advanced payload on the surface to sample and search for polyimines,‚Äù answered Lunine, ‚Äúor possibly by a next generation spectrometer from orbit. Both of these are ‚Äúbeyond Cassini‚Äù, that is, the next generation of missions.‚Äù\nPerhaps when Juno is finished surveying Jupiter‚Äôs atmosphere in two years time, NASA might consider retasking it for a flyby of Titan? After all, Juno was specifically designed to peer beneath a veil of thick clouds. They don‚Äôt come much thicker than on Titan!\nFurther Reading: PNAS"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7a3fc8f9-6261-448d-b149-778894f2ddf3>","<urn:uuid:50acb301-a490-4b61-90ec-32e0aadf273d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the characteristics of New Zealand's tactical kicking game, and how does it relate to transition attack opportunities?","answer":"New Zealand employs a distinctive kicking strategy where they prefer short 22-meter dropouts to regain possession, and in their defensive third, they often use high kicks to challenge for the ball in the air or compete at the resulting ruck. They also employ deceptive passing along the line before kicking behind the opposition wings. While this approach can limit opponents' structured attacking opportunities, it also creates transition attack possibilities if not executed properly. The effectiveness of this kicking game heavily depends on Dan Carter's presence, as with Colin Slade, 60-70% of kicked possession goes to the opposition, while Carter's figures are the reverse. In terms of transition attacks, these tactical kicks can create both 'bait transitions' where teams deliberately kick to create attacking opportunities, and 'stolen transitions' where poor execution of kicks leads to counter-attacking possibilities.","context":["To be successful against New Zealand, and beat them at a World Cup for a third time, France must trust their creative passing game, but it is essential they choose the right moments to do so. France's problem is the tension between the structured part of the game and their natural unstructured approach and for all Marc Li√®vremont's recent statements about returning to a traditional French game they have never really got this right.\nThe key man in striking the balance between order and chaos in French rugby is the scrum-half, not the fly-half. In most countries the No10 calls the shots, but in France it is the No9. Australia now do this, too, with Will Genia at scrum-half and the fly-half Quade Cooper.\nWhen, for example, there is a breakdown and the ball is slow, in England the No10 would decide whether to put the ball up or to continue to play with it. In France it is likely to be the No9, which is why you will often see Dimitri Yachvili and Morgan Parra box-kicking. They make the decisions and that will be even truer now David Skrela has gone home injured. Fran√ßois Trinh-Duc seems a certain starter at fly-half and if he is allowed to dictate play he certainly favours the unstructured approach.\nThe fact there were two scrum-halves on the pitch against Japan after Skrela went off illustrated their influence. With Parra filling in at fly-half, his understanding along with Yachvili at scrum-half of where the forwards should be and where and when to play was perfect and France regained control of the game. I don't for a minute think they will start with that combination on Saturday but it does illustrate the knife edge French rugby is constantly on: the two natural scrum-halves understood instinctively the need for balance between structure and invention.\nIt is the French No9's responsibility to understand the culture and tempo. If they just throw the ball around regardless of the context, it is a mess, but if they continually structure everything and nothing's happening the team will do something silly. How often have we seen French teams run ball back that ? The frustration overwhelms the areas of the game they are good at because they try things whether they are on or not.\nNew Zealand, though, offer opponents the chance to play much more than any other top side (except France) because they want control of the ball in all aspects of the game. When they have a 22 drop out, they kick short because they want the ball back and they back themselves to get it, whereas other countries prefer to kick long to move the game into the opponents' half.\nWhen New Zealand are in their defensive third in open play, they often kick high and challenge for the ball in the air or compete at the resulting ruck, giving the opposition, at best, scrappy possession. They also like to pass along the line as if they are going to attack, which forces opposition wings to come up, then the wing or full-back kicks along the ground in behind, and they look to hustle and compete at the ruck. It is difficult for opponents to play structured rugby against these tactics and they minimise opposition lineouts ‚Äì and the resulting chance to run a planned attacking move ‚Äì but if not executed correctly they offer the opposition the chance to counterattack.\nNew Zealand's big weakness is the execution of their game when Dan Carter is not there and France will be hoping he was not simply being rested against Japan on Friday. When Colin Slade executes his kicking strategy, I'd say 60-70% of the ball goes to the opposition, with Carter the figures are reversed. If they kick away possession against France they are in trouble. But France face the same problem: if they kick loosely or concede turnover ball, they face the world's best attacking them from unstructured play.\nFrance's ability to keep the ball moving and their unpredictability can also diminish the effectiveness of Richie McCaw. They are excellent at keeping the ball off the ground, and this takes McCaw's skills at the breakdown out of the game. France have the ability to integrate forwards and backs, passing the ball before contact, whereas most northern hemisphere sides tend to take the ball into contact, where McCaw thrives.\nAgainst Japan Nicolas Mas, one of the best tightheads around, put in a wonderful little pass that set off the move for Julien Pierre's try. I don't know of any other country that would have a tighthead prop who pops his head up, thinks \"this is on\" and starts a move. If they can do that and keep the ball up against New Zealand they have a real chance.\nThe key decision maker, whether Parra or Yachvili, however, will have to ensure all areas of the game are working. France will get invited in by New Zealand but the danger is that if they get the balance wrong New Zealand can capitalise better than anybody. That's what could make this the outstanding game of the group stage.\nDean Ryan played for England, Wasps and Newcastle at No8 and coached Gloucester in the Premiership","In an article earlier in the week, I covered the 10s role in two of three main areas of free-form attack ‚Äì the set-piece strike and multiphase possession.\nThe third form of attack ‚Äì attack in transition ‚Äì is, for me, one of the key areas of attacking focus in elite rugby sides around the world from test level all the way down.\nFirst, we need to understand what an attack in transition is, how you generate it and the different types of attack in transition.\nWhat is attack in transition?\nAs the game grows further and further into professionalism, it becomes incrementally ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to defend than it is to attack. I‚Äôve written ‚Äúeasier‚Äù in inverted commas there because there are very few things that are easy at the elite level but in the battle between attack and defence, defence always has the benefit of pre-drilled organisation and structure. A good attack needs imagination, creativity, skill execution and timing ‚Äì be it when the attack is being designed or on the field. All a good defence needs in comparison is physicality, mobility, trust, threat identification and knowing your role.\nI like to think of the attack vs defence question like the Battle of Thermopylae. The Persian army had bigger numbers and fancier weapons but the Spartan‚Äôs were organised, technically proficient and had a rock-solid (literally) system of manipulating the attack.\nTo boil it down to a folksy quotable, it is much easier to destroy a thing (defence) than it is to create a thing (attack).\nThat‚Äôs why, given the quality of modern defences, a lot of sides are making the decision to play off the transition between defence and attack as a primary attacking play. Some sides, like Leinster, don‚Äôt need to play off transition as much because of the overwhelming quality of the ball carrying. Teams like Scarlets, on the other end of the scale, play an awful lot of their best stuff on transition.\nAs far as transition attacks go, there are two main types.\nI‚Äôd describe them as;\nBait Transitions are when you‚Äôre trying to bait a transition event out of the opposition through your kicking game or quick taps. What do you need to play a lot of bait transitions? Ideally, you‚Äôd want quick wingers who are good in the air, solid hands across the board, a very mobile 10, pace in the back row (if one or both wingers are involved in the chase) and, I‚Äôve mentioned this before ‚Äì and it might seem counterintuitive ‚Äì you‚Äôll have to have a good offensive and defensive scrum due to the high risk of knock-ons that occur on kick chase. If you have all of those components,\nI‚Äôve been over the kick transition before but they mainly look like this from a kicking perspective;\nWe‚Äôve kicked the ball away ‚Äì nominally ‚Äì and this is the ‚Äúbait‚Äù. When we claim the ball back on the catch, this is a transition attack because the defence has to reset as they run back for the kick.\nThe best option here was the pass out from Cloete at the base but a good tackle from Blue #4 stopped that at the last minute.\nBy the time Castres had reset, the transition was still there to be attacked but we picked the wrong side.\nWe went post-right instead of post-left and coughed up the moment. This is the kind of scenario when you want your 10 making the exact right decision and your scrumhalf trusting him with the play.\nIn the above example, Keatley lines up at first receiver with Zebo second and Farrell third. Murray looked at his options and attempted a kick through for Zebo and Farrell to chase. I‚Äôd have liked to see Murray trust Keatley or Zebo to make something happen here.\nWe might be looking at a 3v3 here but we have the width. Give this to Zebo, let him attack the space between the second and third defender and see if we can get a ball away to Farrell around the corner or with a fix/pass.\nBait transitions like this need to have a high level of trust, split-second decision making and pace, pace, pace.\nHere‚Äôs an example of that need for pace from another transition in the game. In this example, we‚Äôve drawn a kick transition event from Castres and can attack the openside.\nThis transition event shows the importance of pace from your primary creator when you‚Äôre attacking that same transition.\nZebo makes a good catch and we‚Äôve caught Castres napping on their reset. We get clean possession and a good pull back to the second layer. From there, the transition starts to break down.\nPersonally speaking, I‚Äôd have liked Keatley to commit his man before shipping this ball on.\nStander is running a hard decoy option line and we‚Äôve got a stacked second layer ready to come around the corner. Ideally, in this situation, you want to get outside shoulder angle on all your passes so you‚Äôre forcing the opposition to drift towards the openside touchline. Why? This elongates the space between them and gives you lanes to run into. The two men defending the edge of this ragged transition defence are prime for isolation with Conway, Farrell and Cloete as viable threats.\nKeatley, for me, has to hold that initial defender so Stander can stick the second defender with his decoy/option line. By shipping the ball on without interesting that first defender, Keatley hurts the initial transition.\nSee how Castres immediately drift away from his line and onto the outside shoulder angle of our second layer? Now, Stander‚Äôs decoy line doesn‚Äôt even cause a stutter on the second defender and, with nothing to pin them in, they‚Äôre free to push up and out, which kills our second layer. We were lining up outside them ‚Äì good ‚Äì but they took back the angle when they didn‚Äôt buy the decoy ‚Äì that‚Äôs bad.\nA superb carry from Chris Farrell ‚Äì seriously, it‚Äôs outstanding ‚Äì recreates the transition alignment.\nHe chops back inside, which maintains the defensive panic for Castres.\nWhen the ball comes back, we‚Äôve got a massive linebreak opportunity on the outside but it all breaks down.\nWe stuffed a 3-1 transition overlap.\nThe blame will usually go on the forward in this instance ‚Äì Stander ‚Äì but for me, #10 needs to be stretching his legs out here.\nIf Keatley has the footspeed and pace (two different things) to stretch this out, he‚Äôll have a 4v1overlap in 20m of space with Conway, Cloete and Earls to finish, if he doesn‚Äôt want to finish himself.\nThese are marginal issues but they show why a certain type of creator is needed to fully take on an attack that relies a lot on taking advantage of transition events.\nJust as a quick aside, quick tap penalties also act as bait transitions.\nLook at this one from the Scarlets‚Äô Gareth Davies;\nWhen a quick tap is used correctly ‚Äì like this ‚Äì it works in the exact same way as a breakdown turnover as far as attacking the transition is concerned.\nLook at this alignment before the ball comes back.\nThere are three La Rochelle forwards 15m behind the ruck and fourteen La Rochelle players in this shot with good Scarlets numbers out wide. That‚Äôs a tight compression and its one that the Scarlets are excellent at taking advantage of. The speed of the ball coming back hurt this transition attempt but it‚Äôs a perfect example of what a good quick tap transition can look like.\nUltimately, bait transitions need speed and attacking decisiveness to be successful.\nThe addition of Carbery should be a key part of our developing work in this area of the game as long as he builds on the budding relationship he has with Murray. If Carbery can get into the right positions ‚Äì even the ones that I showed above ‚Äì then Murray will find him and use him.\nAfter that, it‚Äôs up to the man with the ball to make it happen.\nThis is where it gets a little complex, so bear with me.\nI would define stolen transitions in the following categories;\nLoose Stolen Turnover\nForced Opposition Kickaways\nAnd then to a lesser extent;\nA scrum taken against the head that doesn‚Äôt end in an awarded penalty\nIf we look at the primary three methods listed here ‚Äì breakdown turnover, forced kickaway and lineout turnover ‚Äì Munster are uniquely stacked to take advantage of all three this coming season.\nI‚Äôll start with the lineout, for obvious reasons; in Peter O‚ÄôMahony and Tadhg Beirne, Munster have two of the premier defensive lineout operators in Europe. They‚Äôre both incredibly quick into the air ‚Äì be it at the front or middle ‚Äì and are usually good for one or two clean turnovers per game, regardless of the opposition.\nThe principle behind the effectiveness of a lineout turnover transition is the same reason as it is for the breakdown and kickaways ‚Äì a purely attacking alignment is an inherently faulty defensive one. That‚Äôs almost a truism, but it‚Äôs the basis behind the mentality of transition attacking.\nOur mentality on lineout turnover is already pretty expansive;\nWe turned this over on our own 22 and you can see how eager Murray was to get this ball out and wide to take advantage of Castres‚Äô formerly-attacking, now-defensive alignment.\nThey have twelve players in the shot, with five Munster attackers out of shot on the outside. Any quick ball out the back of this lineout opens up a number of possibilities through hand or boot.\nThe turnover doesn‚Äôt even need to be clean;\nThis was a scrappy Scarlets turnover but if Barclay gets this ball to Patchell, this is a cast-iron try for the Turks.\nSure, La Rochelle would have moved across to the space but this would take a massive defensive read or a bad attacking play to end up as anything less than five points on the scoreboard for the Scarlets.\nWhen you attack in lineout transition ‚Äì or any kind of stolen transition ‚Äì your defence IS your attack.\nForced Opposition Kickaways\nForced Opposition Kickaways and Breakdown Turnovers are inherently linked. Bait Transitions are where we risk our possession by kicking it away for a territory gain and a transition alignment to attack. When you force/shape the opposition to kick the ball away through your defensive efforts and position, you can get incredible attacking opportunities if their kick is less than optimal.\nMunster turned this ball over after a five-phase possession but pressured the Toulon exit to the point where Trinh-Duc missed touch. From there, Conway had a route to the try line through a broken field.\nThis is a fairly extreme ‚Äì and epic ‚Äì example, but the theory behind forcing kick away transitions on opposition multiphase possession is something that you can control, with the right personnel.\nHave a look at this sequence from Scarlets vs La Rochelle;\nLa Rochelle pinball between Beirne and Barclay ‚Äì two talented jackals ‚Äì for a few phases before kicking the ball back to the Scarlets in a sub-optimal position. Is this a Bait Transition? Arguably, but I would posit that La Rochelle aren‚Äôt really in full control of this situation, despite their possession. You can‚Äôt really call it a calculated risk ‚Äì mainly because they don‚Äôt really have the personnel in place.\nIn this situation, Scarlets‚Äô known threats on the floor are actively manipulating La Rochelle‚Äôs phase patterns.\nThis would play out all through the game and actively limit La Rochelle‚Äôs attacking threat with the ball in hand.\nScarlets would use this threat of Beirne and their other jackals as a means of corralling most of the sides they faced this past season.\nYou don‚Äôt always have to get the ball, you just have to threaten each breakdown enough to slow down possession and tempt a kickaway.\nWhen you see Munster‚Äôs current defensive system ‚Äì a narrow ruck side blitz with a wider drift ‚Äì you can see how our strength on the ground will slot in.\nThe narrow blitz is based on this principle;\nEssentially, with a heavy jackal like Beirne at ‚ÄúC‚Äù, teams will be predisposed to avoid that part of the defence for ball carrying and be ‚Äúfunnelled‚Äù into our narrow ruck side blitz for punishment or pass the ball further out.\nThis lets us attack the breakdown if necessary, punish the ball carrier if he goes narrow ‚Äì and they often will ‚Äì and it puts a lot of pressure on our wider defence to track the opposition as they pass back and then out to where we‚Äôve shown them the space.\nThis, again, plays into our turnover aims ‚Äì look at this graphic;\nCastres have to get this ball wide quite slowly because they‚Äôre playing deep into the second layer without dominant front-foot ball ‚Äì that‚Äôs what the narrow ruck-side blitz is for. When they get out wide, Conway and Farrell will be there to scrag and tackle, with Cloete making up massive ground behind the defensive line to assist on a tackle if necessary or get over the ball for a go at the ball ideally. We‚Äôll either steal the ball, win a penalty or slow the ball down enough to allow our narrow defence to reset.\nYou can see this defensive style in much of what we do since Ferreira took over;\nHere‚Äôs the same narrow system. We‚Äôre set up to hammer Castres in the narrow here, deny them any gain line, slow or steal the ball and then reset around the corner to do the same and tempt that kick away. Here‚Äôs how it looks;\nThis will be where you‚Äôll see Beirne next season;\nThis defence incrementally increases your chance of a breakdown steal or a kickaway, where you can drill your returns in a structured way to increase the chance of getting a point scoring scenario.\nThe final transition attack is probably the most valuable and, as a result, the hardest to get. When you steal the ball in the tackle, or at the breakdown, you get either the best transition ball to attack with or a penalty.\nFor that reason, these kinds of breakdown turnover transitions are relatively rare in most games. To have a chance of playing off this kind of ball, you need to have elite jackals.\nScarlets were able to play a lot of this kind of ball because of their personnel ‚Äì Shingler, Davies, Barclay, Boyde and Beirne were all superb over the ball over the last two seasons. Those guys allowed them to shape most other teams attacking patterns and play off their kickaways and turnovers as a result.\nYou need good close range hands, a mobile 10 and an elite attacking lineout to take full advantage of a team of jackals, but Munster have that and then some.\nLook at the jackaling roster Munster have for next season; Cloete, Botha, Beirne, O‚ÄôMahony, Cronin and Stander. Look at the lineout options we already have and are building on.\nAnd that‚Äôs before you get to the turnover ball effect in loose play;\nBeirne‚Äôs role in springing this ball wide for a Scarlets‚Äô try was only possible because he was standing in and around the ‚ÄúC‚Äù position ‚Äì essentially turning his defensive position into a devasting attacking position in transition.\nWe had a hooker, a 13 making a bad read and a blindside flanker trying to lock up 20m of touchline space after a turnover at a breakdown. Normally, a heavy defender is a liability in this position but not Beirne ‚Äì his pass makes the play.\nWhen you get close range contact/breakdown turnovers your ability to transfer the ball through the forwards to your creatives is a vital part of transition rugby and we‚Äôre already growing our game there.\nBeing able to play off that turnover ball ‚Äì if you have the players to get you regular turnover ball ‚Äì gives you an excellent attacking weapon.\nIn this position, the handling from your forwards ‚Äì who are the defenders (now attackers) closest to the ruck if we remember the narrow blitz system ‚Äì need to have excellent handling.\nIn this instance, they did ‚Äì but the play was left down by inaccuracy from 10.\nPersonnel dictates game plan and our personnel changes point to a style of play not far from what I‚Äôve described here.\nWhether or not we can up our accuracy and build on the work of last season remains to be seen but on the evidence I‚Äôve seen, I think a full preseason under Van Graan and the ever-improving Felix Jones will do our work the world of good.\nThe main question is ‚Äì can we avoid the Scarlets‚Äô pitfalls? They were very good over the ball but got thoroughly blasted by Leinster in the Champions Cup and PRO14. In my opinion, they were too focused on the transition and didn‚Äôt have the grunt to make the ‚Äúnarrow blitz‚Äù system work.\nWhen Beirne, Davies and Shingler weren‚Äôt getting steals due to the breakdown attention of the likes of Furlong, Leavy and Fardy, they found themselves getting overpowered and then overrun phase for phase.\nI‚Äôll have a look at that in more detail over the next few days.\nOne thing is for sure, adding guys like Beirne and Carbery to Munster means one thing ‚Äì more attack in transition."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2012d2dd-bd2c-44dd-b981-42b0323b81aa>","<urn:uuid:5f199f50-2b27-4de0-900f-6cb6bad5c15c>"],"error":null}

It was there that Miriam died and was buried. 2 The Israelites had no water, so they went to Moses and Aaron 3and complained, ‚ÄúMoses, we'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the LORD's sacred tent.[G] 4You brought us into this desert, and now we and our livestock are going to die! 5Egypt was better than this horrible place. At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates.[H] But now we don't even have any water.‚Äù 6Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent, where they bowed down. The LORD appeared to them in all of his glory 787-8and said, ‚ÄúMoses, get your walking stick.[I] Then you and Aaron call the people together and command that rock to give you water. That's how you will provide water for the people of Israel and their livestock.‚Äù 9Moses obeyed and took his stick from the sacred tent. 10After he and Aaron had gathered the people around the rock, he said, ‚ÄúLook, you rebellious people, and you will see water flow from this rock!‚Äù 11 He raised his stick in the air and struck the rock two times. At once, water gushed from the rock, and the people and their livestock had water to drink. 12But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, ‚ÄúBecause you refused to believe in my power, these people did not respect me. And so, you will not be the ones to lead them into the land I have promised.‚Äù 13The Israelites had complained against the LORD, and he had shown them his holy power by giving them water to drink. So they named the place Meribah, which means ‚ÄúComplaining.‚Äù Israel Isn't Allowed To Go through Edom 14Moses sent messengers from Israel's camp near Kadesh with this message for the king of Edom: We are Israelites, your own relatives, and we're sure you have heard the terrible things that have happened to us. 15Our ancestors settled in Egypt and lived there a long time. But later the Egyptians were cruel to us, 16and when we begged our LORD for help, he answered our prayer and brought us out of that land. Now we are camped at the border of your territory, near the town of Kadesh. 17Please let us go through your country. We won't go near your fields or vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. We will stay on the main road[J] until we leave your territory. 18But the king of Edom answered, ‚ÄúNo, I won't let you go through our country! And if you try, we will attack you.‚Äù 19Moses sent back this message: ‚ÄúWe promise to stay on the main road, and if any of us or our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We just want to pass through.‚Äù 20But the king insisted, ‚ÄúYou can't go through our land!‚Äù Then Edom sent out its strongest troops 21to keep Israel from passing through its territory. So the Israelites had to go in another direction. Aaron Dies 22After the Israelites had left Kadesh and had gone as far as Mount Hor 23on the Edomite border, the LORD said, 24‚ÄúAaron, this is where you will die. You and Moses disobeyed me at Meribah, and so you will not enter the land I promised the Israelites. 25Moses, go with Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of the mountain. 26Then take Aaron's priestly robe from him and place it on Eleazar. Aaron will die there.‚Äù 27Moses obeyed, and everyone watched as he and Aaron and Eleazar walked to the top of Mount Hor. 28 Moses then took the priestly robe from Aaron and placed it on Eleazar.

Data has become larger and more granular, with increased depth and density. This enables us as practitioners to move from testing hypotheses on a small and isolated set of data to building detailed profiles of individuals. With this knowledge, we can reshape experiences in the world, which is where we intersect directly with ethics. We are no longer limited by a lack of data, so we are responsible for our own ethical boundaries.\nWhat are ethics?\nAt the intersection between laws and values lives our new hot term: ethics. This word comes to light when things go awry‚Äîsuch as conflicts of interest or ethical violation‚Äîbut its impact lies within the core of our daily personal and professional decisions.\nEthics come into play on the professional side when we act on behalf of another, either as a trusted advisor or as expert. Professionals are typically expected to focus first on the client, using our knowledge to help others. Doctors do this with patients by monitoring health, diagnosing disease, and providing the best treatment.\nTo understand ethics, we need to look at values since they closely interrelate. Values are what we, as humans, believe. They‚Äôre intensely personal, formed by family, religion, culture, and experience.\nWe break up values in a few ways:\n- Beneficence / non-maleficence: We often recognize this as ‚Äòdo no harm‚Äô.\n- Autonomy: This often gets rephrased as the right to decide or self-determination.\n- Privacy: We often apply this to actions or communications occurring ‚Äòin confidence,‚Äô implying that trust is essential and discretion is required.\n- Justice: Defined as ‚Äòright and wrong‚Äô or what‚Äôs perceived as fair.\n- Sanctity of life / physical safety: Literally, the right to exist in an environment that doesn‚Äôt harm the person.\n- Integrity / honesty: Ensuring that claims are represented fairly and truthfully.\nVarious industries may group or catalogue values in different ways. These values may overlap or run into contradictions, such as feelings about the death penalty (sanctity of life vs. justice vs. beneficence). As humans, we form our opinions through our values.\nEthics are philosophy\nThroughout the history of the world, philosophers have attempted to understand humanity and the world. The latter branch was considered ‚Äònatural philosophy,‚Äô which evolved into what we recognize as science. The former encompasses subjects like law and ethics, in addition to its look into rhetorical skills.\nScience and philosophy remain heavily intertwined. Often, a new breakthrough proves we can, with the next question being should we? These innovations not only change something about the world, they in turn shape us, our culture, and the realities we experience.\nData ethics in practice\nBoth ethics and philosophy provide a process for looking into potential value conflicts. For example, many societies value a level of privacy. As we find more ways to use data for potential benefit, this value runs headfirst into privacy concerns. How much is too much? Who can control this collection? Regulations like GDPR attempt to resolve this, but ethics provide much needed insight.\nNumerous ethical review tools exist. As an interpreter, I used Demand-Control Schema extensively for decisions that required an immediate response. In data, we often have more time to make a decision. Using common principles, an ethical review process for anyone involved in data could look like the below diagram:\n- Ambiguity: When we encounter a conflict, something may not sit quite right, like a request. It may be unclear what exactly is the issue, so using our categories of values helps us see what‚Äôs involved.\n- Defining: Having a standard list of values helps us tick through the boxes to identity the issue. Most dilemmas are triggered when two or more values are at odds with each other, such as privacy and autonomy, or justice and beneficence, when we look at data collection, ownership, and data-driven decision-making.\n- Analyzing: Once we‚Äôve identified the issues, we‚Äôll have an easier time finding a solution. In this stage, we‚Äôll brainstorm several, even those that may not be practical. Do we provide ways to opt out or highlight weaknesses in data? Do we push for more clarity?\n- Reviewing: A list of solutions in hand, we may seek counsel from others to find what‚Äôs practical to implement, what hasn‚Äôt been considered, and what works best within our organization. We may need someone else to determine the action.\n- Deciding: This is where we put our solution into play. We also monitor it and adapt as necessary.\n- Data collection: When collecting personal data, do individuals know what I‚Äôm collecting, to what level of detail, and what their controls are? Can someone opt out or limit the detail?\n- Data governance: Consider who owns the data. If it‚Äôs public information, do I make it appropriately accessible while protecting identities enough? Am I transparent enough about the origins of this data and its limitations?\n- Data sharing: Consider biases and whether or not facts are being presented clearly. Are filters clearly identifiable and are wise choices avoiding perpetuating bias (such as color choices)? Is this visualization appropriately accessible to the intended audience? Can the audience trace back the data to understand what is and is not shown?\n- Data decision-making: Consider how you‚Äôre presenting the data. Are the limits of the data understood and does it fit the question? Is the presentation of it deceptive?\nThe practice of ethics helps practitioners step back and evaluate a situation from an ethical lens. The resulting action could be shaped by corporate values or a professional code of ethics. But above all, data ethics are designed to act as speed bumps in our work, so we understand how to face dilemmas both personally and professionally.\nLearn more about recent headlines on data ethics and the impact of these concerns on the modern business model during Bridget's Tableau Conference session, Data ethics | From headlines to headway.

The device could identify when a car was undergoing an emissions test and would activate a change that reduced the vehicle‚Äôs emissions. Upon completing the emissions test, vehicles would return to ‚Äúnormal mode‚Äù and continue polluting at their regular levels. With the help of this device, VW deceived regulators by misrepresenting the amount of CO2 their cars emitted into our air.\nIn September 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) caught on. They discovered approximately 482,000 vehicles in the U.S. that VW had fitted with the ‚Äúdefeat device,‚Äù although VW later admitted that nearly 11 million cars worldwide contained the device. Put plainly, VW lied to consumers and regulators about how harmful their cars were for our air, our health and our environment. Their answer: ‚ÄúWe totally screwed up.‚Äù\nIn 2016, the EPA and VW agreed to a $14.7 billion settlement. Approximately $10 billion was set aside for VW to buy back or repair their vehicles. Another $4.7 billion was set aside for mitigation, including $2.7 billion for an ‚ÄúEnvironmental Mitigation Trust Fund.‚Äù This fund is specifically designated for states to implement projects that reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and initiatives that replace diesel fueled vehicles with cleaner, safer alternatives. Each state‚Äôs share of the fund will vary, based on the number of vehicles sold in that state. Arizona, for example, anticipates receiving $57 million while New York is expected to receive $127 million. Regardless, states across the country are putting together plans for allocating this money.\nChispa, a Latino organizing program of the League of Conservation Voters, is organizing with communities and partners across the country, urging states to invest this money in clean, zero-emission electric school buses that will benefit our kids and help clean up the air in our communities.\nClean Buses for Healthy Ni√±os\nChispa launched the Clean Buses for Healthy Ni√±os campaign to get clean, zero-emissions electric school buses for kids across the country. Chispa programs in Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland, and Nevada first launched the hyperlocal campaign in April 2016 in their states, and it quickly expanded to New Mexico and New York with state partners. In September 2017, two years after VW was caught in the middle of the scandal, Chispa and over a dozen partners began mounting a national campaign to pressure all state governors to take action.\nNow, all across the country, Clean Buses for Healthy Ni√±os is calling on governors and state decision-makers to clean up our air by using their state‚Äôs VW Mitigation Trust Fund to invest in clean, zero-emission electric school buses.\nThe Dangers of Pollution\nDiesel vehicles, including school buses, emit dangerous pollutants like NOx into our air, which we then breathe into our lungs. NOx can act as an irritant gas and pollutant and is linked to various respiratory conditions as well as negative environmental effects. It is especially harmful to kids with developing lungs, as these pollutants can cause respiratory illnesses, aggravate asthma and expose kids to cancer-causing toxins.\nAcross the country, our kids and communities are breathing dirty air. Cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and New York consistently rank as some of the most polluted cities in the U.S. Furthermore, more than 125 million people in the U.S. live in counties with unhealthy levels of pollution. With pollution like this, it‚Äôs no wonder that so many people in our communities suffer from asthma. In fact, nearly 26 million people across this country suffer from asthma, including more than 7 million children. And that number is rising.\nAsthma leads to millions of lost work and school days as well as hospitalization, particularly among children. It also means increased medical costs for parents, less play time for kids, and emotional toil for families who must grapple with this deadly dangerous respiratory illness. This is even more true for low-income and communities of color where students and families are most at risk of breathing dirty air, and are disproportionately suffering from pollution.\nWhy Electric School Buses?\nClean, zero-emissions electric school buses will do more than clean up our air. These buses will serve as a long-term beneficial investment for public transportation and infrastructure. Although electric buses may cost more up front, they cost less to maintain over their entire lifetime, and each bus can save nearly $11,000 per year at the pump when compared to their diesel counterparts.\nElectric school buses will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily CO2 and NOx, by almost 80 percent. Replacing just one diesel school bus with an electric bus is the equivalent to taking 27 cars off the road. With fewer diesel emissions, kids and communities won‚Äôt be forced to breathe toxic pollutants that aggravate or increase incidents of respiratory illness. It will also be a big step in the right direction in the fight against climate change.\nWe all have a right to breathe clean air, and by working together we can make this a reality. Join the #CleanRide4Kids movement and make your voice heard today by signing the petition to your governor.\nWith your help, kids and communities can breathe easier, and we can have cleaner air and zero-emission buses now!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bc1f3fef-28c4-43aa-aea4-85ef6ea0c4db>","<urn:uuid:704c9828-c824-4303-ac6a-2e704806d920>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do seasonal changes impact orchid watering frequency, and what are the recommended watering methods for different humidity conditions?","answer":"Seasonal changes significantly affect orchid watering frequency - in summers, watering should be done once daily, while in winters it can be reduced to once weekly. Humidity levels vary by season, with high humidity requiring less watering, especially for epiphytes that can absorb atmospheric moisture. There are several watering methods available: spraying with a water-can (avoiding wetting leaves and flowers), drip watering (one drop at a time), dunking (submerging in water), and pouring. The dunking method should be avoided in high-humidity areas due to risk of rot and fungal attacks. For drier climates, daily misting or using a humidity tray with pebbles can help maintain proper moisture levels.","context":["Just as my water needs are different from yours, similarly each orchid species has its own particular water requirements. But, how do you decide the water needs of different orchids? This is done either by hit and trial method or by judging the water needs through a series of steps. Let me discuss this in this article. Water requirements of a plant are normally decided by the morphology of the plant as well as the native ecology of the surrounding where the plant grows.\nSteps to judge the water requirements:\n1. Morphology: Many orchids have water storage organs such as pseudobulbs and succulent leaves. Orchids possessing such storage organs require less water, as the stored water also gets utilized when the growth medium becomes dry.\n2. Growth habit: Epiphyte orchids are adapted to surviving on very little water, unlike terrestrial orchids. Epiphytic orchids get their water supply from rain, and rest of the time they face drought like situation on the tree branches. The terrestrial orchids compete with other plants including the big trees when absorbing ground water. So both epiphytes and terrestrial orchids make do with least amount of water even when they are growing in rain-fed forests.\n3. Type of growth medium used: Water requirements need to be adjusted according to the growth medium being used. A medium which can absorb and retain water needs lesser amount of watering than a more porous medium. Medium like peat should not be allowed to dry completely as it will take a long time to re-absorb water. Top of the growth medium consisting of moss can appear dry while still holding some water at the base. Sand and mud mixtures will hold more water than moss, peat or tree bark.\n4. Time of the year: In summers watering should be more frequent than winters. Optimum watering in summers is once daily and in winters it can be reduced to once in a week. Humidity levels keep changing according to different seasons. High humidity means less amount of watering, especially in the case of epiphytes which can absorb water for air. Low humidity means more watering.\n5. Location where the orchid is placed: How and where the orchid is placed also affects the watering need of the orchid. A place where there is more evaporation will require more frequent watering. Orchids placed in an area with high air circulation will dry up at a faster pace.\n6. Methods of watering orchids\na) Spraying: By this method the orchids are sprayed with water using a water-can. Water logging can be avoided by this method of watering. But when spraying water try not to wet the leaves, flowers or the pods.\nb) Drip watering: By this method the orchid gets water one drop at a time. Though there is no question of water logging, but there is a danger of water not reaching each part of the plant. So, the dripping water has to be carefully arranged so that the water spreads evenly at the base.\nc) Dunking: In this the orchid is dunked in a bucketful of water and is left in it for some time. This method should be avoided in areas having high humidity, as the wet aerial parts of the orchid can rot and are easy prey to fungus and bacterial attacks.\nd) Pouring: Pouring water individually in each pot and basket can be bit tedious. But if done properly, by pouring just the required amount of water at the base, a number of water related problems can be avoided.\n7. Precautions: Some orchid should never be allowed to completely dry, especially if the humidity is low. Before watering the orchid remember to check the base of the medium which can be still wet while the surface may appear dry. If the pots are placed in a tray containing water, the tray should contain some gravel. The pot should be placed on this and the water level should be lower the base of the pot.","Phalaenopsis orchid in Singapore Botanic Garden mist house.\nimage by Javier Martin/commons.wikimedia.org\nThe huge plant family orchidaceae contains more than 100,000 cultivars and hybrids of orchids with varying environmental requirements. You can successfully care for your orchid plant at home by providing a suitable growing medium, appropriate light level, watering regimen, ambient humidity and feeding schedule. Mastering a few basic concepts of orchid care can help you navigate the needs of most orchid species that are in wide commercial distribution.\nProvide your epiphytic orchid such as a phalaenopsis or dendrobium with a coarse and fast-draining growing medium such as a bagged commercial orchid bark containing very coarse shards of bark, charcoal and vermiculite. Give your terrestrial orchids such as paphiopedalums and calanthes a finer grade bagged orchid mix with shredded bark, peat moss and some soil. Epiphytic orchids mainly derive nutrients and moisture from the surrounding air while terrestrial orchids mainly derive nutrients from a planting substrate. All orchids fall into one of these categories and their basic care keys off of this main sensibility.\nWater your orchid regularly by holding it in the sink under a gently flowing faucet. Use room temperature to tepid water only as both hot and cold water can shock or damage the vascular system in the plant. For epiphytic orchids water when the planting medium is dry and the pot feels very light when you lift it up. Depending on your orchid, seasonal climate and growing conditions, this can mean watering every few days to every two weeks. Water your terrestrial orchids when the planting medium feels only very slightly moist and the pot feels somewhat light when lifted. This will likely mean watering every few days or once a week.\nFeed your orchids regularly either at every watering with a very weak fertilizer solution or once a month with a slightly stronger solution. Choose a routine and stick to it to ensure that your orchids are neither overfed or under fertilized as it will either shorten bloom life or delay blooming. Dilute commercial orchid food or other high-nitrogen water-soluble fertilizer in tepid water. Use one-quarter the recommended dose for weekly feeding and three-quarters to a full dose for monthly feeding. Pour the diluted fertilizer solution over the bark, stem and roots, saturating the pot while keeping the leaves dry.\nIncrease the ambient humidity around your orchid by misting the stem, roots and planting medium daily with clean water. In drier climates or where daily misting seems more hassle than maintenance joy, create a humidity tray to passively raise the ambient humidity around the plant. Fill a tray, saucer or shallow bowl with small pebbles and water. Set the pot on top of the pebbles but not touching the water. Refill the water to the lip as it evaporates. All orchids will benefit from boosted humidity.\nLocate your orchid plant so that it consistently receives bright indirect light. This is the default preference for most orchid species. When your orchid is in bloom you can safely place it in a more dimly lit location for two to four weeks to extend the life of the bloom. Some direct morning and afternoon sun can be good for the plant and will help it to bloom. You must, however, keep it out of direct midday sun as the leaves can easily scorch and cause the roots and medium to dry out. When the orchid receives direct sun water uptake will increase a bit so adjust accordingly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7bbc819e-75de-4ccf-b0fa-4be7e243072e>","<urn:uuid:b50efe64-c1f4-4eca-b5a2-f5b6f5468355>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was the budget for History Channel's 'The Bible' miniseries that aired in 2013?","answer":"The Bible miniseries was a $22 million project produced for the History Channel.","context":["POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Mar 03, 2013\nFor as long as there has been filmed entertainment, there have been producers and directors retelling the dramatic stories from the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments. But the cable channel History's coming 10-hour miniseries, \"The Bible,\" might be the first to include an angel skilled in Chinese martial arts.\nThat angel, fighting an angry mob during the destruction of the city of Sodom ‚Äî and an effort by the producers to make the program racially inclusive ‚Äî pops up in the first episode of the five-week series, a $22 million project to bring the Bible to life for a new generation. It begins today and ends on Easter.\n\"The Bible\" premieres at 6 p.m. today on the History Channel.\nThe producers know their angels (there are five throughout the program, along with a black-hooded satanic specter who often hovers in the background). The miniseries, to be rerun Mondays on Lifetime, has as executive producers the husband-and-wife team of Roma Downey, a star of the 1994-2003 CBS series \"Touched by an Angel,\" and Mark Burnett, in his first foray outside of the reality genre he helped popularize with CBS' \"Survivor.\"\nThe program came about after Burnett's company was pitched a Bible documentary that he found sensationalized and Downey countered that they should make what she, in a joint interview in Manhattan, called \"the grand sweeping embrace, the love story that is the Bible.\" Referring to Burnett's expertise at marshaling massive productions in remote lands and her own experience with actors, she said, \"We could handle the scale and the intimacy.\"\nSeveral networks made offers, Burnett said. \"It was clearly a very big idea,\" said Nancy Dubuc, president for entertainment and media at A&E Networks, parent of History and Lifetime. Of Burnett ‚Äî whose credits include \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Voice\" ‚Äî Dubuc added, \"We take very seriously when a producer or a storyteller of his magnitude is incredibly passionate about something. They tend to give it their all.\"\nWhat the producers delivered was historical drama with an emotional focus and digital effects that dramatize stories of Moses' parting of the Red Sea, Daniel in the lion's den and Jesus walking on water. Shooting last year over six months in Morocco, the producers put a particular emphasis on details, down to the dust. \"Something we knew we did not want to do is make a donkey-and-sandal movie for your grandmother,\" Downey said. The international cast includes Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado as Jesus, Francis Magee (\"King of Thrones\") as Saul and Downey as Mary.\nThe program abounds with bloody swordfights, beheadings and lashings. \"It is a violent story,\" Dubuc said, referring to the Bible. \"When you have to illustrate it, that's pretty gnarly stuff.\" Ten ways to open the series were considered before the production team settled on a scene inside Noah's storm-tossed ark, as he tells the Genesis creation story to his scared children. The ark scene is not found in the Bible, but the writers contend it could have happened, given oral histories of the time. That dramatic license infuses the 10 hours. The 23rd Psalm is worked into the script when David recites it as he and his slingshot take down Goliath. (Many historians credit the psalm to him but debate when he wrote it.) Pontius Pilate's wife appears in several scenes even though the figure has just one sentence in the New Testament.\nMore dramatic poetic license has been a staple of Bible movies from the beginning, starting with Cecil B. DeMille's silent \"King of Kings,\" which rendered Mary Magdalene as a wealthy courtesan, J. Stephen Lang, author of the 2007 book \"The Bible on the Big Screen,\" said in a telephone interview. Conversely, Lang said, important Bible figures like Paul have been relatively overlooked because \"there is no romance there.\"\nThe producers' initial challenge was finding a narrative and choosing from dozens of Bible stories. They settled on fewer stories, Burnett said, to go \"longer and deeper\" into others; Joseph and his colorful coat ‚Äî which Lang said is the fourth most popular subject of Bible movies, behind Jesus, David and John the Baptist ‚Äî got left on the cutting room floor, to their regret. What unites the stories, Downey said, is a repetition of human failings and \"people striving to get back to a connection to God.\"\n<t$>The network and the producers disagree on the program's religious underpinnings. \"I don't see this as a Christian production,\" Dubuc said. \"We are a global brand, and we appeal to all walks of life and beliefs.\" Among the notes the <t-3>network gave during production, she said, was that \"this is not a piece of conversion.\"\nDubuc said, \"This is an epic drama that's endeavoring to tell the literal ‚Äî as literal as we could be given our production constraints ‚Äî translation of this book that has shaped the world and the people who live in it.\"\nDowney said she believes people of all faiths will enjoy the program. But, Burnett said, \"the meta-narrative of the Bible, the through-line, is the Messiah does come.\" To exclude the New Testament, he added, \"is cheating the Bible.\"\nAdvisers including Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Los Angeles; and Bishop T.D. Jakes of the Potter's House, a megachurch in Dallas, are helping publicize the broadcast. Curriculum tools for churches, many of which are organizing viewing parties, are part of an extensive website from Christian marketing firm Outreach. In a video on the site, Burnett cites the series' potential \"to reach not only those who already go to church, but to reach a whole new generation of people, people who have never been to church.\"\nA shortened theatrical movie, focused on Jesus' baptism through Revelation, will be released for arenas and theaters; there is a CD of the score by the Oscar-winning film composer Hans Zimmer (\"Gladiator\").\nIn addition to a book of 100 inspirations, there are Spanish- and English-language companion books for adults and young adults.\nDowney said the producers hope to drive viewers back to the original source, the Bible. The books, however, are not Bibles, but a novelization of the stories in the script."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2d27756d-2ca9-422c-92c2-8df1afa3aea1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the height requirement for wind turbines compare to the solar panels in Charanka in terms of land use efficiency?","answer":"Wind turbines require taller installations of at least 42 feet (12.8m) and need to be 20 feet above surrounding objects, while solar panels are ground-mounted installations. However, wind turbines are more land-efficient, requiring about 2.47 acres per MW compared to 4-5 acres per MW for solar installations. This is evidenced by the Charanka solar park which uses 5,384 acres of land, whereas wind power installations can generate equivalent power using less than half that land area.","context":["Why India‚Äôs Solar Push Could Kill The Livelihood Of Pastoral Communities\nThe Charanka solar park is spread over 5,384 acres of land where cows, buffaloes and goats raised by the local maldhari community used to graze. It is now out of bounds for them.\nCharanka, Patan: The parched brown of the land in Charanka village in north-west Gujarat, around 50 km from India‚Äôs border with Pakistan, seemed endless. In peak summer, during one of the worst droughts to hit the region in 30 years, it seems devoid of all life--even doughty bush plants have lost most leaves. Cyclone Vayu, that hit the Gujarat coast in June 2019, did little to revive the district of Patan.\nThis perhaps explains why the official website of the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited describes the 5,384 acres across which the Charanka solar park is spread as ‚Äúunused‚Äù land. A project mapavailable at the park‚Äôs office differs from this assessment--of the 5,417 acres, close to 2,000 acres are under cultivation, it showed. The rest, as per the map, is ‚Äúgovernment land‚Äù.\nThe villagers were livid at these labels. ‚ÄúWhat do they mean that the land is unused and that it belongs to the government?‚Äù asked Raku Ben, a livestock rearer. ‚ÄúWe use it for grazing livestock, and our livelihood depends on this land. It doesn‚Äôt belong to anyone, it belongs to everyone.‚Äù\nThe solar park project launched in December 2010, has been functional since April 2012. It sits on what used to be the pasture for the region‚Äôs livestock herders, called maldharis. They have traditionally never owned the land where their animals graze but it is critical for their livelihood. The maldharis were once a nomadic community but some have opted to settle down.\nThese factors are not reflected in the state‚Äôs latest solar power policy of 2015 or the Gujarat Wind-Solar Hybrid Power Policy of 2018. The words ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù or ‚Äúlivelihoods‚Äù do not figure anywhere in the solar power policy.\nSolar park on the right, reserved forest on the left, there is no place left for the cattle herders to take their animals grazing. Charanka‚Äôs livestock has dwindled since these grazing lands were taken over for the park.\nHaving lost access to the grazing lands, maldharis can no longer rear goats, sheep, cows or buffaloes. And the forest department denies them entry to other fertile patches in the region.\n‚ÄúAs a result, the once self-sustaining and independent community has now been reduced to doing daily-wage labour in either agricultural fields in neighbouring villages or working as cleaners in the solar park,‚Äù said Anu Verma, the focal person in India for the South Asia Pastoralist Alliance, a network that advocates pro-pastoralist policies on commons lands, livestock, food and environment.\nA switch to renewable energy is at the heart of India‚Äôs Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitment made at the Paris Agreement in 2015 which sought to keep global temperature rise under 1.5 deg C. One of the key commitments was to increase electricity generation from renewable sources to 40% of total energy generated in the country by 2030. India‚Äôs solar capacity has grown from 3,744 MWin 2014-15 to 28,181 MW as of March 2019, according to an annual report of the Central Electricity Authority of India.\nThe country, however, is likely to achieve this target a full decade ahead, according to a study by the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a US-based think-tank that analyses governance and energy. The cost of solar power has plummeted to Rs 2.44/kWh--in 2011, before the start of the solar revolution, the cost had reached Rs 12.76/kWh.\nHowever, activists working with indigenous communities feel that the real cost of this power is not being taken into account, despite clear signs of emerging conflict, as IndiaSpend reported in March 2017. Solar energy is one of the most land-intensive sources of power and large tracts of arid and semi-arid are being covered by solar panels.\n‚ÄúReview of existing literature suggests that the average land requirement per MW of solar power installed capacity is in the range of 4-5 acres while the average land requirement for 1 MW of wind power is around 1 Ha (or 2.47 acres),‚Äù said a draft report by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). ‚ÄúHence, the opportunity cost of land is estimated in terms of (agricultural income/acre) / (installed capacity/acre), i.e. (Rs/Acre)/(MW/Acre).‚Äù\nGrasslands or not: the debate\nVillagers allege that the solar parks encroach on their grassland but officials of the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL) denied this. ‚ÄúGPCL follows prevailing rules, acts and regulation of land acquisition act in the state for solar park land,‚Äù said Rajendra Mistry, GPCL‚Äôs chief project officer and information officer. ‚ÄúAs far as the Charanka solar project is concerned, GPCL has not taken gauchar land (grassland) for the park.‚Äù\nThere are two types of government land as per revenue records--government wasteland and grassland, Mistry pointed out. ‚ÄúGPCL has (only) taken government wasteland,‚Äù he said.\nA maldhari takes his buffaloes grazing. The transmission lines in the background rise from the Charanka solar park.\nWhile the economic cost of land acquisition is being calculated for compensations to land-owning farmers, livelihood loss is being ignored, activists said. The draft report makes no mention of the social costs of generating renewable energy.\nSolar parks do not need environmental impact assessments (EIA) before being commissioned, said the environment ministry in an August 2017 note. ‚ÄúMOEF&CC (Ministry of environment, forests & climate change) have clarified that the provision of EIA Notification, 2006 is not applicable to solar PV (photovoltaic) power projects,‚Äù said the office memorandum, adding that the disposal of PV cells will attract provisions of the Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Trans-Boundary Movement) Rules, 2016.\nThe memorandum also added that the development of solar parks will attract provisions under the Water Act, 1974 and Air Act, 1981, both focussed on pollution.\nThe long-term impact of cutting off sunlight and rain from the land on which solar parks stand needs to be studied, and considered before large parks are commissioned, said experts. ‚ÄúThere has been a large increase in solar parks around the world, which has led to significant land-use change,‚Äù said a report commissioned by the European Commission that looked into the impact of solar parks on microclimate and plant-soil processes. ‚ÄúHowever, the ecological implications of the land-use change caused by solar parks are poorly understood.‚Äù\nThe study showed up significant impact of solar projects on microclimate. ‚ÄúFrom spring to autumn, for example, soil under the panels was up to 5.2oC cooler, on average, than soil in the gap and control plots,‚Äù said the study. ‚ÄúLower soil temperatures are likely to affect many important plant‚Äìsoil processes, including productivity and decomposition.‚Äù\nThe study also found less moisture in the air below panels, meaning low evaporation of water from plants and thus, lower photosynthesis rates and fewer plants. But in hot regions these panels could boost plant growth. ‚ÄúLess solar radiation (which can stress plants) under panels in sunny regions, such as the European Mediterranean, could actually boost plant growth, for instance,‚Äù said the study.\nForced to take on paltry jobs\nVillagers have taken on low-paying jobs at the park--cleaning panels, cutting grass and laying cables. ‚ÄúThis pays us Rs 200 a day, but we never get more than three days of work in a month and during rains, even less,‚Äù said Neeru Ben, a cattle herder.\n‚ÄúTen years ago, each of the hundred families in the village had at least 350 sheep and the whole village had around 1,200 cows,‚Äù recalls Neeru Ben, a herder. ‚ÄúNow only 20 families have livestock. I have seen my own sheep die of hunger because there are no grazing lands.‚Äù\nThese changes have caused distress in the region, according to activists. ‚ÄúIn my interactions with the villagers, it is very clear that their self-esteem and their sense of identity has taken a hit since the solar park came up,‚Äù said Verma of the South Asia Pastoralist Alliance.\nThe project has also taken up nearly 2,000 acres of cultivated land around Charanka. While landowners got between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh per acre as compensation, the rest got nothing. ‚ÄúWe are forced to travel to neighbouring villages because we can‚Äôt find work as agricultural labourers in our village,‚Äù Neeru Ben added.\nThe current government has systematically broken down all safeguards that protect the rights of local communities, alleged Lalji Desai, the national head of the Congress Sevadal, the grassroot organisation of Indian National Congress, a farm leader and maldhari himself. This is especially true of those who do not have direct land ownership but have been its traditional custodians, he added.\n‚ÄòState rule on grazing lands not followed‚Äô\n‚ÄúEven according to the policies of the state government of Gujarat, at least 40 acres need to be demarcated for every 100 animals that pastorals own but this rule has not been followed,‚Äù said Desai. ‚ÄúApart from this, the government also needs the consent of 70% of landowners before acquiring them, according to LARR (Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013).‚Äù\nMaldharis were once nomadic livestock herders. Some are now opting to settle down.\nThe livestock count has fallen in Charanka. ‚ÄúTen years back, each of the hundred families in the village had at least 350 sheep and the whole village had around 1,200 cows,‚Äù recalled Neeru Ben. ‚ÄúNow only 20 families have livestock. I have seen my own sheep die of hunger because there are no grazing lands.‚Äù\nFodder is available at Rs 22/kg in the market but the villagers cannot afford it. ‚ÄúEach cow needs at least 12 kg of fodder everyday,‚Äù said Neeru Ben. ‚ÄúHow can we afford this?‚Äù\nBefore the solar park came, the then chief minister of the state, Narendra Modi visited Charanka in 2011 for the stone-laying ceremony. Villagers alleged that they were forcibly kept out of the event. ‚ÄúIronically, the police only allowed people from neighbouring villages to attend the programme,‚Äù said Janu Ben, a cattle herder. ‚ÄúI somehow got in. He (Modi) promised us free water, electricity and even a hospital. None of these promises have been fulfilled to this day.‚Äù\nStuck for a solution\nAt an average of five acres of land needed for every MW of solar energy, some 140,000 acres (570 sq km) of land are already under solar panels across the country. If India is to meet its solar target of 100 GW by 2022, which many analysts are sceptical about, nearly 3,00,000 acres (1,214sq km) of land will have to be under panels across India. Of the 100 GW target, 60GW would need to come from large solar parks, and 40 GW from rooftops.\nLand is a state subject, with limited central role, maintained officials of both the MNRE and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a public sector undertaking dedicated to solar energy. ‚ÄúWe will only tie up the land and give it to developers,‚Äù said Praveen Kumar, additional secretary at the MNRE. ‚ÄúWe are not in the business of acquiring or buying it. Whatever the policies the state government has regarding compensation to landless communities, these should be followed.‚Äù\nHe refused to comment on whether the central government can issue guidelines to state governments on the question of compensation for cattle herders who do not own the land they graze animals on.\nSECI officials IndiaSpend spoke to were not sure if there are mechanisms to calculate compensations for those who do not own land or other assets. ‚ÄúEverything involves money,‚Äù said Sanjay Kumar, general manager contract and procurement at SECI. ‚ÄúIf it (compensation to communities who do not own land) is not a part of any policy or not mandated, we cannot spend any amount (on compensation). It should be arrived at by the state government.‚Äù\nThe most SECI can do is to inform the MNRE of Charanka villagers‚Äô problem or propose a solution. ‚Äú(But) I don‚Äôt know whether the central government will be able to enforce this: The state should own that responsibility,‚Äù he said.\nIn 2011, following a Supreme Court order, the then state development commissioner had put out a circular instructing that all encroachments on the grasslands be removed.\nLand use factor cannot be ignored: activists\nNot taking into account various aspects of land--especially its importance in historical and political struggles--is a blinkered view, said land conflict experts. ‚ÄúNot recognising land for its occupational use, ecological importance and cultural significance is a deliberate attempt to categorise them as wastelands, giving the impression that these are empty spaces than can be easily transferred for government use or for private sector projects,‚Äù said Kanchi Kohli, researcher at the Centre For Policy Research, a public policy think-tank based in New Delhi.\n‚ÄúThe Solar Project Developer shall be responsible for obtaining the land for setting up and operating solar power project,‚Äù said the Gujarat Solar Power Policy 2015. Laws like the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013 recognise the importance of grasslands for pastoral communities.\n‚ÄúHowever, they can be applied only when the land‚Äôs uses and importance is recognised,‚Äù said Kohli.\nExperts working on just transition to renewable energy believe that specific laws are needed to protect these communities. ‚ÄúThe rate at which these projects are operating, the real ecological cost and the opportunity cost that others are paying (for them) are not being accounted for,‚Äù said Harjeet Singh, global climate lead at ActionAid. ‚ÄúThe solar and renewable energy revolution has just started and we should not allow it to go without proper scrutiny and later realise its real costs to both the environment and the people.‚Äù\nFirst published by IndiaSpend on 5 Aug. 2019","This guide can help you decide if a residential scale wind turbine is right for you.\nIs Wind Right for you? Wind turbines are an effective source of renewable energy in many areas across the world. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) estimates there are as many as 13 million homes in the United States with a viable wind resource.\nTo make sure a small wind system is right for you, there things to consider:\n- You have at least 6.0 MPH (2.7 m/s) average wind speed for the Polaris 50, 100, 500 and 1000kW turbines. Best results at 12 MPH (5.4 m/s) or more.\n- The ideal location for a wind turbine is 20‚Äô (6.1m) above any surrounding object (trees, roof tops, hills, tall buildings) within a 250 foot (76.2m) radius. This generally means your property should be at least ¬Ω acre (2,023m2)larger in size.\n- The local zoning allows a structure that is at least 42 feet (12.8m) tall (see ‚ÄúGetting Connected Consumer Guide‚Äù)\n- Your local utility has an existing interconnection agreement (see ‚ÄúGetting Connected Consumer Guide‚Äù)\nOnce you have determined you have the right conditions for a wind system, you will need to consider the best place on your property.Proper siting is critical to the performance and longevity of your investment. It can make the difference between years of trouble free operation or continuous frustration.\nThis guide is a precursor to investing in a small residential scale wind turbine. Whether your reason for investing is because of your concern for the environment, helping reduce foreign fuel imports or pure economics, we at Polaris America want to make sure you get the most from your wind turbine. Before making any investment in small wind, be sure to review this guide carefully, ask lots of questions and once you feel confident, call your dealer.\nDETERMINING YOUR WIND RESOUCE\n‚ÄúDo I have enough wind?‚Äù is often the first and most asked question. Generally, if you feel like you have a very windy site, you most likely have a good place for a wind system. It is always a good idea to do your homework just to make sure. Wind resources can vary from placed to place. There are several places you can go to assist you.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy recently developed a series of high resolution wind maps for much of the United States that will give you a good idea what your wind resource is at your location. Keep in mind, these maps are about 80 percent accurate and estimate the wind resource at about 150 feet (46 m) off the ground.\nWinds decrease the closer they are to the ground. You want to make sure the location of your property on the map is in a Class III wind or better. These maps have a resolution of +/- 1 km (0.7 mile). Click here for our wind maps page.\nYou may also obtain wind data from your local weather station, university or even television station. You may also contact the closest weather, TV or radio station and ask them for an idea of the average wind in your area. Some local station web sites may have this information. Wind patterns can change over short distances, so try to obtain information as close to your potential wind turbine as possible. Airport data is not recommended. Airports are generally located in lower wind areas (valleys) and their measurement techniques do not produce good data.\nIf wind maps or local data doesn‚Äôt work, another method is looking around and observing of the deformation of vegetation and trees on and around your property. The Griggs-Puttnam Index was a scientific study that looked at how wind deformed vegetation to determine the wind resource at a particular site. Compare the drawing below with your own property to determine your wind resource.\nThe Griggs-Putnam Index of Deformity is an additional useful tool to help determine the potential of a wind site. The idea is to observe the area‚Äôs vegetation. A trees shape, especially conifers or evergreens, in often influenced by winds. Strong winds can permanently deform the trees. This dormity in trees is known as ‚Äúflagging.‚Äù Flagging is usually more pronounced for single, isolated trees with some height.\nThe Griggs-Putnam diagram, like the Wind Resource Maps, can offer a rough estimate of the wind in your area. The more information that you can obtain from the various sources listed above, the greater degree of accuracy you will have in determining your wind speed and your potential power output.\nThe last resource is conducting an actual wind resource assessment. This is by far the most accurate way of doing a site assessment but it is also the most expensive and time consuming. It involves the installation of a small tower on your property with 1-2 anemometers and a data collecting logger. Companies offer such hardware and then charge a monthly fee for consolidating the data and generating a report.\nKeep in mind that many Polaris America turbine dealers also perform site assessments.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù site?\nWind resource is not the only consideration when siting. Components such as taller towers and running large amounts of wire‚Äìmore than 500 feet (152 m) from your site‚Äìcan add significant costs to your wind system. You will need to balance energy achieved in the best wind site over the cost of installation to determine the best overall placement of your system.\nA-typical siting Considerations\nWinds may be very turbulent running off a cliff causing wind shears. It is important to site the generator far enough from the cliff to avoid turbulent wind.\nWind compresses as it blows over the top of a hill, increasing the wind speed. With proper placement, you may be able to use a shorter tower. We never recommend anything shorter than 33 feet (10 m). It is important to follow the general rule; that is the tower must be at least 20 feet (6 m) above any surrounding object.\nCoastal or Lakeside\nVery strong prevailing winds typically blow from the ocean. If this is the case, it is very important to install your wind generator as close to the coastline as possible. Trees and taller structures can be down-wind from the wind generator.\nA wind turbine must have a clear shot at the wind to perform efficiently. Turbulence which both reduces performance and ‚Äúworks‚Äù the turbine harder than smooth air is highest close to the ground and diminishes with height. Also, wind speed increases with height above the ground.\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should install a wind turbine on a tower such that it is at least 20 ft above any obstacles within 250 ft. Smaller turbines typically go on shorter towers than larger turbines. A 1 kW turbine is often, for example, installed on a 30-50 ft tower, while a 10 kW turbine will usually need a tower of 60-100 ft. We do not recommend mounting wind turbines to small buildings that people live in because of the inherent problems of turbulence, noise, and vibration.\nThe least expensive tower type is the guyed-lattice tower, such as those commonly used for ham radio antennas or cell phone towers. Smaller guyed towers are sometimes constructed with tubular sections or pipe.\nSelf-supporting towers, either lattice or tubular in construction, take up less room and are more attractive but they are also more expensive. Telephone poles can be used for smaller wind turbines.\nTowers, particularly guyed towers, can be hinged at their base and suitably equipped to allow them to be tilted up or down using a winch or vehicle. This allows all work to be done at ground level.\nSome towers and turbines can be easily erected by the purchaser, while others are best left to trained professionals. Anti-fall devices, consisting of a wire with a latching runner, are available and are highly recommended for any tower that will be climbed.\nAluminum towers should be avoided because they are prone to developing cracks. Towers are usually offered by wind turbine manufacturers and purchasing one from them is the best way to ensure proper compatibility.\nSmall wind turbines do make some noise, but not enough to be found objectionable by most people. A typical residential wind system makes less noise than the average washing machine. Small wind turbines do not interfere with TV reception.\nMost residential-sized wind generators are direct-drive devices with few moving parts. Unlike the utility-scale turbines used in wind farms, they do not have high-speed transmissions. Thus, most of the sound that comes from a residential sized wind turbine is aerodynamic noise caused by the blades passing through the air. The noise level of most modern residential turbines measures close to the ambient noise levels under average wind conditions. It is audible, if you are out of doors and listening for it, but no noisier than your average refrigerator.\nSmall Wind Systems and Public Safety\nSome of the public safety questions asked about small wind turbines concern the structural integrity of the tower, what happens during power outages or icing conditions [cold climates only], and the question of whether the tower represents an ‚Äúattractive nuisance.‚Äù\nHow reliable is the structure?\nThe U.S. has about 15-MW of nameplate capacity of small wind turbines ‚Äì over 2,000 installations ‚Äì with an excellent track record for safety. Following manufacturer specifications for the installation will ensure that the footings are adequate to anchor the structure. A building permit is also required, and the structure must meet local building and safety requirements.\nWhat happens if there is a power outage?\nIn the event of a power outage, small wind systems connected to the utility grid are designed to detect the outage and automatically shut down, so that there is no danger to anyone trying to repair utility lines. Stand-alone systems are connected only to the home‚Äôs electrical service, posing no risk to anyone trying to repair utility lines in the event of a power outage.\nWhat about icing?\nUnlike tree branches, wind turbine blades are designed to withstand a heavy load of ice. And when ice builds up on the blades, they simply don‚Äôt ‚Äúfly‚Äù any more ‚Äì they loose their aerodynamic properties. In fact, an ice-covered rotor will turn so slowly (at only several revolutions per minute) that there is no danger of ice being ‚Äúthrown‚Äù off. Typically, the ice melts and falls ‚Äì straight down ‚Äì to the base of the tower.\nCan people get hurt climbing the tower?\nWindmill towers pose no more of an ‚Äúattractive nuisance‚Äù than any other climbable pole or tower in the neighborhood, including water towers, cell phone towers, etc. Some wind turbine tower designs have no available hand- or footholds so they simply can‚Äôt be climbed. Towers which need to be climbed for repair work can be equipped with devices to prevent falls, and some towers are designed to be lowered so that any maintenance or repair work can be done on the ground.\nDo small turbines interfere with electronic devices?\nModern windmill blades are made of wood, fiberglass, or other composite materials which do not interfere with electronic devices.\nDo small wind turbines need to be lit?\nThe FAA doesn‚Äôt require lights on structures less than 200 feet tall, and prohibits both commercial and small private aircraft pilots from flying lower than 1,000 feet. Pilots cannot drop lower than 500 feet when approaching a runway. The only time a small wind turbine would be affected by FAA regulations is if it were proposed to be sited adjacent to an airport.\nMany common structures that are taller than small wind turbines ‚Äì transmission line poles, for example ‚Äì are not required to be lit.\nHowever, turbine owners may need to alert crop duster pilots to their installations in certain regions.\nInstallation or Mounting\nA general rule of thumb is to install a small wind turbine on a tower with the bottom of the rotor blades at least 20 feet (6 m) above any obstacle that is within 250 feet (76 m) of the tower, 25 feet (7.6 m) to the hub.\nMounting wind turbines on top of homes is not recommended. Larger residential home wind turbines vibrate and transmit noise to the structure on which they are mounted. This vibration can lead to noise and structural problems with the building. Mounting on the rooftop can also expose the generator to excessive turbulence that shortens its life."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a764407f-35b0-443a-bb47-b1994d544229>","<urn:uuid:011837e5-3f02-4e9b-abe1-47af6bbfb8fe>"],"error":null}

In Australia, forced marriage was criminalized in 2013 through the Slavery, Slavery like Conditions and People Trafficking Act, amending the Commonwealth Criminal Code.

In today‚Äôs analysis, Emeritus Professor Gillian Triggs and Laura Vidal of Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand explore the opportunities this presents for creating a more effective response to instances of forced and child marriage. This article is an edited extract of a keynote presentation given at a ‚ÄòGood Conversations‚Äô event hosted by Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand at Melbourne Town Hall on 7 June 2018.\nForced marriage is not a new and emerging practice; Australia has been grappling with this issue for more than two decades. The earliest reported case of forced marriage was in 1994 involving Joelle Mazoud, who at age 15 was taken out of school and overseas to marry a man she had never met and was left abandoned in a loveless and abusive marriage.\nAustralia criminalized forced marriage in the Slavery, Slavery like Conditions and People Trafficking Act 2013 that amended the Commonwealth Criminal Code (1995). The criminal law is just a start. There have been no successful prosecutions since the adoption of a criminal law approach, illustrating the great gulf between the law on the statute books and implementation, a fundamental problem for the protection of all human rights, particularly in Australia.\nSince 2013, there have, however, been multiple legislative, policy and program initiatives to address prevention and intervention for individuals at risk by raising awareness of forced marriage and promoting reporting.\nHindering efforts to end the practice of forced marriage is a lack of accurate data. The true extent remains unknown as there is little available comprehensive data and ‚Äì because it takes place within the context of the family unit ‚Äì is likely to be underreported. The National Children‚Äôs Youth Law Centre reported in 2013-2015 that there were 250 cases of forced marriage and to date, the Australian Federal Police have received over 174 referrals for assistance.\nThe law and criminalization\nIn responding to forced marriage, the law is usually the first step. It is a vital tool to respond to the denial of all fundamental freedoms. Forced marriage is a breach of some of the most basic human rights, long agreed in treaties to which Australia is party ‚Äî the right to personal liberty, to form a family, to non-discriminatory access to education, work and legal justice, not to mention the right to freely and fully consent to marriage.\nThe reality is that forcing a person to marry is often a reflection of gender inequality and relative powerlessness. We need to recognize the strong interrelation of gender-based and domestic violence with forced marriage. We also need a clear child protection response to ensure holistic and comprehensive responses to the issue.\nAustralia has, sensibly, chosen to combine the potential for criminal law prosecutions under the Commonwealth Criminal Code (1995) with civil law procedures such as Airport Watch List Orders and court ordered intervention including maintaining school attendance and mediation. One unhelpful aspect of the criminal law approach, however, is that access to government funded support is dependent upon a referral from the Australian Federal Police. Individuals at risk of forced marriage may fail to report risk and harm because they fear that to work directly with a law enforcement agency may expose members of their family and parents ‚Äì often the perpetrators of the crime ‚Äì to criminal prosecution.\nBeyond the law\nLegal tools and perspectives, while a necessary foundation for responding to forced marriage, are a long way from addressing the cultural context, the power imbalances, social complexities and gender inequality that underpin the practice. We need preventative action at the beginning of the problem, not only at the end, by working closely with families to make informed and alternative choices. While the law sets benchmarks, it is often too limited and too late to prevent the practice and to change the attitudes and behaviours of those facilitating forced marriage.\nIn addition to the legislative amendments in the Commonwealth Criminal Code (1995) in 2013, Australia has recently introduced a Modern Slavery Bill which proposes to adopt the Commonwealth Criminal Code (1995) definition of slavery‚Äîthus including forced marriage. In doing so, it attempts to require businesses to report forced marriage in their supply chain, which while entirely appropriate to forced labour and other forms of slavery and servitude, is entirely inappropriate to situations of forced marriage. For forced marriage, the drafting and debate of the Modern Slavery Bill is an opportunity for Australia to think more deeply about the underlying and complex familial aspects of forced marriage and to provide a preventative focus.\nRealistically, we need move beyond enacting further legislation by working with medical and health services, community groups and schools, who are often in an ideal position to identify and support potential cases of forced marriage.\nSome key questions in Australia‚Äôs response to forced marriage need to be asked:\n1. Is criminalisation and referral through law enforcement the most beneficial and appropriate way to identify and support those experiencing or at risk of forced marriage? Criminalisation can have destructive outcomes for most parties. We need to balance the desired outcomes of deterrence and crime prevention with ensuring safety for those at risk and empowering them to assert their rights.\n2. Is the binary of victim-perpetrator, which a criminal justice approach lends itself to, an accurate way to frame our response? How do we define and identify consent and coercion, particularly in the context of a practice that occurs within the familial and community context? Many victim-survivors say they consent because they are scared of the repercussions if they don‚Äôt. Given the complexity of the issue, a simplistic dichotomy is clearly inadequate.\nWe need a preventative and holistic approach that stretches beyond the law. The law is important as a foundation or benchmark, but it will not, and arguably cannot, provide answers to complex socio-cultural problems.\nResponding within a family violence and child protection framework\nThe phenomenon of forced marriage crosses into multiple service sectors. It is rare for those facing forced marriage to present with only one problem for which they require assistance. We need to look beyond the limited view of Australia‚Äôs anti-slavery provisions and identify how family violence and child protection frameworks lend themselves to practical, victim-centered support options.\nMoreover, we need to understand the causes of forced marriage and take an early intervention and preventative approach, including:\n- Engage in good faith with the community to change attitudes and behaviour\n- De-couple government-funded victim support from the requirement of reporting to the Australian Federal Police\n- Ensure early victim-led intervention to support and, where possible, family preservation\n- Adopt interdisciplinary and coordinated approaches to ensure victim-survivors are provided with safe, confidential access to services\n- Provide education and training\nUltimately the criminal law is too little, too late. We need to focus on prevention to protect the rights and freedoms of those facing forced marriage."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:72099157-1eed-4dfa-98d2-507e72fc7f60>","<urn:uuid:2d3f0507-2c7f-47ba-b341-1a4ef0498dc8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key components of a business risk management process, and what makes mitigation the most commonly used risk management method?","answer":"The business risk management process consists of four key components: identifying risks by analyzing internal and external factors, analyzing risks through creating probability distributions, responding to risk with appropriate strategies, and monitoring risks and opportunities continuously. Mitigation is the most commonly used risk management method because it's the easiest to understand and implement, especially when business risks are unavoidable. It works by limiting either the impact of a risk or the likelihood of it happening - for example, providing good training to sales teams to reduce the risk of poor product demonstrations.","context":["A. understand the main risk management methods; B. identify the risk management methods most suitable in your business.\nThere is always a chance that something will go wrong. The things that might go wrong are called risks, and a wise manager identifies them early enough so that he or she can do something about them. Of course, risk management is an ongoing activity, so you should carry on identifying and recording new risks as they come up.\nTime needed to review this content: 30 MIN\nIdentifying and evaluating the risks is a good starting point; then you need to know how to manage them effectively.\nWhat are the risk management methods and which one should you choose?\nThere are 5 main ways to manage risk: acceptance, avoidance, transference, mitigation or exploitation.\n1. Acceptance Accepting the risk means that while you have identified it and recorded it; you take no action. You simply accept that it might happen and decide to deal with it if it does. This is a good strategy to use for very small risks. It could take a lot of time to put together a risk management strategy so it‚Äôs often a better use of your resources to do nothing for small risks. Risk acceptance is also common in pharmaceutical companies when developing a new drug. The cost of research and development does not outweigh the potential for revenue generated from the sale of the new drug, so the risk is deemed acceptable.\n2. Avoidance You can choose to adapt your plans to avoid the risk. This is a good strategy for when a risk has a potentially large impact on your project. For example, a business could refuse purchasing a building for a new retail location if the risk of the location not generating enough revenue to cover the cost of the building is high. A hospital or small medical practice may avoid performing certain procedures known to carry a high degree of risk to the well-being of the patient. Although avoiding risk is a simple method to manage potential threats to a business, the strategy also results in lost revenue potential.\n3. Transference Transference is a risk management strategy where you transfer the impact and management of the risk to someone else. Risk transfer typically takes place by paying a premium to an insurance company in exchange for protection against substantial financial loss. For example, property insurance can be used to protect a company from the financial losses incurred when damage to a building or other facility takes place. If you are transporting equipment and the van is in an accident, the insurance company will be liable for providing new equipment to replace any that was damaged. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.\n4. Mitigation Mitigating is probably the most commonly used risk management technique, especially when business risks are unavoidable. It‚Äôs also the easiest to understand and the easiest to implement. Mitigation means that you limit the impact of a risk or the likelihood of the risk happening. For example, if you are launching a new product and the sales team has to demonstrate it to customers, there is a risk that the sales team doesn‚Äôt understand the product and can‚Äôt give a good demonstration. As a result, they will make fewer sales and there will be less revenue for the company. A mitigation strategy for this situation would be to provide good training to the sales team. There could still be a chance of not understanding the product well but the impact of the risk will be reduced as the majority of the team will be able to demonstrate the new producteffectively. You can mitigate against the impact, but you can also mitigate against the likelihood of it happening.\n5. Exploitation Acceptance, avoidance, transference and mitigation are great to use when the risk has a negative impact on the project. But what if the risk has a positive impact? For example, the risk that the new product is so popular that we don‚Äôt have enough sales staff to do the demonstrations? That‚Äôs a positive risk ‚Äì something that would have a benefit to the project and the company if it happened. In this case we want to maximize the chance that the risk happens! Exploitation is the risk management strategy to use in these situations. Look for ways to make the risk happen or/ and for ways to increase the impact if it does. For example, you could train another sales person to also give product demonstrations and do some extra marketing, so that the chance that there is lots of interest in the new product is increased, and there are people to do the demonstrations if needed.\nYou‚Äôll probably find yourself using a combination of techniques, choosing the strategies that best suit the risks on your project and the skills of your team.\nProtecting Your Business: Risk Management Planning, Research & Development by: Dr. Christine Taylor Berry, Director of Insurance Studies\nCheck out this short animated story that contains the basics of risk management.\n\"Facing the future of risk - Managing business risk to take opportunities and grow\" by PwCUK\nTIPS AND TRICKS:\nPut a risk management plan in place and you‚Äôll spend less time worrying about your business and more time building it;\nCreate a risk aware culture, discuss your risk management plans with your colleagues/ employees and make sure they are trained on what to do in the event of an emergency;\nConsider a general liability insurance to protect your business but don't solely rely on your insurance.\n- It is not enough to identify potential risks, you need to decide how to manage them; - There are 5 main risk management methods but risk management strategies are different in each business; - Risk avoidance can result in lost revenues; - Risk acceptance is a good strategy for small risks or when potential gains of a risky clearly outweigh the costs; - Mitigation or limiting the impact of a risk is the most commonly used technique.\nTHINK OF SOME ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS\nWhat are the main risk managment methods?\nWhich risk management methods do I apply in my business and why?\nThis project has been funded with support from the European Commission. This website reflects the views only of the author, and the\nCommission cannot be held responsible for any use which may be made of the information contained therein.","What is business risk management?\nBusiness risk management is a subset of risk management that is used to examine and understand the risk occurring due to changes in the processes, systems, or other business operations. A business risk framework identifies, tracks, prioritizes, and addresses risks to minimize adversities from unexpected events. Companies can gain the ability to make more informed risk-based decisions with the help of business risk management plan.\nWith a business risk management plan, businesses can prepare for the unexpected by minimizing risks and extra costs before they happen. By having a risk management plan in place, companies can also save money and make the organization‚Äôs future secure.\nBusiness risk management process\n- Identifying risks ‚Äì Identifying the evolving risks by analyzing internal and external factors that affect the key business objectives.\n- Analyzing risks ‚Äì It includes the standardization and creation of probability distributions of outcomes for each material risk.\n- Responding to risk ‚Äì Once potential risks are identified and analyzed, an appropriate strategy needs to be incorporated to address the risk. This is done either by establishing new processes or eliminating the risk, depending on the type and severity of the risk.\n- Monitoring risk and opportunities ‚Äì The final step in a business risk management process involves continually measuring the risks and opportunities of the business environment. Companies must also keep a check on the performance of different management strategies.\nBusiness risk management challenges and how to overcome them\nSpeed of information\nIn an era where news and information travel faster than wildfire, businesses do not have the luxury of time to undertake decision-making and formulate strategies as a part of business risk management once the news of a risk event is released. In several cases, a single risk event is attached to other unrelated risk events and when combined it may rapidly begin to erode the organization‚Äôs reputation and goodwill. To address such situations, some organizations are working proactively to consider their organization‚Äôs responses and business risk management strategies more robustly and well in advance of an actual event. Having different response playbooks that have business risks management strategies and responses identified in advance helps them to quickly respond to risk issues and diffuse some of the adverse effects on a timely basis.\nComplexity of business\nCyber threats, disruptive innovation, regulatory shifts, and changing social demographics may trigger significant risks for an organization. Furthermore, these risk drivers may be related to or can trigger other risks, adding to the complexity of the business risk management challenge. Despite this, the top management in most companies fail to recognize the value of embracing a more holistic and team-based enterprise-wide approach to risk assessment and mitigation. To overcome such setbacks, some organizations are rethinking how they approach risk identification and assessment to find ways to bring together the collective minds of a number of individuals to think through potential risk drivers explicitly and proactively. This is done based on the perceived benefits of putting several minds to work when identifying and assessing risks. It is essential to have varied perspectives on complex risk issues in order to face the realities of today‚Äôs complex business environment.\nIntegration of risk oversight and strategy\nSome organizations may experience a disconnect between their organization‚Äôs business risk management and strategic planning activities. In many companies, business risk management is viewed as a compliance or regulatory activity. This means that often risk management in organizations are transferred to a lower level, non-strategic position. As a result, the organization‚Äôs business risk management efforts are often inadequately integrated with strategic planning. To address this challenge, rather than starting off by analyzing what drives value for the organization, companies must first understand what risks are on the horizon. By starting the conversation with what is strategically important to the business and then asking what might prevent that from succeeding, business leaders will be able to identify how business risk management can be positioned to provide strategic value."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:de7f5314-57ad-4e2e-a462-312e74fa30a1>","<urn:uuid:70a7e1e4-4d34-4708-8ffc-19683a216447>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¬øQu√© efectos positivos tiene el 'time-out ribbon' para reducir el mal comportamiento en las escuelas? I'm really interested in evidence-based alternatives! ü§î","answer":"The time-out ribbon procedure involves children wearing badges (colored ribbons) that make them eligible for rewards for appropriate behavior. When misbehavior occurs, the badge is removed and the child becomes temporarily ineligible for rewards for 3 minutes. Studies by Foxx and Shapiro showed dramatic reductions in misbehavior when using this non-exclusionary technique.","context":["The recent discussions in the press and the US Congress about seclusion and restraint prompted me to draft these preliminary notes about alternatives that are available to school personnel. Generally, one does not need to resort to putting students in isolation or holding them to the ground.\nSchools that employ evidence-based practices have a wealth of alternatives to physical seclusion or restraint. These methods range from plain, old good teaching to systematic analysis of the functions that misbehaviors serve. In the next few paragraphs, I present laconic descriptions of these.\nThe first is simply good teaching: Rewarding appropriate academic behavior reduces misbehavior. Ayllon and Kandel (1974) showed that awarding points for completing reading assignments with 80% accuracy not only helped with reading but also cut the frequency of behavior problems in half. Not only do students who receive reinforcement for academic learning have fewer behavior problems, but their successes make them feel good about themselves, as documented in the Abt Associates report about Follow Through.\nSchools may also employ evidence-based methods for establishing positive learning climates and preventing problems in the larger context of entire buildings. In schools where the faculty and staff consistently implement an agreed-upon set of procedures for teaching students appropriate behavior in hallways and cafeteria, on buses, and other settings, behavior problems decrease substantially. The US Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports has copious resources about school-wide procedures for preventing the frequnecy and intensity of behavior problems and addressing those that inevitably arise.\nWhen problems arise (as even with good teaching and positive school-wide systems in place, they will arise), educators can employ positive means for managing them. Well-documented methods for reinforcing behaviors that are incompatible with a specific misbehavior are available. For example, Day and colleagues (1988) used differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior to reduce the self-injurious behavior of children with substantial problems.\nIf school personnel must resort to procedures aimed at directly reducing misbehaivor, they can use non-exclusionary techniques such as the ‚Äútime-out ribbon.‚Äù Children wear what amount to badges (different colored ribbons) and whenever they have their badge, they are eligible to receive rewards for appropriate behavior. When misbehavior occurs, a child‚Äôs badge is removed and the child is temporarily (3 min) ineligbible for rewards. Foxx and Shapiro (1978) reported dramatic reductions in misbehavior when they studied the time-out ribbon procedure.\nPerhaps the most potent means for reducing misbehavior is to determine the environmental factors that elicit and support the behavior. There is a wealth of docoumentation showing educators how to apply the method known as functional behavior analyses. These methods, when applied with fidelity, identify the features of children‚Äôs worlds that control the misbehavior and allow adults to modify the environment so that the behavior occurs much less often.\nAbt Associates.

{"question":"What are the key differences between proving a wrongful death case versus defending against an old maritime lien claim?","answer":"In a wrongful death case, plaintiffs must prove that the defendant owed a duty to the victim and that this duty was breached through negligent actions. For maritime lien claims, especially old ones, the defense often relies on the principle of laches, where if someone waits too long to enforce their rights and this delay harms others (such as by losing evidence or witnesses), they may lose those rights. This is particularly relevant when documentation disappears and memories fade over time.","context":["Posted: July 31, 2013 | By: David Weil, Esq.\nStatutes of limitation establish a deadline for pursuing legal action to enforce a claim. For example, in California, a lawsuit for breach of a written contract must be filed within four years, and a suit for breach of a verbal contract must be filed within two years.\nThese statutes exist to prevent a scenario such as our reader has described. Memories fade and supporting documentation disappears over time -- and when people face a deadline for initiating legal action, they are more likely to resolve conflicts while the facts are still fresh in everyone‚Äôs mind.\nUnfortunately, most maritime liens are not subject to any statute of limitations. This may seem odd, but we need to remember that recreational boating operates under a legal framework that was designed for commercial shipping and international trade.\nMaritime liens are not treated uniformly around the world, but generally speaking, a maritime lien against a container ship may be enforced anywhere in the world. A statute that requires a lawsuit to be filed within a certain period of time may be enacted by a particular country, but unless it is a part of an international treaty, it will have little or no effect in other countries.\nSo, there is no statute of limitations that will help our reader in the scenario described here. But there is another tool that is part of the general maritime law of most countries.\n‚ÄúGeneral maritime law‚Äù is a collection of maritime legal precedents that are handed down by courts over many years, and these precedents are often observed internationally --even where no statute or treaty would be relevant to a particular case.\nIn this case, we can look to general maritime law for the legal principle known as ‚Äúlaches.‚Äù The laches principle basically says that if you sit on your rights for a long period of time, and as a consequence of that passage of time other people are somehow harmed by your failure to act, you may lose those rights.\nIn this country, courts typically start a laches analysis by looking at the statute of limitations that would have applied in a non-maritime case, and then they look at the question of whether a party was prejudiced by the passage of time.\nLaches may seem to be a rather vague principle, but it does provide incentive for a lien claimant to move things along -- and it is very relevant to our reader‚Äôs case. Here, the repairman claims to have entered into a verbal agreement with a boat owner who has passed away, and he has no documentation or paperwork to support his claim. The passage of time has prejudiced the boat owner‚Äôs heirs, because they are unable to obtain any testimony or track down any paperwork that might contradict the repairman‚Äôs claim.\nNotably, in this case, a comparison to the relevant statute of limitations in California would not offer much guidance.\nThe agreement alleged by the repairman called for payment upon sale of the boat, and the boat had not yet sold. He could therefore argue that there was no breach of the agreement, and therefore the clock on the statute of limitations had not yet started to run. But the uncertainty of that provision of the agreement, coupled with the effect that the passage of 20 years had on the ability of both parties to present a case, would point to an effective laches defense, in this case.\nIn the end, a case like this is probably best handled through a compromise. The costs associated with litigating a case like this will be substantial -- and, in the end, those costs would likely exceed the amount of the claim. Regardless, both sides should consult with a qualified maritime attorney before taking this any further.","What is the statute of limitations on filing a wrongful death suit?\nWhat is the California Wrongful Death Statute of Limitations ?

While Bangkok (known to Thai people as Krung Thep) is the capital city with significant cultural importance, Nakhon Ratchasima (meaning 'city of the lion king') has its own historical significance with Sanskrit roots - its name comes from Nakhon (meaning city), Ratcha (meaning King) and Sima (meaning lion).","context":["by James Cooper\nIn the Vedas we have Kamadeva who is known as the God of love and around 600AD in the country known as present day Thailand we had Camadevi, the Queen of Lanna. Camadevi was the daughter of the King of Lobpuri, which was originally Lavapuri, named after the son of Rama. Legend has it there was an ancient sage named Suthep, a Sanskrit name meaning great God, Su being Sanskrit for good or great and Thep, like theo is a corruption of Deva meaning God.\nIn collaboration with the Buddhists, Suthep invited the princess to become their Queen of what is now known as Lomphun, of which she happily obliged. She named her Kingdom Haribhunjaya which means the victorious land of Hari. The inhabitants were known as the Lavas who were country dwellers and the Mons who were more urban, city dwellers. Shortly after being coronated, in true Ayodhya style, she gave birth to twins, of which one would be her successor. Camadevi is a popular figure among the people of Thailand, not just because she was a great Queen and part of the early history of Thailand but also as an icon of female emancipation. Her statue has become a place of devotion and people go to seek her many blessings. Her son, King Mahanadayok built the Chama Devi Wat as a memorial where he stored her ashes, her comb, her mirror and the remains of her favourite elephant.\nAs far as recorded history, this is pretty much the beginnings of ancient Siam now known as present day Thailand. The Thai people apparently migrated from southwest China to southeast Asia over a period of many centuries. They are first mentioned as Siamese in a 12th century A.D. inscription of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, where they are referred to as Syam or dark coloured people. The European sea farers of the 16th century referred to the sea route as the ‚ÄúRoad of Syam‚Äù. Syam is of course the name for Krsna which refers to him as having a complexion like a dark coloured rain cloud. The Thailand people refer to themselves as Muang Thai.\nThe successors to Queen Camadevi are names which are full of Vedic/Sanskrit nomenclature ‚Äì Rudantra ‚Äì Samsara ‚Äì Padumaraj ‚Äì Kusadeva ‚Äì Dasaraj ‚Äì Yuvaraj ‚Äì Vasudeva ‚Äì Ganga, and from 1737 to the present day all the kings are named Rama.

Known as the Ramakien, from Sanskrit Ramakhyana meaning the long epic of Rama. Its influence on Thai culture is impossible to understate, their concept of monarchy is based upon Ramayana, it pervades its literature, sculpture, architecture and handicrafts. In the performing arts there are the Khon, Nang Yai, Nan Talung and various kinds of puppets which perform the Ramakien. And from this comes a whole industry of drama, dance, music, singing, recitation, choreography, costumes, mask making and puppet making.\nThe Ramayana is particularly appealing to Thais as it presents the story of an ideal King who symbolises the age old concepts of virtue or Dhama. The capital of Thailand was once Ayutthaya which is simply a corruption of Ayodhya the kingdom of Rama. It is said that when Ayutthaya was being destroyed by the Burmese, King Takshin, who was busily engaged in fighting and repelling the attack, paused to write down a few episodes of the Ramayana. The Kings who modelled themselves upon Rama were monarchs and even some declared themselves as Avataras, however it was never absolute monarchy. Like Rama himself it was constitutional monarchy and the Kings especially under the influence of the Buddhists had to rule by Dharma and virtue.\nThroughout Thailand there are many folktales associated with Ramayana. In Saraburi there is a mountain with a big hole through one side. The tale tells how Ravana carried Sita in his chariot and while passing he caught the mountain with the axle of his chariot creating a big hole. Both Chonburi and Phatta lung claim to be the place where Bali fought with the buffalo named Dundhubi because the earth around the caves in both places is red like the buffalo‚Äôs blood. In one tale, Rama returned to Ayudhya after the end of the war, wishing to reward Hanuman, Rama shot an arrow and told Hanuman to follow it. The place where the arrow fell would be Hanuman‚Äôs city to rule. The arrow fell upon Lop Buri where the earth turned white because of the heat of the arrow‚Äôs impact. This story explains the white earth which Lop Buri people use for making talcum powder. These are just a few of the many folk tales throughout Thailand which reflects how closely they associate with the story of Rama.\nLAMPHUN ‚Äì Lamphun is the ancient city which was once called Hariphunjaya, Hari a name of Visnu, Phun is Sanskrit Bhumi meaning earth, land, district and Jaya is Sanskrit fot victory ‚Äì The victorious land of Hari ‚Äì YALA ‚Äì Yala in Thailand means net as in fishing net and it comes from the Sanskrit Jala which also means net ‚Äì NAKHON SAWAN ‚Äì Nakhon Sanskrit Nagara for city and Sawan Sanskrit Svarga meaning heaven ‚Äì Heavenly city ‚Äì UTTARADIT ‚Äì Uttara is Sanskrit for north and this reflects its name which is known in Thailand as the northern city ‚Äì MAHASARAKHAM ‚Äì Maha is Sanskrit for great, Sara is Sanskrit for wealth and Kham is Pali for gold ‚Äì The great wealth of gold ‚Äì PATTANI ‚Äì Pattani comes from the Sanskrit Pathini meaning pure woman ‚Äì SONGKHLA ‚Äì Songkhla according to academia is a corruption of Singgora which is Sanskrit for lion city ‚Äì CHAINAT ‚Äì Chai is Sanskrit Jaya meaning victory and the name means victory city ‚Äì SAKON NAKHON ‚Äì Sakon Sanskrit Sakala meaning whole, total and Nakhon Sanskrit Nagara meaning city ‚Äì City of cities ‚Äì PATHUM THANI ‚Äì Pathum is Sanskrit Padma meaning lotus and Thani is Sanskrit Stan meaning city.

Prasat comes from Sanskrit Prasad meaning castle, temple or mercy. The temple complex is situated in Buriram, a province of Thailand. Buri is Sanskrit puri meaning city and Ram means pleasure or happiness ‚Äì The city of happiness. Built upon the rim of an extinct volcano, some 400 metres high, it is built in honour of Lord Siva and mount Kailasa.\nAbove is the Wat Sri Sawai temple, an ancient Hindu temple dating back to the 12th century. As is the usual process it was eventually taken over by the Buddhists as Siam made the transition from Vedic to Buddhist. Wat is a corruption of Sanskrit Vat meaning enclosure, Sri means Goddess, wealth, beauty and Sawai means superior. The three towers represent the guna Avataras Visnu, Brahma and Siva. The temple is situated in the province of Sukhothai whose name means dawn of happiness, Sukho a corruption of Sanskrit Sukha meaning happiness.\nAbove is the Prasat Preah Vihear temple, whose ownership is hotly disputed between Thailand and Cambodia, being built on the border between these two countries. Prasat is Sanskrit prasad meaning castle or temple, Preah is from Sanskrit Priya meaning loved, devoted or by extension sacred, and Vihear is Sanskrit Vihara meaning abode, the people of Thailand call it ‚Äúthe castle of celestial abode‚Äù. Sitting some 2000 ft above sea level it has been built as a representation of mount Meru, the home of the Gods. Like Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Preah Vihear temple has been declared a world heritage site.\nGaruda is the national emblem of Thailand hes called the Phra Khrut Pha ‚Äì Which means ‚ÄúGaruda as the vehicle‚Äù ( of Visnu ). Garuda was officially adopted as the national emblem by Rama VI in 1911. However this Vedic deity has been a symbol of royalty in Thailand for centuries, depicted on seals used by Thai Kings and governments to authenticate documents. The language of Thai is mainly Sanskrit and Pali which is derived from Sanskrit. Over half the words in Thai language are from Sanskrit and Pali, and many scholars agree that the Thai script is old Khmer which is modelled after the Brahmic script of the Indic family. From the 1st century AD to present day Thailand the monetary coins have been inscribed with various Vedic symbols such as conchshells, Dharma wheels, Sanskrit words, swastikas, Lord Sivas Trisula, Srivatsa, chakras, Airavata, ect.\nThe people of Thailand never call their capital city Bangkok, in fact some in remote places have never even heard of the name. Instead the name for the capital of Thailand as accepted by the Thais themselves is Krung Thep which means ‚Äúcity of angels‚Äù. Its full name is ‚Äì\n‚ÄúKrung thep mahanakhon amon rattanakosin mahinthara ayuthaya mahadilok phop noppharat ratchathani burirom udomratchaniwet mahasathan amon piman awatan sathit sakkathattiya witsanukam prasit ‚Äú. Translated into English this means ‚Äì\n‚ÄúThe city of angels, the great city, the residence of the emerald Buddha, the impregnable city of Ayutthaya, of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous royal palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn ‚Äú.\nAltogether that makes 38 out of 77 Thailand provinces which are Vedic/Sanskrit and there are others which are at the least partially Sanskrit such as ‚Äì Kanchanaburi ‚Äì Krabi -Phattalung and Sisaket and the others we dont yet know about.

Thailand's national government organisation is divided into three types: central government (ministries, bureaus and departments), provincial government (provinces and districts) and local government (Bangkok, Pattaya, provincial administrative organisations, etc.).\nA province, as part of the provincial government, is administered by a governor (‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏±‡∏á‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î) who is appointed by the Minister of Interior. Bangkok, as part of the local government, is administered by a corporation called Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The corporation is led by the Governor of Bangkok (‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£) who is directly elected by the citizens of Bangkok.\nThe provinces are named by their original main city, which is not necessarily still the most populous city within the province today. Also, in several provinces the administration has been moved into a new building outside the city.\nMany provinces date back to semi-independent local chiefdoms or kingdoms, which made up the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The provinces were created around a capital city (mueang), and included surrounding villages or satellite towns. The provinces were administered either by a governor, who was appointed by the king or by a local ruling family, who were descendants of the old kings and princes of that area and had been given this privilege by the central king. De facto the king did not have much choice but to choose someone from the local nobility or an economically strong man, as against these local power groups the administration would have become impossible. The governor was not paid by the king, but instead financed himself and his administration by imposing local taxes himself. Every province was required to send an annual tribute to Bangkok.\nThe provinces were divided into four different classes. The first-class were the border provinces. The second-class were those that once had their own princely house. Third-class were provinces that were created by splitting them from other provinces. Fourth-class were provinces near the capital. Additionally tributary states like the principalities of Lan Na, the Laotian kingdoms of Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Cambodia, or the Malay sultanate Kedah were also part of the country, but with more autonomy than the provinces. In this Mandala system the semi-independent countries sometimes were tributary to more than one country.\nNew provinces were created when the population of an area outgrew the administration, but also for political reasons. If a governor became too dominant in a region former satellite cities were elevated to provincial status, as was the case with Maha Sarakham province.\nReforms of the provincial administration started in the 1870s under increased pressure from the colonial states of the United Kingdom and France. Agents were sent, especially to border areas, to impose more control on the provinces or tributary states.\nAt the end of the 19th century King Chulalongkorn reformed the central government. In 1892 the ministry, which previously had many overlapping responsibilities, was reorganized with clear missions as in Western administrations. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab became minister of the Ministry of the North (Mahatthai), originally responsible for the northern administration. When the Ministry of the South (Kalahom) was dissolved in 1894, Prince Damrong became Minister of the Interior, responsible for the provincial administration of the whole country.\nStarting in 1893 the already existing commissionaireships in some parts of the country were renamed \"superintendent commissioner\" (khaluang Thesaphiban), and their area of responsibility was called a monthon. In strategically important areas the monthon were created first, while in other areas the provinces kept their independence a bit longer. Several smaller provinces were reduced in status to an amphoe (district) or even lower to a tambon (sub-district) and included in a neighboring province, sometimes for administrative reasons, but sometimes to remove an uncooperative governor.\nIn some regions rebellions broke out against the new administrative system, usually induced by the local nobility fearing their loss of power. The most notable was the Holy Man Rebellion in 1902 in Isan. It was initially a messianic doomsday sect, but it also attacked government representatives in the northeast. The provincial town Khemarat was even burned by the rebels. After a few months the rebellion was beaten back.\nAfter 1916, the word changwat became common to use for the provinces, partly to distinguish them from the provincial capital city (mueang or amphoe mueang), but also to stress the new administrative structure of the provinces. When Prince Damrong resigned in 1915, the whole country was divided into 19 monthon (including the area around Bangkok, which was under the responsibility of another ministry until 1922), with 72 provinces.\nIn December 1915 King Vajiravudh announced the creation of regions (phak), each administered by a viceroy (upparat), to cover several monthon. Until 1922 four regions were established; however, in 1925 they were dissolved again. At the same time several monthon were merged, in an attempt to streamline administration and reduce costs.\nThe monthons were dissolved when Thailand transformed from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy in 1932, making the provinces the top level administrative division again. Several smaller provinces were also abolished at that time. During World War II, several provinces around Bangkok were merged. These changes were undone after the war. Also the occupied area from French Indochina was organized into four provinces: Phra Tabong, Phibunsongkhram, Nakhon Champasak and Lan Chang. The current province of Sukhothai was at first known as Sawankhalok. It was renamed Sukhothai in 1939 (which is why the railway system goes to Sawankhalok city and not Sukhothai city). The province, Kalasin, was reestablished in 1947 after having been dissolved in 1932.\nIn 1972 Phra Nakhon and Thonburi provinces were merged to form the special administrative area of Bangkok, which combines the tasks of the provinces with that of a municipality, including having an elected governor.\nStarting in the second half of the 20th century some provinces were newly created by splitting them off from bigger provinces. In 1975, Yasothon province was split off from Ubon Ratchathani. In 1977, Phayao province was created from districts formerly part of Chiang Rai. In 1982, Mukdahan was split off from Nakhon Phanom. In 1993 three provinces were created: Sa Kaeo (split from Prachinburi), Nong Bua Lamphu province (split from Udon Thani), and Amnat Charoen (split from Ubon Ratchathani). The newest province is Bueng Kan, which was split off from Nong Khai effective 23 March 2011.\n|Kabin Buri||Kabin Buri||1926||Merged into Prachinburi province|\n|Sukhothai (before 1932)||Sukhothai Thani||1932||Merged into Sawankhalok province.

{"question":"What essential equipment is needed for a basic home recording studio setup, and how should the acoustic treatment be strategically positioned to optimize the recording environment?","answer":"For a basic home studio setup, the essential equipment includes studio headphones ($20-$75 range, like Vic Firth SIH1 or Behringer HPS3000), microphone stands, backup audio cables, cable ties for organization, and pop filters for vocal recording. For acoustic optimization, treatment should be strategically placed in specific locations: acoustic panels should be positioned at reflection points on both sides of the listener, on the ceiling above the listening position, and behind each monitor. Bass traps should be installed in all accessible corners of the room, including wall-to-wall, wall-to-ceiling, or wall-to-floor corners. Speakers should be placed symmetrically along the narrowest wall, directing sound along the room's length, with tweeters at ear level forming an equilateral triangle with the listener.","context":["Having a good recording studio is kind of a double-edged sword these days. On the one hand, it‚Äôs now easier than ever to start your own home studio. On the other hand, obtaining all the good equipment you‚Äôll need doesn‚Äôt always come cheap. From high-powered computers to the latest recording software and preamps, getting started can seem like a pretty steep climb. Of course, if you‚Äôre reading this you might already have some access to this fundamental gear. If not, you‚Äôre probably considering investing in it. No matter what, you‚Äôll have to spend some of your hard-earned cash if you want a worthwhile setup. It‚Äôs not all bleak, though. There are plenty of useful tools every home studio can use, and many of them don‚Äôt cost much at all. Whether you‚Äôre a hobbyist or a burgeoning professional engineer, everyone should have these six cheap studio tools on hand.\n1. Studio headphones\nIt goes without saying that not all studio headphones are ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù In fact, there‚Äôs quite a range of prices for headphones. Some headphones have added features like true noise cancellation, others have deeper bass, and some are built with better quality materials and craftsmanship. Other equipment simply has a recognizable name brand that causes the markup. At the highest end, a really solid pair could run you over $300 USD. Still, if you‚Äôre just getting started with your home studio you can do just fine with a cheaper set of headphones. Of course, the definition of ‚Äúcheap‚Äù differs for everyone. For our purposes, we‚Äôll stick to the range of $20-$75.\nOn the higher end of this range are Vic Firth SIH1 isolation headphones. These are great for recording drums thanks to their noise reduction capabilities. On the lower end of the price range, Behringer HPS3000 headphones offer good quality, longevity, and comfort on the cheap. Again, these two examples of cheap studio tools might not be the pair you use down the road as you expand your studio and skills, but they‚Äôre a great place to start.\n2. Mic stands\nYou can never really have enough mic stands. They come in handy when you least expect it, and more stands mean more options, more control, and more creativity. Weirdly enough, there‚Äôs a wide range of prices for mic stands as well. This is mostly because some stands are sturdier, feature more flexibility, and have additional functionality. But if you‚Äôre not looking for all the bells and whistles, you can pick up some mic stands at a low cost.\nHaving some extra mic stands also opens the door for great studio accessories. If you‚Äôre looking into recording video, whether on a phone, GoPro, or other small camera, you can mount them on these stands with certain other cheap studio tools. These days, smartphone cameras are of such high quality all you need is a phone clamp that connects to a mic stand. Additionally, you can hook up sheet music stands and even cup holders if you really feel the need.\n3. Soundproofing foam\nThis tool can go overlooked but it‚Äôs crucial if you want to get serious about recording. While DAWs often feature plugins that allow for noise reduction, nothing beats recording in a properly soundproofed setting. You‚Äôll get more of the instrument‚Äôs sound and have much more control over mixing it after the fact.\nFortunately, most soundproofing foam isn‚Äôt too expensive. Of course, the bigger your recording space, the more panels you‚Äôll need. Still, a 12 pack of 2x12x12 inch foam wedges on average runs less than 30 bucks. This is enough to cover a significant portion of a wall. You could go even cheaper with 1x12x12 inch panels, but that‚Äôs a matter of budget and preference. If you‚Äôre unsure how to set up these panels, find an expert or do some online research to see what configuration will work best for your studio.\n4. Backup cables\nThe more equipment you get for your studio, the more cables you‚Äôll need. Fortunately, audio cables are typically cheap studio tools. That being said, they can be unpredictable. Since they‚Äôre flexible and used so frequently, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot to wear them out. You should do your best to take care of them by coiling them properly, not running them over, and removing them gently. Still, no one is perfect. Do yourself a favor and stock up and backup cables when you can. It‚Äôs cheaper to buy in bulk than per unit, and having a drawer filled with new, mint-condition audio cables of all kinds will make your life a lot easier. Nothing is worse then halting the recording process due to faulty cables.\n5. Cable ties\nHaving backup cables is great, but even better is having cables that last a long time. The best way to ensure the longevity of audio cables is to keep them organized and untangled. Investing in a ton of cheap cable ties (or zip ties) will make your studio neater, and save you time and money in the end. If you really want to get organized, get different colored cable ties for different cable types and lengths. This way you‚Äôll never have to run around your home studio looking for the right one.\n6. Pop filters\nLastly, get some pop filters. The most expensive one could run you $70, but all you need is a $10 one. If you want to get really cheap and crafty you could even build one yourself with some pantyhose, cardboard, scissors, clamps, and glue. Pop filters are primarily used for vocal recording. They reduce the impact of plosives, the spoken consonant sounds such as ‚Äúp‚Äù and ‚Äúb‚Äù made by cutting airflow then releasing it. With enough compression and careful editing, these plosive sounds can technically be reduced, but it‚Äôs a huge waste of time. Much better to just invest in a cheap pop filter and save yourself the energy.\nThese six cheap studio tools might seem obvious or nothing special, but each can make a big difference. Without them, your recordings just won‚Äôt be as good. Sure, you can spend a fortune on the latest and greatest gear, and there‚Äôs definitely a difference in expensive equipment versus cheaper stuff. But until that‚Äôs viable, nothing is stopping you from starting a decent home studio and building your skills and portfolio.","Acoustic Treatment for the Home Studio\nMake any room sound like a pro studio with the right acoustic treatment.\nThe missing secret that most home recording studio owners neglect is acoustic treatment.\nIt‚Äôs easy to see why.\nAcoustic treatment remains a mystery for so many beginners.\nIt‚Äôs often confused with soundproofing, which is stopping sound getting in or out of the room.\n- What are acoustics?\n- Assess your room\n- Early reflections\n- Absorbing bass frequencies\n- Types of acoustic treatment\n- Acoustic foam\n- Acoustic panels\n- How to make an acoustic panel\n- Bass traps\n- How to make a bass trap\n- Furniture as acoustic treatment\n- Where to place acoustic treatment\n- Working with poor acoustics\nThe sound of a room\nEvery room has its own sound. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve become so accustomed to that we barely notice it until there‚Äôs a big change.\nIt becomes obvious when you shout down a long tunnel, or sing inside a stone cathedral. Each of these environments shape the sound in their own ways, reflecting it back as a blanket of reverb.\nRooms in houses tend to be on the smaller side. They also have their own sound. But the rectangular shape and parallel walls make their acoustic far from ideal.\nDo acoustics matter?\nAcoustic treatment is vital for two purposes:\nWhen you record a vocalist, the mic picks up the direct sound of the singer, as well as the sound of the room.\nThis is because the singer‚Äôs voice bounces off the walls and furniture, arriving at the microphone a few milliseconds after the direct sound.\nThis colours the sound of the voice with the sound of the room you‚Äôre recording in. And you‚Äôre stuck with that sound.\nWith acoustic treatment, you can minimise the sound of the room, and capture the pure sound of the voice.\nThis signal can be processed with artificial reverb to make it sound like it was recorded anywhere. From Notre Dame to Abbey Road studios.\nWhen you‚Äôre listening back to a recording, you‚Äôll hear the direct sound of the monitors, as well as the sound of the room.\nThis is because the speaker‚Äôs signal bounces off the walls and furniture, arriving at your ears a few milliseconds after the direct sound.\nThis means its difficult to hear your mix accurately. And if you can‚Äôt hear accurately, your mixes will be off when you play them back on another system.\nAssess your room\nWalk around the room and clap your hands.\nListen to the sound.\nThe bigger and emptier the room, the more chance you‚Äôll hear a nice reverb. But for most of us, in small boxy rooms, we‚Äôre likely to hear a nasty ringing sound. It‚Äôs the sound of the clap bouncing back and forth between parallel walls. This is called flutter echo.\nThe ideal sound of a room\nLet‚Äôs assume that you plan to do both recording and mixing in the same room. This is how many home recording studios operate today.\nAim for acoustic treatment which eliminates most of the reflections, but doesn‚Äôt leave the room sounding completely dry.\nSo how do you do this?\nBy strategically placing sound absorbing objects in the room. Medium and high frequencies are quite easy to eliminate. But low frequencies are more problematic.\nRoom layout and monitor placement\nBefore acoustic treatment, consider the layout of the room.\nPlace your speakers symmetrically, along the narrowest wall. This will direct the sound along the length of the room.\nThey should be head height, the tweeter (smallest cone) level with your ears. The two monitors should form an equilateral triangle with the listener.\nPicture yourself sitting in a chair, in front of your monitors.\nAs well as directing sound towards you, the speakers are emitting sound in every other direction. The lower the frequency, the less directional the sound.\nMuch of that sound bounces off the walls and ceilings, and back to your ears. It merges with the direct sound from the monitors. If you were in a massive room, you‚Äôd hear an echo instead.\nYou can actually map out the path of the sound as it leaves the speaker, reflects off the wall, and reaches your ears. Sit in your listening position, or sweet spot, and ask a friend to hold a mirror flat against the wall. Let them move it around, until you can see one of your monitors. This is the area to place an acoustic panel.\nThe acoustic panel will absorb the sound from the speaker, rather than reflect it towards you.\nAfter playing around with a mirror, you should have an area on both walls to your sides, as well as the ceiling above. Place an acoustic panel in each of these three areas.\nYou can also place acoustic panels behind each speaker, to help absorb the sound coming from the back of the speaker. A lot of that sound will be low frequency, which needs separate consideration.\nAbsorbing bass frequencies\nThis is the area of sound which causes most problems for home recording studios. The lower the sound, the more difficult it is to absorb. Especially in smaller rooms.\nThis is because low frequency sound waves are long. The lowest note on a bass guitar is around 41 hertz (hz). That‚Äôs a mega 27 foot long sound wave!\nTo absorb these large sound waves, the acoustic panels need to be really deep. There‚Äôs ones made specifically for low frequencies, called bass traps. They‚Äôre placed in the corners of rooms, where bass frequencies congregate.\nDifferent types of acoustic treatment\nDifferent forms of acoustic treatment absorb different frequencies. It‚Äôs important to get a balance for a natural sounding room.\nThe denser and heavier the treatment, the lower the frequency absorbed. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of only using lightweight solutions, such as foam or carpet. This will only absorb the highest frequencies, resulting in a worse sounding room\nMost acoustic treatments use a combination of the following:\nThis is similar to the foam found in furniture.\nIt‚Äôs lightweight, and great for absorbing high frequencies. If thick enough, it can also be effective for medium frequencies.\nAcoustic foam comes in tiles of various sizes and thicknesses. The thicker they are, the lower the frequency they can absorb. 4‚Ä≥ foam is good for sound down to around middle C on a piano.\nAdding an air gap behind the foam will massively increase the effectiveness at lower frequencies. Aim for a gap of between 2 and 4 inches.\n|1 inch (25mm) foam||Effective above 1 khz|\n|2 inch (50mm) foam||Effective above 500 hz|\n|4 inch (100mm) foam||Effective above 250 hz|\nFoam tiles can be flat faced, or have ridged or egg box style profiles. A textured surface helps to absorb more frequencies. But it also means less foam, so not quite as effective as at lower frequencies.\nAcoustic panels are soft rectangular panels used for absorbing medium and high frequencies. They‚Äôre usually made from fiberglass or mineral wool slab, which are denser than foam.\nYou‚Äôll also find them made with foam, but these work more like the acoustic foam tiles. The thicker the panel, the lower the frequency which can be absorbed.\n|2 inch (50mm) mineral wool||Effective above 200 hz|\n|4 inch (100mm) mineral wool||Effective above 100 hz|\nThe acoustic panels can be placed at the main reflection points. Hang them on the wall, preferably with an air gap of a few inches to increase the bass response.\nI also have some acoustic panels on stands, so I can move them around to change the acoustic when recording.\nI love the look of these full size t.akustik foam panels, finished in oak. They won‚Äôt be quite as effective as homemade, mineral wool panels (see below), but should start having an effect at around 350 Hz.\nAs an alternative to acoustic panels, use can use thick acoustic blankets on a rail. Acoustic blankets are heavyweight blankets made with mineral wool. Some blankets come with an absorbent side for sound reduction, and a reflective side for a brighter sound.\nIf you get a clothes rail with wheels, it‚Äôs easy to move them about to suite any recording, or monitoring situation.\nHow to make an acoustic panel\nAcoustic panels can be made with basic DIY skills. Mineral wool is available in semi-rigid 2 x 4 foot (or 600 x 1200mm) slabs. Buy a four pack of around 45kg/m3 density, 4 inch (or 100mm) thick.\nThe slabs are actually fully functioning acoustic panels out of the box. But they‚Äôre delicate and need a frame around them. And they need covering with material because they‚Äôre made of fibers that can irritate your skin.\n1. Build a frame\nBuild a simple wooden frame around the mineral wool slab, using four lengths of 3/8 inch (or 10mm) timber.\nIf you‚Äôre using 2 x 4 foot mineral wool slabs, cut 2 x 2 foot 3/4 inch, and\n2 x 4 foot lengths. Screw the frame together with 2 screws per corner.\n2. Seal the mineral wool\nMix up a solution of 1 part PVA glue, 9 parts water. Put it into a sprayer, and spray the mineral wool surfaces. Do this for the front and the back. This will bond any stray fibers.\n3. Cover frame with material\nChoose a porous material which allows sound waves to pass through. You can check this by making sure you can breath through it.\nCover the front of the frame first, pulling the material tight and stapling it into place on the back of the frame.\n4. Cover back of panel\nCut out some more material for the back panel, and staple or glue it into place on the frame.\nBass traps are extra deep acoustic panels. The extended depth helps to absorb the longer sound waves of low frequencies, which build up in the corners of rooms.\nMany bass traps work as broadband absorbers, meaning they absorb everything from low frequencies to the highest.\nThis makes bass traps the priority acoustic treatment for your home recording studio.\nBass traps should be placed in the corners of your room, where low frequencies collect. Avoid the tiny foam traps from Amazon, as they won‚Äôt have much effect on the bass. There‚Äôs better options, such as these bass traps by t-akustik, which are twice the size. Or take a look at the funky cylindrical Hofa traps, in a range of colours.\nBut for the most effective bass reduction, I recommend making some yourself with mineral wool or fiberglass.\n|8 inch (200mm) mineral wool||Effective above 50 hz|\n|12 inch (300mm) mineral wool||Effective above 25 hz|\nHow to make a bass trap (7 steps)\nFor a simple solution, follow the instructions for making acoustic panels, but make them double the thickness.\nPlace these thick panels in the corners of you room, so there‚Äôs a triangular air gap behind them.\nBut for a more permanent, and elegant solution, you can build full height bass traps into the corners of the room. Use mineral wool of around 45kg/m3 density, 4 inch (100mm) thick.\nEach slab can be neatly cut into 4 triangles, which are stacked to fill the corners.\n1. Measure the corner height\nMeasure the distance between the floor and the ceiling. To see how many mineral wool slabs you‚Äôll need per bass trap:\nIn inches: divide the height by 16.\nIn cm: divide the height by 40.\n2. Cut the mineral wool\nUse a hand saw to cut each mineral wool slab into four equal triangles. Stack them neatly into the corner of the room.\n3. Stack the triangles\nKeep stacking the triangular mineral wool pieces until you‚Äôve reached the ceiling.\n4. Seal the mineral wool\nMix up a solution of 1 part PVA glue, 9 parts water. Put it into a sprayer, and spray the mineral wool surfaces. This will bond any stray fibres.\n5. Make a frame\nMake a wooden frame around the corner so you can attach a fabric cover.\nFor the floor and ceiling, use 1 x 1 inch (25mm) batons. For the walls, use 1 inch triangular beading, either store bought, or by cutting the batons in half. Screw these directly onto the wall.\n6. Make a fabric panel\nUse 1 x 1 inch batons to construct a rectangular wooden frame, the same size as the frame on the wall. Make the height 1/4 inch (6mm) smaller ‚Äì it will be easier to fit.\nStretch breathable fabric over the frame and staple it into place around the back of the frame.\n7. Screw the panel to the frame\nPosition the fabric panel onto the wall frame, and screw into place.\nThe bass trap is ready.\nDiffusers are reflective panels which scatter sound in different directions. They‚Äôre good for controlling reflections without making the room sound too dry.\nYou probably won‚Äôt need diffusers for your home recording studio, as they‚Äôre not that effective in small rooms.\nIn larger rooms, diffusers like this can be placed along the back wall, to scatter late reflections.\nFurniture as acoustic treatment\nEverything piece of furniture contributes to the sound of the room. You can be strategic by arranging the furniture to get the sound you want.\nAn upholstered sofa at the back of the room can work as a sound absorber. The bigger and heavier the sofa, the more effective it will be at lower frequencies. Throw some cushions and a throw over the sofa to increase the absorption.\nHeavy, dense curtains will absorb some medium and high frequencies. Look for a weight of around 1kg per square metre or more. You can double the mass by installing 4 pairs in place of 2.\nRugs and blankets\nThick rugs and heavy wool blankets can soak up high frequency reflections. Bunch them up and hang them from on the wall, with an air gap of a few inches. You can also hang them on a clothes rail and move them around.\nCarpet or rugs on the floor can help tame a reverberant room by absorbing high frequencies.\nDon‚Äôt make the mistake of carpeting every surface of your room. This will only absorb high frequencies. You‚Äôll be left with a dull boxy sound.\nDuvet/comforter vocal area\nYou can use 2 thick comforters to make an improvised vocal recording area. Hang them in the corner of a room with a few inches of space in between.\nThe singer stands close to the mic, with their back to the duvet. This stops reflections from the corner of the room coloring the sound.\nPut shelves or a stylish bookcase at the back of the room. Fill them with your cables, equipment and manuals. This will provide a random surface which will act as a diffuser. It will scatter sound waves in different directions.\nWhere to place acoustic treatment\nEvery room is different and will need its own considerations. But there is a general blueprint for home recording studios which is a good place to start.\n- Place an acoustic panel at the reflection points on either side of the listener\n- Place an acoustic panel at the reflection point above your head on the ceiling\n- Place an acoustic panel, or bass trap (if in corner) behind each monitor\n- Place bass traps in all accessible corners. If there‚Äôs limited wall to wall corners, fit them in wall to ceiling, or wall to floor corners\nWorking with poor acoustics\nIf you‚Äôre working in an area where you can‚Äôt make any improvements to the acoustics, follow these tips:\n- Close miking\nSet the microphone up as close as you can to the vocalist or instrument. This will ensure the maximum amount of direct sound to the mic.\n- Use a dynamic mic\nDynamic microphones are less sensitive than condenser or ribbon mics. Use one to minimise the sound of the room in your recordings\n- Choose suitable monitors\nIn a small or untreated room, it makes no sense to have big monitors. Choose smaller monitors with less bass response and a smooth bass roll off. You‚Äôll get a more accurate representation of what you‚Äôre listening to.\n- Use headphones\nConsider using a pair of quality open backed headphones for mixing. You‚Äôll completely bypass the sound of the room, and hear a new level of detail.\n- Choose a soft room\nSet up in a room which already has soft furnishings, such as a sofa and curtains. Bring in extra clothes, blankets and duvets from other rooms to help absorb the sound.\nThe bottom line\nHowever much time and money you spend on recording equipment, you‚Äôll always be limited by the room you‚Äôre recording in.\nSome basic acoustic treatment, especially in the low frequency range, will result in clearer recordings and accurate mixes.\nAcoustic treatment is the magic ingredient that so many newbies neglect. It really is the missing link for making pro quality recordings.\nThe International Commission for Acoustics (ICA) promotes development and collaboration in all acoustic research, development & education\nAuthor: Daren B\nDaren studied classical piano and composition at Trinity College of Music, at undergraduate and postgraduate level.\nHis music has been performed at the Southbank Centre, Tate Modern, and the Courtauld Institute, and broadcast on BBC Radio 3, Radio 4 and countless TV shows, including The Apprentice, Top Gear and Horizon.\nDaren is a former lecturer on the BA Music Course at Goldsmiths College, University of London.

{"question":"How do the roles of gods differ between ancient Greek epics like the Iliad and early Chinese religious traditions?","answer":"In ancient Greek epics like the Iliad, the gods played a direct and interventionist role, actively participating in human affairs and battles, with mortals being described as pawns in their divine games. The gods had anthropomorphic attributes and engaged in their own duels. In contrast, early Chinese religious traditions showed a transition from the anthropomorphic sky deity Shangdi to a more abstract concept of Heaven (Tian) that was less directly interventionist. While Shangdi was worshipped through sacrifices and rituals in early Chinese history, the concept evolved into a more naturalistic principle of cosmic order focused on harmony between Heaven, Earth, and Man, rather than direct divine interference in human affairs.","context":["Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism (Daoism), all rich and prolific theo-philosophical traditions of the East which thrived in ancient times and still flourish today, were and are much more accepting of the worship of many different deities or aspects of the divine, or in some cases ‚Äì Taoism and Buddhism for example ‚Äì lack the divine anthropomorphic principle to be worshipped at all. They all however do not outlaw idolatry explicitly as a tenet of faith however, and do not establish the worship of one and only one God as a fundamental tenet of their faith, a marked distinction from the religious developments that took place in the West.\nSo although religions of the East represent significant world factions in modern times, over 1 billion followers at least, these belief systems cannot be considered monotheistic in the sense that they do not profess and dictate the worship of a single, exclusive deity at the expense of the worship of all other deities and manifestations of the divine. And perhaps not unrelated, the religions of the East have not been the source of great strife or persecution in the last few thousand years since their inception. Having said that however, there are some monotheistic threads present in the Eastern religious traditions, in albeit not as hard or stubborn a form as their Western counterparts, again based on our working definition of monotheism being the explicit and law based worship of a single deity to the exclusion of all other deities and idols.\nOne of the unique attributes of the Chinese philosophical tradition is its lack of focus on what we would call in the West ‚Äútheological‚Äù concerns, i.e. issues related to how the universe was created (cosmology) and what divine forces if any preside over it. While even in the theo-philosophical systems of Plato and Aristotle we find a rejection of mythology and the realm of the gods as simply matters of faith or speculation, Aristotle‚Äôs prime mover and Plato‚Äôs demiurge, still plays a fundamental metaphysical role in each of their respective philosophical systems, even if they are not front and center so to speak. In the Chinese tradition however, while we see an implicit theological stance per se in the role of Heaven, we do not see it dealt with specifically or directly in the works of the philosophers themselves, outside of an occasional appeal to the divine as a benchmark of world and natural order. In other words, the existence of Heaven is not denied per se but it takes on the form of a more ‚Äúnaturalist‚Äù view as the philosophical systems mature in the classical period.\nBut implicit in all the classical philosophical works from Chinese antiquity is a cosmological belief in the tri-partite universal order based upon the realm of Heaven (TianÂ§©), the realm of Earth (DiÂú∞), and the realm of Man. It could be said that the whole of Chinese philosophy is meant to, and produced for, the establishment of harmony between these three interconnected yet distinct aspects of reality.\nFrom the I Ching (Yijing), the Book of Changes, one of if not the cornerstone Chinese philosophical text from antiquity, the core of which was written and used as a divination text in the 2nd millennium BCE at the latest, is primarily interpreted (cosmologically speaking), as a means to balance and harmonize these worlds given a specific situation or circumstance in fact ‚Äì at least how the work was interpreted by the classical Chinese philosophical tradition in the Ten Wings, the commentary that is tied to the work.\nFrom the Great Commentary, one of the Ten Wings, we find the work described as:\nAs a document, the Yijing is vast and far-ranging, and has everything complete\nwithin it. It contains the way of the heavens, the way of human beings, and the\nway of the earth.\nThe Yijing is seen as a work whose scope is the entire universal world order, a world order that is bound by the world of Heaven, the way of Man, and the way of Earth.\n1 ‚Äì The Book of Changes contains the measure of heaven and earth; therefore it enables us to comprehend the tao of heaven and earth and its order.\n2 ‚Äì Looking upward, we contemplate with its help the signs in the heavens; looking down, we examine the lines of the earth. Thus we come to know the circumstances of the dark and the light. Going back to the beginnings of things and pursuing them to the end, we come to know the lessons of birth and of death. The union seed and power produces all things; the escape of the soul brings about change. Through this we come to know the conditions of outgoing and returning spirits.\n3 ‚Äì Since in this way man comes to resemble heaven and earth, he is not in conflict with them. His wisdom embraces all things, and his tao brings order into the whole world; therefore he does not err. He is active everywhere but does not let himself be carried away. He rejoices in heaven and has knowledge of fate, therefore he is care free. He is content with his circumstances and genuine in his kindness, therefore he can practice love.\n4 ‚Äì In it are included the forms and scope of everything in the heavens and on earth, so that nothing escapes it. In it all things everywhere are completed, so that none is missing. Therefore by means of it we can penetrate the tao of day and night, and so understand it. Therefore the spirit is bound to no one place, not the Book of Changes to any one form.\nWhile these excerpts no doubt represent later interpretations of the significance of the text, at least later than when the text was initially drafted and used which goes at least as far back as the Zhou Dynasty (early first millennium BCE) and probably much earlier, we see implicit here the fundamental belief in the cosmological world order being the tripartite world order of Heaven, Earth and Man, the understanding of which ‚Äì via the Yijing ‚Äì yields greater tranquility and social harmony in this world, in any one individual life.\nSo this worldview of the tripartite order of Heaven, Earth and Man which is meant to operate in harmony and balance that the sages, shamans really from early Chinese pre-history, attempted to align in the individual and social fabric via the use of divination texts like the I Ching (called the Zhou Yi in the Zhou Dynasty prior to the addition of the Ten Wings) clearly is reflective of a much older theological belief system that was no doubt tied to elaborate rituals and sacrifice and involved the belief in Heaven, what was Shangdi in those times, as a god that needed to be appeased and who was responsible for Truth and Justice at some level in the world of Man. This Shangdi from pre-historic and Bronze Age China evolves into the Heaven (Tian) that we know from the classical philosophical works of the late Zhou, Qin and Han dynasty periods that make up what we know as Chinese Philosophy. What we see clearly here in early Chinese history, no different than the other traditions in antiquity throughout the world, is that philosophy and theology in antiquity are closely linked, one born from the other really, and ancient China is no different in this regard.\nThe etymology of the character for Tian ‚Äì Â§© ‚Äì which can be traced of its roots through Seal Script, Bronze inscriptions and even back to Oracle bone script in the early second millennium BCE reveals this theo-philosophical history of the Heaven, and Shangdi. The character is representative of the character of a man, the similarity to a stick figure of the symbol is clear. So while the anthropomorphic qualities of Tian are smoothed over as it were by the time of the classical era (Confucius et al), we can see the direct reference of the idea, the concept, of an all pervading anthropomorphic deity, i.e. Shangdi, at least as far back as the Shang dynasty (2nd millennium BCE) but in all likelihood much earlier than this.\nWhat we know about the Shang Dynasty period in China‚Äôs history comes from various archeological sites in Northeastern China as well as historical texts written in the classical period (5th through 2nd centuries BCE) that speak to the traditions in deep Chinese pre-history as well as the lineage of rulers and kingdoms, all the way back to the pseudo-mythical legendary times of Fu Xi and the Yellow Emperor. These texts are primarily the Bamboo Annals, Classic of History (aka Book of Documents or Shujing) and Records of the Grand Historian.\nFrom these sources we know that the Shang dynasty succeeded the legendary Xia (or Yin) dynasty which was established by Yu the Great, the tamer of the Great Flood. They were based primarily in the North Eastern part of China, by the Yangtze and Yellow river, but their influence spread much further throughout what we today know as China. The people lived in complex societies, large towns and created complex irrigation systems. They domesticated animals and had mastered the art of Bronze craftsmanship hence the term Bronze Age used to describe this time in China‚Äôs history. They also mastered the art of jade carvings and we know that jade was an important luxury and jewelry item of the upper and middle classes.\nThey had a highly developed lunar calendar system (the word for Moon and Month were the same for example) that was used by the ruler and his subjects to determine when to plant crops, when to harvest, etc. We also see the first evidence of writing in this era of China‚Äôs history, first on tortoise and ox bones, and then later on Bronze inscriptions ‚Äì hence the term Oracle Bone and Bronze scripts that are used to describe early forms of Chinese writing. While it is believed that inscriptions were also made on bamboo or silk strips, consistent with later time periods in Chinese antiquity, we do not have any evidence of such given that these types of artifacts degrade quite considerably over time. It is clear that the forms of writing we see on the bones and bronze is fairly mature however, and it can be safely assumed that writing developed in China at least in the third millennium BCE if not earlier, putting Chinese writing systems in line with the cuneiform of the Sumer-Babylonian and Akkadian peoples and the hieroglyphs of the Egyptians to the West in fact.\nFrom the archeological, written and inscription evidence we see a people described as having a complex hierarchical social structure on top of which sat the Emperor who was looked upon as having the so-called ‚Äúmandate of Heaven‚Äù to rule and govern over the people. These people not only had complex burial structures with vast and expensive artifacts left with the deceased, but also consulted the ‚Äúspirits‚Äù, or ancestors, on various important topics or before making important political or social decisions, speaking to the divine reverence which the ancient Chinese had for their either direct, or ancient ancestors. This is typically referred to as ‚Äúancestor worship‚Äù in the literature on Chinese history and this tradition was kept alive in some form or another certainly through the Han Dynasty period (206 BCE to 220 CE) period and is prominently reflected in the philosophy of Confucius. Within this culture of worship of ancestors, we also see strong evidence for the worship of the great god of the sky, Shangdi, a tradition which was to later transform into, or morph into, the notion of Heaven in the Zhou dynasty and persisted throughout much of China‚Äôs history.\nWe see ample evidence in the archeological and written record of the worship of the great sky god (Shangdi), the ancient Bronze Age god of the sky of the Shang peoples, harkening back no doubt to China‚Äôs pantheistic roots. The Book of Documents (Shujing) also references sacrifices and rituals to Shangdi going back to pseudo-historical Emperor Shun from the latter part of the third millennium BCE or so (23rd century BCE).\nThe two Chinese characters from which the word for ‚ÄúShangdi‚Äù is derived are ‚Äú‰∏ä‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúhigh‚Äù ‚Äúhighest‚Äù ‚Äúfirst‚Äù or ‚Äúprimordial‚Äù, combined with ‚ÄúÂ∏ù, which is typically translated as ‚Äúemperor‚Äù and is the same character used in the name of ‚ÄúHuangdi‚Äù, the great Yellow Emperor of deep Chinese antiquity which is the same title sometimes used for the Emperor of China himself. From earliest times, and consistent throughout Chinese history in fact, we can see the close link to the Emperor and the one supreme deity Shangdi, marking as in most ancient civilizations the notion of divine authority with rule of the people.\nIn the time of the Zhou dynasty at the turn of the first millennium BCE, we see a transition and semantic equivalence that is established between Shangdi and Tian (Heaven), which is also the word for ‚Äúsky‚Äù. Tian is of course one of the three pillars of the world order in classical Chinese philosophy ‚Äì Heaven, Earth and Man. We see this transition take place, along with the evolution of Classical Chinese as a writing system, first in the Zhou dynasty period and then maturing in the latter half of the first millennium BCE in the Warring States period, being firmly established in Chinese philosophical nomenclature by the beginning of the Han Dynasty in 202 BCE (Former or Earlier Han) when most if not all of classical Chinese philosophical works were commented on and ‚Äúcanonized‚Äù so to speak.\nRulers of the Chinese empire throughout its written history were looked upon as ‚ÄúTianzi‚Äù, or sons of Heaven, which is the abstract concept who the deity came to represent over the centuries. In the archeological and written record Shangdi is presented as the ruler of Heaven who presides over order and justice in the world of human affairs. The notion that a supreme deity of the heavens establishes order and justice is a common theme throughout the ancient world in fact and parallels here can be drawn to the ma‚Äôat (Maat) of the Egyptians or the rta of the Indo-Aryans as well as of course the aforementioned association of divine legitimacy to the rulers themselves. In this sense Shangdi can be looked at as analogous to Marduk of the Babylonians who rose to prominence as the head of the Babylonian pantheon as Babylon rose to power around the same timeframe much further to the West, or even Zeus/Jupiter in the Greco-Roman tradition a millennia or so later although the link to authority and power is not present.\nWe see the role of heaven played out in the socio-political sphere as well beginning with the Zhou dynasty specifically which Confucius looked upon as a bygone age of justice and virtue. It‚Äôs in the transitional period between the Shang and Zhou dynasty that we find the first reference to the notion of the ‚ÄúWill of Heaven‚Äù which was used by the first dynastic rulers of the Zhou as justification for the overthrow the Shang dynastic rulers. This idea that rulership is not necessarily by birth but by a so-called ‚ÄúMandate of Heaven‚Äù (again Tian) which bestows a right to rule on a just ruler or Son of Heaven (Tianzi) is unique to the Chinese and has been used throughout its history to justify an overthrow of rule or governance. Natural disasters, unrest or famine were for example generally considered to be signs that the rulers had lost the Mandate of Heaven and so the well being of the ruled and the authority of the ruler were seen as tightly interconnected and interdependent upon each other.\nWorship of Heaven (Shangdi and later Tian) throughout China‚Äôs long history included the erection of shrines and the offering of prayers, and in the Shang dynasty and earlier, the use of sacrifices as a form of worship. The last and greatest of these houses of worship was erected as recently as the 14th century CE, the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The connection of Shangdi to imperial rule and the seat of power, akin to the Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs in some respects, was prevalent even after Confucianism, Taoism, and then much later Buddhism took root with the Chinese people in the latter part of the first millennium BCE, as evidenced by the rulers of China continuing to perform the annual bull sacrifice, a beast with very ancient roots in mythology, in honor of Shangdi even in modern times.\n Great Commentary B8.

{"question":"What's the key difference between UAE and Arizona inheritance laws regarding parents' inheritance rights when there's no spouse or children?","answer":"In the UAE and Arizona, there are distinct approaches to parents' inheritance rights. Under UAE Sharia law, when the deceased has no spouse or children but surviving parents, the mother receives 1/3 share of the estate and the father receives the remaining wealth. In Arizona, if someone dies without a spouse or descendants, the parents inherit the entire estate in equal shares, or if only one parent survives, that parent inherits the entire estate.","context":["The question of inheritance is raised frequently, particularly regarding what happens if a family member dies and has not made a will. In that situation, the law of the country in which you are residing will have a major impact on any inheritance and the distribution of the deceased assets. Making a will can ensure that assets are distributed according to the wishes of the deceased but it is relevant to note that some types of assets may still fall under the laws of the land in which you are residing (for example, immoveable assets).\nIn the UAE, if a non-Muslim dies leaving assets which have to be distributed among their heirs, as per Article 17/1, a request has to be made to the court to follow their home country laws, failing which, the assets will be distributed according to Sharia law. Moreover, Article 17/5 has put some limitations on the freedom of disposition of assets which include properties here in UAE.\nBelow is an example which will explain the beneficiaries under Sharia law,\nIf the deceased person has a family of father, mother, wife and three children (1 brother and 2 sisters) then,\n1/8 share will be given to wife, 1/6 share will be given to mother and father and the remaining share will be divided among brother and sisters where the brother will get double the amount of the shares the daughters are entitled to.\nIf the deceased does not have any children then,\n1/4 share will go to wife, 1/3 share will go to mother and the remaining assets will pass to the father\nIf the deceased has no wife or children but a surviving father and mother then,\n1/3 share will be given to the mother and the remaining wealth will be given to the father\nIn the event the deceased is survived solely by his mother and wife\n1/3 + R will be given to mother and 1/4 + R will be given to wife\nWhere the deceased leaves behind a father, mother, wife, and daughters,\nDaughters will get half of the total amount whereas 1/6 share will be given to the mother, 1/8 share will be given to wife, the and 1/6 share plus the remaining amount will be given to the father\nIf survived by a father, mother, wife, and son,\n1/6 share will be given to the father, 1/6 share will be given to the mother, 1/8 share will be given to wife and the remaining amount will go to the son.\nIf there are no parents and only a wife and children assuming there is a son then the wealth will be distributed among them. In case there is no father and son then uncles will also take the share and the equation will be,\n1/6 share will be given to the mother, wife will be given 1/4 share and the remainder will be distributed among the siblings (paternal brothers only)\nIf there is a daughter and not a son then it will be as,\n1/6 share will be left to the mother, 1/8 share to the wife, half to be equally distributed among the daughters and any remainder will be passed to the siblings (only brothers).","Dying Without a Will in Arizona\nLaws of Intestacy Succession in Arizona\nWhen an Arizona resident or a person who owns real estate located in Arizona dies without having made a Last Will and Testament, the intestacy succession laws found in the Title 14 of the Arizona Revised Statutes will dictate who inherits the deceased person's Arizona probate estate. Below is a summary of the Arizona intestacy succession laws in various situations.\nDeceased Person is Survived by a Spouse and/or Descendants and/or Parents and/or Siblings\nHere is what will happen under the Arizona intestacy laws if the deceased person is survived by a spouse and/or descendants (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.), and/or parents, and/or siblings:\n- Survived by a spouse and children from the marriage - In this case, the surviving spouse will inherit all of the deceased spouse's probate estate.\n- Survived by a spouse and children who are not the children of the surviving spouse - In this case, the surviving spouse will only inherit the deceased spouse's separate property, and the children will inherit the other half of the separate property and all of the deceased spouse's community property.\n- Survived by a spouse and no descendants, parents or siblings - In this case, the surviving spouse will inherit the deceased spouse's entire probate estate.\n- Survived by descendants and no spouse - In this case, the deceased person's descendants will inherit the entire probate estate, per stirpes.\n- Survived by a parent or parents and no spouse or descendants - In this case, the parents will inherit the entire estate in equal shares, or the surviving parent will inherit the entire estate.\n- Survived by a sibling or siblings and no parents, spouse or descendants - In this case, the siblings will inherit the entire estate, per stirpes.\nDeceased Person is Not Survived by a Spouse, Descendants, Parents or Siblings\nIf the deceased person dies without a will and is not survived by a spouse, descendants, parents or siblings, then the deceased person's property will pass to nieces and nephews, if any. Otherwise, the property will go to grandparents, aunts or uncles, great uncles or aunts, cousins of any degree, or the children, parents, or siblings of a predeceased spouse.\nIn the unlikely circumstance that the deceased person is not survived by any family members as described above, then the entire probate estate will escheat to the State of Arizona.\nWhat Will You Inherit From an Arizona Intestate Estate?\nSo exactly what will you inherit if your relative dies without leaving a Last Will and Testament and the relative was a resident of Arizona or owned real estate located in Arizona? Even if you determine based on the information presented above that you are entitled to an intestate share of your relative's estate, you may very well not inherit anything. Why? Because your relative may have left all non-probate property or the debts your relative owed at the time of death may exceed the value of the probate estate which will make the estate insolvent.\nThe information contained in this article is not tax or legal advice and is not a substitute for such advice.

{"question":"What's the typical structure of an aerobic dance workout and how long does each segment last?","answer":"A typical aerobics program lasts about an hour and consists of 5-10 minutes of warm-ups and stretching, followed by 20-30 minutes of target heart range dance, can include 20 minutes of body sculpting (muscle stretching floor program), and ends with 5-10 minutes of cool-down and additional stretching. These programs typically occur three to four times per week.","context":["What is Aerobic Dancing?\nBased on a document produced in cooperation with the: American Podiatric Medical Association\nFrom humble beginnings in the late 1960s, aerobic dance has become a major symbol of the fitness craze that exploded into American culture in the 1980s. It's still one of the most popular ways to get fit and stay fit around the world. While recently the aerobics craze has had its ups and downs, in 2002 Gym memberships were reportedly up 7% and aerobics is having a return to its dance roots.\nMore than 24 million people participate in aerobics. Aerobic dance has blossomed into a sport for all to have fun while losing weight and keeping in shape. There are varied forms of aerobics including low-impact, swim and other water aerobics is popular. Dance is still the predominant form and may be inspired by ballet, country line dancing, salsa or even hip-hop.\nEssentially an hour's workout set to music, a typical aerobics program begins with 5-10 minutes of warm-ups and stretching, peaks with 20-30 minutes of target heart range dance, can include 20 minutes of a muscle stretching floor program known as body sculpting, and ends with 5-10 minutes of cool-down and more stretching. Programs typically run three to four times a week.\nThe benefits of aerobics include increased cardiopulmonary efficiency, strengthened heart and lungs, improved circulation, lowered cholesterol levels, and stress and anxiety reduction. But it is a strenuous form of exercise, and thorough preparation, wise choice of routines, proper equipment, and consideration of floor surfaces are essential to avoid injury.\nIt's a good idea to see a doctor of podiatric medicine specializing in sports medicine before beginning an aerobics regimen. The podiatrist will perform a biomechanical or gait analysis to assess your risk of injury.\nDon't Forget the Feet\nBecause aerobic dancing involves quick lateral movements, jumping, and leaping for extended periods of time, proper care of the foot plays a crucial part in keeping the entire body fit to endure the \"pain\" that precedes the \"gain\" of a more fit physique and efficient heart and respiratory system.\nIf your feet suffer from excess pronation or supination (your ankles tend to turn inward or outward too much), it's especially important to see a podiatric physician, who may recommend controlling the sometimes harmful motions with an orthotic shoe insert.\nProper shoes are crucial to successful, injury-free aerobics. Shoes should provide sufficient cushioning and shock absorption to compensate for pressure on the foot many times greater than found in walking. They must also have good medial-lateral (side-to-side) stability. Impact forces from aerobics can reach up to six times the force of gravity, which is transmitted to each of the 26 bones in the foot.\nBecause of the many side-to-side motions, shoes need an arch design that will compensate for these forces, and sufficiently thick upper leather or strap support to provide forefoot stability and prevent slippage of the foot and lateral shoe \"breakup.\" Make sure shoes have a toe box that is high enough to prevent irritation of toes and nails.\nThe American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine has long held the position that sports specific shoes are the best. The requirements of aerobics are for shoes that provide stability for side to side motion and are also supportive while permitting both twisting and turning.\nRunning shoes lack the necessary lateral stability and lift the heel too high to be considered acceptable for aerobics. Running shoes are not recommended by podiatric physicians for aerobics.\nOnce you've found the proper shoes, tie them securely, but not too tightly. Make sure there is sufficient room in the toe box.Double-tie the laces to prevent accidental slippage in mid-routine.\nPurchase shoes in the afternoon, when the feet swell slightly. Wear the same socks that you will wear in training. For sports activity that lasts more than 30 minutes socks made of \"wicking\" fibers such as Coolmax ¬Æ rather than cotton is recommended.\nPrevention of Injuries\nIn a physically challenging sport such as aerobics, injuries are common, and often involve the foot, ankle, and lower leg. (Other susceptible parts of the body are the knee and back.)\nPhysicians say most injuries from aerobics result from improper shoes, surfaces, or routines, and overuse of muscles through too vigorous a regimen.\nNew, properly tied, well-fitted aerobic-specific shoes will address the first problem, and common sense will help the with the others. The key to injury prevention is proper conditioning, which will provide muscles the flexibility and strength needed to avoid injury.\nIf you are attending an aerobics class, make sure it is led by a certified instructor. Hardwood floors, especially with padded mats, are the best surfaces possible. If you can, start with a multi-impact class, where you can start at a low-impact level and work your way up as your conditioning improves.\nIf you exercise at home with a video, be very careful. Read the label to determine whether the video is produced by certified aerobics instructors and whether you can handle the degree of impact. While it's safe to do low-to-moderate impact aerobics on the living room carpet, that's not a proper surface for high-impact routines.\nIn addition, make sure the video includes a proper warm-up period. Make sure there are no rapid, violent movements. Do not bounce or use ballistic stretching, or stretches known as the Yoga plow or hurdler's stretch. Knees should always be loose during warm-up. A static stretch held for 10 seconds can help avoid overstretching injury.\nAs you work out, monitor your heart rate to stay near the target heart range (start with 220, subtract your age, then multiply by 0.8 to find target heart range). You should be within five of the target range. Monitor pulse at peak and after final cool-off and compare. The difference is known as your cardiac reserve.\nDrink adequate water to avoid dehydration during workouts which can cause nausea, dizziness, muscle fatigue, and cramping. For exercise lasting longer then 45 minutes a sports nutrition drink may be superior to water.\nDon't under estimate the importance of the cool-off period. It burns off lactic acid (which makes muscles feel tired) and adrenalin, while keeping blood from pooling in the extremities.\nWhile fitness professionals exercise vigorously six times a week, it's best to start slower. Although it varies by the individual, it's safe to start exercising twice a week for several weeks, then gradually increase to a maximum of five times a week. Remember to pace yourself, and listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop. Don't attempt to exercise through pain, or you may aggravate an acute injury into a chronic or even permanent one. If you continue to be bothered by pain more than 24 hours after exercising, see a physician.\nCommon Aerobics Injuries\nPlantar fasciitis (arch pain) -- Arch pain is often caused by frequent stress on the plantar aspect, or bottom of the foot, in an aerobics routine. When the plantar fascia, a supportive, fibrous band of tissue running from the heel to the ball of the foot, becomes inflamed, pain on the bottom of the foot results. Forefoot and rearfoot instability, with excessive pronation, may result in plantar fasciitis. Shoes with proper support in the arch often prevent plantar fasciitis; if not, see your podiatrist for a custom orthotic device or a recommendation for another shoe.\nHeel spurs -- Heel spur syndrome, related to plantar fasciitis, occurs after calcium deposits build up on the underside of the heel bone. Heel spurs form gradually over many months. Both plantar fasciitis and heel spurs can be avoided by a proper warm-up that includes stretching the band of tissue on the bottom of the foot.\nSesamoiditis -- Sometimes referred to as the ball bearings of the foot, the sesamoids are a set of accessory bones found beneath the large first metatarsal bone. Incredible forces are exerted on the sesamoid bones during aerobics, and inflammation and fractures can occur. Proper shoe selection and custom orthotic devices can help avoid sesamoiditis.\nShin splints -- Aside from ankle sprains, shin splints are perhaps the most common injury to the lower body, as the muscles attached to the shin bone bring the foot up and down. The pain is usually an inflammation of the shin muscle and tendon due to stress factors. Treat shin pain with cold compresses immediately after the workout to reduce inflammation. Proper stretching before the workout should prevent the onset of shin splints. Strengthening of muscles also helps reduce shin splints.\nAchilles tendon and calf pain -- The frequent rising on the toes of an aerobics routine often creates pain and tightness in the large muscles in the back of the legs, which can create pain and tightness in the calf and inflammation of the achilles tendon. Again, stretching the calf muscles gently and gradually before and after the workout will ordinarily help alleviate the pain and stiffness.\nStress fractures -- Probably the most common injuries to aerobics instructors, stress fractures are caused by poor shoe selection, hard surfaces, and overuse. Women are more likely to develop stress fractures, usually in the lesser metatarsal bones, than men. When swelling and pain surface, see a podiatrist. X-ray evaluation and early treatment can prevent a disabling injury.\nIf you experience any of these injuries, see a physician (a podiatrist can treat most of them), who will prescribe treatments to alleviate the pain, and make recommendations to prevent recurrence of any discomfort. As foot specialists trained in all aspects of foot care, podiatrists are also qualified to perform foot surgery if the condition requires it.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe bottom line when undertaking an aerobic dance program is to be careful and responsible. Aerobics may even provide a more vigorous workout than jogging, and injuries will inevitably occur if you don't listen to your body and exercise your common sense as well as your muscles.\nRemember there are good aerobics programs and bad ones. Use discretion in choosing both a class to attend or home video to purchase that is right for you. Always pace yourself, and stop if you feel pain. Remember, foot pain is not normal, so don't ignore it. Chances are, a successful aerobics regimen will bring out the body you've always dreamed of, and a better feeling about yourself both physically and mentally."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:28d0ff36-bd06-4179-9546-b5da353c578b>"],"error":null}

They should be hung vertically side-by-side with bottoms facing each other, avoiding direct contact, and kept in a protective cover. The bindings should be loosened using a screwdriver to preserve their spring, noting down the adjustment settings for later. As for safety testing, ski bindings should be tested at a ski shop before use, especially after accidents. The technician will adjust the DIN settings based on factors like weight and expertise level, mount bindings according to ski and boot size, and check the release mechanism. They will also inspect for any visual cracks or worn-out parts that might require replacement.","context":["As the days get warmer and the snow sadly starts to melt, it‚Äôs time to think about storing your ski equipment. Unless you‚Äôre going to New Zealand or another summertime ski destination, you probably won‚Äôt use your gear for at least six months. If you don‚Äôt want your ski edges to rust or your ski coat to smell, you‚Äôll need to store them properly. Our guide will walk you through the basic storage techniques for each key item of equipment.\nWashing a Ski Jacket & Trousers\n- Program your washing machine to a synthetic 30 degrees cycle and add detergent\n- Add two white tennis balls to stop your down jacket from clumping\n- Complete a second rinse cycle to make sure there isn‚Äôt any remaining washing detergent\nHow to Dry a Ski Jacket & Trousers\nDrying your ski suit properly prevents it from smelling when stored over summer. The easiest way to make sure your coat and trousers are dry is by using a tumble dryer. However, you can still get a dry coat by hanging or laying your coat out -- it‚Äôll just take much longer.\nDrying a Ski Jacket with a Tumble Dryer\n- Program your dryer to a soft or delicate cycle\n- Add two tennis balls to air a down feather jacket\n- Run several cycles to make sure your coat is thoroughly dry\n- Between cycles, fluff the jacket to prevent lumps\nDrying a Ski Jacket without a Tumble Dryer\n- Lay your ski coat and trousers flat down in a dry place\n- Wait for one to two weeks\n- As you wait, occasionally fluff the jacket to avoid lumps (you should do this at least four to five times)\n- Do NOT store till the coat is 100% dry\nHow to Wax Skis for Storage\nAt the end of the season, after you‚Äôve finished your final run, you‚Äôll need to bring your skis into the shop so they can be waxed and restored. If you know how to wax skis, you can also do this at home. Unlike regular waxing, we recommend leaving a layer of wax on the bottom of your skis to protect and nourish the bases during the summer months. Ski maintenance is an important part of ski ownership.\nHome Ski Storage\nOnce your skis are waxed and restored, the best place to store them is in a warm, dry and dark indoor area to prevent rust. Leaving them in direct sunlight, like on your balcony or patio, can dry out the wax on the bottom of your skis and cause your equipment to crack.\nIt‚Äôs also a good idea to hang your skis side-by-side vertically with the bottoms facing each other and in a protective cover. Try to avoid the temptation to hook them together, but rather leave a small space, so the bases aren‚Äôt directly touching.\nPreparing Ski Bindings for Summer Storage\nAt the end of the season, you should pull up and loosen your ski bindings as this will help to preserve their spring. To relax the spring, you‚Äôll need to use a flat-head screwdriver to unscrew the screw at the front and back of the bindings. This will take the pressure off the spring. However, make sure to note down your adjustment so you can reset the binding once the summer is over.\nYou can also bring your skis to your closest ski shop and they can adjust your bindings to prepare them for summer storage and keep you safe on the slopes.\nSki Boot Storage Systems\nStoring your ski boots properly guarantees that they‚Äôre still comfortable next season and don‚Äôt smell bad.\nBefore putting them away for the summer, make sure you follow these steps:\n- Thoroughly air your boots by removing the liner from the plastic outer shell\n- Examine the heel and toe units. If you notice any damage (like a split) or if they appear worn, you may need to have them replaced\n- Buckle the buckles on the first notch to help them keep their shape\n- Store your boots in a boot bag in an indoor dry and warm area. Ideal storage temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius as this will keep the plastic from cracking.\nNow that you‚Äôre equipment is safely put away, sit back and count down the days till the mountain opens again!","You are a skiing enthusiast who loves to blaze through the mountains. As you can realize, skiing is an extreme sport and your gears need to be at their prime every time you hit the downhill slopes. You need to make sure that the ski gear, ski bindings, release force settings are tested and are up to the mark.\nHaving well functioning gear will ensure your safety while you have fun. This article will give you an overview of the ski binding release test.\nTable of Contents\nWhen should you test your ski bindings?\nTo perform a release test you need to visit a ski shop. You need to ensure that you visit the ski shop before the trip, so they have time to fix it if the bindings are not releasing correctly.\nIn case you have faced an accident or a crash during any of your skiing sojourns, it is recomended to have the release test and gear checks done.\nRegular ski binding release tests might sound like an inconvenience, but remember this is a matter of your safety.\nDIN setting and how it works\nThe DIN standard measurements are followed worldwide to adjust the ski binding forces and release scales.\nThe International Standards Organization (ISO) did release a set of standard criteria to adjust ski binding scales but the DIN setting is still popularly followed globally.\nWhen you go to a ski shop, the technician would adjust the bindings based on the following parameters:\n- Expertise level\nThere are a few other factors taken into consideration while adjusting the DIN but these are the primary ones.\nFor example, if you weigh anywhere between 50 pounds and 165 pounds, and your expertise level ranges from beginner to intermediate, your DIN will be adjusted between 2 and 7.\nSimilarly, if you weigh anywhere between 65 pounds and 250 pounds, and your level of expertise ranges from intermediate to expert, your DIN will be adjusted between 3 and 12.\nSturdiness is one of the most important aspects kept in mind during a ski binding release test. A high level of skiing expertise means you will have the ability to maneuver through challenging steeps at a faster speed. This requires a lot of strength and the gears have to be robust. Hence, the DIN is set at a higher level to accommodate more elasticity and robustness to the ski binding.\nCan I adjust the DIN settings by myself?\nIf you are an experienced skier and know the in and out of how to set the DIN you can give it a shot.\nIt is highly advisable to pay a visit to a ski shop and get the ski binding release tested by a technician if needed. A professional will have wide-ranging knowledge of various DIN settings and can guide you well based on your requirements.\nHow ski shops do binding release test\nHere is a step by step insight on how binding release test is done.\n- First, the ski bindings are mounted according to the ski size and the size of the boot sole.\n- Then the technician will check and adjust the DIN settings based on weight, expertise, and skier size.\n- There are visual indicators to show each measurement and the technician sets the values and torque according to the industry standards.\n- The toe and the heel equipment is mounted and set up according to the results of the visual indicator. The adjustments are done based on the age of the skier, size, and boot sole length, to name a few.

{"question":"Can you explain how the number of spirals affects performance in spiral mandrel distributors? ü§î Im trying understand better!","answer":"Increasing the number of spirals in a spiral mandrel distributor has several effects on performance. It improves the distribution efficiency and reduces the pressure loss of the tool when the spiral geometry remains constant. This happens because more spirals increase the free volume where melt can flow, which reduces flow resistance and leads to lower pressure loss. The melt distribution also improves as it spreads over a larger area. However, there is a trade-off - more spirals mean longer machining times are needed for milling the flow channels.","context":["Spiral mandrel distributors are among the most powerful extrusion tools for the production of pipes, films, hoses and bottles and are available in a wide range of variants on the market. Spiral mandrel distributors can be used for various production processes and a good design of the spiral mandrel distributor significantly determines the quality of the product produced.\nWhen designing and dimensioning spiral mandrel distributors, there are various design rules, the knowledge and observance of which can make a positive contribution to achieving high product quality. A few of these design criteria will be mentioned and explained below.\nThe most important free geometry parameters of a classical spiral mandrel distributor (without consideration of extruder connection, primary distribution and die) are:\n- Diameter (D)\n- Overall height (H)\n- Number of spirals (n)\n- Slope of the spirals (alpha)\n- Spiral channel depth at beginning of channel (t)\n- Spiral width (b)\n- Gap width of the overcurrent range (s)\n- Wrap angle of the spirals (phi)\n- Design details, radii, bevels, sealing surfaces\nThe diameter of a spiral mandrel distributor as well as the height of the system are usually determined by the available installation space and the desired diameter of the product. The advantages of a compact design are, on the one hand, reduced space and material requirements and, on the other hand, the avoidance of unnecessarily long flow paths and thus unnecessary loading of the melt as well as high pressure losses. However, if the systems are too short, the distribution effect can be negatively affected.\nNumber of spirals:\n‚ÄúIncreasing the number of spirals improves the distribution efficiency and reduces the pressure loss of the tool (with constant spiral geometry).‚Äù\nIn principle, it can be assumed that an increase in the number of spirals increases the free volume (the area in the die in which melt can flow). The pressure loss in the die decreases due to the reduction of the flow resistance which is usually associated with this. At the same time, the melt is distributed over a larger area, which usually increases the distribution effect. The disadvantage is, of course, the longer machining times for milling the flow channels.\nChannel depth of the spirals:\n‚ÄúAn increase in the initial channel depth leads to a more uniform distribution effect and a reduction in the pressure loss, but can have a negative effect on the flushing capability of the tool.‚Äù\nIn the geometry of the spirals, the initial depth and the depth profile are defined. The depth of the spirals generally decreases continuously with the course of the spirals until it reaches the core diameter of the sleeve. A high initial depth of the spirals leads to a reduction of the pressure loss in the tool, but can have a negative effect on the behaviour of the tool during purging or material change processes. The following graphic shows the simulation results of a spiral mandrel distributor. The occurring wall shear stresses are shown in colour. In the areas where the flow channels are narrow, comparatively high shear stresses prevail, so that the die walls in this area are flushed with good effect (e.g. in the area of the nozzle and the overcurrent areas). The areas in which the flow paths have large free volumes are characterized by low shear stresses (blue areas). Stagnation of the melt can occur here. In principle, the melt takes the ‚Äúpath of least resistance‚Äù as it flows through the die, so in deeply cut channels a large part of the melt flows through the spiral channel. Of course, this also has an influence on the distribution effect.\nSpiral pitch angle:\n‚ÄúLower spiral angles improve the melt distribution, but cause a higher pressure loss.‚Äù\nTogether with the overall height of the system, the pitch angle determines the size of the wrap angle. The pitch angle, similar to a thread pitch, is the angle at which the spirals winds around the mandrel. The following figure shows the melt flow in two adjacent spiral in different colors. From the overall height of the manifold as well as the angle of inclination, the wrap angle results, in this case almost 180¬∞.\nThe resulting overlap angle of the melt in the area of the distributor end is also clearly visible. The overlap angle is the area in the (rotationally symmetrical) product which is fed simultaneously by the melt from two adjacent spirals. The larger this spiral is, the more effectively weld lines are avoided (or blurred).\nGap width between helical mandrel and cylinder:\n‚ÄúThe initial gap width has an influence on the distribution efficiency, but this influence is dominated by the gap width profile. Small initial gap widths lead to increased pressure loss‚Äù.\nSince the function of the spiral mandrel distributor is based on the principle that the flow fronts that flow through the spirals overlap with the flow fronts that flow out of the spiral and into the gap area, the gap width between mandrel and cylinder plays an important role. If this gap width is too large, almost the entire melt flows through this overcurrent area and the flow at the bottom of the spiral comes to a stagnation. If the overflow gap is too narrow, hardly any melt can flow through it and the dominant flow component occurs in the spiral flow.\nIn order to achieve optimum production results, an intelligent adjustment of the gap width course is therefore necessary. In practice, both linear and progressive or degressive shapes exist.\n‚ÄúThe gap width profile has a strong influence on the quality of the distribution of the extrusion die. ‚Äù\nThe following figures show different courses of the spiral channel depth and the gap width of the overcurrent gap. While the channel depth in the upper illustration decreases linearly, the spiral depth curve in the lower illustration is degressive (first rapidly decreasing, then slowly decreasing).\nThe correct selection and combination of various design details in the spiral mandrel distributor determines the product quality to be achieved later. For this reason, it is particularly important to attach great importance to the design of the spiral mandrel distributor. Today‚Äôs computer simulation methods allow an insight into the tool behaviour even before the machining of the steel and thus help to avoid unnecessary additional expenditure.\nRegister here (free of charge) as a premium member and gain access to our download area.

{"question":"¬øCould you explain how traditional family musical legacies are being preserved in modern rock, and what role do sustainable urban farming solutions play in preserving food traditions? üéµüå±","answer":"In terms of musical preservation, we can see this through Alex Estrada's case, where despite moving from his family's mariachi tradition to rock music, he maintains his heritage by incorporating traditional elements like mariachi finger-strumming techniques and palmas clapping in his modern rock compositions with Silver Snakes. Regarding sustainable urban farming, systems like BrightFarms are preserving food production traditions while adapting to modern needs by building hydroponic greenhouse farms on supermarket rooftops. These systems maintain food production capabilities in urban environments while using significantly less water and land than traditional farming methods. For instance, a 30-story, one square block farm can produce the equivalent of a 2,400-acre outdoor soil-based farm, allowing for sustainable food production in urban settings.","context":["Alex Estrada Was Going to Be a Sixth-Generation Mariachi.

Mariachis perform as patrons consume their margaritas and enchiladas. It‚Äôs the fifth anniversary of the formation of Estrada‚Äôs band, Silver Snakes.\nEstrada is a sixth-generation musician. His grandfather performed at the Million Dollar Theatre in the 1950s with Mariachi Chapala. His grandmother sang on radio shows broadcast from Olvera Street.

The fundamental social problem of feeding society is growing larger due to a rising scarcity of water and an ongoing depletion of agricultural land. Population growth, climate changes, pollution, and agricultural water waste contribute to growing fresh water shortages around the world. Depletion of soil nutrients through poor farming techniques, floods, poor irrigation, and winds have seriously damaged agricultural land.\nApproximately 40% of the world‚Äôs agricultural ground is unsuitable for farming. The role of agricultural business desperately needs to align with the evolving ethos of a rapidly growing society. Can hydroponic farming provide a sustainable solution to environmental problems caused by traditional farming methods? What practical applications does hydroponics have in densely populated urban areas? Farmers describe soil degradation as thinning and unproductive land that leads to low yielding crops.\nLand degradation includes nutrient depletion, loss of biodiversity, climate change, erosion by water, erosion by wind, reduced vegetative cover, pollution, drought, compaction by animals or machinery, sedimentation, increased soil temperatures, reduced organic matter, and salinization (Stockings, 2000 pg 5). According to the United Nation‚Äôs food and agriculture program, 854 million people do not have sufficient food for an active and healthy life (Sample, 2007). The population has increased by nearly 2 billion in the last 20 years and food production increased by 50%.\nIt is estimated that by 2050 the population will reach 9 billion. (Sample, 2007). State and federal officials have drafted accords in attempts to rectify water shortages. UN officials have gathered to create and execute a plan of action to improve conservation of soil and restoration of degraded land, but such plans are merely band-aids on a broken limb. The ultimate form of soil conservation is eliminating the use of soil in agriculture completely. Hydroponic agriculture offers a permanent solution to this rapidly growing problem of water shortages, pollution, and land degradation.\nDevelopment of hydroponic systems took place from 1925 through 1935. Experimentation with soil-less nutrient solutions and advancement in agricultural plastic by Professor Emery Myers Emmert at the University of Kentucky sparked an interest in hydroponic food production. Efforts were primarily aimed at large scale commercial food growth, but Hydroponic food systems were eventually abandoned due to high construction and operation costs (University of Arizona). Modern hydroponic systems are relatively inexpensive to build and offer several effective methods of food production.\nThe most popular commercial agriculture hydroponic system is the Nutrient Film Technique. NFT consist of a plastic pipe or gutter, a water reservoir, and a water pump. A thin film of nutrient infused water constantly flows through the tubing. Plant roots are suspended over the piping with only the roots touching the stream of nutrient water. The pipe or gutter is slightly elevated at the far end to allow water to drain back into the water reservoir. The NFT system delivers high levels of oxygen to the roots promoting vigorous plant growth.\nNFT systems are ideal for leafy greens such as lettuce, cabbage and basil but are effective for a multitude of fruits, herbs, and vegetables. A minimal operating cost makes this system ideal for commercial applications. [pic] [pic] A popular system for larger plants is the ebb and flow or flood and drain system. This table system consists of a plastic tray, water pump, timer, reservoir, and tubing. The plants lay on the top table separate from the nutrient reservoir. The pump is programmed to turn on in 15 minute increments with variations specific to the type of plant and stage of development.\nWhen activated, the pump will fill the table at top with the nutrient infused water from the reservoir below. Once it is turned off the water will drain back into the reservoir below. [pic] One of the simplest hydroponic methods is the deep water culture system. Often used in commercial applications, this system can be built with materials found at a local hardware store or discount retail market. The deep water culture system can be built with a non-transparent storage tote, an aquarium air pump, and an air stone commonly used in fish tanks.\nPlant roots are permanently submerged in nutrient rich water. This system does not require a water pump or timer. Urbanization and technological developments extended the distance produce traveled to reach consumers. Heilbroner explains the changed by describing that ‚Äúindustrial technology has literally refashioned the human environment, bringing with it all the gains-and all the terrible problems-of city life on a mass scale‚Äù (Heilbroner, Milberg pg 83 ). Hydroponics is the tool to address the basic social problem of feeding society by making produce readily accessible and grown in urbanized areas.\nAlthough traditional agriculture has served its purpose for many years, the ethos of rapidly growing demands sustainable and healthy forms of food production. Hydroponic farming in conjunction with greenhouses can help solve land degradation and water pollution problems through out the world. Lufa Farms, a Canadian farm based in Monteral, engineered a series of greenhouses on top of a 31,000-square foot office building. Greenhouse growing allows the Canadian farm to supply fresh produce all year round, even in 45 degree temperatures.\nIt is estimated that Lufa Farms can deliver more than 1,000 baskets of produce per week, three times more than land-based competitors. ( Business and the Environment). Greenhouse hydroponic farming not only solves the problem of land degradation and a water shortage due to traditional farming practices but it also alleviates the pressure of fossil fuel consumption and vehicle pollution. Because sustainable farming systems can be established in city rooftops and barges, transporting fruits and vegetables from remote farms is no longer necessary.\nProduce grown in the city have shorter distances to travel reducing transportation expenses and fuel consumption. Consumers can purchase a fresher product at their local market. According to Columbia University professor of public health and microbiology Dickson D. Despommier, a 30-story, one square block farm could produce the same amount of produce as a 2,400 outdoor soil based farm ( Business and the Environment ). The Science Barge, a greenhouse and hydroponic system on top of a barge based in Yonkers, New York, is a fully functioning urban farm prototype for a fully sustainable food production sytem.\nThe Science Barge produces tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce without carbon emissions, chemical pesticides, or waste water runoff (New York Sun Works, 2010-2011). The barge uses solar and wind power to sustain greenhouses on top of the barge. Purified river water and rain water is used to irrigate the crops. Science Barge grown produce use seven times less land and four times less water than traditionally grown crops. (New York Sun Works, 2010-2011). The economic advantage of hydroponic farming can be identified through a cost-benefit analysis.\nConsidering that in 2000, 41% of all freshwater used in the United States was for Agricultural purposes (Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition); reduction in water cost is one of the main economic advantages of hydroponic farming. BrightFarms is a company that has taken this emerging technology and developed a business model of ‚ÄúBetter food, better prices, better environment. ‚Äù BrightFarms designs, finances, builds, and operates hydroponic greenhouse farms on supermarket rooftops.\nBrightFarms pledge is ‚Äúto deliver produce at equal or higher service levels than the retailer currently requires of its other suppliers. There is no cost to the retailer to build the BrightFarm, only an obligation to purchase the output. ‚Äù The company intends to increase profits by reducing shrink due to longer produce shelf life. They have calculated that this practice will produce higher gross margins for the retailer. The company implements a long-term price fix contract to protect the retailer from unstable prices, rising cost costs and inconstant supply. BrightFarms 2012). BrightFarms feels that ‚Äúwith the elimination of shipping, and the drastic reduction of fuel consumption, carbon emissions and water use, BrightFarms enables grocery retailers to change their produce supply chain in a way that improves the planet and their bottom line. ‚Äù (BrightFarms 2012). According to Brian H. Kurbjeweit, professor of Contemporary Business at the University of Redlands, economic progress is an interconnected system comprised of science, economics, law, and ethics all influenced by the ethos of a society.\nThe ethos of modern society has expressed an urgent need for sustainable business practices. Science has engineered the tools to effectively create a new form of responsible farming. Materials to build hydroponic systems are readily available at a relatively low cost. Through social media, instructional videos and written instructions to build and operate hydroponic systems are readily accessible world wide through urban farming forums free of cost on the Internet. There is a basic economic need to feed and sustain life.\nThe basic economic problem creates a market for those willing to invest in large-scale urban farming businesses. Responsible agriculture is an ethical guideline that all farmers in global and local economies should follow to ensure the basic economic problem is addressed. Continued land degradation, water pollution, and pesticide smothered produce combined with a rapidly growing world population will lead to further human suffering. It is an ethical duty of world leaders to implement sustainable forms of agriculture to nurture its citizens. Law, the missing factor is yet to be addressed.\nIt may be the ethos of future generations that persuades governments to execute laws to speed up the implementation of sustainable farming techniques or it may be severe ethical violations by non-complying agricultural corporations that spark the creation of laws to effectively protect citizens from illness caused by pesticides and water pollution. It may simply be an epidemic interest in well being or as author Malcom Gladwell describes, a tipping point may be reached where local co-ops solve the basic economic problem, one small community at a time, using sustainable forms of agriculture.\nStockings, M., Niamh, M.

{"question":"What are concrete examples of visual signposting techniques in modern games?","answer":"In New Super Mario Bros. 2, there are two clear examples of visual signposting: 1) A literal big red arrow providing direct guidance, and 2) A more subtle approach using coin placement that draws the player's eye upward, indicating a path to a hidden star coin reward when using the super leaf power-up.","context":["As a designer, you should always know what you want the player to do, but just because you know what the player should be doing doesn‚Äôt mean that they do.\nMaking sure that a player doesn‚Äôt get lost is an important part of the game‚Äôs design, as a lost player is likely to become a frustrated player. And a frustrated player isn‚Äôt likely to be your player for long.\nNavigation can become an issue even in relatively small games, so effective signposting becomes an essential skill for all designers. As tempting as it may be to begin development by creating amazing graphics and set-pieces, a better starting point would be to decide what you want the player to do in an environment and the route you want them to take through it.\nNew Super Mario Bros. 2 takes signposting very literally, as shown in the screenshot above. But even without the big red arrow there is another form of signposting in the shot. The placement of the coins draws the player‚Äôs eye up, and suggests that there is a reward for following that line. Sure enough, if a player uses the super leaf and flies up in that direction, they will find a hidden star coin.\nThere are plenty of ways to help guide the player, such as:\nUI ‚Äì Even if your game is primarily UI based, you should still know which buttons you want the player to press. If you have a particular button that you want a player to click, make it stand out more than the others. Make it bigger, more colourful or add a visual effect. If you‚Äôve played any social games before you‚Äôll have noticed that the ‚ÄòSHARE‚Äô button is more often than not the most obvious, and that you have to hunt for the tiny close button.\nMaps ‚Äì Most commonly used in sandbox games with big centralised hubs, maps are a great way to show a player where the next objective is. Use different icons to differentiate between different targets, though be mindful to avoid overloading the player.\nLandmarks ‚Äì By putting an interesting looking building on the horizon, players are likely to want to investigate it, especially if used in conjunction with other techniques such as NPC characters‚Ä¶\nNPC Characters ‚Äì Characters within the game can interact directly with the player, sending them on a quest or opening up a new area of the game.

The Lost Woods section in Ocarina of Time made excellent use of audio cues to guide the player through the maze.\nVisual Distinction ‚Äì Many games have themed worlds, which not only break up the gameplay and can present new challenges but can also guide the player. If an NPC character has sent you on a quest to the desert and you‚Äôre surrounded by snowmen, you‚Äôre likely to have gone the wrong way.\nWhatever game you make, deciding how you guide the player will be part of the design.

{"question":"whats the time for maca seed to germinate?","answer":"Seeds germinate in 5-7 days at 25¬∞C under good moisture conditions. The seeds apparently do not have dormancy.","context":["MACA BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION\nThe maca plant is a rosette of frilly leaves with an enlarged fleshy underground organ formed by the taproot and the lower part of the hypocotyl (Le√≥n 1964; Tello et al.1992). These parts of the plant swell during growth, forming a storage organ resembling a turnip. For simplicity, we will call this organ ‚Äòhypocotyl‚Äô, which is the economic product of maca. The foliage forms a mat, growing in close contact with the ground. The leaves exhibit dimorphism, being larger in the vegetative phase and reduced in the reproductive cycle (Tello et al. 1992). The ‚Äòhypocotyls‚Äô display a variety of colors from purple to cream and yellow (Le√≥n 1964). This species is an octoploid with 2n=8x=64 chromosomes (Quir√≥s et al. 1996), considering that the basic genomic number of Lepidieae is x=8. Its meiosis is normal, with the chromosomes associating predominantly as bivalents. This type of association indicates that maca is a disomic polyploid. Polyploidy is a common event among the species in the tribe Lepidieae to which maca belongs (Darlington and Wylie 1945). Most of the pollen collected from the flowers is fertile, as measured by pollen stainability. Consistent with other cruciferous species, pollen grains are trinucleated.\nMaca is an annual crop completing its life cycle within a year when climatic conditions are favorable (Quir√≥s et al. 1996). However, often maca is considered a biennial plant (Tello et al. 1992) because it has a vegetative cycle followed by a reproductive phase. Furthermore, in the Jun√≠n area maca is grown as a biennial by holding the ‚Äòhypocotyls‚Äô underground during the dry season. However, during favorable years, when there is enough moisture in the soil and an absence of killing frosts, plants left in the field complete their life cycle within a year. The vegetative phase includes the expansion and growth of the ‚Äòhypocotyl‚Äô and root. These organs are fully enlarged approximately 7 months after planting. At this time the plants initiate their reproductive phase. Often the first floral buds will appear in a small cluster at the center of the rosette, or as solitary flowers in some of the leaf axils, announcing the initiation of the generative shoots, the main reproductive structures. Only a few of the first flowers will produce fruit. Almost at the same time, at the base of the plant, radially and under the leaves, generative shoots will rapidly grow, producing secondary branches. These will generate most of the seed of the plant. Approximately 20 primary generative branches are produced per plant, and each of these will produce approximately 13 secondary branches (Aliaga C√°rdenas 1995). The generative branches will produce profuse flowering racemes for the next 3 months. Each secondary branch will yield racemes with 50-70 flowers each. Therefore, a primary branch will bear close to 1000 flowers. Fruits will set in most of these flowers throughout this period, maturing in approximately 5 weeks. At this time, the fruits will initiate dehiscence and the mature seed will be released. During the long period of flowering, it is possible to observe both fruits and flowers in the generative branches.\nApproximately 85% of the fruits will bear seeds. Apparently seeds do not have dormancy, germinating in 5-7 days at 25¬∞C and good moisture conditions. A single plant of maca produces approximately 14 g of seeds. One gram contains approximately 1600 seeds. Seeds are small, measuring 2 mm in length, and are light tan to brown in co lour (Aliaga-C√°rdenas 1995).\nThe flowers of maca are inconspicuous and arranged in axillar racemes. They have four erect, concave sepals, and four small white petals. The ovary is oval and bicarpelar with a short style, which develops into a dehiscent silique of two locules, carrying one seed per locule. Only two stamens, or seldom three, with well-developed anthers are present in the flowers. A variable number of rudimentary stamens consisting only of filaments is also present. The normal number of functional stamens in the family Brassicaceae is six, four larger than the other two. However, androeceum variation reflected in number of complete stamens is a common feature of the genus Lepidium (Thellung 1906). Small nectaries at the base of the stamens are also present. It is unknown, however, whether these are functional. Aliaga-C√°rdenas (1995) found that maca is primarily an autogamous species. Pollination is initiated 4-5 days after the flower bud is first visible to the naked eye, and continues for another 3 days. The anthers and petals wither for the next 2 days while the ovary starts to enlarge initiating fruit development. Part of the anthesis takes place while the flower is still closed, thus indicating that the maca flowers are partially cleistogamous. Further evidence of autogamy is provided by spontaneous fruit-setting of flowering plants in growth chambers, where insects were excluded (Quir√≥s et al. 1996). In Jun√≠n, the native area of maca production, no insect pollinators working the flowers were observed. Only sporadic visitation by two or three species of Dipterae which landed in the leaves and flowers have been seen (Quir√≥s, unpublished).\nIn the field at Davis, California, only a few syrphid flies were observed visiting the foliage and seldom the flowers. Plants grown from different accessions are morphologically alike, with a few exceptions. All these observations suggest that maca reproduces predominantly by self-pollination."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6f90388e-db83-4bf2-af31-5d1240895191>"],"error":null}

Each character tends to have its backstory, stats, class, and much more, and that is the same case with Alear.\nAlear, your main character, is a Divine Dragon who has been awoken from slumber to defeat the Fall Dragon. They will explore the Continent of Elyos in order to find the Emblem Rings to help defeat the dragon. But there is much more to be learned about Alear!\nHere is a quick overview about Alear in Fire Emblem Engage:\n|Starting Class||Battle Style||Weapon||Skills||Base Stats||Growth Rate||Starting Items|\n|Dragon Child||Dragon||Sword||Divinely Inspiring||Health: 22|\nWho Is Alear In Fire Emblem Engage?As mentioned, Alear, belonging to Lythos, is the main protagonist of the game and is a Divine Dragon and the child of the Divine Dragon Monarch, Lumera. 1000 years ago, Alear helped take down and seal away the Divine Dragon but then went into a deep slumber.\nAfter all those years, they finally get woken up to help defeat the Fell Dragon, who is rumored to be on the verge of returning. However, due to many years of being asleep, Alear loses memory of who they are and all the events that occurred before they woke up. Regardless, Alear listens to what Lumera says and sets out on a journey to find the 12 Emblem Rings spread across the Continent of Elyos to help defeat the Fell Dragon.\nAs Alear is the protagonist, they will be available right from the start of the game. At the start of the game, the player can choose whether they want their Alear to be male or female. Additionally, they can also rename them to whatever they want. You will also set their date of birth.\nBase ClassAlear starts off with the Dragon Child class. The class is rare among other characters, and they are the only playable character that has that class. The Dragon Child class utilizes the Dragon Battle style in combat. That makes Alear proficient as a sword user.\nNot only that, but the Dragon Child class makes it so that Alear is relatively stronger and more efficient while teaming up with the different Emblem Rings. Even though other characters can also combine with the different rings, in general cases, Alear‚Äôs power will be far greater than the rest.\nThe stats of Alear will change as you progress further in the game. It also depends on how quickly you‚Äôre leveling up and using Alear in battle. Regardless, here are the stats for Alear:\nAs you play and get in more battles, you‚Äôll gain experience, which will ultimately help your stats grow. Your stats will grow at different rates, and here is the growth rate for each of the stats:\nCustomizationAlear has a unique look that distinguishes them from almost every other character in the game. They have red and blue hair, which is split down the middle, making each side different colored. As for their eyes, the side with red hair has blue eyes, and the one on the blue-haired side is red colored. Unfortunately, you cannot change this iconic look of the character. But there are other customization options.\nYou can get different clothes for Alear at the Somniel. Clothes and other accessories can be bought from the Boutique and the Amiibo Gazebo stores. However, whatever appearance you choose for Alear in the Somniel will not reflect in actual battle; it will only be visible at the Somniel.\nStarting Weapon And SkillsWhen you‚Äôre just starting out, there aren‚Äôt many skills or weapons that you can expect to use as Alear. Of course, that will change as you progress further into the game, collect more Emblem Rings, and much more. But, when you‚Äôre just starting out, these will be your starting skills and weapons:\n- Weapon: Iron Sword, Liberation\n- Skill: Divinely Inspiring, which lets the adjacent ally take one less damage while dealing +3 more damage.\nOf course, you‚Äôll soon get access to different weapons and skills, especially when you use the engage option. For example, if you Engage with Marth, you‚Äôll get access to the Rapier weapon as well as the Divine Speed and Lodestar Rush attack skill.\nThere are two versions of Alear, male, and female. That means that for each language, there are two voice actors. We will be highlighting the Japanese and English voice actors. They are the following:\n|Japanese||Hiro Shimono||Aya Endo|\n|English||Brandon McInnis||Laura Stahl|\nWith that, you know most that there is to know about Alear in Fire Emblem Engage. They‚Äôre one of the strongest base class characters in the game, which makes sense as they‚Äôre the protagonist. Of course, as you progress further in the story, you‚Äôll learn all about the events, secrets, and much more!\nUp Next: Fire Emblem Engage: Sommie\nThanks!

{"question":"How do the impacts of high frequency trading firms compare between the Swiss National Bank's sudden policy change and India's recent cryptocurrency tax implementation?","answer":"During the Swiss National Bank's sudden announcement to de-peg the Swiss franc from the Euro in 2015, HFT firms generated positive returns due to the immense market volatility, while major brokers like FXCM needed bailouts and Alpari became insolvent. In contrast, when India implemented strict crypto taxes in 2022 (30% on profits and 1% TDS), HFT and other trading firms were negatively impacted due to severely reduced trading volumes, with Indian crypto exchange traffic falling by 80% and app downloads dropping by 93%. The different outcomes demonstrate how HFT firms thrive in high-volatility events but struggle when regulatory changes reduce overall market volume and trading opportunities.","context":["Meaning of Market Event\nA Market Event is anything significant that can affect the markets in terms of price movement, volume or market microstructure, like referendums or surprise regulatory decisions. The market events are classified in three types:\n- Unplanned event or Black Swan ‚Äì Price volatility is extremely high, profit potential is more (for ‚Äôalways‚Äô prepared firms) and disruption is high.\n- Planned event with unknown outcome or Grey Swan ‚Äì Post event price volatility is high, profit potential extremely high and disruption is limited\n- Planned event with known outcome or White Swan ‚Äì Price volatility post event is low, profit making opportunities and disruption in the market are limited.\nOn 15th Jan 2015, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) suddenly announced that it would no longer hold the Swiss franc at a fixed exchange rate with Euro. This was a totally unplanned event, and the markets were not ready for the outcome. Following the announcement, currency markets crashed with nearly 17% drop intraday, which is huge, considering typical movements are in the range of 0.5% for the daily transactions.\nFig1: Chart of EUR/CHF in the aftermath of the SNB announcement Source: ZeroHedge\nDisruption and volatility in the market was exceptional. Big FX brokers were crippled, as FXCM, a major US retail foreign-exchange broker emerged as one of the biggest victim amongst the leading firms, only to be rescued later by a bailout from Leucadia. UK‚Äôs Alpari, however, did not have a favourable outcome as FXCM, as it became insolvent. However, due to the immense volatility In the market, HFT firms generated positive returns. Brokers like Oanda and Direct FX came out of it unscathed.\nAfter UK‚Äôs decision to exit from the European Union following the results of a national referendum, currency markets globally saw a bloodbath. Nearly, $2 trillion was wiped out from global equity markets. Pound crashed 10% intraday and margin requirement across various asset classes related to GBP & Britain shot up. This was a case of planned event with unknown outcome.\nYet, as per media reports, computer-driven hedge funds generated positive returns. High Frequency Trading (HFT) firms profited from the changes in currency correlations with zillions of transactions throughout the day.\nSecurities transaction tax in India increased on options from 0.017% to 0.05% from June 1, 2016. Daily traders felt the heat, as volumes dropped. Everything was on expected lines, which limited the disruption. The HFT firms got impacted by this not much by the increase in STT directly, but from the fall in volume that limited the profit making opportunities for HFT as well as for most other firms in the market. In the below chart, the decrease in volume of Nifty Options for the first five days in June 2016 is plotted against the corresponding period of the previous month.\nData Source: nseindia.com\nWhat helps HFT make money\nVolumes and volatility contribute most to the success of trading strategies.\n- High volatility ‚Äì Ensures there are opportunities for the traders\n- High volumes ‚Äì Ensures that the opportunities are frequent and sizable\nProfitable Strategies during high volatility events\nThe prime objective here is to capture the bid ask spread during the low volatility events. People buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. Most traders have access to multiple exchanges or trade in multiple asset classes. Therefore, there is also a need to identify the leads and lags of different exchanges, which is embedded in most of the trading strategies.\nVolatility results in disparity at different destinations. Classical arbitrage is a speed game ‚Äì if you are not the fastest or among them, then there is not point using such a strategy. Of course, speed comes with its associated cost. However, if there is volume, there is an opportunity to scale up.\nMachine learning/Directional strategy\nMany High Frequency Trading firms employ directional strategies and Machine Learning that take full use of the short-term price deviations. At least 1000 orders in a minute‚Äôs time can be placed. Traders do not take market risk or hold position for more than a millisecond. Tick based decisions are taken to execute profitable roundtrips trade.\nSentiment Analysis & Machine Readable News based strategies\nSentiment Analysis is gaining popularity with a lot of HFT firms, however, they are more applicable for the events that are certain. People look at the data and react to it. HFT reacts to news much faster than the manual ones. Twitter feeds are used to design trading strategies. The downside is that a lot of processing has to be done to create a quantitative sentiment index and design a strategy around it.\nDifferent kind of market events require relevant market strategies to remain profitable.

The exchange is not based in India and thus is not subject to its jurisdiction, even if its users are.\nVisits to Indian exchanges Wazir X, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber and ZebPay fell 80% between Feb. 1 ‚Äì when Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government announced a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions ‚Äì and Oct. 31, according to SimilarWeb. App downloads fell 93%, AppTweak shows.\nThe tax on crypto gains kicked in starting April 1 and was set at the same level as taxes on earnings from online casinos. But the industry was hit harder by the second tax, which took effect July 1 and was aimed ‚Äúmore for tracking transactions,‚Äù Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.\n‚ÄúThe real killer has been the 1% TDS on each transaction,‚Äù said Ajeet Khurana, a crypto analyst and founder of Web3 platform Reflexical. ‚ÄúBecause effectively this tax tells people not to transact. This has dampened sentiments the most.‚Äù\nWhile trading volumes crashed as much as 70% on Indian exchanges days after the imposition of the tax regime, the data shows website traffic for Binance remained more or less constant from June.\nAs for downloads, by July 22 ‚Äì around three weeks after the start of the transaction tax ‚Äì unique installations of Binance overtook all Indian exchanges.\n‚ÄúEffectively we have gifted volume to Binance,‚Äù Khurana said. ‚ÄúPeople will feel compelled to trade on international exchanges such as Binance because Binance will not implement the TDS.‚Äù\nThe move isn‚Äôt necessarily indicative of tax evasion, Khurana said. A notification from the income tax regulator said residents are supposed to calculate and file taxes themselves when an international exchange doesn‚Äôt implement TDS because it doesn‚Äôt fall under Indian jurisdiction.\nIn response to Parliamentary questions from opposition member of parliament Vivek K. Tankha on Tuesday, Pankaj Choudhary of the Finance Ministry said it does not register foreign crypto exchanges, and the same tax rules apply to anyone trading crypto irrespective of whether the exchange is registered in India or abroad.\nThe response also revealed that the government earned $7.3 million through TDS since its implementation.\n\"The amount of tax earned by the government shows that the actual net volume of all the exchanges combined is around 6,000 crores ($727 million) in Q3 2022 which is way below as compared to 2021, when the crypto market witnessed a massive bull run,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian exchange BuyUcoin.\nThe ‚Äúpoorly designed 30% capital gains tax on crypto assets and sledgehammer approach of 1% TDS on exchange-traded transactions coincided with [the] global rout in cryptocurrencies to kill Indians' interest in cryptocurrencies,‚Äù said Subhash Garg, a former secretary in the Finance Ministry‚Äôs Department of Economic Affairs.\nThat‚Äôs evident not only in transactions but also in interactions with mobile platforms. Searches of keywords including ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù have dramatically declined, while negative terms such as ‚Äúscam,‚Äù ‚Äúwaste‚Äù and ‚Äúfraud‚Äù have increased on reviews and ratings of popular apps in the past 90 days, AppTweak‚Äôs data shows.\n‚ÄúKeyword search volumes (indexed between 5 as the lowest and 100 as the highest) reveal that the popularity of the keyword \"bitcoin\" fell from 72 to 34,‚Äù said Karan Lakhwani, AppTweak‚Äôs India head. ‚ÄúA similar trend was observed for the keyword ‚Äòcrypto,‚Äô wherein keyword search volume fell from 81 to 37.‚Äù\nThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

{"question":"What are the contrasting approaches to audience persuasion between Wittgenstein's critique of casual similes and King's biblical references in his Washington speech?","answer":"Wittgenstein took a strict, literal approach to language use, criticizing Fania Pascal's casual simile about feeling 'like a dog that has been run over' because she couldn't know how that actually felt. In contrast, King successfully employed biblical references and carefully chosen metaphorical language throughout his 17-minute speech at the Lincoln Memorial, using these devices to paint a clear picture of racial injustice and connect with his audience of 200,000 people by drawing parallels between civil rights and historical struggles.","context":["It‚Äôs hard not to admire a good simile. They make literature more evocative: ‚ÄòElderly American ladies leaning on their canes listed toward me like towers of Pisa.‚Äô (Nabakov from Lolita.) They add venom to political bite: ‚ÄòHe looks like a female llama surprised in the bath.‚Äô (Churchill on De Gaulle.) And they help etch the cry for social justice into a nation‚Äôs memory: ‚ÄòWe will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.‚Äô (Martin Luther King, Jr., I Have a Dream.)\nInspired wordcraft such as this is enough to leave you dizzy. But, alas, this is not the time to praise good similes but to bemoan the bad ones.\nAnybody who‚Äôs spent time in front of a gaping white page knows that expressing oneself in a clear, original, and incisive manner is Herculean chore requiring both persistence and wit. Similes are a particular gamble because a good one can invigorate your work, while a bad one can leave readers unmoved, or worse, wincing. (Would students across America be memorizing King‚Äôs speech if he spoke of justice rolling down like a stray tennis ball on a uneven court?) The task is challenging enough for novelists and poets, but as agonizing as creation may be, the most these writers risk with a bad simile is their pride. (In a memoir, Fania Pascal recalled telling Ludwig Wittgenstein that a tonsil operation had left her feeling ‚Äòlike a dog that has been run over.‚Äô Wittgenstein promptly castigated her use of language because she couldn‚Äôt possibly know what a run-over dog felt like.)\nNo, the mettle of a simile is truly tested in non-fiction, specifically when a writer‚Äôs efforts to inform or persuade have broad and lasting consequences. An apt simile might sway a presidency is used during the debates or inspire a massive investment if unleashed during a business pitch. Or, that same apt metaphor might have the power to save the planet.\nConsider the case of James Hansen, the environmental scientist who has emerged as the world‚Äôs foremost authority on the dangers of global warming. In his unnerving book Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity, Hansen recounts the various times he was called to Washington D.C. to give briefings on climate change. At one point in 2001, it seemed the Bush government was ready to take the problem seriously and Hansen was asked to address a select group of officials that included Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice. Hansen discussed the problem of carbon and what he considered the terrifying rise in the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide from 280 ppm in 1750 to 370 ppm in 2000. And then he hit them with his big simile. He pulled a tiny 1-watt Christmas tree bulb from his pocket and brandished it before his powerful audience. The net effect of human-made climate change on the planet, he announced, ‚Äúwas equivalent to having two of those bulbs burning night and day over every square meter of Earth‚Äôs surface.‚Äù\nNow, be honest: Does the Christmas bulb simile work for you? Are you terrified? Flooded with angst over global warning? Compelled to change your energy consumption patterns? I thought so. And, guess what, Cheney, Powell, Rice, and company weren‚Äôt persuaded either. They left the meeting underwhelmed by the climate change threat and whatever interest the Bush government once showed in the issue evaporated after the events of September 11, 2001.\nCan we blame this crucial missed opportunity on one scientist‚Äôs bad simile? Probably not. But, as carbon dioxide emissions continue to soar and the American government continues to dither, we can legitimately wonder where we would be today if there had been a splash of Nabakov and a dash of Churchill in Hansen that day.","The main idea behind Martin Luther King‚Äôs famous speech was to showcase to the American public the degree of racial inequality in the United States, requesting them to abstain from discriminating on the basis of race. It is recognized as one of the best speeches ever given. Read to know the main idea behind Martin Luther King‚Äôs famous speech.\nContext of the speech\nMartin Luther King, Jr. gave the address in front of a throng of around 200,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 march at Washington. The Civil Rights Movement, which peaked in the 1950s and 1960s, was the backdrop against which the speech took place.\nIt has to do with African-Americans‚Äô inequitable treatment in the United States. The speech came at a crucial period for racially disadvantaged people in the United States.\nThe address was 17 minutes long and was written in New York first, then Washington before the event.\nThe main idea conveyed through the speech\nMartin Luther King argued that all people are created equal in his address. Despite the fact that the circumstances in America at the time demonstrated otherwise, King was adamant that it should improve for the better in the future. Read to know the main idea behind Martin Luther King‚Äôs famous speech.\nMany white individuals at the time were taken aback by how quickly the civil rights movement gained traction. Racism continued to exist in many forms across the country.\nFor example, black pupils were not authorized to attend Little Rock‚Äôs Central High School. This is despite the fact that school segregation was declared unconstitutional in 1954, three years before the incident.\nMartin Luther King was very aware of his surroundings. The larger point he is attempting to make with the speech is that the participants in the march at Washington are not demanding anything ostensibly lavish or privileged. These individuals were merely demanding the fulfillment of an almost two-century-old commitment. King points out that racial equality is guaranteed in the Declaration of Independence as an extension of the rights that were initially guaranteed.\nKing‚Äôs speech also does a decent job of painting a clear picture of the issue at hand. He periodically consults the Bible in order to accomplish this. Otherwise, he draws upon literature, music, history, and, most importantly, instances from his own life.\nOne such aspect that he really emphasizes is captivity, which took the form of either slavery or imprisonment. He presents his ideas by using keywords like chains, manacles, prison cells, and other words that hint at a form of restraint on one‚Äôs freedom. He goes a step further in drawing a parallel between the injustice then and in the past.\nIn fact, the beginning part of his speech consists of a startling claim that ‚ÄúThe Negro still is not free‚Äù. Pointing to the harsh fact that African Americans have been subject to chattel slavery for almost a century. He pinpoints that these restraints are both literal and metaphorical in the real world. Literal in the sense where protestors end up getting physically imprisoned for their actions of civil disobedience. Metaphorical in the sense that, African Americans could not purchase real estate in certain neighborhoods.\nAnother figurative hindrance was the presence of a hostile police force, which made African-Americans feel uncomfortable in general. There were other policies that made it difficult for African Americans to find work. King goes on to say that just because they are metaphorical chains doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt real.\nFinally, by using terms like shackles and chains, King is ingeniously connecting the civil rights movement of his day to the harrowing days of slavery. In fact, this connection may be traced all the way back to the Babylonian captivity, which is mentioned in the Bible. In doing so, he portrays the civil rights movement as a long-running fight rather than something that arose out of nothing.\nIn his lecture, King also discusses the concept of American brotherhood. He‚Äôs basically advocating for a more racially integrated America. Despite the fact that many at the time did not believe this was possible, King stood firm in his beliefs and did not back down. He even goes so far as to say that he wanted people to not just tolerate one another, but to gladly coexist.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. also emphasizes the importance of his supporters engaging in ‚Äúcreative‚Äù kinds of protest. Rather than resorting to more aggressive means of protest and then facing strong opponent violence, He begs that his fans keep their dignity and protest as calmly as possible.\nThe key phrase ‚ÄúI have a dream‚Äù is repeated throughout the speech to cement the idea of a better society that Martin Luther King has envisioned for America. An America where there is no racial prejudice. He dreams of a nation where people would not be judged by the color of their skin, but by their character and virtues.\nThe protestors at the march at Washington are also cashing a metaphorical ‚Äúcheck.‚Äù He addresses this by referring to President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Emancipation Proclamation. He does this so that his supporters, those fighting for equality, will be able to follow in the footsteps of a great American leader.\nAnother intriguing similarity between the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement is drawn by him. Lincoln‚Äôs address was set against the backdrop of the Civil War. In the same way that the war generated a very contentious battle in the country, both of these events challenged core freedoms. Both of these conflicts involved the country‚Äôs most fundamental ideals.\nMartin Luther King, Jr‚Äôs speech continues to be a highly relevant speech even today because of its content and structure. The speech also serves as an example for public speakers to learn from. The ideas conveyed were absolutely then and now. Racial segregation is an inhuman thing and must be eradicated from the world.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n- Where was the speech given?\nThe speech was given at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.\n- What is Martin Luther King, Jr. famous for?\nHe is well-known for his contributions to the American Civil Rights movement and his ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f0e599f6-d73a-4754-8394-39799581a22f>","<urn:uuid:e7306ff4-4333-4c93-a5b0-93dc69d30f0a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Como historiador militar especializado en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, me gustar√≠a saber qu√© testimonios directos de veteranos y resistentes franceses se mencionan en la visita a Normand√≠a del 2008. ¬øPodr√≠as detallar sus experiencias?","answer":"Two significant direct testimonies were documented during the 2008 visit. First, WWII veteran Don Robertson (from the 147th Combat Engineers Battalion and later 29th Division) participated in the trip and remarked that he gained massive amounts of new information about what happened around him in 1944. Second, M. Andr√© Heintz, a former French Resistance member and retired university professor, shared his experiences at the Abbaye d'Ardenne. Heintz provided an extensive historical account and, when prompted, told about his personal experiences in the Resistance before the landings and during the bombardment of Caen. His testimony was described as 'powerful' by participants.","context":["International Experience July 2008\nNormandy Allies 2008: Our 10th International Experience\nby Walter Carter & Marsha Smith\nNormandy Allies took its tenth annual trip to visit the sites of the 1944 landings and battles of World War II. During July 13-24, eight students and thirteen adult travelers participated in the International Experience with a team of four Normandy Allies‚Äô Board members: Marsha Smith, LTC(Ret) Peter Combee, SGM(Ret) Charles Frick, and Walter Carter.\nThe students were welcomed by Norman host families for 4 nights during our time in Normandy‚Äîcombining history and culture, as Austin commented: The most significant event that happened during the trip for me was being able to learn and understand about the WWII events and the significance behind them, while also experiencing the French culture via their food, habits, living conditions and general differences from the US. All of these events wrapped together made this trip a real learning experience from a historical and cultural standpoint.\nWe were fortunate to have among our travelers WWII veteran Don Robertson from Des Plaines, OH (originally with the 147th Combat Engineers Battalion attached to the 6th Engineer Brigade, and later transferred into the 29th Division).\nDon said of the trip: ‚Äú[I got] massive amounts of new information and knowledge of what happened around me in 1944. This has been a total explanation of the war.‚Äù\nThe other 12 adults included several educators and one lady who lost her husband on D-Day. One adult commented that the trip was ‚Äúbeyond my wildest dreams, a very enjoyable experience.‚Äù Another added, ‚ÄúA truly outstanding and educational trip with a good group of people.‚Äù The widow‚Äôs daughter said, ‚ÄúI believe [Mom] is at peace with the circumstances surrounding her husband‚Äôs final interment.‚Äù\nOur itinerary covered the landing area from Pegasus Bridge and Sword Beach on the east to Utah Beach and Sainte-M√®re-Eglise on the west. We toured major museums at Pegasus, Caen, Bayeux, Juno Beach, Arromanches, Sainte-M√®re-Eglise, Utah Beach, and Saint-L√¥; walked along the shore and bluffs at Omaha Beach; paid our respects in cemeteries at Bayeux, Colleville, Saint-L√¥, and LaCambe; inspected German fortifications at Pointe de Hoc and Longues sur Mer; visited Graignes, where larger German forces finally overwhelmed a small group of American paratroopers and executed a number of prisoners and French villagers who had helped them; listened at Trevi√®res to the stories of French citizens who lived under the German occupation and through the liberation; viewed an exhibit in the Chateau de Colombi√®res on US Army intelligence work carried out there by some of ‚ÄúThe Ritchie Boys‚Äù (See the wonderful recent film by that title!); and stopped at the Bois de Bretel along Captain Carter Road, where Walter‚Äôs father was killed while trying to rescue wounded solders in June 1944.\nWe are grateful to several French citizens gave us invaluable and hospitable assistance in making our appointments and visits: Jacques and Jeannette Chambon, Jean Claude and Nicole Joussard, Bertrand LeJemtel, Joseph Leprieur, Jean-Pierre Richard, Pierre and Collette Labb√©, Jean Mignon, Jeanine V√©rove, Denis Lesage, Michel Henry, Charles de Maupeou, and (Englishman) Michael Yannaghas.\nWe are also grateful to our team member, LTC(ret) Gene Johnston, who was unable to be with us in person, yet had made many arrangements for our group.\nM. Andr√© Heintz (in black sweater on left), former member of the French Resistance, retired university professor and co-author of ‚ÄúIf I Must Die‚Ä¶From ‚ÄòPostmaster‚Äô to ‚ÄòAquatint'‚Äù, gave us an extensive historical account at the Abbaye d‚ÄôArdenne, just inland from Juno Beach. Here we paid our respects at the memorial to the Canadian prisoners of war who were executed by German SS troops.\nPrompted by SGM Frick, M. Heintz also told of his own experiences as a member of the Resistance before the landings, and during the bombardment of Caen. We were all moved by his story, and by his humble manner of relaying extraordinary events. As participant Pat Stark commented, ‚ÄúAndr√© Heintz was powerful.‚Äù\nJoseph Leprieur, Secretaire of the Town Council of Sainte-M√®re-Eglise, spoke on behalf of Mayor Lefevre and welcomed Marsha Smith and the Normandy Allies participants to a luncheon at the Town Hall. Several members of the Town Council joined us, as well as representatives from the Airborne Museum who later provided the group with admission to the outstanding museum.\nOne full day of the journey is spent at Utah Beach and Sainte-M√®re-Eglise, with additional time at La Fi√®re and Graignes. The airborne assault and the ensuing sacrifices and accomplishments of the 82nd Airborne and the 101st Airborne are a significant part of each Normandy Allies tour.\nOn the July 18 anniversary of the liberation of Saint-L√¥, we were honored to attend the commemoration ceremony with Sally Howie McDevitt and members of her family. Sally is the daughter of Major Thomas Howie, ‚ÄúMajor of Saint-L√¥,‚Äù who was killed in action there in July 1944. We were also joined by French students, Lucile and Virginie.\nWe honored the 29th Division by a visit to its monument at Vierville s/Mer, where we recited the Association‚Äôs preamble. At St. Jean de Savigny we were welcomed by M. Denis Lesage, President of the Wall of Remembrance Association, and a crowd of community residents. Against a backdrop of flag-bearers with their display of colors, and following the sounds of the French and United States national anthems, Marsha Smith and Walter Carter (Honorary President of the Association) spoke to the assembled crowd, and the eight students recited in unison a poem in French.\nSome special moments:\nFor comments from our participants‚Äîsee ‚ÄúTrip Feedback‚Äù\nFor additional information on our work‚Äîrequest our Annual Report from Marsha Smith.

{"question":"Please explain what ammunition loads are recommended for hunting different types of game birds.","answer":"There are six recommended ammunition loads for different bird hunting scenarios: 1) For most upland birds: 1 1/8 ounces of lead 7 1/2s at 1200 fps, 2) For pheasants and sage grouse: 1 1/4 ounces of 5 or 6 shot at 1300 fps, 3) For doves, snipe, rails and teal where non-toxic shot is required: one ounce of steel 6s at 1300 fps, 4) For general non-toxic upland shooting and waterfowling: 1 1/4 ounces of steel 2 or 3 shot at 1450-1500 fps, 5) For geese, swans, and cranes: 1 1/4 ounces of steel BBs at 1450-1500 fps or HeviMetal BBs, 6) For turkeys: 1 3/4 ounces of 5 shot at 1250 fps, specifically Winchester Long Beard.","context":["Photograph by John Hafner\nSo here‚Äôs the first question. It‚Äôs liable to have a very long answer so you might consider responding to it in installments.\nShotguns are the weapon of choice (often by necessity) for a large variety of winged game. But winged game can mean anything from twenty pound wild turkeys to tiny bobwhite quail. Like the birds, the guns and ammo used to hunt them will usually be quite variable. Leaving brand names aside, can you tell me what type equipment you think best fits each kind of bird? Specifically, I would be interested in your choice of shotgun style (e.g. pump, auto, etc.), gauge, and ammo. And, of course, the reasons why. (Perhaps a spread sheet would be useful?) Here‚Äôs the list:\n1. Turkeys (obviously in a class of their own)\nc. Prairie Chickens\nd. Sage Hens\ne. Sharptailed Grouse\nii. Valley Quail\niii. Mearns Quail\niv. Scaled Quail\nv. Mountain Quail\nh. Mountain Grouse\ni. Ruff Grouse\nii. Franklin Grouse\niii. Blue Grouse\na. Freshwater divers\nb. Sea ducks\nd. Puddle ducks\ng. Sandhill Cranes\nh. Miscellaneous (coots, etc.)\n_There! That should keep you busy for a while! _\nAnonymous in Canada\nThank you for the that question. It is way longer than my answer, which is depressingly simple: a 3-inch, 12 gauge gas gun with an alloy receiver and a 26-inch barrel and choke tubes will work for every bird in North America. It will be light enough to carry, hit hard enough for the biggest of birds, possess the ability to be loaded down to 28-gauge levels, and the gas system will reduce recoil.\nThe shorter barrel length (I prefer 28 inches on my semiautos) is a concession to the need for a slightly shorter, lighter gun for upland and turkey hunting in the woods. Throw in a slug barrel and you can shoot deer and pigs with it, too.\nI‚Äôll even name names: Browning Maxus, Winchester SX3, Beretta A400 Action, Remington V3.\nFor those who prefer inertia and the tradeoff is better function in harsh conditions vs more felt recoil, I‚Äôll add the Benelli M2 or Montefeltro, along with the Franchi Affinity and the new Browning A5.\nOn to ammo, and while I can‚Äôt recommend one all-purpose load for everything, we‚Äôll get it done with six loads for our one gun.\n1 1/8 ounces of lead 7 1/2s at 1200 fps for almost every upland bird save pheasants and sage grouse, who get 1 ¬º ounces of 5 or 6 shot at 1300.\nOne ounce of steel 6s at 1300 fps if you hunt doves, snipe, rails etc and non-toxic shot is required, plus all teal hunting.\nFor all other non-toxic upland shooting and most waterfowling, 1 ¬º ounces of steel 2 (maybe 3) shot at 1450-1500 fps.\nFor geese, swans, cranes, 1 ¬º ounces of steel BBs at 1450-1500, or HeviMetal BBs.\nFor turkeys, 1 ¬æ ounces of 5 shot at 1250 fps or so, and make it Winchester Long Beard.\nThat answer is the truth, but I wouldn‚Äôt be much of a gun nut if I let it be the last word. Therefore, the upcoming Installment two will suggest a five-gun battery for North American wingshooting."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b8fefded-5f2d-4c23-80d5-34d013971d3b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between safety requirements for cavalry and Wars of the Roses battle reenactments, and how do their weapon training approaches compare?","answer":"In cavalry reenactments, safety focuses on proper equipment like helmets with leather chinstraps and correct weapons handling - starting with carbines first, then sabers, and pistols last. For Wars of the Roses reenactments, participants must be 16 or over, wear helmets (even if not fighting), and receive weapons training before participating. Both types require specific safety equipment - cavalry needs proper period-accurate protective gear while Wars of the Roses fighters need helmets, padded jacks, and gloves. The weapons training differs: cavalry emphasizes proper use of period-specific firearms and sabers, while Wars of the Roses focuses on safe 'pulled' blows with pole weapons, swords and archery.","context":["Equipment list for the aspiring\n2nd Dragoon/Cavalry Reenactor\nA sad tale...\nListen my friends and you shall hear, of the shopping tale of a\nOne pistol would do but two were more fun, now not enough money\nleft for the carbine, just one.\nThe coat was too heavy kinda like a blanket, and the dye turned\nall purple when the sun it had baked it.\nThe saddle you know had a fiberglass tree, and the \"authentics\"\nmade mirth and laughed at it with glee.\nHis heart it was golden and desired to do right, but the rush to\nbuy stuff created a blight.\nThe next time he shops will be with more wisdom, some friends\nwith the knowledge will help the decision.\nYes it's happened to more of us than we wish to admit.\nWe look on those early mistakes and wish we could Hang 'Em High.\nIt's better to go slow and get it right than waste time and a Fist Full of\nDollars rushing to get all that great stuff you thought you saw the other\nguys using, when For a Few Dollars More you can do much better in the\nauthenticity of your gear and clothing.

Archers can act as an independent group or join others. A single reenactor will be given responsibility for the direction of all archers during a display. Gunners will also report to a responsible individual. The display is marshalled according to a script decided by the organisers and group captains.\nWhen two blocks meet they will 'fight'. This involves attempting to score a safe hit against an opponent with your weapon. When hitting someone the blow is 'pulled' to prevent full contact. This can be fun and both blocks will approach it with good humour. The blocks will fight back and fourth and move about the field until they are required either to win, or break and be defeated. Those on the defeated side will be expected to 'die' or be 'captured' but not before fighting as best they can against the victors. Whichever side you are on, if you receive a 'killing blow' from an opponent within view of the public you must 'die'. A battle looks pretty silly if the whole of one side remains unscathed! It is important to remember that we are there for the public and should give them the best show possible.\nSome battles are 'open ended'. These are usually combat displays with varying numbers of participants. Hits are scored against the opposition until it is decided that the display should end. At this point good hits are taken as killing blows by both sides. Those still standing are the victors. This type of display often involves fewer people, so it is important to make the final combat entertaining for the public.\nSome battles will involve horses. The Woodvilles sometimes work with 'Destrier', a group dedicated to the medieval horse in battle and jousting (click here to visit their site).\nIf you want to bring a horse for display you will need additional equipment and information. Ask the Woodville group captain or another horse owner for advice (we have several riders in the group). Alternatively contact Destrier (click).\nSafety is the most important thing in a battle reenactment. Participants should be responsible individuals. Each group holds public liability insurance and this only remains valid if safety rules are followed.\nTo take part in a battle you must be 16 or over and wear a helmet. You will also be given some weapons training before you begin.\nPeople can fall, weapons can break and arrows can be blown off course, so even if you don't plan fighting (e.g water carrying) you must wear a helmet.\nTo fight in a bill-block you will need a helmet, padded jack, gloves and a weapon. An archer will need the same but will have a bow and safety arrows (called 'blunts'). A gunner will also have the same plus a hand gun or cannon.\nOnce you have the basic kit you can expand upon it. Some start with a jack and helmet and end up in full armour. It all depends upon personal preference and budget.\nClick here to go to the next page to find out MORE ABOUT FIGHTING KIT\nBack to Top"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f8f2b6d7-4d8c-48bb-b046-64e19abfbb26>","<urn:uuid:4549113b-b06d-4bfb-9d7a-d59b09eb7df8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do DuPont's synthetic biology innovations compare to LanzaTech's in terms of their environmental impact and industrial applications?","answer":"DuPont and LanzaTech represent different approaches to sustainable manufacturing through synthetic biology. LanzaTech focuses on converting carbon waste emissions from steel factories into transportation fuel, producing over 16 million gallons of ethanol annually at their Beijing facility. Meanwhile, DuPont developed a genetically engineered microorganism that converts renewable cornstarch into 1,3-propanediol for their Sorona¬Æ polymer production, replacing petroleum-based processes. Both innovations reduce reliance on fossil fuels, but target different industrial applications - LanzaTech addresses carbon emissions from existing industrial processes, while DuPont's technology creates new sustainable materials for textiles and consumer products with properties like improved stretch, recovery, and stain resistance.","context":["Synthetic Biology for Sustainable Cities\nWho will you meet?\nCities are innovating, companies are pivoting, and start-ups are growing. Like you, every urban practitioner has a remarkable story of insight and challenge from the past year.\nMeet these peers and discuss the future of cities in the new Meeting of the Minds Executive Cohort Program. Replace boring virtual summits with facilitated, online, small-group discussions where you can make real connections with extraordinary, like-minded people.\nSustainability is in vogue, with businesses and cities jostling to improve their public image and produce goods and services using renewable sources. Yet cities exponentially swell and carbon emissions continue to increase. Global CO2 emissions rise nearly every year (about 36 billion tons in 2014), with the bulk of these derived from solid and liquid fuels.\nScientific and economic solutions to curtail these emissions have been proposed for decades, with some success along the way. But 21st century problems necessitate modern solutions, and businesses ‚Äì the major contributors to carbon emissions ‚Äì are not typically willing to promote sustainability at the cost of profits.\nFortunately, synthetic biology ‚Äì an engineering approach to biology that creates and uses tools to design and build functions in cells ‚Äì offers a means to implement sustainable manufacturing processes that can reduce costs while producing materials, fuels, and chemicals that are superior to existing products on the market.\nThe engineering and adaptability of genetically-modified organisms holds the solution.\nSynthetic Biology: The Next Industrial Revolution\nIn these letters, scientists reported the first successful genetic circuits operating in living cells. Modeled on electrical circuits, the scientists constructed two different types of biological circuits in living organisms using entirely synthetic DNA, programming the cell to perform predefined behaviors not found in nature.\nA skilled group of physicists, bioengineers, and molecular biologists soon flocked to the discipline, eager to program cells that could perform untapped functions. In the years that followed, engineered cells were processing and recording information, executing complex behaviors (like counting and forming patterns) and converting cheap starting materials into valuable compounds and medicines.\nIn April 2019, the field of synthetic biology graced the cover of The Economist, broadly conveying both its promise and perils. While synthetic biology has come a long way in the last two decades, its greatest test, industrial scale manufacturing for a circular and sustainable economy, is only just beginning.\nFeeding Organisms for a Profit\nMicrobes have been exploited by humans for thousands of years. By supplying bacteria and yeast with simple sugars, they have long produced tasty foods like bread, wine, beer, and cheese.\nBut synthetic biologists are now rerouting the metabolic pathways of these very same organisms so that they consume carbon waste, like carbon dioxide and methane, rather than sugar. By changing their food supply, the cells can still produce a repertoire of products, albeit with less waste and expense.\nSome industrial cities, mainly in Asia, are already taking carbon dioxide and methane waste from factories and using it as a feedstock to manufacture a milieu of commercial products. Bioplastics, including pesky PET, are being degraded by engineered organisms. Microbes that produce nitrogen are even being used as a synthetic fertilizer to reduce our dependence on ammonia, the production of which is energy intensive and wasteful.\nAs our ability to reliably and rapidly engineer organisms improves, living cells will increasingly be used to produce goods at industrial scales. Synthetic biology solutions can be implemented in many sectors of cities and municipalities to address current challenges in sustainable fuel production, waste and carbon emissions recycling, improvement of crop yields, and for the production of high-nutrient foods.\nThese applications will have broad benefits regardless of where human communities arise, and the same technologies that will help sustain us on earth will also support our journey to inhabit the stars.\nAboard the International Space Station, orbiting earth at nearly five miles per second, engineered seeds are growing into plants that could soon manufacture specific proteins, including antiviral antibodies, on-demand. NASA is also exploring synthetic biology to convert carbon dioxide to valuable organic materials on Mars and in deep space, since crude oil and other carbon sources will not be readily available. Other scientists are actively exploring ways to leverage synthetic organisms to produce food in space or to help terraform Mars‚Äô atmosphere.\nThe realization of these seemingly far-flung dreams is brought closer by the businesses engaged in synthetic biology R&D. More companies join the biological revolution every day, eager to improve their products while reducing cost and waste.\nIndustrial synthetic biology is already making a dent in the circular economy.\nIf cells can be engineered to convert carbon to fuels and medicine, so too can they be modified to convert waste products ‚Äì such as those billions of tons produced annually ‚Äì to do the same. But plausibility rarely translates to lasting results. Take the city of Chicago as an example.\nIn 2015, residents and activities in Chicago generated 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Reducing these exorbitant emissions is no small feat, and it is unlikely that a single remedy will provide a full solution. But synthetic biology can, and already is, making cities like Chicago more sustainable by converting carbon emissions to valuable materials.\nLanzaTech is an industrial-level synthetic biology company that harnesses carbon waste and converts it to transportation fuel using engineered organisms. They opened their first industrial facility outside of Beijing last year, which collects emissions from a steel factory and generates more than 16 million gallons of ethanol per year. Soon, the company will expand to four additional facilities, reducing emissions comparable to removing hundreds of thousands of cars from the road each year.\nThe chemical giant DuPont is also actively shifting their R&D towards synthetic biology solutions that can mitigate pesky chemical manufacturing issues through their Industrial Biosciences division. They are already operating large, active research programs to reduce food waste, produce fuels renewably and manufacture biomaterials with market-driven solutions using genetically-engineered organisms. Earlier this year, DuPont began construction on a new European headquarters for their Industrial Biosciences division in the Netherlands, with the aim of expanding their global impact.\nOther companies are exploring synthetic biology as a means to reduce carbon emissions in agriculture, a sector that makes up nearly 10% of US greenhouse gas emissions. The results are incredibly promising.\nPivot Bio, based out of Berkeley, California, announced their successful development of a nitrogen-producing microorganism that can replace synthetic fertilizers. The production of ammonia is energy-intensive and wasteful, contributing many millions of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year. Pivot Bio‚Äôs engineered strain will reduce the agricultural industry‚Äôs reliance on synthetic fertilizers, without impacting crop yield. In the latest growth trial, the microbe outperformed synthetic fertilizer by 7.7 bushels per acre.\nThe ‚Äúmeatless meat‚Äù industry has also been expanding in recent years, leveraging the capabilities of engineered organisms to recreate the taste of real meat without the cow. Impossible Foods, creators of the famous Impossible Burger, use engineered yeast to produce heme, the major protein found in blood, to give plant-based burgers the taste of red meat.\nSpiber is a Japanese company that produces synthetic spider silks, foams and films by designing proteins that assemble into pre-defined patterns and structures at the molecular level. Farming silk from spiders is excruciatingly time consuming. Now, the company can modify natural silk fibers and design new material functions in a matter of days with synthetic biology. While normal silk contracts in water, for example, Spiber has created altered versions that are hydrophobic, expanding their utility for outdoor apparel. They previously partnered with The North Face to produce high-performance ski jackets made from bioengineered materials.\nPushing beyond textiles, Checkerspot, based out of Berkeley, California, engineers microalgae, a type of photosynthetic organism found in water, to produce oils that are difficult to manufacture using chemistry alone. These include oil and water-repellant coatings and even a palm oil replacement. Large areas of rainforest are cleared to produce palm oil currently, destroying ecosystems and exacerbating carbon emissions.\nIn all of these examples, nature is the breadboard and scientists are only limited by their imagination. A nearly infinite array of chemicals and materials can be produced from living organisms, with CO2 and other carbon sources, like methane, as the fodder.\nBut there are roadblocks ahead.\nFuture Outlooks for a Bio-Based Solution\nImagination is not implementation. Despite the remarkable progress of synthetic biology over the last two decades, widespread public acceptance remains elusive. Gene editing continuously dominates headlines; a trend that is not always positive. Opposition to genetically-modified (GM) crops remains especially fierce. Of those Americans that have ‚Äúheard a lot‚Äù about GM foods, nearly half see them as health risks, despite the widespread adoption of GM foods in agriculture over the last several decades.\nWhile synthetic biology has had less media coverage than GM food specifically, accurate and timely dissemination of information will prove crucial in swaying public acceptance, particularly as engineered organisms manufacture medicines and other consumables in greater volumes. Engineered E. coli have been used to produce human insulin since 1978 amid little public backlash, but there is no certainty that future medicines, clothing lines, and fuels produced using synthetic biology will be so readily accepted.\nWhile a circular economy has long been imagined, it has only recently become fully implementable. For this next stage of the fight, synthetic biology ‚Äì along with economic incentives and political sway ‚Äì will usher cities and economies, on earth and in space, toward their inexorable destinies.\nNicholas McCarty is a bioengineering PhD student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

This strategy would connect more Americans to high-speed internet while also driving down prices by increasing competition among local ISPs.\nIn addition to potentially helping narrow the digital divide, middle mile infrastructure would also provide backup options for networks if one connection pathway fails, and it would help support regional economic development by connecting businesses.\nOne of the most visceral manifestations of the combined problems of urbanization and climate change are the enormous wildfires that engulf areas of the American West. Fire behavior itself is now changing. Over 120 years of well-intentioned fire suppression have created huge reserves of fuel which, when combined with warmer temperatures and drought-dried landscapes, create unstoppable fires that spread with extreme speed, jump fire-breaks, level entire towns, take lives and destroy hundreds of thousands of acres, even in landscapes that are conditioned to employ fire as part of their reproductive cycle.\nARISE-US recently held a very successful symposium, ‚ÄúWildfire Risk Reduction ‚Äì Connecting the Dots‚Äù for wildfire stakeholders ‚Äì insurers, US Forest Service, engineers, fire awareness NGOs and others ‚Äì to discuss the issues and their possible solutions. This article sets out some of the major points to emerge.\nWhether deep freezes in Texas, wildfires in California, hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, or any other calamity, our innovations today will build the reliable, resilient, equitable, and prosperous grid tomorrow. Innovation, in short, combines the dream of what‚Äôs possible with the pragmatism of what‚Äôs practical. That‚Äôs the big-idea, hard-reality approach that helped transform Texas into the world‚Äôs energy powerhouse ‚Äî from oil and gas to zero-emissions wind, sun, and, soon, geothermal.\nIt‚Äôs time to make the production and consumption of energy faster, smarter, cleaner, more resilient, and more efficient. Business leaders, political leaders, the energy sector, and savvy citizens have the power to put investment and practices in place that support a robust energy innovation ecosystem. So, saddle up.","Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge: 2003 Greener Reaction Conditions Award\nMicrobial Production of 1,3-Propanediol\nInnovation and Benefits: DuPont and Genencor International jointly developed a genetically engineered microorganism to manufacture the key building block for DuPont's Sorona¬Æ polyester. The process uses renewable cornstarch instead of petroleum to make environmentally friendly, cost-competitive textiles.\nSummary of Technology: DuPont is integrating biology in the manufacture of its newest polymer platform, DuPont Sorona¬Æ polymer. Combining metabolic engineering with polymer science, researchers are introducing a microbial process in a business that, historically, has relied solely on traditional chemistry and petrochemical feedstocks. This achievement, comprising biocatalytic production of 1,3-propanediol from renewable resources, offers economic as well as environmental advantages. The key to the novel biological process is an engineered microorganism that incorporates several enzyme reactions, obtained from naturally occurring bacteria and yeast, into an industrial host cell line. For the first time, a highly engineered microorganism will be used to convert a renewable resource into a chemical at high volume.\nThe catalytic efficiency of the engineered microorganism allows replacement of a petroleum feedstock, reducing the amount of energy needed in manufacturing steps and improving process safety. The microbial process is environmentally green, less expensive, and more productive than the chemical operations it replaces. 1,3-Propanediol, a key ingredient in the Sorona¬Æ polymers, provides advantageous attributes for apparel, upholstery, resins, and nonwoven applications.\nScientists and engineers from DuPont and Genencor International, Inc. redesigned a living microbe to produce 1,3-propanediol. Inserting biosynthetic pathways from several microorganisms into an industrial host cell line allows the direct conversion of glucose to 1,3-propanediol, a route not previously available in a single microorganism. Genes from a yeast strain with the ability to convert glucose, derived from cornstarch, to glycerol were inserted into the host. Genes from a bacterium with the ability to transform glycerol to 1,3-propanediol were also incorporated. Additionally, the reactions present naturally in the host were altered to optimize product formation. The modifications maximize the ability of the organism to convert glucose to 1,3-propanediol while minimizing its ability to produce biomass and unwanted byproducts. Coalescing enzyme reactions from multiple organisms expands the range of materials that can be economically produced by biological means.\nFor more than 50 years, scientists have recognized the performance benefits of polyesters produced with 1,3-propanediol; however, the high cost of manufacturing the ingredient using petroleum feedstock and traditional chemistry kept it from the marketplace. The biological process using glucose as starting material will enable cost-effective manufacture of Sorona¬Æ polymer, which will offer consumer fabrics with softness, stretch and recovery, easy care, stain resistance, and colorfastness. A unique kink in the structure of the polymer containing 1,3-propanediol allows recovery at a high rate when it is stretched. As a result, Sorona¬Æ improves fit and comfort because the fabric quickly recovers its original shape when stretched, for example, in knees or elbows. The resilience of Sorona¬Æ also adds beneficial features to automotive upholstery and home textiles. In resin applications, Sorona¬Æ's barrier characteristics protect moisture, taste, and odor.\nBiology offers chemical manufacturers attractive options for the production of chemicals while adhering to the principles of green chemistry. This microbial production of a key polymer ingredient from renewable sources is one example. By integrating biology with chemistry, physics, and engineering, DuPont develops new solutions that enhance the environment and improve upon existing materials."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b45e815-98ac-4eb6-87ae-c97e27fcfc97>","<urn:uuid:7cc5047e-8a5f-48ed-8045-c47a7fab9182>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¬°Hola! I'm interested in machine precision and safety standards. How do manufacturing tolerances affect production costs, and what are the essential safety requirements for protecting workers? üîß","answer":"Manufacturing tolerances significantly impact costs - tighter tolerances are more expensive because they're harder to achieve on certain surfaces, require more thorough inspection, and often result in costly deburring processes for raised edges. As for worker protection, safety requirements mandate that safeguards must prevent any body part from contacting dangerous moving parts, be firmly secured and tamper-resistant, protect against falling objects that could become projectiles, create no new hazards like sharp edges, and allow for safe lubrication without guard removal. These safeguards should not interfere with operator efficiency while ensuring comprehensive protection.","context":["CNC machining is capable of incredible precision manufacturing at affordable costs, but as with any process, there are ways to get those costs down further‚Äîthrough prudent decision-making and a better understanding of the tools and techniques involved. The following design guide will provide you with some practical tips for controlling costs when you‚Äôre designing projects meant for CNC machining.\nKeep Those Corners Rounded\nCNC machines are capable of creating 90-degree corners, but the process adds a significant amount to machining time. This is because the machine has to stop, then be rotated, and then continue along its path. That extra time can start to eat into your budget, so a more sensible design option would be to include rounded corners. This way, the machine can continuously run and won‚Äôt have to take needless breaks that will extend your production time.\nGo Light On The Deep Pockets\nLike trying to do right angles, attempts at deep-pocketed parts take more time than is ideal. This sort of design, with all of that extra material being removed, often requires special tools to achieve. It‚Äôs more prudent, generally, to limit pocket depth to save time and money.\nWatch Your Tolerances\nIn the simplest terms, machine tolerance (also known as dimensional accuracy) is the amount of variance allowed in the dimensions of whatever part you‚Äôre manufacturing. The greater the difference between those upper and lower limits, the ‚Äúlooser‚Äù the tolerances are said to be. Smaller differences, meanwhile, are known as ‚Äútight‚Äù tolerances.\nNow, designs with tighter tolerances are almost always going to be more expensive because they‚Äôre a bit trickier to achieve on certain surfaces (thanks to the limitations of some machines) and they often require more thorough inspection to make sure they‚Äôre produced correctly.\nThere‚Äôs also the deburring cost to consider, as attempts to achieve those tight tolerances often result in burred edges (those raised parts on the sides that can form after machine tooling) on manufactured parts. As you may have suspected, the deburring process can be rather costly, thus, an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way to reduce some of your costs is to loosen some of your tolerances.\nConsider Thick Walls Instead Of Thin Ones\nThin walls on components are typically fragile, which means that they‚Äôre going to take more time to produce correctly, and as we‚Äôve already demonstrated more than once, time is money. In lieu of those time-consuming, thin walls, try using thicker walls in your part design. This is, of course, assuming weight isn‚Äôt too great a concern in your design (thicker walls will weigh more). If it is, you may have to consider other cost-saving measures instead.\nMake Use Of Standard Drill Sizes\nSomehow it all comes back to time: by incorporating standard drill sizes into your plans, you can cut down on the amount of time that you‚Äôre spending in production, since those are typically ready to go. If you‚Äôre using custom sizes, on the other hand, prepare for manufacturing to take longer and cost more as the manufacturer will probably need to break out their end mill tool to get the job done.","Moving machine parts have the potential to cause severe workplace injuries. Crushed fingers or hands, amputations, burns, or blindness can be prevented through machine safeguards. Simply put, any machine part, function, or process that may cause injury must be safeguarded.\nWhere Mechanical Hazards Occur\nDangerous moving parts in these three basic areas need safeguarding:\n- Point of Operation: is the area where work is being done on a material, such as cutting, shaping, boring, or forming of material.\n- Power Transmission Apparatus: is the area of the mechanical system that transmits energy to the parts of the machine performing the work. These components include flywheels, pulleys, belts, connecting rods, couplings, cams, spindles, chains, cranks, and gears.\n- Other Moving Parts: include all parts of a machine that move while the machine is operating. These parts can be rotating, reciprocating, or transversing. Feed mechanisms and auxiliary parts of the machine are considered other moving parts as well.\nHazardous Mechanical Motions and Actions\nMany mechanical motions and actions present hazards to the worker.\nThe following types of motions and actions are common to nearly all machines and recognizing them and their danger is essential to worker protection.\n- Rotating: Rotating parts are dangerous because they can grip clothing or skin, forcing an arm or hand into a dangerous area.\n- Reciprocating: Reciprocating motions are dangerous because a worker may be struck or pinned during the back and forth or up and down motion.\n- Transverse: Transverse motion is movement in a straight continuous line. The danger in transverse motion lies in the possibility of a worker getting caught in a pinch point or dragged by the part itself.\n- Cutting: The cutting action may involve all three motions and is dangerous at the point of operation. While the cutting action can be dangerous to fingers, limbs, torso and head, flying chips or debris pose a serious danger to the eyes and face.\n- Punching: The punching action results when pressure is applied to the ram for the purpose of stamping metal or other materials. The danger occurs at the point of operation when the material is inserted, held and withdrawn by hand.\n- Shearing: Shearing action involves applying power to a slide or knife to trim or shear metal or other materials. Like the punching actions, the hazard occurs at the point of operation.\n- Bending: The bending action occurs when power is applied to a slide to draw or stamp metal or other material. The hazard occurs at the point of operation, similar to punching and shearing.\nIn order to protect the machine operator, safeguards must meet minimum general requirements.\n- Prevent contact: The safeguard must prevent hands, arms, and any other part of an operator's body from making contact with dangerous moving parts. A good safeguarding system eliminates the possibility of the operator or another worker placing parts of their bodies near hazardous moving parts.\n- Secure: Operators should not be able to easily remove or tamper with the safeguard because a safeguard that can easily be made ineffective is no safeguard at all. Guards and safety devices should be made of durable material that will withstand the conditions of normal use. They must be firmly secured to the machine.\n- Protect from falling objects: The safeguard should ensure that no objects can fall into moving parts. A small tool dropped into a cycling machine could easily become a projectile that could strike and injure someone.\n- Create no new hazards: A safeguard defeats its own purpose if it creates a hazard such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unfinished surface that could cause a laceration. The edges of guards, for instance, should be rolled or bolted in such a way to eliminate sharp edges.\n- Create no interference: Any safeguard that impedes an operator from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding may actually enhance efficiency since it relieves the operator's apprehensions about injury.\n- Allow safe lubrication: If possible, workers should be able to lubricate the machine without removing the safeguards. Locating oil reservoirs outside the guard, with a line leading to the lubrication point, will reduce the need for the operator or maintenance operator to enter the hazardous area.\n- Concepts and Techniques of Machine Guarding , US Department of Labor\n- OSHA Machine Guarding: eTool\n- OSHA Machine Guarding: Safety and Health Topic Page\n- OSHA Guarding of Portable Powered Tools (29 CFR 1910.243"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c5de1296-3919-4e42-87f9-7f0a1f7c1bd5>","<urn:uuid:ef54e330-945d-4577-bdf6-3daf00e5322a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the artistic evolution of canoe imagery in Canadian art, and how is Brad Copping incorporating canoes in contemporary glass art?","answer":"The artistic depiction of canoes in Canadian art has evolved significantly over time. In earlier art, canoes were portrayed simply as common elements of New World life, while contemporary interpretations have become more complex and ambivalent. As for contemporary glass artist Brad Copping, he is currently finishing a residency at the Canadian Canoe Museum where he is creating an innovative piece - a full-scale, working cedar-strip canoe completely encrusted in mirrors for an upcoming exhibition, representing a unique fusion of traditional Canadian imagery with contemporary glass artistry.","context":["We‚Äôve got a kind of either/or relationship with the stuff. Either it‚Äôs the ubiquity of, say, the common run-of-the-mill drinking glass, perhaps lying shattered in a gazillion little lethal splinters and shards on the kitchen floor at our feet, or it‚Äôs something like one of Dale Chihuly‚Äôs massive and complex sculptural blown glass installations, breathtakingly beautiful, sinuous amalgams suspended, perhaps, above our heads.\nI‚Äôm indulging in a couple of stereotypes, to be sure, seeking out a couple of oppositional extremes so as to better talk about, and map out a place for, the work of Canadian glass artist Brad Copping. Copping emerged in the early 1990s from Sheridan College in Toronto, an institution that‚Äôs been one of the hotbeds of clay and glass teaching in Canada. He‚Äôs done time at the Pilchuk Glass School in Washington State, and at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine, and worked and studied with sculptor David Nash in Scotland. He now lives and works in a small rural community in eastern Ontario.\nAnd on the continuum I marked out with aforementioned extremes, Copping‚Äôs aesthetic in many ways tends much closer towards that of the drinking glass. Much closer. Literally, in fact, for the drinking glass figures prominently in a number of his sculptural pieces.\nAnd here, before going any further, is where it need be noted that Copping is in no way a glass purist, devoted to the aesthetic, medium-specific singularity of this remarkable stuff. His work does things using glass, and bypasses utter devotion to the expression of artistic technique (which, I hasten to add, he has plenty of). Copping‚Äôs work isn‚Äôt self-focused. It points outwards and away into the world.\nSo this is glass, but glass with a bit of a twist (no pun intended), rooted in the mundane but remarkably fecund realm of the utilitarian: in the drinking glass. Domestic Fuel, a piece from 2009, makes my point. Though Copping is no stranger to integrating non-glass elements into his work (wood, paper, wire, the casings for artillery shells, and even books figure in some of his sculptural works), Domestic Fuel in some ways toes a narrow aesthetic line. It‚Äôs all glass, from top to bottom. And the larger part of it is, well, comprised of glasses. A small, moulded glass house, pitched roof and all and about the size of a small doll house, comprises the base from which the work rises up, for you see, in many ways it‚Äôs all about a kind of weightlessness. The house‚Äôs chimney transitions into a tall, thin, not quite straight column of drinking glasses stacked, upside down, one onto the other. And in keeping with the conceit that this is denotative of smoke rising from the house, the glasses are blackened and filthy; dirty streaks even run down along the roof and sides of the house.\nMiddle of Somewhere (2007) is a wall-mounted installation that does incorporate non-glass components. But the heart of the piece is glass ‚Äì in the form of (you guessed it) glasses. Along the length of metal shelf are a series of clear drinking glasses that are pierced through on either side (blown this way by Copping) to permit the intrusion of a tubular length of tightly rolled-up topographical maps that runs from one end of the work to the other, joining all the elements together.\nAnd even earlier than that, in 2005, he created Level Conversation, another wall-mounted works made up of two (ahem) drinking glasses, each independently resting on its own small shelf, connected to one another via a long vinyl tube running out the bottom of each and sagging down towards the floor. Water fills the tubing and the glasses and it is, of course, an aesthetically delightful iteration of a simple water level.\nAll this isn‚Äôt, obviously, to suggest or imply that Copping hasn‚Äôt got the chops. Boy does he. The water glass may be fundamental to his work, but he‚Äôs more than amply capable of blowing exquisite glass for non-installational purposes that surmounts the blandly utile. When the G8 Summit of world leaders was held in Canada in 2010, Copping created Forest Glass, a beautiful series of blown water glasses used by the meeting leaders. Back in 2001, he created water glasses and goblets for the Canadian Embassy in Japan. And he‚Äôs even created unique wine bottles for a prestigious Canadian winery. In short, he‚Äôs more than capable of being medium-specific; he‚Äôs more than capable of blowing extraordinarily beautiful glass vessels. He can do the aesthetically straight and narrow. It‚Äôs just that larger issues are perhaps best (and quite possibly more interestingly) dealt with via sculptural installations incorporating non-glass elements.\nWhich inevitably brings me back to, yes, drinking glasses. Entangled (2007) is another variant of this common, everyday object. It‚Äôs also pierced (again, specifically blown this way), numerous holes in the vessel negating any utile function and making way for a weave of rope in, around, and through it.\nIn his mixed media sculptural works, Copping marries glass to the world, a marriage that is all about transparency, about a specific kind of seeing through and into the world that only glass can truly address, a medium at once visually porous (though not exclusively and absolutely), and yet all about a surface that can aesthetically root our seeing (though too not exclusively and absolutely). Glass permits.\nCurrently, Copping is finishing up an artist residency at the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough, Ontario, working for the past seven months on a project that involves completely encrusting a full scale, working cedar-strip canoe in mirrors for an upcoming exhibition.\nAt this stage of his artistic journey, it‚Äôs apparently time for some reflection.\nBy Gil McElroy","In the Wilds: Canoeing and Canadian Art\nJune 27 to November 15, 1998\nThe canoe is a Canadian icon as familiar as the moose, the beaver and the maple leaf and, as such, is an important symbol of our mythologized northern identity. Not surprisingly, therefore, the theme of canoes and canoeing is one that has often been employed by artists, from prehistoric times to the present. As may be seen in this exhibition, the manner in which artists have depicted the canoe has changed over the years. In art from earlier days, the canoe was largely portrayed as a ubiquitous element of life in the New World. The interpretation of the canoe image in contemporary art has shifted considerably to become a more complex, even ambivalent one.\nAppropriated from First Nations culture, the canoe facilitated exploration, trade, mapping/surveying and, ultimately, colonization and settlement. Canoeing as a means of transportation made Canada possible and although it seems obvious, it should perhaps be stressed that canoes were used by anyone who travelled beyond the early developed eastern areas of the nation. Missionaries, explorers, fur traders, military topographic, and professional or fine artists who travelled north and west did so by canoe. So perfect and practical both in design and form, the canoe is still the most appropriate way to travel through boreal country.\nOnce the trans-Canada railway was completed, more eastern-based artists were able to travel West, and perhaps, once there, did some travelling by canoe. Although we have no documentation on the canoeing of artists like the so-called ‚ÄúCPR artists‚Äù of the late 19th century, this mode of transport must have affected the painters' vision, experience, and thus, their rendering of the land. Happily, however, there is some written material on the English artist Frances Anne Hopkins and her Canadian canoe voyages, including thoughts on how canoeing influenced her painting. Hopkins was active in Canada in the 1860s and 1870s, and painted many pictures featuring canoes, her principal method of transport through the Great Lakes with her husband, an inspector for the Hudson's Bay Company. Robert Stacey's coining of the term ‚Äúcanoe-eye-view‚Äù in his catalogue essay on the artist is of itself a welcome addition to this area of study. It carries with it implications for our enriched experience of paintings like those by Hopkins, which were consciously executed to appear as though painted from a canoe vantage point‚Äîas indeed many of them were.1\nIn contrast to Hopkins' detailed, naturalistic canoe scenes, a fanciful theme that has captured the imaginations of several French--Canadian artists is that of La Chasse Galerie. One version of this popular legend tells of a group of lumbermen at a remote camp, who wished to visit their loved ones in Montreal and sold their souls to the devil so that they might travel by flying canoe, with Satan himself paddling in front.2 Cross-culturally, in primitive belief systems, the boat (or canoe) image is a soul-boat, a vessel for carrying the souls of the dead to the afterworld, often travelling through the skies. It would seem that the Quebec legend retains elements of this archetypal symbolism.\nFor many people, what readily comes to mind when considering the subject of canoeing and Canadian art is the Group of Seven, and the Group's immediate forerunner and companion, Tom Thomson. In using the canoe to travel into places like Algonquin Park, the Group was not out of keeping with general cultural trends of their time. After the turn of the century, the canoe was no longer associated solely with First Nations people or the fur-trade and exploration, but had been fully adopted by whites, first for hunting and fishing and later, for pure recreation.\nAlthough it may seem surprising, information on the canoeing abilities of the members of the Group is sketchy. A.Y. Jackson recalls that J.E.H. MacDonald could neither swim nor paddle.3 Jackson himself was a late starter, but apparently became proficient as a canoeist. At first, however, he was paddled about by Tom Thomson.4 Lawren Harris mentions having had a canoe shipped north on the Group's box-car visits to Algoma, (1918-1921), but no reference is made as to who paddled it.5 In general, the canoeing experience seems less central to the work of such artists as MacDonald, Lismer, Varley and Jackson (and their contemporaries) than to that of Tom Thomson. Most of their best-known works seem very much to have been composed while they were on land.\nRelatively few Thomson paintings have canoes in them; most depict the landscape itself, or could be said to be concerned with ‚Äúpainting-as-painting,‚Äù the landscape serving as a jumping-off point for his treatment of paint, colour, and space. In those rare paintings of Thomson's in which the canoe does appear, it does so modestly and rather prosaically, merely as another compositional element. Looking at Thomson's paintings and sketches, it is quite easy to imagine that the majority of the artist's small sketches were partially or fully executed while he was in a canoe. The low horizon line common to so many of these works was likely employed to give the sense of being surrounded, cupped in the landscape, with the overhead skyscape as important as the vegetal one on shore. The implied presence of the canoe underneath and around the painter‚Äîand by implication and extension, around the viewers of the paintings‚Äîcan be as palpably felt as that of the caf√© table underneath a Venetian sketch by J.W. Morrice.\nEmily Carr, the West Coast contemporary of the Group, widely known today for her works depicting the Northwest Coast First Nations villages and artifacts, as well as the British Columbia rainforest, does not appear to have canoed herself. However, she did create a few paintings featuring First Nations ocean-going canoes, which, as in her other works of aboriginal artifacts, were an effort to document First Nations creations before they were entirely destroyed by the influence of white culture.\nAn aspect of canoeing that holds a very strong appeal for many contemporary artists is the activity's spiritual nature. Richard Gorman explains: ‚ÄúI don't have to canoe, I could use any kind of boat, or even a car, to paint in Central Ontario, but I like the poetry of the canoe‚Äîwhich can only be called artistic.‚Äù6\nLandon Mackenzie's first painting depicting a canoe was Canoe/Woman, in which the kneeling figure of a woman paddles a canoe bearing the spherical cosmos in the bow. Dolphin-like shapes play around in the water surrounding her. In a sense, Canoe/Woman could be seen as a female answer to the classical motif of Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders.\nKnown for years as a printmaker, Don Holman has recently turned to painting. Canoeing on Bell's Lake includes his own canoe as an element in the painted construction. For this artist, the canoe becomes a personal symbol, an image evoking a feeling of freedom.\nIn Michael Robinson's work, the canoe, portrayed in great detail, comes alive, whether borne aloft while being portaged, being paddled in the water, or appearing in the sky as a celestial craft. While Robinson's themes draw on the myths and legends of his people, his etchings and paintings are more than mere illustrations of these tales. They also function metaphorically, with dark and light referring to evil and illumination, respectively, and horizontal bands across the painting or print surface alluding to the different levels of the shamanic universe.\nBlake Debassige is highly aware of the spiritual significance of the canoe, and includes its image in his work with this notion in mind. His work is bold and immediate, inviting the viewer to delve more deeply into the meanings of the subjects portrayed.\nIn the work by contemporary artists who employ the canoe image, or whose work is informed in some way by their own canoeing, there is often a strong streak of nostalgia present. This nostalgia is not just for Canada's past, but for Canadian art history, and past artists who canoed, especially‚Äîas one might suspect‚Äîfor Tom Thomson.\nGordon Rayner's paintings are often related to his canoeing experiences on the Magnetawan River in Ontario. In a painterly series entitled Concerning a Drowning in Canoe Lake, which includes Evidence II, Rayner explored the theme of Tom Thomson as a mythic hero.\nStill other contemporary artists use canoeing to allow them to penetrate into places that would otherwise be inaccessible. The canoe image may or may not appear in their work, but their art is, at least in part, a response to the experience of canoeing and to the wilderness where canoeing takes them.\nThe influence of Jeannie Thib's canoeing enters her work subtly, and only rarely manifests itself as an image of the canoe itself. In her untitled piece, she was interested in exploring the relationship of lines from a text describing animal behaviour with the notion we have of what human behaviour is, especially when humans are placed in a wilderness setting. Blueprint considers the human urge to make a plan, leave a mark, and overlay a system of logic on the natural world.\nBridget Corkery has included the canoe theme in several of her woodcuts, linocut prints and small book projects. Canoe Trip depicts a canoe paddle, seen from the level of the water line, moving through fragments of flotsam and jetsam. An underlying concern for the threatened wilderness environment in Canada would seem to be active in this work, albeit, made subtle (but perhaps more cuttingly effective) by its rather dead pan treatment.\nEd Bartram declares that he has realized increasingly, but only recently, the huge role that the canoe and canoeing play in his work. His recent print of shoals is a departure from his earlier etchings of rock faces, as we are now given a view towards the distance, rather than facing a rock surface frontally and at close range. But both directions of this work come from his canoeing on Georgian Bay, and are visceral, emotional responses to that environment.\nAnother aspect of the canoe that has been explored by several contemporary Canadian artists is its important status in popular, grassroots Canadian culture.\nThe Regina ‚Äúfunk‚Äù painter, David Thauberger, has been working with images drawn from popular culture for some years. As it happens, Thauberger has never been in a canoe himself, and chooses the image, in his typical light--hearted, humourous manner, for its pop-culture, myth-of-the-north associations.\nAlthough Keith Harder expresses a love of canoeing in his writing, his pictures seem light-hearted and fun loving about his craft. The interior ‚Äútableau,‚Äù which includes his Christmas tree and is ironically titled Coureurs de Bois, places his work in line with David Thauberger's tongue-in-cheek approach.\nThe beauty of the canoe's shape and structure has appealed to artists who don't necessarily canoe themselves, and have not necessarily been influenced in their work by the canoeing experience. In two of his series of works, Derek Besant selected the canoe as well as other images, such as a wheelbarrow and an umbrella, as neutral, recognizable objects. The canoe in Site/A.drift, he writes, ‚Äú. . . is not so much a canoe, but rather a shape, a piece of identifying debris . . .‚Äù7\nPaul B√©liveau has canoed extensively in northern Quebec, and writes that he feels the beckoning power of the canoe, calling on us to embark on a journey.\nSeveral contemporary Canadian artists explore the notion of the canoe as an archetypal representation or stand in for the self, or the human body.8\nDavid Alexander uses landscape as a springboard for feeling and an expressive use of paint, much in the Canadian tradition of David Milne, and in the prairie context of painters such as Dorothy Knowles. In Alexander's work the canoe may be seen as a metaphor for the human body or the self. Alex Colville treats the canoe archetypally, as he does other objects in his work: every possible nuance of meaning seems to be alluded to, so that a non-specific, open-ended reading of the painting seems encouraged. Often the canoe seems to be a parallel to, even a metaphor for the body of the female in the paintings, echoing the archetypal idea of the female body as vessel.\nKevin Sonmor has canoed extensively in Alberta and British Columbia, but the earth-toned landscape setting of Tarpaulin III looks more prehistoric and ominous than anything that may have been remembered from these trips and transcribed literally. The single canoe looks primordial, like an imagined bog-canoe, oozing bitumen, and surrounded by steam.\nAll of these themes‚Äîthe nostalgia, spirituality, love of the canoe\nstructure, and the notion of the canoe as an archetype‚Äîseem to intertwine in\nmany of the artists' thinking, and in their relation to the canoe. As a subject,\nor a point of departure, the canoe and canoeing cut across regional,\ngenerational, media-related, and stylistic boundaries in the complex fabric of\ncontemporary Canadian art, allowing an enriching examination and enjoyment of a\ngroup of otherwise unrelated artists.\n1.

{"question":"Para mi trabajo necesito saber... ¬øCu√°les son los componentes principales que hay que considerar al implementar un programa de gesti√≥n del conocimiento vs. los factores cr√≠ticos para el engaged scholarship? Gracias!","answer":"For knowledge management programs, there are five core components: people (increasing individuals' influence through knowledge), processes (establishing best practices), technology (tools and automation), structure (organizational transformation), and culture (cultivating knowledge-sharing). For engaged scholarship, the critical factors are: engagement of knowledge users in research prioritization and application, organizational support structures for collaboration, incentives for both researchers and knowledge users to work together, and changes to organizational processes to facilitate partnership. Both approaches emphasize the importance of organizational culture and structures, but knowledge management has a broader focus on technical systems while engaged scholarship emphasizes collaborative relationships.","context":["Bowen, S. J. & Graham, I. D. (2013). From knowledge translation to engaged scholarship: Promoting research relevance and utilization. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 94(1 Suppl 1), S3-8. doi:10.1016/j.apmr.2012.04.037\nIt is now accepted within health care that clinicians and managers should base their practice and decision making on evidence. One would think that this would be quite a simple undertaking‚Äîif good research is available and well communicated, people will act on it. But most of our efforts to date, which have focused largely on research transfer, have had modest success. This has created a need to reexamine the evidence‚Äîand the assumptions‚Äîon which our current knowledge-to-action activities are based. This article will summarize what is known about what works in promoting evidence-informed action, tracing the evolution from a linear focus on research transfer to complex strategies for user engagement. Using concrete examples, it will illustrate the strengths and limitations of various approaches and implications for rehabilitation medicine.\nI enjoyed this paper because it focuses the Knowledge to Action (KTA) gap from one of knowledge transfer/diffusion to one of knowledge production. This is a very important re-framing which has implications for anyone seeking to maximize the impacts of research on end users.\nThe KTA gap is commonly defined as a knowledge transfer problem. In other words, it is proposed that the reason knowledge is not moved into action is because there has been a failure to transfer it effectively to the intended audience‚Ä¶Within the field of health, there has been increasing recognition that researchers cannot, however, rely on diffusion: new knowledge will not, without active dissemination and implementation efforts, necessarily make its way to the intended user‚Äîor result in action.\nI would go further (as the authors do, below) to say that even active dissemination isn‚Äôt enough. We need implementation efforts, which ask us to think about how we create the conditions to enable our downstream implementation partners to take up research evidence and implement it into products, policies and services that will have an impact on end beneficiaries. And how do researchers do this when they are not working in the companies that produce the products, with government Ministries who are making the policies or with community agencies who are delivering the services?\nA critical factor predicting research use is the engagement of knowledge users in prioritization, definition, interpretation, and application of research. It makes more sense to bring the end user partners into the research process upstream and practice integrated knowledge translation (iKT). This turns the KTA Gap into one of knowledge co-production (iKT) and not one of knowledge dissemination (end of grant KT). Research goes unused not because of a simple failure in dissemination, but because researchers fail to address the most important problems facing clinicians, managers, and decision-makers.\nTable 1 in the article identifies the differences between end of grant dissemination (knowledge transfer paradigm) and integrated KT (engagement paradigm).\nAnd then the authors use the term engaged scholarship (=iKT) to describe this form of collaboration. Engaged scholarship (defined as a form of collaborative inquiry between academics and practitioners that leverages their different perspectives to generate useful knowledge) is based on the belief that higher-quality, more relevant research results from true collaboration and from integrating the diverse perspectives of multiple stakeholders.\nThis paper also recognizes the role of organizations as knowledge brokers. Recognition of the importance of organizational context has resulted in a shift from focusing on individuals who broker knowledge between specific individuals to the concept of knowledge brokering as an organizational process. This requires changing the way organizations do business (set priorities, allocate resources, and plan, implement, and evaluate programs). Changes to organizational structure and processes are needed to support this new way of doing business. This requires us to think about not just who we hire but how we create organizational structures that facilitate engaged scholarship.\nHowever researchers and knowledge users report barriers to engaged scholarship. The authors recognize that this type of collaboration won‚Äôt happen without support for both sides. We must collectively find ways to provide incentives to both researchers and knowledge users to work together in identifying pressing research questions and conducting solutions-focused research to address these questions in a timely manner.\nThis is another example of good Canadian KT scholarship. We have many leaders in the scholarship and practice of KT/KMb in Canada. We can trace this back to the early days of CHSRF (now CFHI) in the 1990s and the creation of CIHR in 2000 with its legislated mandate to ‚Äúexcel, according to internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence, in the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved health for Canadians, more effective health services and products and a strengthened Canadian health care system‚Äù.\nQuestions for brokers\n- Is engaged scholarship enough? What about ‚Äúengaged implementation‚Äù where researchers work with end users to support the implementation of research evidence into products, policies and services.\n- What incentives do researches and knowledge users need to work together?\n- Why is Canada a leader in KT research and practice? Hint, check an old blog I wrote for a suggestion.\nResearchImpact is producing this journal club series as a way to make the evidence on KMb more accessible to knowledge brokers and to create on line discussion about research on knowledge mobilization. It is designed for knowledge brokers and other knowledge mobilization stakeholders. Read the article. Then come back to this post and join the journal club by posting your comments.","by Robert Simmons of the Forsythe Solutions Group\nA winning knowledge management program (KMP), one that increases staff productivity, product and service quality, and deliverable consistency by capitalizing upon codified intellectual and knowledge-based assets, cannot subsist on technology solutions alone, It must also consider people, processes, structure, and culture.\nMany organizations leap into a knowledge management (KM) solution (document management, data mining, blogging, community forums, and the like) without first considering the purpose or objectives they wish to fulfill or how the organization will adopt and follow best practices for managing its knowledge assets long term.\nThis is the first in a series of three articles in which I will present a phased approach for implementing and sustaining a successful KMP. Part I introduces some key KM terms and concepts and then presents the eight-phase approach at a high level. Respectively, Parts II and III discuss phases 1 thru 4 and 5 thru 8 in more detail.\nTerminology and Concepts\nWhile Knowledge Management as a discipline is relatively young having started in the ‚Äô70‚Äôs, KM terminology, models, and best practices are still being established and adopted. I‚Äôve listed the more widely accepted terms and concepts below. They should provide some awareness and basic principles upon which to build your organization‚Äôs KMP.\nKM best practices specify different types of knowledge. The types most often referenced are tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.\nTacit knowledge represents internalized knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as how he or she accomplishes particular tasks.\nExplicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that‚Äôs easily communicated to others.\nIn 1995, Nonaka and Takeuchi introduced the Socialization-Externalization-Combination-Internalization (SECI) model (Fig. 1) in their book The Knowledge Creating Company wherein tacit knowledge is extracted to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is re-internalized into tacit knowledge. It demonstrates a continual evolution of knowledge through socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization.\nIn 2007, the IT Infrastructure Library v3 (ITIL v3) introduced a Knowledge Management process including definitions for data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.\nData is a set of discrete facts about events.\nInformation comes from providing context to data.\nKnowledge is composed of the tacit experiences, ideas, insights, values and judgments of individuals as well as from the analysis of information and data.\nAnd wisdom gives the ultimate discernment of the material and having the application and contextual awareness to provide a strong, common sense judgment. The Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) structure (Fig. 2) demonstrates phases of increased context and understanding and how data is transformed into information, then knowledge, and finally wisdom.\nITIL v3 also refers to a Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS) as set of tools and databases used to manage knowledge and information. While ITIL‚Äôs application of KM is primarily focused on the development, delivery, support, and improvement of IT services, the architecture of the SKMS (Fig. 3) has relevance from a business perpective, as well.\nUnderstanding this archtecture ‚Äî how data and information is stored, related, and integrated (data and integration layers) and how people will want to access and utilize the information (knowledge processing and presentation layers) ‚Äî is the first step in addressing the technology needs of a knowledge management system (KMS) solution.\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, a successful KMP will consider more than just technology. The core components of KM include people, processes, technology, structure, and culture (Fig. 4).\nPeople represents how you increase the ability of individuals within the organization to influence others with their knowledge.\nProcesses involves how you establish best practices and governance for the efficient and accurate identification, management, and dissemination of knowledge.\nTechnology addresses how you choose, configure, and utilize tools and automation to enable KM.\nStructure implies how you transform organizational structures to facilitate and encourage cross-discipline awareness and expertise.\nAnd culture embodies how you establish and cultivate a knowledge-sharing, knowledge-driven culture. The eight-phase approach explained below addresses all areas of the KM framework.\nImplementing a KPM is no easy feat. You will encounter many challenges along the way including many of the following:\n- Inability to recognize or articulate knowledge; turning tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.\n- Geographical distance and/or language barriers in an international company.\n- Limitations of Information and Communication technologies.\n- Loosely defined areas of expertise.\n- Internal conflicts ‚Äì professional territoriality.\n- Lack of incentives or performance management goals.\n- Poor training or mentoring programs.\n- Cultural barriers ‚Äì this is how we‚Äôve always done it.\nThe following eight-phase approach will enable you to identify these challenges early on so that you can plan for them, thus minimizing the risks and maximizing the rewards. This approach was developed based on logical, tried-and-true activities for implementing any new organizational program. The early phases involve strategy, planning, and requirements gathering while the later phases focus on execution and continual improvement.\nPhase 1: Establish program objectives ‚Äì Before selecting a tool, defining a process, developing workflows you must envision and articulate the end-state. Different organizations may have different reasons for implementing a KMP, but in order to establish the appropriate program objectives, identify and document the business problems that need resolution and the business drivers that will provide momentum and justification for the endeavor.\nProvide both short term and long term objectives that address the business problems and support the business drivers. Short term objectives should seek to provide validation that the program is on the right path while long term objectives will help to create and communicate the big picture.\nPhase 2: Prepare for change ‚Äì KM is more than just an application of technology. It involves cultural changes in the way employees perceive and share knowledge they develop or possess. One common cultural hurdle to increasing the sharing of knowledge is that companies primarily reward individual performance. This practice promotes a ‚Äúknowledge is power‚Äù behavior that contradicts the desired knowledge-sharing, knowledge-driven culture end-state you are after.\nSuccessfully implementing a new KMP may require changes within the organization‚Äôs norms and shared values; changes that some people might resist or even attempt to quash. To minimize the negative impact of such changes, it‚Äôs wise to follow an established approach for managing cultural change such as John Kotter‚Äôs 8-step change process, which will be covered in more detail in part II of this series."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d021462-7a25-4901-b84d-109b382a31f3>","<urn:uuid:616799cc-a961-4db4-8f16-d9524feb77e8>"],"error":null}

Blocks, heads, rods, crankshafts and camshafts are thoroughly cleaned in a chemical jet wash or hot tank to remove any contaminations that could accelerate both early component and engine failure.\nPrior to being thoroughly inspected by our quality control department, crankshafts are precision machined to exact tolerances, polished & magnafluxed.\nHeads are carefully resurfaced to ensure a proper sealing surface with the block and a finish consistent with today's new gasket materials. Valve height is mic-d and every head is vacuum tested to assure accurate valve seating.\nBlocks are inspected by magnetic particle which aims to reveal any cracks and imperfections. Cylinders are then bored, honed and inspected to precise tolerances. Torque plate honing is performed on particular engines to avoid the chances of cylinder head distortion after the head is bolted and torqued to the block. This process eliminates a major cause of engine blow-by. Block surfaces are machined and then inspected to ensure proper finish.\nCamshafts are carefully inspected and precisely machined to provide correct lift. Lobs are measured with a micrometer to ensure the OEM tolerances are met.\nConnecting rods are first cleaned, then machined to O.E.M. specifications. This is done before being honed to the standard diameter of previous equipment to achieve an even distribution of stress on the bearings. New bushings are fitted and machined in all bushed rods. Every rod is carefully inspected for bend and twist.\nOur C10 Cat long block engines all receive a standard set of new parts such as pistons and rings, bearings, gaskets and seals, and liners. These new parts assure good performance and reliability throughout the life of your engine. The new parts are a combination of OEM and Aftermarket when available.\nRequest a Quote\nPlease fill out the form below with your information and request. A member of our staff will be with you shortly.\nREMANUFACTURED ENGINES STANDARDS\nTo remanufacture is to make as close to new as possible. Therefore, wearable parts are automatically replaced. All Caterpillar C10 engines core materials are also thoroughly inspected and examined against original equipment specifications for correct dimensional tolerances. Replacement parts are new or requalified. If new, parts are made in the same production processes as original equipment. Testing is performed to manufacturer specifications and original production standards.\nCAT C10 Long Block Parts List:\n- Complete Loaded Cylinder Head\n- Timed Front Gear Group\n- New Upper and Lower Gasket Set\n- Intermediate Cover\n- Cylinder Block\n- Connecting Rods\n- **1 Year Warranty\n*Note: We can provide new oil pumps, oil coolers, water pumps, turbos, injectors and fuel pumps for additional cost with the long block but will not come assembled to the engine.\n**First 6 Months Parts & Labor, Second 6 Months Parts Replacement Only.

Testing your engine‚Äôs oil pressure on the dyno saves you having to access hard to reach components after the engine‚Äôs been installed. During a shakedown on the dyno, you‚Äôll be able to detect and correct leaks and find the source of any vibration or noise. Repeated passes on the dyno allow you to evaluate your build‚Äôs controllability under a full range of loads. In the end, you‚Äôll leave knowing that your ignition timing, AFR, oil pressure, MSD/carb, lash and cam timing, and all supporting systems are ready to go!\nOur custom-built engine dyno\nLike our Chassis Dyno, our Engine Dyno was built for superior performance. It‚Äôs built on the same platform that GM uses for their Nascar program. At its heart is a Go Power Dual Rotor water absorber that can test up to 2,400 ft. Lbs. of torque at 10,000 rpm. We‚Äôve proven our dyno has reliability by comparing HP for HP and Tq for Tq test results against engines tested in a government lab.\nThe dyno can accommodate both carburetted and fuel injected engines with multiple high-pressure fuel outputs for 300 HP to 2,000 HP. We can test gas, diesel, nitrous, and bio-fuel engines ‚Äì everything from a simple 2-stroke up to 10-cylinder gas engines.\nWe can test headers of any size or style ‚Äì including Pulling Headers. Unique to the industry, we‚Äôve introduced a mobile water absorber so you can test your engine with complete exhaust systems from header to tailpipe ‚Äì even with the catalytic converter and muffler fitted!\nWe built our dyno test cell to be one of the quietest in the industry and installed a large viewing window so you can watch as we run through the engine pulls. Our pricing includes tuning, but we realize some of you may prefer to do your own tuning and we‚Äôre pleased to offer a complete range of tools for your use.\ntest and tune to your goals\nIt‚Äôs important to identify your testing & tuning goals before your appointment. Your goal may be to break-in, test and tune a rebuild, or to compare the performance of different components such as camshafts, carbs, headers, air induction systems, etc. Or, you may just want to see what she can do! Whatever the reason for your visit, our expert technicians will work with you to meet your goals.\nBreaking in a new or rebuilt engine\nProperly breaking in a new engine when running it during the first minutes or hours is critical to performance and to extend the life of your engine. If done right, your rings will seat perfectly, and your cam lobes will be properly surfaced. We follow a specific procedure for break-in using carefully calibrated engine loads. After break-in, we can proceed directly to tuning for power and performance!\nENGINE DYNO Pricing\nEngine Dyno Testing & Tuning\nPrice includes tuning; however, we recognize that some experienced tuners may prefer to do their own tuning with limited assistance.\nAdditional time $100/hour\nmore tuning options\nOur chassis dynamometer was custom-built with the best components available.

{"question":"What is the highest elevation point in Lithuania versus Slovakia, and which country has the higher peak?","answer":"Slovakia has the higher peak. Slovakia's highest point is Gerlachovsky Stit at 2,655 meters, while Lithuania's highest point is Auk≈°tojas Hill at only 294 meters above sea level.","context":["Geography of Lithuania\n|‚Ä¢ Total||65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi)|\n|Coastline||262 km (163 mi)|\n|Borders||Total land borders:|\n1,574 km (978 mi)\n|Highest point||Auk≈°tojas Hill |\n294 m (965 ft)\n|Lowest point||Baltic Sea |\n|Longest river||Nemunas |\n917 km (570 mi)\n|Largest lake||Lake Dr≈´k≈°iai |\n44.79 km2 (17.29 sq mi)\n|Exclusive economic zone||7,031 km2 (2,715 sq mi)|\nLithuania is a country in the Baltic region of Europe. The most populous of the Baltic states, Lithuania has 262 km (163 mi) of coastline consisting of the continental coast and the \"Curonian Spit\" coast. Lithuania's major warm-water port of Klaipƒóda (Memel) lies at the narrow mouth of Curonian Lagoon, a shallow lagoon extending south to Kaliningrad and separated from the Baltic sea by Curonian Spit, where Kur≈°i≈≥ Nerija National Park was established for its remarkable sand dunes.\nSituated between 56.27 and 53.53 latitude and 20.56 and 26.50 longitude, Lithuania is glacially flat, except for morainic hills in the western uplands and eastern highlands no higher than 300 metres. The terrain is marked by numerous small lakes and swamps, and a mixed forest zone covers over 33% of the country. The growing season lasts 169 days in the east and 202 days in the west, with most farmland consisting of sandy- or clay-loam soils. Limestone, clay, sand, and gravel are Lithuania's primary natural resources, but the coastal shelf offers perhaps 1,600,000 m3 (10 Mbbl) of oil deposits, and the southeast could provide high yields of iron ore and granite.\nLithuania is situated on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Lithuania's boundaries have changed several times since 1918, but they have been stable since 1945. Currently, Lithuania covers an area of about 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi). About the size of West Virginia, it is larger than Belgium, Denmark, Latvia, the Netherlands, or Switzerland. Lithuania is situated on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea and borders Latvia on the north, Belarus on the east and south, and Poland and the Kaliningrad region of Russia on the southwest. It is a country of gently rolling hills, many forests, rivers and streams, and lakes. Its principal natural resource is agricultural land.\nLithuania's northern neighbor is Latvia. The two countries share a border that extends 453 kilometres. Lithuania's eastern border with Belarus is longer, stretching 502 kilometers. The border with Poland on the south is relatively short, only 91 kilometers, but it is very busy because of international traffic. Lithuania also has a 227-kilometer border with Russia. Russian territory adjacent to Lithuania is Kaliningrad Oblast, which is the northern part of the former German East Prussia, including the city of Kaliningrad. Finally, Lithuania has 108 kilometers of Baltic seashore with an ice-free harbor at Klaipƒóda. The Baltic coast offers sandy beaches and pine forests and attracts thousands of vacationers.\nTopography and drainage\nLithuania lies at the edge of the North European Plain. Its landscape was shaped by the glaciers of the last Ice Age, which retreated about 25,000‚Äì22,000 years BP (Before Present). Lithuania's terrain is an alternation of moderate lowlands and highlands. The highest elevation is 297.84 meters above sea level, found in the eastern part of the republic and separated from the uplands of the western region of Samogitia by the fertile plains of the southwestern and central regions. The landscape is punctuated by 2,833 lakes larger than 10,000 m2 and 1,600 smaller ponds. The majority of the lakes are found in the eastern part of the country. Lithuania also has 758 rivers longer than ten kilometres. The largest river is the Nemunas (total length 917 km), which originates in Belarus. The other larger waterways are the Neris (510 km), Venta (346 km), and ≈†e≈°upƒó (298 km) rivers. However, only 600 kilometers of Lithuania's rivers are navigable.\nOnce a heavily forested land, Lithuania's territory today consists of only 32.8 percent woodlands‚Äîprimarily pine, spruce, and birch forests. Ash and oak are very scarce. The forests are rich in mushrooms and berries, as well as a variety of plants.\nLithuania has a humid continental climate (Dfb in the K√∂ppen climate classification). Average temperatures on the coast are ‚àí2.5 ¬∞C (27.5 ¬∞F) in January and 16 ¬∞C (60.8 ¬∞F) in July. In Vilnius the average temperatures are ‚àí6 ¬∞C (21.2 ¬∞F) in January and 16 ¬∞C (60.8 ¬∞F) in July. Simply speaking, 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F) is frequent on summer days and 14 ¬∞C (57.2 ¬∞F) at night. Temperatures occasionally reach 30 or 35 ¬∞C (86 or 95 ¬∞F) in summer. Winters when easterly flows from Siberia predominate, like 1941‚Äì42, 1955‚Äì56 and 1984‚Äì85, are very cold, whereas winters dominated by westerly maritime airflows like 1924‚Äì25, 1960‚Äì61 and 1988‚Äì89 are mild with temperatures above freezing a normal occurrence. ‚àí20 ¬∞C or ‚àí4 ¬∞F occurs almost every winter. Winter extremes are ‚àí34 ¬∞C (‚àí29 ¬∞F) at the coast and ‚àí43 ¬∞C (‚àí45 ¬∞F) in the east of Lithuania. The average annual precipitation is 800 millimetres (31.5 in) on the coast, 900 mm (35.4 in) in Samogitia highlands and 600 mm (23.6 in) in the eastern part of the country. Snow occurs every year, it can be snowing from October to April. In some years sleet can fall in September or May. The growing season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern part. Severe storms are rare in the eastern part of Lithuania and common nearer the coast.\nThe longest measured temperature records from the Baltic area cover about 250 years. The data show that there were warm periods during the latter half of the eighteenth century, and that the nineteenth century was a relatively cool period. An early twentieth century warming culminated in the 1930s, followed by a smaller cooling that lasted until the 1960s. A warming trend has persisted since then.\n|Climate data for Lithuania|\n|Record high ¬∞C (¬∞F)||12.6\n|Record low ¬∞C (¬∞F)||‚àí40.5\nConcerned with environmental deterioration, Lithuanian governments have created several national parks and reservations. The country's flora and fauna have suffered, however, from an almost fanatical drainage of land for agricultural use. Environmental problems of a different nature were created by the development of environmentally unsafe industries. Air pollution problems exist mainly in the cities, such as Vilnius, Kaunas, Jonava, Ma≈æeikiai, Elektrƒónai, and Naujoji Akmenƒó‚Äîthe sites of fertilizer and other chemical plants, an oil refinery, power station, and a cement factory.\nWater quality has also been an issue. The city of Kaunas, with a population of about 400,000, had no water purification plant until 1999; sewage was sent directly into the Neman River. Tertiary wastewater treatment is scheduled to come on-line in 2007. River and lake pollution are other legacies of Soviet carelessness with the environment. The Courland Lagoon, for example, separated from the Baltic Sea by a strip of high dunes and pine forests, is about 85 percent contaminated. Beaches in the Baltic resorts, such as the well-known vacation area of Palanga, are frequently closed for swimming because of contamination. Forests affected by acid rain are found in the vicinity of Jonava, Ma≈æeikiai, and Elektrƒónai, which are the chemical, oil, and power-generation centers. Lithuania was among the first former Soviet republics to introduce environmental regulations. However, because of Moscow's emphasis on increasing production and because of numerous local violations, technological backwardness, and political apathy, serious environmental problems now exist.\nNatural hazards: hurricane-force storms, blizzards, droughts, floods\nEnvironment‚Äîcurrent issues: contamination of soil and groundwater with petroleum products and chemicals at former Soviet military bases\n- party to:\nAir Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulphur 85, Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n- signed, but not ratified:\nLithuania has an abundance of limestone, clay, quartz sand, gypsum sand, and dolomite, which are suitable for making high-quality cement, glass, and ceramics. There also is an ample supply of mineral water, but energy sources and industrial materials are all in short supply. Oil was discovered in Lithuania in the 1950s, but only a few wells operate, and all that do are located in the western part of the country. It is estimated that the Baltic Sea shelf and the western region of Lithuania hold commercially viable amounts of oil, but if exploited this oil would satisfy only about 20 percent of Lithuania's annual need for petroleum products for the next twenty years. Lithuania has a large amount of thermal energy along the Baltic Sea coast which could be used to heat hundreds of thousands of homes, as is done in Iceland. In addition, iron ore deposits have been found in the southern region of Lithuania. But commercial exploitation of these deposits probably would require strip mining, which is environmentally unsound. Moreover, exploitation of these resources will depend on Lithuania's ability to attract capital and technology from abroad.\nNatural resources: peat, arable land, amber\n- arable land: 33.48%\n- permanent crops: 0.47%\n- other: 66.05% (2011)\nIrrigated land: 13.4 km2 (2011)\nTotal renewable water resources: 24.9 km3 (2011)\nArea and boundaries\n- Total: 65,300 km2\n- Land: 62,680 km2\n- Water: 2,620 km2\n- Australia comparative: slightly smaller (5.5%) than Tasmania\n- Canada comparative: about 9% smaller than New Brunswick\n- United Kingdom comparative: about 17% smaller than Scotland\n- United States comparative: slightly larger (4%) than West Virginia\n- Total: 1,574 km\n- Border countries: Belarus 680 km, Latvia 576 km, Poland 91 km, Russia (Kaliningrad) 227 km\nCoastline: 262 km (163 mi).

{"question":"¬øCu√°nto crece la planta night-blooming cereus and what's the best way to maintain its size? How to prune it correctly?","answer":"The night-blooming cereus grows vigorously once established and can develop vines up to 40 feet long. To control its shape and size, you can trim it using sterile pruners. The plant is a climbing, vinelike perennial with leafless, three-sided stems that can be trained to climb a support using its brown aerial rootlets along the stems. It's commonly grown as a container plant, and you should only transplant it when it has completely outgrown its container, as being root-bound actually encourages more flowers.","context":["Like its cousin, the Christmas cactus, night-blooming cereus (Hylocereus undatus), commonly called Christ in the Manger, is a clamoring, vinelike perennial is the plant family Epephyllum. The hardy cactus develops leafless, three-sided stems that can be trained to climb a support via brown aerial rootlets along the stems. Cultivated as a container planting in Sunset Climate Zones 4 to 7 and 12 to 14, the unusual plant is an intriguing addition to patios, decks and doorways. The Christ in the Manger plant only blooms once a year, with blooms that last only one night. Purchase night-blooming cereus plants online or from local nurseries or take a cutting from the plant of a friend or family member. With proper care, night-blooming cereus plants live for decades and become treasured family heirlooms.\nPrepare a potting mixture of 1 part sand, 1 part organic compost and 1 part potting soil. Fill a 2-inch pot with the mixture. The container must have a hole for drainage.\nPosition a 3- to 4-inch cutting with the cut edge about one-quarter of its length in the soil in the pot. Water lightly at planting. The soil should be moist, but not soggy.\nPlace the cutting in a bright location, out of direct sunlight. The cutting should develop roots in about six weeks, anchoring itself in the soil.\nWater the cutting when the first inch of soil is dry to the touch. The plant prefers to be on the dry side and can die from root rot if overly watered.\nTransplant the cutting to a 6-inch pot when the cutting has developed roots and shows evidence of new growth. Porous, non-glazed clay pots work best. Do not transplant again until the plant has completely outgrown its container. Plants that are root-bound, tend to produce the most flowers. Once established, the plant prefers a bright, full-sun location. Night-blooming cereus does not bloom until the plant is well established, at about 4 to 5 years old.\nFeed the plant monthly with a 20-20-20 fertilizer during spring and summer. Cease fertilization during the fall and winter months to encourage flowering. The plant can develop one or more buds. It is an impressive sight to watch the exquisite, highly fragrant trumpet-shaped flowers open. You can actually see the movement as the petals unfold. The flower are creamy white with a deep yellow center. As the plant matures, multiple flower buds form, blooming every two weeks from October through December.\nMove the plant indoors when the mercury drops to protect night-blooming cereus from freezing temperatures. The plant can suffer severe damage at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. When brought indoors, the plant requires a totally dark environment from dark to dawn (mimicking outdoor conditions) in order to establish flower buds.

{"question":"How do the immediate response procedures compare between a case of poisoning from household items and a rattlesnake bite?","answer":"For household poisoning cases, the immediate response involves moving the victim to a comfortable place, preventing crowding, checking their breathing, and watching for symptoms like dizziness, bluish lips, chest pain, fever, or headache before getting medical help. For rattlesnake bites, the response must be more urgent - the victim should be taken to an emergency room within one hour if possible, and avoid common misconceptions about treatment. In both cases, immediate medical attention is crucial, but rattlesnake bites require more specialized emergency care due to the specific venom delivery system and potential severity of the bite.","context":["‚Ä¢ We should try to avoid accidents by following safety rules.\n‚Ä¢ However, if an accident still occurs, we should not panic.\n‚Ä¢ The injured people must be given first aid immediately.\n‚Ä¢ The most important thing to remember about first aid is that we have to keep ourselves safe.\n‚Ä¢ First aid is defined as the first or immediate help given to injured people before they are taken to a hospital.\n‚Ä¢ First aid is given for minor cuts and wounds that might occur while playing.\nFigure 5: Do not play on the road and do not stand in front of the swing\nFirst Aid for Burns:\n‚Ä¢ In case of minor burns, cold water or ice may be applied on the burnt area.\n‚Ä¢ The burnt area should be held under running water for some time.\nFigure 6: First aid for burns\n‚Ä¢ An antiseptic cream or a paste of baking soda and water should be applied on the burn.\n‚Ä¢ If the burn is severe, a doctor must be called immediately.\n‚Ä¢ Do not try to prick any blister, if formed.\nFigure 7: Applying antiseptic cream on burns\nFirst Aid for Fractures:\n‚Ä¢ A break or crack in a bone is called a fracture.\n‚Ä¢ In case of a fracture, it must be ensured that the fractured part is tied with a straight object.\n‚Ä¢ If there is a fracture is in the hand, a cloth sling can be used to prevent movement.\n‚Ä¢ The patient must be taken to the hospital immediately.\nFigure 8: A cloth sling tied on a fractured hand\nFirst Aid for Animal Bites:\n‚Ä¢ The most common animal bites are caused by pets such as cats and dogs.\n‚Ä¢ Animal bites can cause a deadly disease called rabies.\n‚Ä¢ The risk of rabies is high if bitten by stray animals.\nFigure 9: First aid for animal bites\n‚Ä¢ In case of an animal bite-\n(1) Wound should be washed with soap and water,\n(2) Antiseptic cream should be applied on the wound,\n(3) Wound should be covered with a clean bandage.\n‚Ä¢ The patient should be taken to the doctor immediately.\nFigure 10: Applying antiseptic cream on the wound\n‚Ä¢ A person bitten by a poisonous snake must be rushed to the hospital immediately.\n‚Ä¢ A tight bandage can be tied between the wound and the heart to slow the spread of poison in the body.\n‚Ä¢ For bee and wasp stings, a paste of baking soda and antiseptic cream should be applied.\nFigure 11: Tying a tight bandage on the wound to slow down the spread of poison\nFirst Aid for Poisioning:\n‚Ä¢ If a person is not careful, there are many sources of poisoning from items like:\no Naphthalene balls\no Paints, etc. that he can suffer from.\n‚Ä¢ Poisoning can cause a person to feel dizzy, get bluish lips, chest pain, fever, or even headache.\n‚Ä¢ In case of poisoning, the victim should be carried to a comfortable place and avoid crowding around him/her.\n‚Ä¢ We should check if he/she is breathing properly.\n‚Ä¢ A doctor should be informed immediately.\n‚ÄúPrecaution is better than cure‚Äù","How to Manage Pests\nPests in Gardens and Landscapes\nThe rattlesnake is California‚Äôs only native venomous snake. Six species are found in various areas of the state from below sea level to about 11,000 feet. Their size may vary, but adults can reach 6 feet in length. Rattlesnakes are an important part of the ecosystem, feeding on rodents, birds, and other small animals.\nRattlesnakes have a distinctive, triangular head shape, which is a key characteristic in their identification. Nonpoisonous snakes in California do not have this obvious characteristic. A less reliable identifying feature is the rattle. The rattle is on the end of the tail and is composed of interlocking horny segments. Young rattlesnakes are born with a small rattle or button. A new segment is formed each time the skin is shed, which may occur several times each year. The size of the rattle is not a good indicator of age, however, because the terminal segments are often broken off on older snakes. Because they can be broken off, the lack of a rattle does not mean the snake is not a rattler. Some nonpoisonous snakes have coloration similar to that of rattlesnakes. The characteristic that most readily signifies a rattlesnake is its triangular-shaped head.\nThe largest and most common rattlesnake in California is the western diamondback (Crotalus atrox), found primarily in Imperial, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties from sea level to 7,000 feet. It is probably the most dangerous rattlesnake in California because of its size and aggressive disposition. The sidewinder (C. cerastes) is the smallest rattlesnake and is so named because of its peculiar method of sideways locomotion. The sidewinder is sometimes called the horned rattler because of the hornlike scales above its eyes. It is most commonly found in sandy desert areas from below sea level to 6,000 feet. The Mojave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus) range includes the desert and foothills of southeastern California from sea level to high elevations. Speckled rattlesnakes (C. mitchellii) are found throughout Baja California and up the coast approximately to Los Angeles, overlapping with the red diamond rattlesnake (C. ruber) in most of this area. It also overlaps much of the sidewinder‚Äôs range in the southeastern desert area. The red diamond rattlesnake is found in Baja California and in southwestern California below Los Angeles.\nBIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR\nMost rattlesnakes forage for prey in or near brushy or tall grass areas, rock outcrops, rodent burrows, around and under surface objects, and sometimes in the open. Adults eat live prey, primarily rodents; the young take mostly lizards and young rodents. To catch their prey, rattlesnakes wait until the animal is nearby. The snake strikes with two large fangs that inject venom. This subdues the prey, which is then swallowed whole. Rattlesnakes feed on carrion less frequently.\nWhen inactive, most rattlesnakes seek cover in crevices of rocks, under surface objects, beneath dense vegetation, and in rodent burrows. In some areas, rattlesnakes hibernate for several months in the crevices of rock accumulations. Unlike most reptiles, rattlesnakes give birth to live young. Young snakes require protection and are likely to be born in abandoned rodent burrows, rock crevices, or in other secluded places.\nRattlesnakes are among the group of snakes called pit vipers because of the small pits on each side of the head between the eye and nostril. These pits are temperature-sensitive structures that assist the snake in finding prey, even in total darkness. The nostrils and tongue also detect the odors of prey. Rattlesnakes have the most highly developed venom system of all snakes. The venom is produced in glands behind the eyes, and then flows through ducts to the hollow fangs. Normally the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth, but when the snake strikes, the fangs are pivoted forward to inject venom. The snake can control the amount of venom ejected from either or both fangs. Even after its death, a rattlesnake can still inject venom for an hour or more by reflex action. Caution, therefore, is advised when handling what appears to be a dead snake.\nWhat do I do for initial first aid?\nBecause most Californians live in rattlesnake country, a snakebite emergency plan should be developed before it is needed. If you are less than one hour from the nearest emergency room, initial treatment is relatively simple:\nWhat should NOT be done after a rattlesnake bite?\nSeveral DON'Ts are very important to remember:\nIn the United States, about 800 rattlesnake bites are reported annually. While seldom fatal, bites are extremely painful and can lead to severe medical trauma. It is important to never handle rattlesnakes, not even dead ones.\nThose who enjoy hiking should determine first whether rattlesnakes are found in that area and under what conditions they might be encountered; however, rattlesnakes may be very sparse or nonexistent in some parts of their range. In addition, they can sometimes be transported into areas outside their normal range, either by humans or by natural mechanisms such as flowing water. If rattlesnakes are in the area, they will most likely be hidden in rock crevices, under logs, in heavy brush, or in other areas where they are protected, including tall grass, but they can also be found on roads, paths, and other areas where cover is limited. Be careful when moving brush, wood, logs, or other debris. In rattlesnake country, be alert when kneeling down to work in the garden and watch where you step. Since rattlesnakes are often well camouflaged and wait quietly for prey, they can be difficult to see. In the wild, rattlesnakes should be left alone as they present little potential hazard. However, rattlesnakes around the home or garden are not acceptable to most people. Fortunately, there are ways to minimize the potential hazards.\nThe six species of rattlesnakes found in California are not considered endangered or threatened. The California Department of Fish and Game Code classifies rattlesnakes as native reptiles. California residents can take rattlesnakes on private lands in any legal manner without a license or permit.\nWhat can be done to prevent a bite?\nHands, feet, and ankles are the most common sites for rattlesnake bites. Using some common sense rules can prevent most snakebites.\nRattlesnakes add to the diversity of our wildlife and are important members of our ecosystem; and should be left alone whenever possible, especially in wildland areas. Nonpoisonous snakes should be left alone wherever found.\nBecause of the danger rattlesnakes pose to people, pets, and domestic animals, it can be necessary to exclude or remove them from around homes and gardens.\nIt is difficult to detect rattlesnakes because they are not easy to see or to locate in their hiding places. Be alert to the potential for their presence during the time of year when rattlesnakes are generally active in your region. If rattlesnakes become exceptionally numerous in an area, sightings by neighbors may alert you to expect a problem. Snake populations may fluctuate from year to year; this is thought to be related in part to the availability of prey. Some animals, such as peacocks, turkeys, and dogs, can be good sentinels for detecting rattlesnakes. If your dog behaves in an unusual manner, such as excessively barking or whining, it would be wise to investigate for the presence of a snake. A veterinarian should immediately attend to dogs or domestic animals bitten by a rattlesnake. If you have a snake-proof fence, be sure to check its integrity prior to the time when snakes become active in the late winter or early spring. Remember that keeping the rodent population in and around your yard under control is an excellent way to discourage snakes of all kinds.\nOne of the best ways to discourage rattlesnakes from inhabiting gardens and homes is to remove suitable hiding places. Heavy brush, tall grass, rocks, logs, rotten stumps, lumber piles, and other places of cover should be cleaned up. Keep weeds mowed close to the ground or hoe them out completely. Since snakes often come to an area in search of prey, eliminating rodent populations, especially ground squirrels, meadow voles, deer mice, rats, and house mice, is an important step in making the habitat less attractive for snakes. Rattlesnakes cannot dig burrows but frequently use those dug by rodents. After controlling the rodents, fill in all burrows with soil or sod and pack down firmly.\nRattlesnakes may seek refuge beneath buildings. If there is a gap or opening, they will enter and inhabit a building, just as house mice do. Sealing all cracks and other openings greater than 1/4 inch can prevent them from entering. Gaps beneath garage doors are often large enough to permit snakes to enter, especially young ones. In summer, rattlesnakes may be attracted to cool and/or damp places, such as beneath buildings and in basements. Access doors on crawl spaces should be inspected carefully for breaks or gaps. Use caution if you must crawl under a house or other building. Hot tub or swimming pool pump enclosures may provide cover if they are not well sealed. The dampness associated with ornamental water fountains, pools, and fishponds may also make the surrounding area attractive to snakes.\nSnakes can be excluded from an area by installing a snake-proof fence. While expensive, fences are often necessary for children‚Äôs play areas. Be sure to make gates tight fitting and keep vegetation and debris from collecting around the fence. Snakes can climb accumulated vegetation and gain access to the top of the fence. Check the fence frequently to be sure it has not been damaged in any way.\nOver the years various home remedies have been suggested to repel snakes, such as placing a horsehair rope around your sleeping bag or sprinkling sulfur dust or scattering mothballs around the area to be protected. Unfortunately, none of these work. Despite what you may hear, there are no plants that repel snakes. Currently several commercially available chemical snake repellents are on the market, but they have not proven to be sufficiently effective to warrant recommendation.\nOther Control Methods\nRemember, if left alone, a snake is likely to move on to another area. If necessary, rattlesnakes may be killed with a shovel or club. Rattlesnakes are capable of striking fast, so caution is important. They can also be killed by shooting if it is allowed by local regulation. If you don‚Äôt want to kill the snake yet want it removed, it is best to call a professional pest or wildlife control operator who specializes in snake removal. The county agricultural commissioner or Cooperative Extension office may be able to direct you to professionals who remove rattlesnakes. Remember, most rattlesnake bites occur when inexperienced people try to pick up or move a rattlesnake.\nSeveral predators feed on rattlesnakes including the king snake, which swallows them whole. Unfortunately, the number of rattlers eaten by predators is insignificant in reducing the problem you might encounter around your home or garden.\nSalmon, T. P., D. A. Whisson, and R. E. Marsh.
