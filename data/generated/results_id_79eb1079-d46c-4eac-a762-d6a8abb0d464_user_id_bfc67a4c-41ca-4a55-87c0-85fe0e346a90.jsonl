{"question":"What is the difference between the 1930 television play 'The Man with the Flower in his Mouth' and Bert Coules' Sherlock Holmes radio adaptations in terms of their cast size?","answer":"The 1930 television play 'The Man with the Flower in his Mouth' had a very small cast of only three on-screen characters: The Man played by Earle Grey, The Woman played by Gladys Young, and The Customer played by Lionel Millard. In contrast, Bert Coules' Sherlock Holmes radio adaptations featured much larger casts, with episodes typically including numerous supporting characters alongside the main characters Clive Merrison as Holmes and Andrew Sachs as Dr. Watson. For example, the episode 'The Madness of Colonel Warburton' alone had six additional cast members beyond the main duo.","context":["The Man with the Flower in his Mouth\nThe First British Television Play – 1930\nLuigi Pirandello’s “The Man with the Flower in his Mouth” was transmitted from the Baird studios in 133 Long Acre, London, on 14th July 1930. For the first play in Baird’s modest studio, Val Gielgud (of that Gielgud family!), the productions director, chose one with only three on-screen characters:\nThe Man (i.e. with the Flower etc..): Earle Grey\nThe Woman (his wife): Gladys Young\nThe Customer (who missed his train): Lionel Millard\nIn 1967, an edited version of the play was remade entirely in 30-lines and recorded onto a stereo tape recorder. One track held the 30-line video signal (with the innovation over 1930 of having sub-black synchronising pulses, as used in analogue broadcast television), the other track held the audio. Bill Elliott, at that time with Granada TV in Manchester, used his own modified Televisors acting as camera and monitor. However, the most exciting feature of this re-make is that it was supposedly re-produced and presented by the original producer, Lance Sieveking, supported by the original art-work (by C R Nevinson) and music recording.\nThere is a ‘however’ to that. The BBC had made their own version at roughly the same time in the 1960s and the audio introduction to that by Sieveking sounds absolutely identical, suggesting at least that the audio introduction was ‘borrowed’ by the ILEA from the BBC. If that’s the case, then it calls to question the claim that Sieveking personally oversaw the ILEA production.\nThe stills from Bill Elliot’s videotape, re-played from reel-to-reel tape recording, shows impressive detail on 30-lines, as illustrated on the first two captions. (The second one says “by Luigi Pirandello”).\nThe captions are accompanied by the strains of the original music from the very 78rpm disc that Sieveking used in 1930. The music you hear comes from the actual 78rpm music disc of ‘El Carretero’ used by Sieveking for the introduction, which is now owned by Paul Sieveking, Lance’s son and co-editor until 2002 of the ‘Fortean Times’. I transcribed the disc and restored the audio as best I could, and registered this audio recording with the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS) in 2004. The clip below is the first 30 seconds, not used in the 1967 remake.\nOn the soundtrack (YouTube video below), once the music fades out, we hear the voice of Lance Sieveking describing the scene. ‘An avenue lined with trees…. electric lights gleaming through the foliage….’\nAnd so started the joint Baird-BBC Television Play…(left) This is a picture off-screen from the 1967 re-make. When compared with the original art-work (right, from “Television” August 1930), the graphic is mirror-reversed. Although Bill Elliott’s camera used mechanical scanning on 30-lines, he used a mirror mounted in front of the lens which he tilted to provide panning (not done in the original broadcast). This gave mirror-reversal and would imply that the text captions were printed left-right reversed for the reconstruction – or more likely that he recorded the captions separately with the mirror swung out of the way . The slight skewing of the picture is caused by the ‘camera’ being arc-scanned (as was the original play), but displayed with straight lines.\nThe Cast of 1967 in 30-lines\nThe ‘Man’, the ‘Woman’ and the ‘Customer’\nAmateur actors – all unknown but possibly with a link to the ILEA (Inner London Education Authority)\nNOTE: The YouTube version comes from the double CD The Dawn of Television Remembered and unlike other versions available on the net from Bill Elliot’s footage which he gave away to many folks on 625-line video Sony Betamax tape, this version has had the audio remastered, the new ‘El Carretero’ transcription inserted and the video cleaned up.\nIs it an authentic version of the 1930 play? From a production point of view, it’s close and how close depends on whether the story of Sieveking returning with the original props, captions and incidental music, is correct or not. At time of publishing my own view in Restoring Baird’s Image [IEE 2000, p179], Elliott’s claim was thought to be correct.\nFrom a technical point of view, this is not 100% authentic, but is the closest we can get. Here are a few points of detail to consider:\n- Elliott used a mirror in front of his modified Baird Televisor camera, which allowed panning. This was not used in 1930 and the field of regard was absolutely fixed such that the actors had to stay within a limited area. Actor changes were effected by a sliding checkerboard in front of the camera, which would have slowed down the on-screen action.\n- Elliott edited the original 1/4inch reel-to-reel audio tape (which I have an original). There are splices between scene changes, made even more noticeable as his Televisor motor drifted in speed and the pitch changes in the video are a result of those edits and speed drift. (The audio sounds OK so it’s not the tape recorder!)\n- Elliott used a high quality 1960s photomultiplier with modern amplifier giving plenty of high frequency content. As an indication of what you would see in the studio that’s fine, but for the viewer in his home the image would be a little less crisp than this.\n- The tape recorder and the tape has added artifacts of vertical streaking that would not be visible on a direct broadcast in 1930.\n- The image was recorded using a 625-line camera pointing at a special-purpose 30-line monitor that Elliott built. This makes for a much poorer picture than a true 30-line picture. Consequently, the picture you see has been smoothed out in time slightly to reduce that effect (Thanks to the Wilsons of Stable Recordings for that).\nRemake – Further Information\nThanks to Simon Vaughan of the APTS for the following article referring to the 1967 remake of TMWTFIHM. Oddly there is no comment regarding Bill Elliott.\nHeard and Seen (PDF, 145kbytes)\n(The Journal of The Guild of Television Cameramen, Number 3, Winter 1974, Pages 10-11)\nSome Facts about Bill Elliott\n- Bill Elliott provided all the 30-line imagery (other than my Phonovision imagery) for the 1985 Granada series “Television“. His material appeared in Programmes 1,2 and 13. A fleeting extract from “The Man with the Flower in his Mouth” appeared in Programme 13.\n- Bill converted one of his precious Televisors into a camera by putting a photomultiplier behind the scanning disc – just where the neon would have gone for display. On the other side of the disc, he had a lens that focused the scene onto the surface of the scanning disc – which acted as an image dissector. He could display the result either on the other Televisor or on his home-brew CRT display.\n- Bill wrote an article for New Scientist many years ago describing Baird TV and illustrating the article with his picture of William Taynton, the first person ever to be televised back in October 1925.\nIn ‘Television’ for August 1930, four of the original captions were reproduced in an article “The Fourteenth of July, 1930” written by Lance Sieveking. They have been scanned, cleaned up and are reproduced below.\nClick on the above images for high resolution scans.","The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\nThis article is about the BBC Radio 4 series transmitted from 2002 to 2010. There is also a U.S. produced series, which began in 1998, that transmits under the same title and a book range from Titan Books.\nThe Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a series of radio dramas based on Arthur Conan Doyle's detective Sherlock Holmes. Written by Bert Coules as a pastiche of Conan Doyle's work, the series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2002, 2004, 2008-9 and 2010. There are sixteen episodes, all of them produced and directed by Patrick Rayner of BBC Scotland. Clive Merrison stars as Holmes, having portrayed the detective in a complete canonical run for Radio 4 (the only actor to successfully do so to date). Andrew Sachs appears as Dr. Watson, replacing Michael Williams after Williams died following the Radio 4 run of Sherlock Holmes adaptations. Each of the stories is based on a throwaway reference from an actual Conan Doyle short story or novel.

{"question":"How did scientists in the 1950s use magnetic evidence from rocks to prove that continents had moved rather than the magnetic poles wandering?","answer":"When scientists examined rocks of the same age on different continents, they found that the magnetite crystals pointed to different magnetic north poles. For example, 400 million-year-old magnetite in Europe pointed to a different north magnetic pole than magnetite of the same age in North America. Since there could only be one magnetic north pole, the only reasonable explanation was that the continents themselves had moved while the magnetic pole remained fixed. This phenomenon was named 'apparent polar wander.'","context":["\"The Wegener hypothesis has been so stimulating and has such fundamental implications in geology...\"\n\"...as to merit respectful and sympathetic interest from every geologist. Some striking arguments in his favor have been advanced, and it would be foolhardy indeed to reject any concept that offers a possible key to the solution of profound problems in the Earth's history.” - Chester R. Longwell, \"Some Thoughts on the Evidence for Continental Drift,\" 1944\nWegener and his supporters did all they could do to find evidence to support continental drift. But without a mechanism the idea would not be accepted. What was needed was the development of technologies that would allow scientists to find more evidence for the idea and help them describe a mechanism. But first, they would find still more evidence that the continents had moved.\nMagnetic Polarity Evidence\nThe next breakthrough in the development of the theory of plate tectonics came two decades after Wegener’s death. Magnetite crystals are shaped like a tiny bar magnet. As basalt lava cools, the magnetite crystals line up in the magnetic field like tiny magnets. When the lava is completely cooled, the crystals point in the direction of magnetic north pole at the time they form. How do you expect this would help scientists see whether continents had moved or not?\nAs a Wegener supporter, (and someone who is omniscient), you have just learned of a new tool that may help you. A magnetometer is a device capable of measuring the magnetic field intensity. This allows you to look at the magnetic properties of rocks in many locations. First, you’re going to look at rocks on land. Which rocks should you seek out for study?\nMagnetic Polarity on the Same Continent with Rocks of Different Ages\nGeologists noted important things about the magnetic polarity of different aged rocks on the same continent:\n- Magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks point to the current magnetic north pole ( Figure below ) no matter what continent or where on the continent the rocks are located.\nEarth’s current north magnetic pole is in northern Canada.\n- Older rocks that are the same age and are located on the same continent point to the same location, but that location is not the current north magnetic pole.\n- Older rocks that are of different ages do not point to the same locations or to the current magnetic north pole.\nIn other words, although the magnetite crystals were pointing to the magnetic north pole, the location of the pole seemed to wander. Scientists were amazed to find that the north magnetic pole changed location over time ( Figure below ).\nThe location of the north magnetic north pole 80 million years before present (mybp), then 60, 40, 20, and now.\nCan you figure out the three possible explanations for this? They are:\n- The continents remained fixed and the north magnetic pole moved.\n- The north magnetic pole stood still and the continents moved.\n- Both the continents and the north pole moved.\nMagnetic Polarity on Different Continents with Rocks of the Same Age\nHow do you figure out which of those three possibilities is correct? You decide to look at magnetic rocks on different continents. Geologists noted that for rocks of the same age but on different continents, the little magnets pointed to different magnetic north poles.\n- 400 million-year-old magnetite in Europe pointed to a different north magnetic pole than magnetite of the same age in North America.\n- 250 million years ago, the north poles were also different for the two continents.\nNow look again at the three possible explanations. Only one can be correct. If the continents had remained fixed while the north magnetic pole moved, there must have been two separate north poles. Since there is only one north pole today, what is the best explanation? The only reasonable explanation is that the magnetic north pole has remained fixed but that the continents have moved.\nWegener was Right!\nHow does this help you to provide evidence for continental drift? To test the idea that the pole remained fixed but the continents moved, geologists fitted the continents together as Wegener had done. It worked! There has only been one magnetic north pole and the continents have drifted ( Figure below ). They named the phenomenon of the magnetic pole that seemed to move but actually did not apparent polar wander .\nOn the left: The apparent north pole for Europe and North America if the continents were always in their current locations. The two paths merge into one if the continents are allowed to drift.\nThis evidence for continental drift gave geologists renewed interest in understanding how continents could move about on the planet’s surface.\n- Using magnetic evidence found on a single continent in the 1950s, scientists showed that either the north magnetic pole was in a different spot in Earth’s past or that the continents had moved.\n- When they added magnetic evidence from a second continent, they showed that in the past there had either been two magnetic north poles or the continents had moved.\n- Since there is only one magnetic north pole today, they concluded that the simplest explanation is that the continents have moved.\nUse the resource below to answer the questions that follow.\n- Apparent Polar Wander at http://www.grossmont.edu/garyjacobson/animations.htm\n- Explain what appears to be occurring at the North Pole.\n- What direction is the pole moving?\n- Describe the movement of the South Pole.\n- What direction is the South Pole moving?\n- What is apparent polar wander?\n- How does magnetic evidence from one continent show that either the north magnetic pole has moved or the continents have moved?\n- How does magnetic evidence from two continents show that the continents have moved?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4285135e-01db-4319-8db8-f144c72d1472>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the earliest signs of hearing and vision response in newborns? Can you compare babies' first reactions to sound versus light?","answer":"In terms of first reactions, babies show different timelines for hearing and vision responses. For hearing, babies are typically able to react to noises when they are one month old. For vision, the very first response is blinking in response to light - this is the earliest visual response observed in development. During the first month of life, newborns are most responsive to human faces and light, and can see objects best at about 12 inches from their face.","context":["Unlike older children and adults, infants cannot tell you if they have problems with their hearing and vision. They also wouldn’t normally feel uncomfortable because they wouldn’t be able to distinguish auditory and visual problems from normal hearing and sight.\nAs parents, you need to be aware of signs that will tell you your child probably has hearing and/or visual problems.\nBaby’s Hearing Development\nDoctors usually check baby’s hearing after childbirth or within his/her first month. Normally, babies would be able to react to noises when they are a month old. Studies also show that children will react to their parents’ voices at 3 months old, and by 6 months, they can determine the source of the sound by turning their heads toward the source. Most babies will also be able to imitate sounds at 12 months and produce a few simple words.\nWarning Signs of Hearing Problems\nIf your baby has failed the screening, it doesn’t mean that he/she has gone deaf, but the doctors will not be able to provide any treatment until the child is 6 months old. Repeat test will confirm the results and will give the doctors an idea how to save baby’s hearing. Even if the results of the hearing examinations are positive, you should still look out for the following signs: baby doesn’t react to sudden noises at 3 months; doesn’t respond to music and voices; doesn’t imitate sounds at 6 months or feel at ease when there’s a familiar voice; baby doesn’t turn to the source of the sound; and there is no variety in pitch when baby babbles.\nBaby’s Sight Development\nYour baby’s eyes are among the last organs to fully develop before childbirth, and during his/her first few months outside the womb, the eyes will continuously adjust as he/he grows up. For example, it’s perfectly normal for a baby to look cross-eyed sometimes during his/her first three months and their sight is normally blurry or out of focus, but they should be able to distinguish different colors. After about a week old, the baby should be able to focus on objects not farther than 12 inches from his/her face. By the time he/she is six months old, the baby will be able to see clearly at any distance and will react to objects and facial expressions.\nWarning Signs of Visual Problems\nA child’s vision will not fully mature until he/she is about 3 years old, but you should consult your pediatrician if you notice any of the following signs: baby’s eyes don’t move or only one eye moves; objects and other visual stimulus don’t elicit reactions from an infant at one month or older; one of the eyes has not opened or one of the eyelids droop; you notice red spots on the eyes when taking photos of the child; one or both of the eyes are bulging; the infant’s eyes look cloudy; eyes are sensitive to light or the baby often squints; the pupils are of different sizes; and the baby often rubs his/her eyes.","Your parenting knowledge should grow as your child does. Tips from our experts can help.\nHow Do I Know If My Baby Needs Glasses?\nParents often ask me, “What can my baby see?” or “Is my baby meeting visual milestones?” These are good questions, and if you have any concerns, please do discuss them with your doctor. In general, a child is referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist if there are questions regarding visual development.\nNormal visual development\nRemember that preemies will usually need more time to develop and reach milestones, and that’s okay.\n- Newborns can only see about 20/400, which is the “big E” on the eye chart. At birth, the part of the eye responsible for central vision is still developing. Over the first year of life, this continues, allowing for approximately 20/20 vision by age one.\n- Infants will blink in response to light. This is the first visual response we see in development.\n- During the first month of life, a newborn is most responsive to a human face and light. They see objects best when they’re held 30 centimeters, or about a foot, in front of their face. High contrast colors like black and white are helpful.\n- A six-week-old can usually track up and down but not yet side-to-side.\n- Tracking side-to-side is usually achieved by three to four months of age.\n- Eye contact normally begins at six weeks of age, although up to eight weeks is still considered normal.\n- By 12 weeks, infants begin to focus on their hands, which helps them learn hand-eye coordination. As they start to grab at visualized objects they begin to recognize distances. These skills help them build an understanding of three-dimensional space and orientation.\n- Around five to seven months of age, an infant can distinguish a caretaker or familiar relative by sight.\n- Between seven and 10 months, infants develop a finer focus and can see small objects and detailed facial features.\n- At one year, most children have 20/20 vision, even though they can’t communicate that on a vision screening.\nAbnormal visual development\n- Healthy newborns may have temporary misalignment of their eyes during initial development. But if their eyes still seem to cross or wander out by three to four months of age, seek an evaluation from an ophthalmologist.\n- If a child seems to consistently turn his or her head to look at things, ask an ophthalmologist to evaluate for eye problems.\n- Nystagmus, sometimes described as fluttering, rhythmic jerking, or wandering movements of the eyeballs, should immediately be brought to a doctor’s attention. These movements aren’t present at birth, but can develop as early as two months of age.\n- Alert your doctor if you also notice forceful or constant eye rubbing, droopy eyelids, a white pupil, or constant tearing when the baby isn’t upset or crying.\nDoes my baby need glasses?\nSince we can’t ask such a young child to read a chart, it’s common for parents to ask how to know if a baby needs glasses. Many pediatricians will screen pre-verbal and pre-reading children at a routine check-up to catch an early need for glasses with devices that look like cameras. While these devices are very good at sensing changes in the eyeballs that suggest a child might need glasses, they can also have a lot of false positives, when there isn’t a true problem. If a baby doesn’t pass this screening test, the pediatrician will refer the child to an ophthalmologist for a complete evaluation.\nIf your pediatrician doesn’t have this device, don’t worry! There are other ways that your doctor can check your baby’s eyes. Classically, an ophthalmoscope red reflex test can be performed by shining a light in the baby’s eyes. The reflection gives the doctor information about eye development and will indicate if anything needs to be examined by an ophthalmologist. If you still have questions, ask your doctor to refer your child to an ophthalmologist for a complete dilated exam.\nSome final advice\nTry your best not to Google any serious health concerns, including vision issues. Information online isn’t tailored for your child’s specific circumstances and medical care is never one-size-fits-all. Discuss your questions with your doctor or an experienced eyecare specialist.\nWe’re here to help!

{"question":"In managing horse care, how do age-related needs affect both feeding requirements and boarding service arrangements?","answer":"Age significantly impacts both feeding requirements and boarding service arrangements. Young, growing horses need extra caloric support but must avoid too rapid growth, while elderly horses, especially those with dental issues affecting hay consumption, require specialized concentrate feeds to maintain body condition. These age-related nutritional needs translate to boarding service costs, as barns typically charge additional fees for extra or specialized feeding, administration of supplements beyond basic provisions, and health care services. Barn owners need to consider these factors when structuring their service fees, whether through a-la-carte charges or tiered board rates that include specialized care for horses with different age-related requirements.","context":["One of the benefits of stabling a horse at a boarding operation is that there are many personnel around the barn to attend to horse needs when necessary. This can be an incredible convenience for the horse owner, but it does add to the work of the barn personnel. Unless you are involved in a “full service” barn, there are usually added fees to the monthly board rates to pay for these privileges.\nThat doesn't mean you have to charge a good client for feeding her horse if she is sick, for example. You might do that for a couple of days just because she is a good client.\nBut you should know when you are willing to provided services free, and when services will be charged on the monthly billing. And you need to make sure your clients understand that, too.\nWhat Services Warrant Added Fees?\nBasic board typically covers stabling, 2-3 times daily feedings, mucking of stalls and paddocks and turnout. Other tasks that might warrant service charges service include:\n- Extra or specialized turnout\n- Catching the horse and bringing it in for the veterinarian, farrier, chiropractor, acupuncturist or other support practitioners\n- Holding the horse for the vet, farrier or other support practitioners\n- Extra bedding\n- Extra hay\n- Feeding extra supplements beyond what the barn usually provides, such as daily dewormer, psyllium, SmartPaks, vegetable oil, beet pulp, etc.\n- Health care services such as paste deworming, administration of medication or immunizations, wound care cleaning or bandaging\n- Putting on and taking off equipment such as blankets, fly masks, hoof boots or leg wraps\n- Insect control, such as fly spray application\n- Show preparation such as bathing, clipping, braiding and mane pulling\n- Laundry service for blankets and/or blanket repair service\n- Tack cleaning\n- Clean up of aisle and wash stall when owner doesn’t perform this task\n- Hand walking, lunging or exercising the horse\n- Lessons and/or arena use\n- Tack locker availability\n- Trailer parking or trailering the horse off the farm to shows and events\nEvery one of these services costs a barn owner, manager or riding instructor time and money. If barn staff must be hired to carry out these procedures, then payroll expenses go up. If the barn owner, manager or riding instructor elects to carry out the tasks, then that person's day could be consumed by the extra tasks, preventing them from doing their primary job.\nHow Are These Services Charged?\nThe question of how to apply fees fairly should be answered up front when a new boarder comes to the barn. So there are no financial surprises, boarders need to know what they are getting into besides a flat board rate.\nThe dilemma is always how to make it fair. Should there be an a-la-carte fee for individual items selected by an owner, or does every boarder pay the same for added services no matter how many services they use? If it is to be a-la-carte, then a menu of possible services allows owners to tailor choices to their specific needs. While some barns and owners prefer that method, you’ll need to decide if the fees will be charged per month, week or day. Fees for added services vary depending on how much time it takes and the extent of out-of-pocket expenses for the barn owner/manager. Fees generally range from $10 to $50 per month for any one service, and can be $5-10 each for an a-la-carte procedure. More involved services should cost more because labor is one of your biggest expenses.\nJust as a barn might charge different rates for horses living in a pasture versus an outside paddock versus inside stall, it is possible to set up a different “tier” of board rates. Those who want specialized services can have them included as part of their monthly board rate, while others might prefer a lower board fee with an occasional extra for infrequently added services.\nFor example, one owner might work full-time and really wants to spend time with her horse when she is at the barn. So she might pay for services that she doesn't have time to perform, or that she chooses to pay someone else to do so she can spend barn time with the horse or in the saddle.\nThe overall board fee for a full-service barn might be considerably higher than one that provides the bare essentials, but owners could be more accepting of paying a flat fee up front than seeing it nickel-and-dimed from their pockets with itemized services. That way they are able to estimate their monthly budgets more exactly.\nHow you decide to manage service fees likely affects the type of boarder attracted to your barn. If you decide to charge for a-la-carte, you can count on an increased amount of record keeping and billing. There is also a potential for boarders to complain about a-la-carte charges or how a task was performed and how often. If you charge a flat rate, then some will be dissatisfied because they aren’t interesting in availing themselves of many of the offered services and they think the \"board fee\" is too high. Some horse owners are self-reliant and prefer to meet the vet and farrier themselves, equip their horses themselves with blankets, boots, or fly masks, etc. Some expect that turnout is part of the board fee, and others might not have a need to feed supplements.\nNo matter what services are offered or used, there will be an added cost to you that should be passed on to your clients. Most horse owners are appreciative of the specialized attention to their horses and happily will pay for the privilege and convenience. Just make sure you are up-front about when charges will be placed and for what services.","Most of us feed some form of grain to our horses, but often we only do so because it is what we were taught, and not necessarily because we know they need it. Nor do we give a lot of consideration to what kind of “grain” or “concentrate” we feed. How important is grain as an addition to the equine diet? Can all horses benefit from grain? Would it be better for most horses to go without?\nMany people feed grain to horses out of habit, but as it turns out many horses do not in fact need grain. If a horse is an “easy keeper” or has metabolic issues, feeding grain or concentrate feeds can actually cause problems.\nThe fact is that the average horse probably doesn’t need grain or concentrate feed in order to meet its’ caloric requirements. As an example let’s look at a 1000 pound middle aged horse in light work. This animal can easily attain enough calories through hay consumption (either grass or alfalfa). By weight, this horse should receive 20 pounds of hay in a day, which in calories (on the low side) would equal about 16,000 calories. This, generally speaking, is plenty of energy for the example horse. So with quality hay, clean water, and possibly a salt source (block), the horse’s nutritional requirements are easily met.\nHowever, there are a number of factors in a horse’s life that can increase or decrease their caloric needs, possibly necessitating the addition of grain or concentrates.\nThe workload of a horse at any given time can very quickly alter the nutritional needs of the animal. A horse that is competing at a high level, a ranch horse that is ridden daily, endurance athletes, even trail horses that are covering a lot of ground every day are all horses that could probably benefit from additional feed in order to meet their increased caloric needs. Workload should be closely monitored as the horse goes through different stages in a career. Feeding a horse that has transitioned to light work the same amount it was getting during heavy competition or workload will quickly add unhealthy pounds.\nAge is one of the most significant factors in altering the energy needs of an individual horse. Young, growing horses can benefit from a little extra support in calories, but too much can be problematic, causing growth that’s too rapid. Elderly horses, especially if they have or are developing dental issues that cause them to be unable to chew and mechanically break down the hay matter to a digestible size, will require concentrate feed in order to maintain their body condition.\nPregnancy and lactation\nPregnancy and lactation will quickly alter a mare’s nutritional needs. Gestating a foal, and providing milk for a growing youngster can make incredible demands on a mare’s body, requiring a structured meal plan to accommodate the additional caloric requirements to support both her and her foal. We advise consultation with your veterinarian to develop a plan for your mare in order to best provide for her caloric needs and the needs of her growing foal.\nThis time of year here in Colorado, we also have to consider that weather will begin to effect the caloric requirements of our horses. As ambient temperatures drop, horses will begin to burn more calories to maintain body temperatures. While grains and concentrates can certainly help during these times, hay and the digestion of it actually creates the body heat thatwill keep your horse warm on a cold night.\nSo what kind of grain or concentrate feed should you be feeding if you think your horse has increased caloric needs? Talk to your veterinarian in order to tailor a feeding plan for your horse. With all of the possible variances from day to day and in life stages, it is very important to continually evaluate the feeding program for your horse to maintain a healthy equine partner. Consistent use of a weight tape and BCS scoring in order to fine-tune your feeding is a must, and we recommend you always weigh your feed so that you can be sure your horse is getting exactly what they need."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5bb7730c-1245-4daa-be1f-76d6b2036cf4>","<urn:uuid:f0b59e1e-1693-4acc-a121-365284a7c302>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key safety considerations for beginner riding lessons, and what statistics support the importance of wearing certified helmets during equestrian activities?","answer":"For beginner riding lessons, safety is paramount and is the focus of the first lesson, including proper horse handling introduction. Instructors must have sharp intuition and experience to recognize potentially hazardous situations. Regarding helmet safety, statistics show that 70,000 people annually receive emergency treatment for equestrian-related injuries, with head injuries accounting for 18% of emergency room visits. ASTM certified helmets significantly reduce deaths and serious injuries by absorbing impact energy effectively. Notably, about 20% of head injuries occur during non-riding activities, highlighting the importance of protection at all times around horses.","context":["I make no bones about being an advocate for instructors of beginning riders. It’s because I firmly believe that you can lay so good a foundation for your students, that they will not forget it, no matter what style or level of riding they become enamored with. And investing the extra time to lay a good foundation will save lots of time in the future because your students will not have to go back and fill in holds that they missed in the beginning.\nHere’s a saying to hang in your barn- Every Olympic rider began as a beginner.\nBeginner lessons are an introduction into the world of horsemanship. I know this sounds trite but it’s true. The beginning level gives students glimpses into horse handling and riding; giving them a taste of what it feels like to be in control of a horse and the responsibility of handling one. All things at the beginner level are in the introduction stage and all things will have to be repeated on a regular basis, requiring you to have an abundance of patience. Remember, not only are you teaching something totally unfamiliar to your student, they are learning it with an animal that has its own opinions and needs. If your beginner is taking one lesson a week, progress will seem to be slow. A week has 168 hours and you have your student for only one of those hours, yet students who are horse crazy can make amazing progress an hour at a time.\nBecause we have limited time with our students, I work extras into my riding program. I have curriculum available in hard copy and on my web page. I recommend books, websites, videos, and exercises. I do everything I can to connect my student’s riding lessons together like a continual chain.For instance if I tell my student that riding her bicycle for a half hour 5 days a week will strengthen her legs and that stretching her heels on the steps at her house will help her get her heels down, chances are she will develop great legs more quickly than the student who doesn’t think about it until her next lesson.\nAnd when beginners regularly see what riding and horse care is about, through magazines, videos or other riders, most students are motivated to progress more quickly than if their lessons are merely single weekly events. It’s about continuity.\nBe Sensitive to Pace\nThere are many varying factors in riding lessons making it difficult to predict the number of lessons, if used in set order for a set amount of time, that it will take to develop every rider to a particular skill level. Fortunately each rider and situation is unique. As a riding instructor you must develop an eye for the time your students are ready to move on to more difficult tasks.Keep in mind that you want students to be successful in small achievements, while at the same time you want to seize opportunities that challenge at the appropriate time for their growth as a horseman.Bear in mind that it is much easier to move the confident student ahead than it is to bring the frightened student back, make the repairs and then move forward. So be keenly aware of your pace and don’t let a parent, agenda, or another situation cause you to over face a rider. The consequences can be very hard to work with.\nThe First Three\nThe first two lessons are about structure. You’ll use them to demonstrate your teaching method and expectations for your student.\nLesson #1 is all about safety; the introduction to handling the horse and the first steps of riding.This is where you establish the attitude about the horse and learning that you wish to imbed in your student.The first lesson is full of demonstration and explanation, a vast amount of which your nervous, new student may not remember. It’s OK.\nThe second lesson is about what your student remembers from lesson #1. It’s their opportunity to give things a try before you tell\nthem what to do at each step. Be sure to reward everything they remember with your positive reaction. When you reward what they remember, their confidence will rise and they will remember more. Patience is very important. Give your student a little time to work out how to put the halter on before you step in to help, but don’t leave your student hanging either. Always be ready to immediately redirect anything that looks unsafe. A beginner instructor must have a sharp eye, intuition and lots of experience in recognizing the signs of an impending hazardous situation.\nBy Lesson #3 your student should understand how you’ll proceed in lessons; e.g. that you explain and demonstrate but will expect them to try to relate back to you, the things you teach them. At this point you can begin the serious work of steering and control, balance and moving around on the horse.\nHow long it takes for my students to move from the beginner to the advanced beginner label strictly depends on how they progress. You never help a student by rushing them out of the beginning stages. A sharp instructor will know when the time is right to move ahead and will be able to keep the beginner interested moving them forward before they become bored.\nLet’s Get Serious\nTeaching riding is not something to be taken lightly. Americans don’t have the advantage of a national program that trains instructors, such as the British Horse Society. And while there are some certifications available in the U.S., all you have to do to be considered an instructor in America is ride better than the next guy. While good riding shows that a person has ability to ride a horse, it does not speak to their ability to instruct. A good riding instructor is the ultimate ground person. He or she is the one who can see what is happening before it occurs and can educate the student for a positive outcome. A good riding instructor has skills that reach beyond the knowledge of theory, training methods, learning styles, riding talent and rules. Good riding instructors have a natural intuition for timing, cause and effect; and for setting students up to succeed. With or without a national program for riding instructors, all instructors, particularly those who are just starting out, would do well to invest the time apprenticing under an older established riding instructor, particularly if you plan to begin the foundation of someone else’s riding career.\nSo do you know them? Those fabulous riders in the 4 pictures? They began as beginners! Be encouraged, you never know who you’re helping on to that school horse or pony the very first time!\nThanks for reading The Riding Instructor\nBarbara Ellin Fox","The height above the ground, the frequency of falls and the variables introduced by the horse itself, create an environment where head impacts are relatively common in horse-related activities. Despite the agility of a rider, it is often impossible to adjust one’s position during a fall to avoid a high energy, head impact with the ground, a rock or other objects. Facts like these are what make wearing a helmet so important. A rider's experience nor a horse's training make a difference in the risk factors involved.\nTo help riders better understand the risks involved with equestrian riding activities and the importance of helmet safety, Troxel founder and chairman, Dr. Richard Timms, compiled a list of medical facts from a range of equestrian studies. If you're trying to convince a friend or loved one to wear a helmet, we encourage you to pass these facts along. And remember, buckle up every ride, every time.\n- 70,000 people are treated in emergency rooms because of equestrian related injuries accounting for an estimated 2,300 admissions annually. Head injuries account for 18% of emergency room injuries.\n- Lifetime riders who report riding six or more times per year reported a 13% lifetime rate of being hospitalized because of a riding injury.\n- Head injuries account for the majority of hospitalizations and deaths.\n- The risk of head injuries appears to be similar in English riding as compared to western riding. Serious head injuries and deaths are more common with aggressive riding such as jockey’s and eventer’s. Deaths are rare when wearing an ASTM certified helmet during non-aggressive riding activities.\n- The mechanism of the majority of equestrian related head injuries relates to your distance above the ground. In more aggressive forms of riding such as jumping and racing, the potential for a crush type injury is increased. The majority of head injuries occur from falls caused by unpredictable events. However, about 20 percent occur while performing non-riding activities or as a bystander.\n- Risk of injury relates more to your cumulative time riding and less to level of expertise. Concussions accounted for 8% of horse riding related emergency room data, a rate that is higher than many other major sporting activities. The majority of riders with a onetime concussion resolve completely without residual problems. This high rate of complete recovery diminishes with subsequent concussions.\n- Public health studies indicate that there are scattered riding related fatalities each year throughout the USA. Deaths are significantly reduced by wearing an ASTM certified helmet. For each fatality, there are many times more head injuries.\n- Recurrent head traumas (or TBI’s) and their consequences are uncommon in equestrian riding in contrast to contact sports such as football. They do occur to riders who frequently ride in high risk activities.\n- Certified helmets provide a highly effective means of absorbing much of the impact with the ground or objects such as a rock or the horse’s hoof. Helmets are certified for their ability to absorb energy, cover your skull and stay properly in place. Equestrian riders are wise to wear certified helmets. Uncertified helmets are for look and vanity. They should not be worn as a means of head protection. Riders who wear ASTM certified helmets rarely suffer serious head injuries or death from a head impact but there are exceptions especially during aggressive riding activities.\n- April 15, 2016"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b8f749e0-2b13-4d33-83a2-5351142ffc77>","<urn:uuid:17d8b1a3-0cb3-4cfd-a84c-4697e90b43bd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the challenges in breeding cattle for both high marbling and good maternal characteristics?","answer":"While some believed high marbling potential was only for 'terminal' cattle and couldn't coexist with good maternal traits, this is a misconception. The main challenge is that breeding for maternal traits takes much longer to see improvements since they're lowly heritable. Environmental factors significantly impact maternal traits like fertility, making genetic selection more difficult. However, the tools exist through EPDs and indexes to successfully select for both marbling and maternal traits simultaneously.","context":["Research shows no correlation between marbling and maternityIt might be easier to explain away why you don’t have marbling in the herd than it is to get it.\nBy: Miranda Reiman, Agweek\nIt might be easier to explain away why you don’t have marbling in the herd than it is to get it.\nSome say that’s the origin of the popular “urban legend” in the Angus breed: high marbling potential is for “terminal” cattle, because they don’t make good mamas. You can’t have both in the same herd.\n“People have created this theory mainly because they haven’t ever selected for carcass traits, so they try to characterize their herd as ‘maternal,’” says Bill Bowman, longtime operations and genetics executive at the American Angus Association.\nA new research paper, “Selection for Marbling and the Impact on Maternal Traits,” by Virginia Tech Extension animal scientist Scott Greiner and graduate student Jason Smith, explores the topic.\n“Marbling has a very small, if not insignificant relationship, with most of the traits that we associate with cowherd productivity,” Greiner says. “You can have terminal traits and maternal traits, and they can coexist.”\nThe first step to building a productive cow is to get her bred early.\n“Early on, there were a couple of fairly high marbling bulls that also happened to be low scrotal circumference bulls, and automatically there was this association that marbling and scrotal circumference had this big negative relationship,” Bowman says. “But that is not the case.”\nBoth small-scale studies and actual analysis of the expected progeny differences (EPDs) for marbling and scrotal circumference found no association between the two traits.\n“In the Angus breed, we don’t have a ‘females reaching puberty’ problem at all,” Bowman says, but the paper also confirms that a marbling focus will not impact age of puberty.\n“Age at first calving” is often used to determine if a female will get pregnant during a normal breeding season, and studies show differing results. One indicates no relationship and another says an increase in a full unit of marbling would extend age at first calving by 10 days. The practical application of the latter leaves little need for concern.\n“A breeder that makes a 0.25-unit improvement in marbling EPD would be expected to increase age at first calving by less than three days,” the authors say.\nThere is no correlation between marbling and heifer pregnancy in the Angus database.\n“Angus sires are highly sought after amongst commercial producers due to their ability to excel at calving ease while they maintain or improve carcass traits when compared to a number of other breeds and their composites,” the paper says.\nThe research is limited, but it highlights possible positive impacts, such as increased marbling in tandem with calf survival, lower birth weight and better calving ease.\nThe association’s data shows there is a positive correlation between marbling and maternal milk EPDs at 0.22.\n“This is always important, whether you’re selecting for marbling or not: keep milk production at a level that’s appropriate for your environment and your management,” Greiner says.\nThe paper notes, “Opportunity currently exists within the Angus sire population to select for marbling, while divergently selecting for maternal milk.”\nThe scientists found no evidence of increased calving interval or reduced stayability among high-marbling populations.\nSeedstock producer Lee Leachman, Wellington, Colo., says, “We calculate a calving interval EPD and it is not correlated to marbling in our database.”\nHe also wondered about the impact of popularity in AI sire selection, since that is bound to be “influenced by the trends and fads of the day. The use of outlier, high dollar-beef bulls has become less popular because of the perception that those cattle might be less functional.”\nIndeed, Bowman says the average marbling EPD of the 25 top-use AI sires had dropped. But the recent white paper shows all of the trait correlations maintained the same trends when high-use and high-accuracy bulls were compared with data for all Angus sires.\nResearch on mature cow size and efficiency is less clear. High-marbling cows may tend to be larger and slightly less efficient. The cow energy dollar-value index ($EN) has a minor negative correlation with marbling at -0.23, but the marbling EPD is positively correlated with residual average daily gain (RADG) and the weaned calf index, “suggesting a favorable relationship between marbling potential and both pre-weaning value and post-weaning gain efficiency,” the paper says.\nUsing EPDs and indexes to match cattle to environment is key.\n“The tools are there; you just have to use them,” Bowman says. “The mature size-type components are totally underused.”\nGreiner says it’s important to note that environment is at work, too. Breeding for maternal traits takes much longer to see marked improvements since they’re lowly heritable, he says.\n“Take a trait like fertility…we do know there is a genetic component, unquestionably,” Greiner says. “It’s just that the environmental factors override it so much that genetic selection becomes more difficult for the simple fact that identifying differences becomes more difficult.”\nDick Beck, Three Trees Ranch, Sharpsburg, Ga., says that’s why it is so rewarding to focus on both sides at the same time.\n“Of course we should keep working on the cowherd, but why would you walk away from making progress on a trait that’s easily improved?” he says.\n“To say I’m going to improve 90-day conception rate by 5 percent, that is a tough, tough goal,” Beck says. “Saying I’m going to improve the quality grade of my next calves by 5 percent, I can do that in my sleep, with the right genetics. And it doesn’t take away from my efforts to improve on those tough goals.”\nEditor’s note: Reiman is the assistant director of industry information for Certified Angus Beef LLC."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4fd53b11-5fe1-4819-8434-49be81dc9836>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the best container varieties of peas for maximizing yield in small spaces, and how does vertical growing enhance their productivity? ¿Cuáles son las ventajas específicas del cultivo vertical para los guisantes en términos de protección y apariencia del fruto?","answer":"Burpee offers a specialized container variety called Peas-in-a-Pot, which is specifically bred for containers. This 10-inch plant produces full-size yields in just an 8-inch diameter container. For small spaces, pea shoots are also an excellent option as they grow fast and are rich in Vitamins C, A, and protein. When grown vertically, peas benefit significantly from this growing method. The vertical structure allows the plants to leaf out across the support, creating masses of leaves that protect ripening vegetables from sun and wind burn. The leafy trellis can also shield the garden from prevailing breezes.

But other vining crops such as cucumbers, squashes—both summer and winter, and melons can also be grown vertically.\nMany vining crops will climb vertically by themselves using twisting tendrils to grasp the support. Others may require twist ties or string to help them grow up.\nReasons to Grow Vertically\n• Save space. Vertical vegetable gardening saves space. Cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash require a large amount of ground space. One untrained cantaloupe will crawl over an area of 16 square feet. The same melon trained vertically will take only one or two square feet of ground.\n• Avoid pests and disease. Slugs, snails, and other pests can easily attack crops growing on the ground; it is much more difficult for them to climb trellises or strings. Crops growing on the ground come in contact with wet soil which can cause rot or disease.\n• Fruit appearance. The fruit of cucumbers and squash grown vertically hang down and grow straight with the pull of gravity. Fruits will grow longer and straighter.\n• Protection and garden beauty. Vertically growing vegetables leaf out across the support. Masses of leaves protect ripening vegetables from sun and wind burn. A leafy trellis or fence can shield the garden from prevailing breezes and block out unwanted views—of neighboring property or compost piles.\nTypes of Vertical Supports\n- Trellis, netting, or fence\n- Wire or wooden cages\n- Teepees and tripods\n- Poles and posts\nSet vertical supports to the north side of your planting area so that they do not shade shorter, smaller crops.\nCrops for Vertical Growing\nBeans: pole beans produce throughout the season (bush beans mature all at once, and then stop).\nCucumbers: All varieties of cucumbers can be grown vertically. You can prune cucumbers to a single stem or prune them to the branches growing toward the vertical support. Cucumber grown vertically will grow longer and straighter.\nMelons: All melons can be grown vertically (except watermelons) without support for the fruit. Be sure to pick ripe melons before they slip from the stem. Melons also can be attached to the support with a net or sling.\nPeas: Peas are a spring crop. Space them just 2 inches apart and train them up chicken wire or a fence. When the vines dry up, replace them with beans or squash or any other vine crop.\nSummer squash: Summer squash will form fruit along the length of the vine when grown vertically. Tie summer squash in at about 1 foot lengths.\nTomatoes: Indeterminate or vining tomatoes that keep growing long from the tip of the vine (unlike determinate or bush tomatoes) will grow on any vertical structure including strings. Tomatoes are commonly grown vertically in cages or on poles.\nWinter squash: All winter squash can be grown vertically without support for the fruit, except the large and heavy Hubbard and Banana squash."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7a5f6324-cf2c-42d2-b192-aabc55d196df>","<urn:uuid:0975fd66-edb1-4704-86d1-d935313d770b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key features and benefits of high-end audio devices in terms of sound quality, and what common technical issues should users watch out for when using them?","answer":"High-end audio devices offer exceptional sound quality features like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X codec support for immersive surround sound, with some systems offering up to 11.1.4 speaker setups and AI upsampling for optimal audio performance. However, users should be aware of common technical issues like power cycling problems, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and potential sound distortion. Regular maintenance, including proper cleaning, temperature control, and protection from power surges is essential. Additionally, devices may require firmware updates to resolve compatibility issues and glitches that can hamper performance.","context":["While soundbars are branded as all-in-one solutions for the living room, there are several things you need to look for to ensure you get a great listening experience.\n- Codecs: Love ’em or hate ’em, codecs are an important thing to look for when looking at soundbars. Most will support both Dolby Atmos, which is an object-based surround system, and DTS:X, which uses a traditional speaker layout. For the most part, only blu-ray disks use DTS:X while most streaming services will offer Dolby Atmos.\n- Speaker Array: Most soundbars will advertise something like “5.1.2” or “7.2.4”. This indicates how many speakers the bar has and where they are located. The first number indicates any front or side-firing speakers. The second number indicates how many subwoofers it includes. And that third number indicates how many surround speakers it’ll come with, or in some cases how many up-firing speakers are built-in. So a “7.2.4” setup would have seven front/side speakers, two subwoofers, and either four surround speakers or four up-firing speakers.\n- Audio Return Channel (ARC/eARC): While all of the soundbars on our list support ARC or eARC, not all do. Assuming your TV has ARC/eARC (most modern TVs do have one HDMI input that supports it), it enables your TV to pass on high-quality audio to your soundbar over HDMI, including surround sound and Dolby Atmos. If your TV doesn’t have a dedicated HDMI ARC port, you’ll have to resort to using an optical cable. You cannot pass on Dolby Atmos or surround sound over an optical cable.\n- “Smarts”: As with most of anything else, soundbars are starting to implement “smart” features. Most modern bars allow you to install an app, have access to a digital assistant such as Alexa, or have fancy upsampling features to simulate surround sound on non-surround sound content.\n- ✓ Great Dolby Atmos experience\n- ✓ Supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa\n- ✓ Software updates for years to come\n- ✗ Expensive\n- ✗ Lacks DTS:X surround sound codec\n- ✗ Sub + surround speakers sold separately\nBy far, Sonos offers the best soundbar experience thanks to the company’s expertise with smart home products. The ARC is a 5.1.2 system that only comes with the bar itself (subwoofer and surround sound speakers sold separately). But don’t let that fool you: the out-of-the-box experience is still excellent—picking up the subwoofer and surround speakers will only enhance an already superb experience.\nIn addition to supporting Dolby Atmos, the Wi-Fi connected bar has hands-free integration with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa features, and supports all of the major music streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, Qobuz, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music. It’s practically a smart speaker, but one that actually sounds good, and perfect for listening to music.\nIf you have the extra cash and don’t mind tracking down all the different accessories for it, the Sonos ARC is truly a seamless and reliable soundbar. You can’t go wrong here.\nIt's pricey, but the Sonos ARC with all of its accessories outputs some of the best sound, regardless if it's in Dolby Atmos or streaming on Spotify.\n- ✓ Infinite audio customization options\n- ✓ Superb sound quality\n- ✓ Sturdy and straightforward remote\n- ✗ Expensive\n- ✗ Lacks any sort of \"smart\" features\nWhile you lose out on some of the smarts, the Shockwafe Ultra from Nakamichi is one of the highest-quality soundbars out there, rivaling some dedicated home theater setups when it comes to immersive sound. Being 9.2.4, the bar has five front-facing, two side-firing, and two up-firing speakers. You’ll also get two wireless subwoofers and four surround speakers. It’s almost a surround sound system, all it’s really missing is some rear speakers. The only downside here is that, while the subwoofers are wireless, the surround speakers are wired and need to be plugged into the subwoofers.\nOf course, since almost nothing is mastered in 9.2.4, Nakamichi uses artificial intelligence (AI) to upsample your audio source and make use of every speaker the system has. It features all the goodies, including DTS:X and Dolby Atmos surround sound codec support, a proper remote control with an equalizer (EQ) and volume controls, and a bold design.\nThe only thing the bar really lacks is any sort of “smarts” such as voice assistant support, an app, or a connection to the internet. To do firmware updates, you’ll need to download them on your computer, copy it to a flash drive, and install it via the bar’s USB port on the back. But if your primary concern is sound quality, this is one you should look at.\nNakamichi Shockwafe Ultra\nSometimes adding more speakers does equate to a superior sound experience. The Nakamichi Shockwafe Ultra features a 9.2.4 speaker setup that sounds incredible. Though, some may dislike its futuristic design.\n- ✓ Excellent Dolby Atmos experience\n- ✓ Great surround sound experience\n- ✗ Expensive\n- ✗ Mediocre stereo listening experience\nIf you want the absolute best option for Dolby Atmos and surround sound content, look no further than the Samsung HW-Q950A. Trading blows with the Shockwafe Ultra and the Sonos ARC, the Samsung bar gets you a more elevated experience. It’s an 11.1.4 setup, which means the bar has 11 speakers, one external subwoofer, and four surround speakers. And much like the Shockwafe Ultra, it will upsample everything you’ve got in order to make use of every speaker.\nHowever, the bar performs rather poorly for stereo or audio content not directly mixed in surround sound or Dolby Atmos. It’s not a terrible experience, but you could do much better, especially at this price point. On the bright side, though, the HW-Q950A does feature hands-free control via Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant.\nAt its price, you should hope that Samsung is delivering a great Dolby Atmos experience, especially with an 11.1.4 speaker setup.\n- ✓ Inexpensive\n- ✓ Good Dolby Atmos experience\n- ✓ Great stereo listening experience\n- ✗ Lacks up-firing speakers\nSometimes you don’t want the absolute best, but you also don’t want to cheap out and buy the least expensive thing. That’s where this Vizio M-Series soundbar comes in. It’s a 5.1 setup that features two surround speakers and a single subwoofer in addition to the soundbar.\nIt packs in all the bells and whistles such as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X decoding, eARC, and surround speakers. Though, it is missing up-firing speakers, which hampers the Dolby Atmos experience a small tad. But don’t get us wrong, it still provides a solid experience despite the lack of up-firing speakers. It’s a great all-around soundbar that has great surround sound and stereo performance.\nVizio M Series M51ax-J6\nThe M51ax-J6 does everything you'd expect it to. It checks off every box and offers a pretty great sound experience, all without putting a huge dent in your budget.\n- ✓ Inexpensive\n- ✓ Good surround sound experience\n- ✓ DTS decoding\n- ✗ Lacks support for Dolby Atmos\n- ✗ Lacks support for lossless audio\nThe V Series V51-H6 from Vizio is a solid entry-level choice, and one of the most affordable well. It’s the best option for those looking for something more than just their TV speakers, but not a ton more. It does lack certain features, however, like to play Dolby Atmos content nor is it able to decode lossless audio over ARC, but that’s to be expected at this price point.\nDespite its shortcomings, this Vizio bar sports a 5.1.2 speaker setup, capable of standard surround sound decoding via the DTS codec. It also plays stereo content exceptionally well. This makes it a great option for those who plan on playing traditional TV or YouTube primarily. For the price, it’s hard to complain about its lack of lossless audio decoding or Dolby Atmos support.\nVizio V Series V51-H6\nThe V51-H6 is great for those looking to upgrade from their TV speakers. It's especially great if your main point of entertainment is live TV or watching YouTube videos.","Arcam sa30 problems: troubleshoot glitches and technical issues with the high-end amplifier in a few steps.

{"question":"¿Podría explicar detalladamente cómo se relacionan los principios de limpieza y preparación en la técnica Kurinuki con los rituales de purificación en la ceremonia del té tradicional japonesa?","answer":"Both the Kurinuki technique and the Japanese tea ceremony emphasize careful preparation and cleanliness. In Kurinuki, artisans must carefully select clay that is appropriately soft and moist, ensuring it's clean enough to work with but not too wet to prevent cracking. The clay is then meticulously carved and finally smoothed and polished for a uniform finish. Similarly, in the traditional tea ceremony, cleanliness is paramount - the host ensures the ceremony area and approach are immaculately clean, even rinsing stone walkways free of dust. Guests must also participate in cleansing rituals, washing their hands and rinsing their mouths at a stone basin, symbolically leaving behind the dust of everyday life. Both practices share a fundamental respect for the materials and process, emphasizing purity and careful preparation as essential elements of their respective arts.","context":["DISCOVER THE ART OF KURINUKI\nCeramics is one of the oldest art forms in the world. Since prehistoric times, mankind has used clay to create utensils, decorative objects and works of art. The Kurinuki technique is one of the most unique and recognized ceramic techniques used in Japan. Through this technique, artisans can create unique and fascinating pieces of great beauty and simplicity. You will learn about a magical sample of Japanese ceramics, its history, characteristics and more. Join us!\nWHAT IS KURINUKI\nIt is a Japanese ceramic technique that involves carving the desired shape into a piece of clay. The name kurinuki can be literally translated as “to hollow”.\nA single lump of clay is used which is carved with the appropriate tools to achieve the desired shape. Instead of creating a work from individual pieces of clay, as is done in some other techniques, the piece is carved from a single block of clay. The result is frankly beautiful.\nTea bowl made with the Kurinuki technique. Made by\nSarah Maelle Ceramique.\nWHAT DOES THE KURINUKI TECHNIQUE CONSIST OF?\nThe Kurinuki technique begins with the selection of the right block of clay. The artisan must ensure that the clay is soft and moist enough to carve easily, but not too wet to prevent cracking during carving.\nOnce the clay is selected, it is cut into the desired basic shape and carved using different tools, such as clay knives, needles and spatulas. As the piece takes shape, small amounts of clay are removed to achieve the desired design.\nArtisans use this technique to create organic shapes and unique textures on the surface of the bowl. The Kurinuki process involves sculpting the clay from the inside of the bowl to the outside, rather than shaping the form from the outside to the inside, as is done in other ceramic techniques.\nFinally, the part can be smoothed and polished to obtain a smooth and uniform finish.\nArtist: Ewe Suchanek\nYUNOMI TYPE KURINUKI BOWL\nArtist: Chanoyu Ceramics\nSMALL YUNOMI STYLE CUP\nArtist: Clarochelle Ceramiste\nLEARN MORE ABOUT ITS ORIGIN AND USES\nThe Kurinuki technique dates back to medieval Japanese times, where it was used to make ceramic objects for the tea ceremony. During the Edo period (1603-1868), the technique was extended to the production of other everyday objects, such as bowls and plates. Despite the popularity of the technique, most objects produced with Kurinuki were made for personal use and were not widely marketed.\nDue to the special nature of this technique, each resulting piece is unique and no two pieces can be made alike. This uniqueness has led many artisans to embrace the Kurinuki technique as an art form to express themselves with unrepeatable creations.\nOne of the most popular applications of this technique is in the creation of Yunomi bowls, which are used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\nThese ceramic bowls have a cylindrical shape and are sometimes wider at the base than at the mouth. They are used for drinking tea and are held with both hands while drinking. Because of their ceremonial use, these pieces are of great cultural importance in Japan.\nAnother type of bowls that are made with Kurinuki are the Chawan, these are less cylindrical and wider.\nArita Porcelain: A priceless marvel of ceramicsWelcome to a journey full of charm that will take you through the fascinating history of Arita pottery.

The regimented movements and actions seem to fly in the face of the intention behind the ceremony, which is to foster a feeling of harmony and calm. But once examined as a discipline, it can be translated into something that non Japanese people can absorb.\nThe f irst thing that must be considered is the setting. Small rooms that are constructed specifically for tea ceremonies between the host and a single guest are often placed with a view of a well maintained garden or a natural setting free from distractions. Larger settings can be done, but the overriding concern is that there be a simple setting where the guests can focus on the moment. Most tea ceremonies will have a small alcove with an artistic piece, such as a scroll, flower arrangement or bonsai is placed. Otherwise, the room should be comfortable, simple and clear of things that draw attention away from the participants and the tea. Once the setting is established, the host makes sure that the area and the approach to it are as clean as possible. In settings that have a stone walk way or path, even the stones will be rinsed free of dust.\nWhen the guests arrive, they remove their footwear, much like any proper Japanese setting. They are also wash their hands and rinse their mouths from a small stone basin. If this is not available, hot steamed towels are offered instead to at least wash their hands. There is no implications that anyone is not hygienic meant by this. It is actually a symbolic gesture towards leaving the dust of everyday life behind for a short time and approach the tea with a clear mind.\nIf a traditional charcoal fire is being used to heat the water, the host will wait until everyone is seated before laying the fire. Then a light meal of several courses is presented, with each dish being individually brought to a guest. The food should already be plated and ready to be eaten. The guests should not have to serve or cut anything as this is considered a lack of preparation on the host’s part. Sake is served, but only a single small cup to cleanse the palette. A single sweet that each guests carries is the end of the meal. This is to indicate that each person brings something unique to the event.\nAfter the meal, guests are invited to the waiting area or garden while the room is cleared of dishes. There should be no work done in the presence of guests. When the room is again ready, the host invites the guests back for their tea. In the presence of the other participants, the host will then clean each utensils with a cloth, using prescribed motions. The practice needed to do this is much like a dance. It should be done privately so often that the host need not struggle to remember any steps. This is one of the true indicators of mastery of the tea ceremony.\nThe tea itself is made using a thicker ratio of the powdered green tea than is usual. The measuring and mixing is all done in a specifically made bowl and even the number of turns made while whisking is decided by tradition. Once the tea is ready, the guest will receive it form the host or an assistant. Before drinking, the guest will bow to the host as a sign of respect. The bowl is then lifted and turned back towards the host. The guest then inhales to experience the aroma, takes a sip and gives a bow of the head to the bowl. That person then wipes the place they sipped from and will either offer the bowl to the next guest or back to the host, depending on the number of participants. This continues until everyone present has sampled the stronger tea.\nThe host then removes the bowl from the room and when returning, will bring more confections and begins making individual cups of tea that follows a more usual ratio of tea to water. This is the less formal stage fo the ceremony, and afterward the host wipes all the utensils clean. The guest of honor will then ask to examine the artistry of the utensils used and the host will allow them to be passed around. These items are often handed down from generation to generation and many are works of art in their own right. Once all this is done, the host will escort the guests to the door and once the host bows to them as they leave, the ceremony is complete.\nThese steps are not done as a sign of opulence on the host’s part. They are done as a sign of respect for the guests. All of the ritual and practice are used to remove any discomfort or unexpected incidents that usually happen during a less formal occasion. The tea ceremony is one of the few situations where the entire practice, from start to finish, is meant to calm the people present and give them a refuge from the usual chaos of life. The tea being central to this shows that it is more than a beverage, it can be a strong symbol of\nFREE eBook Gift for Signing Up\nGet Your FREE eBook\nSubscribe to Robert's mailing list and get a FREE eBook offer.\nThank you for subscribing.\nSomething went wrong."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9d27e125-15d7-4ee2-9310-b40f74021697>","<urn:uuid:da81a379-7fa8-4a14-b62b-4b75765df340>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the core principles of classical Confucian political ethics, and how do they relate to modern democratic values in East Asian societies?","answer":"Classical Confucian political ethics centers on key principles like filiality (xiao), benevolence (ren), and ritual propriety (li). These traditional values emphasize mutual relationships, particularly through the five relationships articulated by Mencius: parent-child (affection), ruler-minister (rightness), husband-wife (gender distinctions), older-younger siblings (order), and friends (trustworthiness). In modern East Asian democracies like South Korea and Taiwan, these Confucian principles coexist with democratic values of popular sovereignty, political equality, and rights to political participation. The integration manifests in phenomena like active civic engagement while maintaining cultural respect for authority and social harmony. Importantly, contemporary interpretations seek to reconcile Confucian ethical principles with modern democratic practices rather than viewing them as incompatible.","context":["Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews\nSungmoon Kim, Public Reason Confucianism: Democratic Perfectionism and Constitutionalism in East Asia, Cambridge University Press, 2016, 276pp., $99.99 (hbk), ISBN 9781107106222.\nReviewed by Sam Crane, Williams College\nWhat can Confucianism be in the modern world? In adapting traditional concepts and principles to contemporary social and political circumstances, how much revision is too much? At what point does the modernity of a modern Confucianism overwhelm its Confucian distinctiveness? Among theorists who wrestle with these sorts of questions, politics is a central concern. On the one hand are those who view Confucianism, and its difference from liberalism, as inseparably tied to elitist, non-democratic political practices and institutions. On the other hand are varieties of Confucian democrats, who believe key principles can be adapted to liberal political contexts without losing their unique, non-liberal qualities.\nSungmoon Kim places himself squarely in the Confucian democrat camp and his tightly argued book is an outstanding example of comparative philosophy. It is a rigorously synthetic work, bringing together a sophisticated understanding of political liberalism and a nuanced analysis of contemporary Confucianism. Kim’s project, at its most general, is to reconcile Confucian precepts — filiality (xiao), benevolence (ren), ritual propriety (ii), among others — which he asserts are still robust in contemporary East Asian societies, with the now well entrenched democratic politics of places like South Korea and Taiwan. In doing so, he strives to stay true to both sides of the story: maintaining principles that are consistently and intelligibly “Confucian” while demanding that key democratic ideals — popular sovereignty, political equality, and the right to political participation — are not lost in the process. In most of this, he admirably succeeds.\nHe begins in the Introduction by drawing a distinction between Confucian meritocratic perfectionism and Confucian democratic perfectionism. The former generally frames modern Confucianism as a set of communitarian ideals for the good life that are best realized by a meritocratic elite who gain and maintain power through non-democratic means. Kim rejects this approach in light of current political realities in East Asia, most notably the emergence of value pluralism, and because the most prominent examples of this line of thinking are beset by inconsistency.\nOn Kim’s account, Confucian meritocratic perfectionists cannot give up completely on democracy. None of the key proponents of this position advocate for a return to monarchy, the political context of classical Confucian thought. All are moderns in the sense that democratic legitimation of some sort is necessary in the contemporary politics of most countries (even North Korea names itself the “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”). Therefore, they all seek different forms of synthesis, as Kim would have it, of bits of democracy and bits of meritocracy. But, upon close analysis, Kim finds these efforts lacking:\nThe theoretical difficulties that Confucian meritocratic perfectionism is chronically exposed to and the unsatisfactory responses to them give rise to a need for an alternative normative political theory that is both Confucian-perfectionist and robustly democratic, as well as more responsive to the fact of pluralism. (pp. 13-14)\nThat alternative is Kim’s notion of Confucian democratic perfectionism, which he further refines to public reason Confucianism.\nBefore examining the core of Kim’s argument, however, it should be noted that he does not ignore his Confucian meritocratic perfectionist adversaries after dispatching their central premises at the outset. All throughout the text, Kim refers to the meritocratic alternative, especially the work of Joseph Chan (2015), to delineate and clarify his own position. Kim uses the near dialogic quality of these juxtapositions to delve deeply into democratic and liberal theories.\nIn Chapter 1, Kim, drawing on Jonathan Quong (2011), argues that since Confucianism is “already a self-contained ethical system and a comprehensive doctrine,” (p. 39) there is no sensible way to formulate a contemporary political Confucianism that is not perfectionist. By this reckoning, to be intelligibly “Confucian,” though not identical to its traditional expressions, modern Confucianism must be understood as a “particular ideal of what constitutes a valuable or worthwhile human life” (p. 38) that can guide how state power is used to “promote or discourage some activities, ideals, or ways of life” (p. 38). Anti-perfectionism, which would demand state neutrality in the adjudication of value conflicts, is untenable for Confucianism due to its prior ethical commitments. In this, Kim agrees with his interlocutor Chan. But Kim goes on to reject Chan’s notion of a “moderate political Confucian perfectionism,” because, Kim argues, Confucianism cannot be reasonably interpreted as a merely “political” doctrine, in Rawlsian terms; it must be seen as “comprehensive.” This leaves a problem of how to limit state power in the pursuit of comprehensive perfectionist goals so as to not trample upon extant value pluralism; that is how to construct a moderate or limited comprehensive perfectionism. Kim’s solution is to oppose Chan’s meritocratic standpoint and embrace a fuller acceptance of democratic practice: “In other words, only when it is Confucian democratic perfectionism can comprehensive Confucian perfectionism be moderate.” (p. 66)\nKim continues in Chapter 2 to construct his central concept: public reason Confucianism. To do so, he both builds upon and distances his argument from Rawls. Although he quotes William Galston’s (1991) observation that Rawls comes close to “a kind of democratic perfectionism” (p. 85), Kim is more explicit in fleshing out the relationship between public reason and perfectionism, and suggests that he is making a unique contribution here: “Understandably, no perfectionist has yet to attempt to make public reason, so understood, an integral part of their normative theory.” (p. 77) Whether or not he is successful in this endeavor will, no doubt, be determined by continuing debate among specialists in both liberal theory and contemporary Confucianism. He finishes the chapter with a specification of six propositions that clarify the democratic entailments of public reason Confucianism, centering on equal citizenship and protection of basic freedoms in a society “still saturated with Confucian habit, mores, and moral sentiments.” (p. 88)\nIn the next two chapters, 3 and 4, Kim provides concrete examples of how public reason Confucianism might be manifest in actually existing political debates. He focuses on two court cases in South Korea to demonstrate the extent to which Confucian values can be preserved as they are balanced against the requirements of liberal citizenship.\nIn one case, in which the Constitutional Court in 2005 abolished the family-head system — a traditional institutionalization of patrilineality in property law and other legal and social matters — Kim contends that Confucianism was insufficiently safeguarded. He fully recognizes that the deep and abiding gender discrimination of the existing law had to change, but argues that, instead of complete abolition, the system could have been revised to allow women to assume the role of family-head previously reserved only for men. The key here is the redefinition of family practices that embody Confucian social relations, and that offer a conception of personhood different from the fully autonomous individual of liberalism, while at the same time easing the social inequality imposed on women.\nIn the second case, a 2005 Supreme Court decision that ruled against limiting formal membership in clan organizations to only male family members, Kim generally agrees with the outcome, but offers different reasons for his concurrence. From the perspective of public reason Confucianism, clan organization membership should be open to women, not because all voluntary private associations should realize a liberal ideal of gender equality in and of themselves, but because exclusion fails on Confucian grounds:\nThe true source of injustice is that the clan organizations have excluded female members from formal membership, violating their norm of filial piety, a virtue which must be possessed by both men and women according to Confucius. (p. 147)\nThe full depth of Kim’s reasoning on these cases cannot be replicated in a brief review, but he offers them as moments of negotiation between the competing demands of institutionalized democratic norms versus enduring cultural beliefs and practices. Indeed, he suggests that political modernization, the entrenchment of democracy and certain of its liberal repercussions, creates an “identity crisis” in Confucian societies like South Korea (p. 127). Public reason Confucianism, he argues, is the best response insofar as its democratic commitments limit the potential authoritarianism of a more extreme perfectionism, thus respecting value pluralism, while maintaining cultural continuity through its defense of Confucian values.\nIn Chapter 5, Kim turns to civic virtue, and the question of how it should relate to moral virtue. Traditional, wholly comprehensive, Confucianism assumes ethical monism, in which there is no contradiction between the two since moral virtues are civic virtues: a good ruler is a good son, and if the ruler is not a good son, he cannot be a good ruler. Kim sees this as an untenable position in a modern society characterized by value pluralism, but his own position, which he refers to as “tempered virtue monism” (p. 193), is problematic. He wants to hold on to a kind of monism, wherein Confucian moral virtues — such as filiality and benevolence — function as civic virtues, but only in an instrumental sense:\nTheir public-constitutional promotion is not necessarily due to a universal moral assumption that they are human virtues to be embraced by all, as was claimed by traditional Confucianism, but rather due to their largely instrumental (and perfectionist) role in sustaining and reproducing the Confucian public character of the polity, with ceaseless modifications and adjustments, under the modern circumstances of politics marked by value pluralism and moral disagreement. (p. 199)\nAt what point, however, does the expansion of value pluralism and moral disagreement require something more than “modifications and adjustments” to Confucian virtues? What happens if and when moral virtues lose their publically oriented instrumental efficacy? The democratic basis of public reason Confucianism would seem to necessitate a tolerance for evolving views on virtue and, thus, ultimately lead to more of a separation of a particularly Confucian set of moral virtues and the kinds of civic virtues required to maintain the polity.\nThis problem is especially important in light of Kim’s vigorous defense of a Confucian-derived right of political participation in Chapter 6. Menicus figures prominently here, most notably the apparent tension between his “philosophical advocacy of moral equality and individual dignity and his subscription to political inequality.” (p. 219) Kim overcomes this seeming contradiction with a reconstruction of Mencian thought to argue that, in fact, a kind of political agency can be found there (p. 222), and, moreover, that anyone, through sufficient moral cultivation, can become a public official (p. 221). Together these form a rudimentary concept of a participatory public that, when combined with the modern sociological fact of democratic citizenship in South Korea (and Taiwan) produces a strong basis for a right to political participation consistent with Confucian principles. He then defends this position against his meritocratic opponents who reject the democratic possibilities inherent in Confucianism.\nAlthough perhaps not his primary intention, Kim’s overall formulation of public reason Confucianism goes a long way towards understanding recent political developments in South Korea. The remarkable public demonstrations and presidential impeachment in Seoul stand out as notable examples of a highly active democratic public in a society commonly regarded as infused with Confucian sensibilities. In very direct and concrete ways, individual Koreans are negotiating the line between liberalism and Confucianism: how much should they defer to authority and how much should they assert their individual rights? Even if President Park had presented herself as a good and filial daughter, many Koreans came to believe that her transgressions of civic virtues necessitated her removal.\nBut public reason Confucianism still faces a daunting problem. South Korean society is changing. It is day-by-day becoming more diversely multicultural and more participatively democratic. Insofar as Confucian democratic perfectionism is a moderate or limited perfectionism, and is genuinely democratic, its politics must reflect underlying social and political dynamics. As more people enter the political arena, it is likely that value pluralism and moral disagreement will expand accordingly. And if those social-political dynamics move in a more liberal direction, if, for example, people come to feel that settled notions of filiality are limiting their individual thriving, Confucian democracy could run counter to Confucian perfectionism, consigning Confucian philosophy and life to a much more limited and confined cultural space, rather like Christianity in Europe.\nIn the meantime, Sungmoon Kim has given us a masterful analysis of the intersections and boundaries of Confucianism and liberalism, an account that is certainly more empirically accurate than its meritocratic perfectionist rivals in its depiction of South Korean and Taiwanese political realities, and stimulatingly suggestive of democratic possibilities in authoritarian East Asian states where Confucianism is a part of the public discourse.\nChan, J.

Coleman\nFor much of the twentieth century, Confucianism was condemned by Westerners and East Asians alike as antithetical to modernity. Internationally renowned philosophers, historians, and social scientists argue otherwise in Confucian Political Ethics. They show how classical Confucian theory—with its emphasis on family ties, self-improvement, education, and the social good—is highly relevant to the most pressing dilemmas confronting us today.\nDrawing upon in-depth, cross-cultural dialogues, the contributors delve into the relationship of Confucian political ethics to contemporary social issues, exploring Confucian perspectives on civil society, government, territorial boundaries and boundaries of the human body and body politic, and ethical pluralism. They examine how Confucianism, often dismissed as backwardly patriarchal, can in fact find common ground with a range of contemporary feminist values and need not hinder gender equality. And they show how Confucian theories about war and peace were formulated in a context not so different from today's international system, and how they can help us achieve a more peaceful global community. This thought-provoking volume affirms the enduring relevance of Confucian moral and political thinking, and will stimulate important debate among policymakers, researchers, and students of politics, philosophy, applied ethics, and East Asian studies.\nThe contributors are Daniel A.

It will surely stimulate thoughtful reflection and debate for many years to come.\"—Sarah A. Queen, Journal of Law and Religion\nClassical Chinese intellectual traditions (which were not confined to China proper, but had enormous influence throughout east asia, particularly in Japan, Korea, and vietnam) did not even have words for civil society, much less a theory of it. In Chinese, for instance, the word for society (shehui) is a neologism from the West, introduced into China via Japan in the late-nineteenth century. Though based on classical Chinese characters, it was a new combination of characters, used in a new sense, to name a modern phenomenon-the development in treaty Port cities of a separate societal sphere of life that could be at least analytically distinguished from separate economic and political spheres, which were also denoted by words new to the Chinese lexicon. The term civil is even newer, and less well established in modern asian lexicons. In contemporary Chinese, for example, there are no fewer than four words that are used to translate the civil in civil society. Alternatively, Chinese intellectuals today call civil society shimin shehui, which literally means \"city-people's society\"; or gongmin she-hui, \"citizens' society\"; or minjian shehui, \"people-based society\"; or wenming shehui, \"civilized society.\" These are all attempts to name phenomena and to articulateaspirations that have arisen in an urbanizing east asia linked to a global market economy. In this confusing, transitional context, many intellectuals are feeling the need to develop new theories of civil society and new ways of developing such a society, even if they are not completely sure what to call it and how to link it-if it can be linked at all-with their cultural traditions. Those traditions are complex, pluralistic, and full of conflicting and contradictory ideas about how to live a good life in a well-ordered world. Major strands include the daoist celebration of natural, virtually anarchistic spontaneity, the legalist pursuit of centralized political order through carefully controlled allocation of rewards and punishments- and the \"thinking of the scholars,\" to which Western Sinologists in the nineteenth century gave the name \"Confucianism.\" Systematized by great philosophers such as Zhu Xi into a comprehensive framework of ideas during the late Song dynasty in the eleventh and twelfth centuries c.e., the \"neo-Confucian\" tradition blended some metaphysical ideas from Buddhism with the moral teachings of Confucius (551-478 b.c.e.) and his disciples (particularly Mencius, 390-305 b.c.e.), which advocated a middle way between daoist anarchism and legalist authoritarianism.\nUnlike the daoists, the Confucians searched for a stable political order. But unlike the legalists, they insisted that such order had to be based on moral principles, not simply on power. Scholars in this tradition had vigorous disagreements about how people could know these principles and learn to apply them. On one side of these debates were what Wm. Theodore de Bary has called a relatively \"liberal\" interpretation, which would be consistent with many of the standards for human rights advocated by modern Western liberals-or at least \"liberal communitarians.\" But there were also authoritarian interpretations of the neo-Confucian traditions. In east asia today, apologists for authoritarian governments like that of Singapore invoke the Confucian tradition to suppress much of what would be considered part of civil society in the West. At the same time, prominent asian intellectuals like tu Wei-ming invoke more \"liberal\" strands of Confucianism to build a base for relative openness in east asian societies.\nIf there is to be a meaningful dialogue between modern proponents of Confucian thought, on the one hand, and theories of civil society that derive from the Western enlightenment, on the other, it will, in my view, have to draw upon those relatively liberal strands of the neo-Confucian tradition. These are the strands that i will emphasize in this chapter.\nINGREDIENTS: WHO, AND WHAT, DOES CIVIL SOCIETY INCLUDE?\nThis question seems to envision a social framework that can gather together certain individual parts while excluding others. If this is so, the question fails to make sense in a Confucian context. Confucian thought does not conceive the world in terms of delimited parts. The great social anthropologist fei Xiaotong has given the following vivid account of the difference between Confucian and Western ways of thinking about the configuration of relationships that constitute a society.\nIn some ways Western society bears a resemblance to the way we bundle kin-dling wood in the fields. A few rice stalks are bound together to make a handful, several handfuls are bound together to make a small bundle, several small bundles are bound together to make a larger bundle, and several larger bundles are bound together to make a stack to carry on a pole. Every single stalk in the entire stack belongs to one specific large bundle, one specific small bundle, and one specific handful. Similar stalks are assembled together, clearly classified, and then bound together. In a society these units are groups.... the group has a definite demarcation line.\"\nThe configuration of Chinese society, on the other hand, is \"like the rings of successive ripples that are propelled outward on the surface when you throw a stone into water. Each individual is the center of the rings emanating from his social influence. Wherever the ripples reach, affiliations occur.\"\nThe ripples can eventually reach everywhere. The neo-Confucian vision was thus holistic. As tu Wei-ming characterizes it, \"[S]elf, community, nature, and heaven are integrated in an anthropocosmic vision.\" Insofar as discourse is driven by this holistic imagination, it is difficult to make the distinctions that are the staple of Western secular civil society discourse: between public and private, and voluntary and involuntary forms of association.\nThere are words in Chinese-gong and si-that translate as \"public\" and \"private,\" but in the logic of Confucian discourse the distinction be-tween them is completely relative. Once again, according to fei Xiaotong:\nSacrificing one's family for oneself, sacrificing one's clan for one's family-this formula is an actual fact. Under such a formula what would someone say if you called him si [acting in his private interest]? he would not be able to see it that way, because when he sacrificed his clan, he might have done it for his family, and the way he looks at it, his family is gong [the public interest]. When he sacrificed the nation for the benefit of his small group in the struggle for power, he was also doing it for the public interest [gong], the public interest of his small group.... Gong and si are relative terms; anything within the circle in which one is standing can be called gong.\nLikewise, the distinction between voluntary and involuntary forms of association is blurry. In the West the family is the prototypical in-voluntary association; one does not choose one's parents. But in the asian traditions there is a different way of thinking about the family. fei Xiaotong again: if a friend in england or america writes a letter saying he is going to \"bring his family\" to visit, the recipient knows very well who will be coming. But \"in China, although we frequently see the phrase, 'your entire family is invited,' very few people could say exactly which persons should be included under 'family.'\" A person can choose to include distant relatives or even friends as part of broadly conceived family. The involuntary relationships that make up the kinship group are expanded in indeterminate ways by voluntary affiliation.\nA traditional discourse centered on a holistic \"anthropocosmic vision\" and unable to make fixed distinctions between public and private, voluntary and involuntary forms of association-this would not seem a very promising basis for developing a coherent theory of civil society. Contemporary Chinese and other asians are faced with social realities that cannot readily be encompassed by this vision. One of the words for civil society, it will be noted, is shimin shehui, \"urban society.\" In modern metropolises like hong Kong, Shanghai, taipei, tokyo, or Seoul, the asian intellectual has to contend with extreme social fragmentation, industrial or postindustrial divisions of labor, populations influenced by global media and demanding opportunities for free, individualistic self-expression, and a powerful, globalized market economy-all of which put complex demands on the state.\nThere are those, of course, who think that the only way to confront these new challenges is through \"all-out Westernization,\" rather than through any appropriation of the Confucian legacy. But others believe that it is neither possible nor desirable to discard that legacy. When those who consider the reappropriation of the Confucian legacy consider the issue of civil society, they look to the intermediate associations between the nuclear family and the state. The logic of Confucian-ism makes it difficult to make sharp distinctions between the various elements in this intermediate realm. Instead of seeing different kinds of associations as independent entities, like so many separate sticks within a bundle of firewood, each with its own purposes and each at least potentially in competition with each other, they tend to think of the different elements as fluidly interpenetrating each other, like the ripples on a pond. When they use the word minjian shuhui-\"people-based society\"-to translate civil society, they do not usually connote popular groups acting independently of the state. They assume that people-based groups cannot properly exist without the general permission, guidance, and supervision of the government.\nAt one extreme, those envisioning such people-based groups from top to bottom might see them simply as a \"transmission belt\" between the state and the lowest realms of the society. (Ideologues in Mainland China and some apologists for the Singapore regime would fall into this category.) Public purposes infuse what we in the West would think of as private matters. At the other extreme, those envisioning people-based groups from bottom to the top are likely to blend what Westerners consider private matters with public affairs. They may think of groups like the family as legitimately being able to influence affairs of state. (into this category might fall some of those who celebrate familistic, \"guanxi capitalism,\" in which business deals are regulated by particularistic connections between relatives and friends rather than impersonally applied laws.) But most intellectuals working within the Confucian tradition fall between these extremes. For instance, they recognize the necessity for intermediate associations to maintain a large degree of autonomy from the state. Yet because of the difficulty that Confucian discourse has of offering a principled justification for such autonomy, they advocate it more on pragmatic grounds. an institutional embodiment of this stance is perhaps seen on contemporary taiwan, which in many ways is witnessing a \"springtime of civil society,\" with a tremendous proliferation of intermediate associations-religious, ethnic, commercial, environ-mentalist, feminist. To have a legitimate standing in taiwanese society, all of these groups must be duly registered with an appropriate government ministry, and thus in principle accept government supervision. But there are now so many of these groups that the government could not regulate them, even it wanted to. For all intents and purposes these groups function as autonomous, voluntary associations. Members of such groups definitely seem to want this practical autonomy. But most seem reluctant to undertake the effort that would be necessary to establish a principled basis for it.\nSOCIETY: WHAT MAKES CIVIL SOCIETY A SOCIETY AND NOT A SIMPLE AGGREGATE?\nThe Confucian vision is radically social. as herbert fingarette puts it: \"for Confucius, unless there are at least two human beings, there are no human beings.\" The relationships that define the conditions for human flourishing were given a classic formulation by Mencius:\nBetween parent and child there is to be affection Between ruler and minister, rightness Between husband and wife, [gender] distinctions Between older and younger [siblings], an order of precedence Between friends, trustworthiness\nThis formulation assumes that human persons flourish through per-forming different, mutually complementary roles. Some roles should take priority over others-for instance, the role of parent is more important than the role of friend. But this formulation does not justify a top-down, authoritarian system in which it is the prerogative of superior people to give orders and the duty of inferiors blindly to obey.\nThere is another formulation of the basic Confucian relationships that does justify authoritarianism. That is the doctrine of the \"three bonds,\" between ruler/minister, father/son, and husband/wife. Today, in common discourse, the core of Confucian teaching is indeed understood in terms of these authoritarian three bonds. according to Wm. Theodore de Bary, however, the three bonds \"have no place in the Confucian classics, and were only codified later in [first century c.e.] han texts.\" They are of legalist provenance, products of an age when Confucianism became the ideology of the imperial state. Apologists for asian authoritarian regimes like to stress the importance of the three bonds. But Zhu Xi and most neo-Confucians rarely mention them. And when tu Wei-ming and other modern Confucian intellectuals try to press Confucian-ism into the service of creating a democratic civil society, they claim that the Mencian vision of mutuality is the most authentic expression of Confucianism.\nEven if one tries to build a vision of civil society around the five relationships of Mencius, it would be difficult to avoid making moral distinctions between men and women and older and younger people that would be unacceptable to Western liberals. However, in theory at least, these distinctions would lead not to inferiority but to complementary reciprocity. The emphasis in the parent/child and husband/wife relation-ship would be on mutual affection and love, expressed energetically and creatively on all sides. The parent should instruct the child, but the child should also admonish the parent if the parent is doing something wrong. In the Classic of filial Piety, the disciple of Confucius asks the Master, \"[i]f a child follows all of his parents' commands, can this be called filiality? the Master replied, 'What kind of talk is this! ... if a father even had one son to remonstrate with him, he still would not fall into evil ways. In the face of whatever is not right, the son cannot but remonstrate with his father.'\" In the Classic of filial Piety for Women, \"the women said, 'We dare to ask whether we follow all our husbands' commands we could be called virtuous?' her ladyship answered, 'What kind of talk is this! ... if a husband has a remonstrating wife then he won't fall into evil ways. therefore if a husband transgresses against the Way, you must correct him. how could it be that to obey your husband in everything would make you a virtuous person?'\"\nExcerpted from Confucian Political Ethics by Daniel A.

{"question":"Module homes vs RTM - quick delivery?","answer":"Ready-to-Move (RTM) homes are built completely in one piece and delivered fully finished, requiring only foundation securing and service connections. Modular homes, while also factory-built, come in sections that are 70-90% complete and take a few days for final assembly on-site. Both options are faster than traditional construction, but RTM homes offer the quickest completion once delivered, though their transport requires road access and costs increase with distance from the builder's yard.","context":["Constructed entirely or largely on-site from a customized floor plan using any number of materials like wood, concrete, and straw. Materials are purchased as needed, transported in convenient loads and don’t require much on-site storage. The process is more time-consuming than most “package” options, so the short building season in Canada needs to be considered. With extensive hands-on experience and/or a reliable construction crew, the result can be a source of great pride and satisfaction as your custom home design becomes a reality.\nThese kits encompass styles like traditional framed designs, log homes, and timber-framed options; almost any style can be customized to suit your budget and requirements. All the major building components are pre-cut and prepared in a facility and shipped to the construction site for assembly. This is a good option if you have time, some building experience, and help. A basic package provides everything needed to bring your house to the “lock-up” or weather-tight stage, including windows, doors and roof. A “complete” package can cover insulation, drywall, interior doors and trims, exterior finishing, cabinets and even appliances. Detailed construction plans accompany the materials that are delivered to the site on drop-deck trailers in one or more loads. You will need to ensure site access for these large vehicles and storage for the package components, but you can expect to pay less for a kit house package because of the supplier’s bulk-buying power and the time saved in pre-cutting and sourcing materials.\nThese houses are built to some degree of completion in an off-site climate-controlled facility. This is a fast-growing industry that has evolved to offer both stock plans and custom-designed options.\nIncludes pre-built wall and floor panels that are shipped to the building site and lifted into place using a crane. The wall panels can be simply the studs and sheathing, or can include windows, doors, wiring and insulation. The package will include the floor and/or roof assemblies, prebuilt stairs, siding, doors and hardware to facilitate bringing the house to the lock-up stage in a very short time.\nThese distinctive spherical structures consist of triangular shapes within circles, giving a strength and rigidity that can withstand considerable wind loads. Because they use less surface area to enclose the same volume as a box-type structure— resulting in less heat escape— domes are very energy efficient. Domes are pre-packaged and manufactured and brought to the building site for assembly. Whether the frame is made of steel, wood or aluminum, with a crew it can be assembled in half a day. Lightweight triangular Structurally Insulated Panels (SIPS) fill the frames and make for rapid construction and savings in labour costs.\nThese homes are built almost entirely in a factory in one or more units or modules that are joined together once delivered to the building site. Access must be available for large transport trucks and the 80’ crane needed to lift the modules onto a prepared foundation, although a helicopter can also be used. Because this construction method uses wood beams with steel posts for support rather than steel frames, the design can include multiple stories and a basement. Each module is completed with insulation, plumbing, wiring and exterior siding plus whatever level of interior finishing you desire. The roof is hinged and unfolded on site for quick weatherproofing, leaving only the “button-up” work of mechanical and electrical tie-ins, drywall and interior paint.\nThis type of house is exactly as it sounds: built completely in one piece at the contractor’s site and moved to your foundation as a fully finished home. The plans may be stock, or customdesigned with all the finishings completed as specified. Once the building is secured onto the foundation, the mechanical, electrical and water services will be installed and connected and stairs put into place. A RTM house is a good option if your area has a shortage of skilled labour and materials. However, road access is critical and cost increases with distance from the builder’s yard.\nThe selection of home-building packages and solutions for rural living is extensive and as varied as one property is from another. It is well worth the time to research them all, to know your land’s attributes and challenges and make an informed decision as to how you will approach the construction process.\nWith forethought and strength of purpose, your rural home can be built on your budget, and within your time frame, to allow for many years of enjoyment!","Modular or Manufactured?\nThe Complete Guide to Modular Housing\nA modular home is built in sections in a factory. The home site is prepared while the sections are being manufactured. Once the site is ready and the modular home sections are complete, pieces are transported to the home site. Centennial Homes then attaches the sections on the crawl space or basement and completes the rest of the work required for the final inspection and certificate of occupancy.\nThe Difference Between Modular and Manufactured\nAlthough a modular home is manufactured, it’s not the same thing as a “manufactured,” or “mobile,” home. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), modular homes are built to the same local, county and state building codes as site-built homes. Manufactured homes, on the other hand, are constructed according to HUD code. HUD requires that a manufactured home be built on a permanent chassis rather than on a foundation.\nModular homes are available in many of the same styles as site-built homes. The most common styles offered by Centennial Homes are the ranch and split foyer. We can can build rather elaborate contemporary styles that are indistinguishable from their site-built counterparts. And as with site-built home plans, modular plans can be customized. Non-load-bearing walls can often be moved or eliminated, and all manner of extras, from a garage to an attic to a deck or porch, can be added.\nFinancing a modular home is the same as financing a site-built new construction. The mortgage loan begins as a construction loan to be disbursed in several “draws” as construction progresses to predetermined milestones. For example, the first draw might be made after the land has been excavated, and the next after the foundation is in. The work must be inspected at each stage. Once it has been determined that the work has been completed properly, the buyer is asked to sign off on the payment so that the next phase of construction may begin. Once all the construction-loan money has been disbursed and the buyer takes possession, the loan converts to a standard mortgage loan.\nBenefits of Modular Homes Over Site-Built\nThe primary benefit of modular construction over site-built is that modular has more stringent quality control. Every component of every home is manufactured in precisely the same way each time, and results of every process are inspected numerous times before the home leaves the factory. In addition, factory construction makes weather a nonissue–because the home is built indoors, there’s no concern about weather-related damage or delays. Finally, modular homes are less expensive than site-built homes because volume discounts on materials and automated processes keep prices down. A National Association of Homebuilders comparison found the average construction cost of a modular to be about 11 percent less than that of a site-built home.\nTime to Build\nThe time it takes to build a modular depends on the size and style, but a general guideline for factory work completion is one to two months. According to the National Association of Home Builders Research Center, modular homes are delivered to the home site 70 to 90 percent complete. It takes just days for a local contractor and finish crew to assemble the home and make it move-in ready.\nWhat are Manufactured Homes?\nBuilt offsite, in a controlled environment, under the federal code commonly known as HUD, manufactured homes are built in single or multiple sections and transported and set up on your building site. They can be set on piers, a crawlspace, or conventional foundation, depending on your needs. HUD Code requires that these homes are built to specific standards of strength, durability, fire resistance, and quality.\nWhat are Modular Homes?\nModular homes are built offsite, in a controlled environment, to the same local, state or regional codes that all conventional site homes are built to and include delivery to the site. They must be set and permanently affixed to a crawl space or basement foundation.."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7e534ea0-a0bb-4244-b351-1d1a9c30446b>","<urn:uuid:6df3a9e0-631d-4f55-8166-7f0642b1ea39>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can workers safely install roof trusses when conventional fall protection systems like guardrails aren't practical? What are some alternative methods?","answer":"There are several methods to safely install roof trusses when conventional fall protection isn't practical: 1) Ground assembly - assembling truss sections on the ground and sheathing them before lifting them with a crane, which greatly reduces fall risks. 2) Using lifts (aerial or scissor) to provide stable elevated platforms for workers. 3) Using properly constructed internal and external scaffolds, such as bracket scaffolds. 4) Using platform and stepladders set up inside the building. Additionally, an engineered spreader can be used to distribute the force of a Personal Fall Arrest System across multiple trusses. Once a complete truss section is fully installed and secured, it can then serve as an attachment point for fall protection while installing additional trusses.","context":["Reducing Falls During Residential Construction: Installing Roof Trusses\nEvery year, residential construction workers experience numerous fatal injuries due to falls. Installing roof trusses presents several challenges for protecting workers from these falls. This fact sheet highlights some of the hazards of truss installation and lists some practical methods that employers can use to protect workers who install trusses.\nRisks During Truss Installation\nAccidental falls are the leading cause of death for construction workers and installing roof trusses can be particularly dangerous for two reasons: (1) truss construction usually occurs high above the ground and (2) trusses are not stable until they are properly restrained and braced.\nRoof trusses are the highest part of a house frame, so residential construction workers installing them can fall and be seriously injured or even killed. Although personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) are the most widely used form of fall protection in residential construction, they might not be suitable when workers begin installing roof truss sections because there may not be a stable place to attach an anchor. Trusses are designed to support weight from the top down. Until trusses are properly restrained and braced, they are weak if pulled from the side (i.e., subjected to lateral force) as can occur when a truss-mounted fall protection system bears the full weight of a falling worker.\nPFAS need strong anchor points that can hold the sudden weight of a falling worker. No anchor with a single connection point, such as a strap anchor or a bolt-on anchor, will protect a falling worker who is attached to a single truss.\nOther systems, such as scaffolds, lifts and ladders can be used to protect workers until a fully interconnected, multi-truss section has been appropriately braced and secured.\nOSHA requires fall protection measures for residential construction activities 6 feet or more above lower levels. As a result, employers must plan ahead to ensure they have the right systems in place, and that all workers are properly trained before the job begins.\nPersonal Fall Arrest System (PFAS)\nA PFAS is designed to safely stop a fall before the worker strikes a lower level. It includes three major components:\n- An anchorage to which the other components of the PFAS are rigged.\n- A full body harness worn by the worker.\n- A connector, such as a lanyard or lifeline, linking the harness to the anchorage. A rip-stitch lanyard, or deceleration device, is typically a part of the system.\nFor more information on the requirements for a PFAS, refer to 29 CFR 1926.502(d).\nRemember that for fall arrest systems, workers must use full-body harnesses. Body belts can cause serious injury during a fall and so OSHA prohibits their use as part of fall arrest systems.\nIf a worker falls while using a single truss as an anchor point, the whole truss assembly can collapse. Such a structural failure puts workers’ lives and entire buildings at risk.\nHow to Reduce Risks\nDuring Initial Truss Installation\nGuardrails, nets, or PFAS (conventional fall protection) may not be practical for all phases of truss installation. Instead, employers should plan to use other methods, such as ground assembly, scaffolds, aerial lifts, or ladders to keep workers safe.\nGround assembly: By assembling a truss section on the ground, employers can greatly reduce the risk of falls for workers. A section of trusses can be sheathed while still on the ground. Peak anchors and lifelines can be pre-installed before the section is lifted into place. Many builders find it efficient to pre-assemble truss sections on the ground and then lift them with a crane so that workers can secure the section to the building frame.\nLifts: Depending on the building layout and the tasks involved, lifts (e.g., aerial, scissor) may be options for setting trusses. Lifts provide a stable, elevated platform from which workers can operate. Workers must follow all safety procedures and conduct all operations from inside the lift basket. For other requirements for using lifts, refer to 29 CFR 1926.453, Aerial Lifts.\nScaffolds: When properly constructed and used, internal and external scaffolds can provide suitable protection for truss-setting tasks. For example, bracket scaffolds placed on the inside or outside of a building provide large, stable walking and working areas for workers. To ensure safe use and appropriate load limits for bracket scaffold systems, workers should always follow the manufacturer’s instructions or consult a qualified person. For other requirements for scaffolds, refer to 29 CFR 1926 Subpart L, Scaffolds.\nLadders: For certain truss-setting jobs, platform and stepladders can provide a stable work platform for workers. They can be particularly helpful when set up inside a building. Workers should always use a ladder safely by following the requirements spelled out in 29 CFR 1926 Subpart X, Stairways and Ladders.\nSpreader: An engineered spreader, when installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, distributes the force of a PFAS across multiple trusses. The roof trusses do not need to be sheathed to use a spreader. These engineered anchorage devices are reusable and can be uninstalled and reinstalled quickly. A qualified person should decide if the spreader is suitable for use as an anchor.\nAfter a Complete Truss Section Is Fully Installed\nOnce the assembled truss section has been set and secured, it can be used as an attachment point for an anchorage device. From this point on, PFAS can be used to protect workers while they install additional trusses and roof sheathing.\nMultiple (typically four) individual trusses that are interconnected and fully sheathed. A truss section that has been restrained, braced and sheathed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions can provide a suitable structure to establish an anchor point.\nAnchors: Fixed anchors provide a secure point where workers can tie off their lifelines as part of a PFAS. Anchors for a PFAS must meet the 5,000- pound strength requirement or maintain a safety factor of at least two under the supervision of a qualified person – 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15). See 29 CFR 1926 Subpart M, Fall Protection for more information and additional requirements.\nDifferent types of anchors for these systems include, but are not limited to:\n- Peak anchors\n- Strap anchors\n- Bolt-on anchors\nOnce a group of trusses has been properly restrained and braced, a roof peak anchor can provide a usable tie-off point for a lifeline. Multiple peak anchors and lifelines can protect several workers. After confirmation from the manufacturer, some peak anchors may be strong enough to serve as tie-off points for two lifelines. Peak anchors can also be useful for fall protection during later roofing tasks or while setting another truss section.\nWritten Fall Protection Plans\nIf the employer does not use ladders, scaffolds, or aerial lifts, and can demonstrate that it is not feasible or would create a greater hazard to use conventional fall protection equipment (guardrails, safety nets, or PFAS) when working at heights of 6 feet or greater, the employer must develop a written site-specific fall protection plan in accord with 29 CFR 1926.502(k). The plan must be prepared by a qualified person as defined by 29 CFR 1926.32(m). This person could be the owner, the supervisor, or a worker who has extensive knowledge, training and experience with fall protection and is able to solve problems relating to fall protection. States with OSHA-approved State Plans may have additional requirements for written fall protection plans.\nThe site-specific fall protection plan must document at each location why the use of conventional fall protection equipment is not feasible or will create a greater hazard. The plan must also describe the alternative methods that the employer will use so that workers are protected from falls. Workers and their supervisors must be trained on the proper use of those other fall protection methods.\nConventional fall protection equipment can reduce or eliminate the chances of a fatal fall. Written sitespecific fall protection plans ensure that protection continues, even when conventional fall protection methods are determined to not be feasible.\n29 CFR 1926 Subpart M – Fall Protection\nAvailable online at www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10922.\nOSHA Residential Fall Protection Web Page: www.osha.gov/doc/topics/residentialprotection/index.html.\nOSHA Compliance Guidance:\nCompliance Guidance for Residential Construction – STD 03-11-002 (dated 12/16/2010)\nAvailable online at www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&p_id=4755.\nState Plan Guidance: Twenty-seven states or territories currently operate their own OSHAapproved state plans. State plan workplace health and safety standards must be at least as effective as comparable Federal OSHA standards.

{"question":"How does the chemical industry's accident rate compare to the construction industry based on 2014 German data?","answer":"Based on data from German trade associations for 2014, the chemical industry had 11.71 occupational accidents per million working hours, making it three times safer than the construction industry which had 35.81 occupational accidents.","context":["The figures are alarming: Throughout the world, more than 313 million people suffer an accident at work every year. 2.3 million of these people are killed. These figures were announced by the International Labor Organization, ILO. To enable LANXESS employees to work safely the specialist chemical group has introduced the global safety program Xact.\n“Get home safely”\nMany industrial accidents can be avoided by taking care and paying attention. This is not always the case, however. In Germany alone, there were about 870,000 notifiable work-related accidents in industry and the public sector in 2014. This includes more than 174,000 commuting accidents, i.e. accidents while traveling to or from work. 322 people suffered fatal commuting accidents and 483 were killed in accidents at work. These figures were published by German Statutory Accident Insurance.\nIn comparison with the frequency of occupational accidents in various industries, it is noticeable that the chemical industry is safer than many other industries. This is shown by data from German trade associations for 2014. With 11.71 occupational accidents per million working hours, the chemical industry is, for example, three times safer than the construction industry, with 35.81 occupational accidents.\nIn order to improve occupational safety at LANXESS, the group initiated the Xact safety program in 2011 and gradually introduced it at all of its locations worldwide. Over the course of this program, companies were carefully examined and possible safety risks were analyzed. The program aims to improve safety at work, safety of processes and safety at the plant, as well as to protect health and the environment. “Our employees and our partners’ employees should get home as healthy as they were when they came into work. Meeting this goal is one of the central tasks of our global occupational safety program, Xact,” explains Xact Manager Christoph Mannheims.\nXact rules for safe conduct\n“Making a company safer is a large and complex task. Employees themselves are the most important part of this,” explains Mannheims. Six “Golden Rules” help to make safety more easily understandable for everyone. These Golden Rules make up the main principles for safe work at LANXESS and address the decisive points whereby each employee – whether in the plant or in the office – can make an active contribution to their own safety and that of their colleagues, regardless of their job or place in the hierarchy.\n- I always take time for safety.\n- I pay attention to my safety and that of my colleagues.\n- I refuse jobs that I cannot carry out safely.\n- I openly say when situations are unsafe.\n- I take action when I see a breach of safety regulations.\n- I do not give instructions for unsafe actions.\nThe safety rules create a common understanding of the group’s safety culture. This is based on employees changing their own own conduct and taking action for safety – for themselves and for their colleagues. Because of this, it is important to speak about dangerous situations and unsafe behavior.\nUnsafe situations and actions are often the cause of accidents. “We ask all superiors and employees to consider where unsafe situations could occur within the scope of their responsibility and how they can counteract them with their expertise,” says Christoph Mannheims.\nThe modules: Safety dialog, risk assessment and incident analysis\nRegular discussions within the company are the key to improving safety at the local level. The so-called safety dialog aims to promote an open and constructive discussion of safety. This is carried out at all levels of management on an equal basis and, ideally, also among colleagues. Documentation of the discussions helps to identify and eliminate weak points.\nA further module of the safety program is the risk assessment. The performance of tasks such as, for example, taking samples or connecting a tank, is analyzed and assessed with regard to possible hazards. After this, countermeasures are specified. Before employees start on a task they must be familiar with the risk assessment.\nIf an accident occurs in spite of this, the incident is investigated. In the incident analysis a team of employees and experts analyzes the incident and the possible causes. Special attention is paid to technical, organizational and personal conduct. Once the cause has been established, measures are specified to prevent the accident from happening again.\nGood tools are ineffective without training and instruction in their use. Because of this, LANXESS also provides training material for the Xact modules and assists departments in its implementation and training of employees.\nRisk: Climbing stairs and safe walking\nMost people imagine exploding tanks and blazing fires when they think of accidents in the chemical industry. Yet accidents involving chemicals are far less common than, for example, accidents involving tripping, slipping and falling – which, in fact, account for the majority of reported accidents at LANXESS globally.\nFalling down stairs is particularly dangerous. Hardly anybody realizes that every year in Germany, for example, almost twice as many people die in such accidents as in motorbike accidents – only road accidents account for more deaths. 80% of falls down stairs occur while descending, mostly on the bottom two or three steps – this is why it is important to always use the handrail when taking the stairs.\nTo raise employee awareness of these hazards, LANXESS has held a walking circuit at its locations on the Lower Rhine.

{"question":"How do lunar soil and solar trackers compare in terms of providing protection and maintenance needs?","answer":"Lunar soil (regolith) provides excellent protection when piled over modules on the Moon, shielding against cosmic rays and micrometeoroids while also providing insulation to reduce temperature swings in a vacuum. In contrast, solar trackers, while useful for power generation, actually create additional maintenance requirements due to their moving parts, which are more prone to malfunction and lead to increased maintenance expenditures.","context":["These images are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License.\nSpace Shuttle External Tank – Currently, the Shuttle’s ET achieves 99% of the energy needed to reach orbit.

Types of Solar Trackers and the Growth of the Solar Tracker Industry\nYou can increase your solar panel’s output by using solar trackers, which allow them to follow the sun’s movement in the sky, exactly like a sunflower does. However, solar tracking systems are rather expensive.\nIs the increased expense of a solar tracker worth the additional solar power output that it provides? For the most part, it’s better to just add more solar panels.\nWhat exactly is a solar tracker, and how does it work?\nThe output of solar panels and solar receivers can be increased with the aid of solar trackers. Tracking the movement of the sun as it moves from east to west every day, a Solar Tracker is a device that does just that. Solar Trackers are devices that follow the sun’s path across the sky, ensuring that solar collectors and solar panels are always pointed directly at the sun. The quantity of solar energy captured by the solar collector and converted into heat or power is increased when Solar Trackers are used. Solar Trackers can enhance the economics of a solar panel installation by 20% to 30% by increasing the production of solar panels.\nSingle-axis solar trackers and Dual-axis solar trackers are the two most common types of solar trackers available on the market.\nSingle-axis solar trackers: Single-axis solar trackers follow the sun from east to west, rotating around a single point, and moving in unison, by panel row, or by section, depending on the configuration.\nDual-axis solar trackers: As the sun moves from east to west, this tracker not only measures its progress, but it also tracks its progress as it goes from north to south. Due to the fact that Dual axis trackers are more popular among residential and small commercial solar projects with limited space, they are able to produce enough power to meet their energy requirements.\nIndustrial Growth Of Solar Tracker\nFrom 2021 to 2027, the Solar Tracker Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 5.3%. By 2027, global exports are predicted to reach 48 GW. The market data for solar tracker devices will grow as more money is invested in renewable energy technologies and as electricity demand rises.\nAccording to the worldwide solar tracker market research report, the top players are Array Technologies Inc., Abengoa Solar, Trina Solar, SOLTEC, Titan Trackers, ArcTech Solar, and NEXTracker.\nUsing a solar tracker has its advantages and disadvantages.\nThe advantages of solar trackers are as follows:\n- In comparison to stationary solar arrays, tracking systems produce higher amounts of energy output since they are able to track the sun’s movement.\n- Due to the wide range of trackers available from manufacturers such as Allearth Solar and First Sunergy, it is possible to choose a device that is ideal for your specific requirements.\n- The use of solar trackers is especially advantageous in locations where power costs are based on time of use.\nYou won’t have to pay for grid electricity when it’s most expensive because you’ll be able to produce more during peak hours, saving you money.\nSolar trackers have some disadvantages.\n- A solar tracker is an extremely expensive addition to a project that can potentially treble its cost.\n- Because solar trackers are composed of moving parts, they are more prone to malfunctioning. Increased maintenance expenditures are a result of this.\n- If you decide to install trackers, you may need to do more site planning and preparation, which may include constructing more wiring trenches and grading the ground more extensively."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ca40f0ab-ecad-4b3d-8d82-ca0453c8d29d>","<urn:uuid:3b56bdc2-d29b-469a-9ac6-4b693454ce70>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the key strategies for water shortage management between the SWCD's Drought Contingency Plan and the proposed Western Slope water bank system?","answer":"The Drought Contingency Plan has three main strategies: 1) drought reoperations of initial CRSP reservoirs, 2) supply augmentation through cloud seeding and invasive phreatophyte removal, and 3) exploration of voluntary, temporary, compensated programs to reduce consumptive use. In contrast, the Western Slope water bank system focuses on pooling pre-1922 senior water rights as an insurance policy against downstream demands. This water bank would allow towns and water providers to lease senior water rights during dry periods, potentially creating a 100,000 acre-foot portfolio that could be used to provide water for Western Slope municipalities even during downstream calls on Colorado's water allotment.","context":["The Southwestern Water Conservation District (SWCD) was formed to represent southwestern Colorado in water management and planning matters. Since 1941, SWCD has advocated for the protection, use, and development of Colorado’s interstate compact entitlements in the San Juan and Dolores River basins. SWCD plays an active role in negotiations among Colorado River water users within the state, serving in an advisory role to the State of Colorado on the Upper Colorado River Commission and regularly engaging with state and federal agencies and on interstate Colorado River management.\nThe Colorado Water Conservation Board is currently leading an investigation to evaluate the feasibility of a demand management program for Colorado.\nThe SWCD Board has adopted guiding principles addressing demand management. Click on the link below to download the latest guidelines:\nThe SWCD Board emphasizes that this is a living document that may be revised based on constituent input, developments in the demand management feasibility investigation, or other reasons.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Secretary of Interior directed the seven Colorado River basin states to adopt a drought contingency plan (“DCP”). The DCP serves as an interim agreement until the 2007 Colorado River Interim Shortage Guidelines are renegotiated prior to their expiration in 2026.\nThe goal of the Upper Basin DCP is twofold: avoid compact violations or possible curtailment, and keep Lake Powell above target elevation 3,525’ to maintain power generation and crucial revenues for Colorado project operations and compliance programs. The three main strategies for implementation of the Upper Basin DCP as drafted are 1) drought reoperations of the initial CRSP reservoirs, 2) supply augmentation via cloud seeding and invasive phreatophyte removal, and 3) exploration of a voluntary, temporary, compensated program to reduce consumptive use, a.k.a. demand management.\nSWCD is supportive of Colorado’s participation in the Upper Colorado River drought contingency plan, and assert that any exploration of a program to reduce consumptive use in Colorado must have parameters that ensure the viability of Western Slope communities.

The goal of the study is to inform local stakeholders as planning efforts move forward in the Colorado River basin.\nIn Phase I, it was determined that there is significant risk of Lake Powell reaching critical elevation 3,525 feet, which can be reduced (not eliminated) by Lower Basin states implementing their drought contingency plan and CRSPA reservoir reoperations. Phase I and II further explored the additional risk reduction by reducing consumptive use voluntarily. It was clear that reducing consumptive use had to be significant in order to bend the risk curve, and such reductions may need to be weighed against their costs. Phase III delved deeper into what curtailment may look like on the Western Slope, using specific basin data and various administrative scenarios, with the goal of preparing stakeholders to discuss objectively these possible futures and plan accordingly.\nExecutive Summary: Risk Study Phases I & II\nPresentation: Risk Study Phases I & II\nFinal Report: Risk Study Phase I\nFinal Report: Risk Study Phase II, Task 1\nFinal Report: Risk Study Phase II, Task 2\nFinal Report: Risk Study Phase III\nColorado River Water Bank Work Group\nThe Water Bank Work Group (WBWG) was conceived by the Southwestern Water Conservation District and the Colorado River District. Other participants are the state, the Front Range Water Council and The Nature Conservancy. The intent of the WBWG is to explore conservation efforts to prevent buy-and-dry of senior West Slope agricultural water rights by East Slope water providers, most of whom hold post-compact water rights.\nA study evolved into sponsoring a pilot project program with irrigators being paid to demonstrate how reductions in consumptive use could be made. Another avenue being explored is how water banking could be structured to result in an overall net benefit rather than merely minimize impacts. To that end, the Grand Valley Water Users Association is initiating a pilot fallowing project involving 1,000 acres. What role a water bank could serve as part of a larger demand management plan to reduce and manage potential future shortages is an element to be examined in the next phase of the study.\nIn September 2020, the WBWG released the following study that evaluates the secondary economic impacts of demand management program in Western Colorado:\nFor more information, please visit the River District’s website.","Glenwood Springs-based water district has new idea to avoid shortages\nSummit County Correspondent\nGlenwood Springs, CO Colorado\nGLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colorado ” Colorado water users could avoid drought shortages by pooling resources to buy or lease senior water rights and hold them in a new Western Slope “water bank,” according to officials with the Colorado River Water Conservation District.\nThose collective water rights, established prior to a 1922 interstate agreement, would be an insurance policy against downstream demand from California, Arizona and Nevada, said Jim Pokrandt, education specialist with the river district, headquartered in Glenwood Springs.\n“It would be an aggregation of pre-1922 water rights that could be used in case of a compact call,” Pokrandt said, explaining the potential for downstream states to “call” on their water rights at the expense of Colorado’s water users.\nUnder the 1922 interstate contract, Colorado is obligated to deliver an average of 7.5 million acre feet of Colorado river water downstream annually.\nIn a worst-case scenario, Colorado water users could be forced to cut some of their existing uses if the downstream states demand their full allotment.\nWater rights established before the compact was signed are not subject to the agreement.\nStored in a water bank, those senior rights could be used to provide water for Western Slope municipalities ” even if the downstream demands cut into Colorado’s allotment of water, said Boulder water attorney Glenn Porzak.\nMost of the water rights that are available for such a bank are held by ranchers and farmers.\nA significant amount of water would have to be amassed to make a dent, Porzak said, speculating that it might be possible to put together a 100,000 acre-foot portfolio.\nRather than buying the water outright, towns and other water providers and users could agree to leases that would kick in during dry periods, when the potential for a compact call looms greatest.\nThat would fit with the river district’s vision for a water bank, which is intended to be a buffer against shortages in a crisis situation, according to a recent edition of the district’s newsletter.\n“If we know we’re getting close (to a shortage) we could use that pool to put water in the river,” Pokrandt said.\nBanking senior water rights is not a new idea in and of itself.\nPorzak said there already are water users in Eagle and Summit counties who are buying up pre-1922 water rights to hedge against future shortages.\nBut the river district’s vision is for a collective arrangement that would provide some security across the Western Slope.\n“Their idea would go one step farther. It’s a great idea, but the devil is in the details,” Porzak said.\nAmassing those precompact rights could trigger competition by Front Range utilities like Denver Water and the Northern Water Conservancy District, as they go after the same senior rights, he explained.\nA downstream call on water allocated by the compact would likely spur Front Range water users to go after Western Slope water, regardless of seniority.\nGiven political realities, it’s unlikely that water use on the Front Range would be cut in a drought, even if those municipal rights are junior to West Slope agricultural uses.\nA water bank could help the river district and the West Slope “protect its flank” in a drought situation, Porzak concluded.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Glenwood Springs and Garfield County make the Post Independent’s work possible.

{"question":"How to identify authentic Tex-Mex dishes vs traditional Mexican food?","answer":"Tex-Mex can be identified by its heavy use of shredded cheese and flour tortillas. Common Tex-Mex items include fajitas, Texas-style chili con carne, crispy tacos, melted queso used as a dip, and enchiladas covered in sauce and yellow cheese. There are also regional Tex-Mex specialties like puffy tacos from San Antonio and breakfast tacos from Austin. In contrast, traditional Mexican dishes vary by region and include items like mole, chilaquiles, pozole, and cochinita pibil, which typically don't feature the heavy use of yellow cheese characteristic of Tex-Mex.","context":["The Complete Guide to Mexican Food in America\nMexican food in the United States is quite a departure from what you’re likely to find in various parts of Mexico. Regional influences have led to a number of dishes you’ll find in America, but not in Mexico. And, with some of Mexico’s best chefs opening new restaurants in the United States, there’s definitely no shortage of remarkable Mexican eats stateside.\nRegional Differences in America\nIn Mexico, there are seven main regions that comprise Mexican gastronomy. In the United States, you'll find most of these regional dishes plus a few extra.\nHead to the Lone Star State for some Tex-Mex, characterized by its heavy use of shredded cheese and flour tortillas. Fajitas, Texas-style chili con carne and crispy tacos are common Tex-Mex items. Melted queso eaten as a dip and enchiladas drenched in sauce and yellow cheese are also signature Tex-Mex items. Even within Tex-Mex, there are regional specialties, like puffy tacos from San Antonio and breakfast tacos from Austin.\nBaja, California put its own stamp on Mexican cuisine with the fish taco that has become a staple throughout this west coast state. And, if you didn’t already know, the Caesar salad originated in Baja as well — Tijuana to be exact. Head further north and you’ll find the Mission-style burrito that was created in San Francisco. In Los Angeles, you’ll find practically every region of Mexico represented, thanks to the city’s cultural diversity—everything from pre-Hispanic southern dishes, to Chilango, a term that represents street food from Mexico City and more. And when in neighboring Arizona, try Mexican sushi, which fuses American-style sushi with Mexican ingredients from Sonora.\nYou’ll also find no shortage of more traditional Mexican dishes in America. Many Jalisco, Puebla and Oaxaca specialties can be found in countless restaurants and food stands across the country. Depending on where you are, you can even find Yucatecan cuisine, which is markedly different from the rest of Mexico and characterized by some serious spice from the habanero peppers used in many dishes.\nTraditional Dishes to Try\nWhile Americanized Mexican dishes are an important part of our culinary landscape, the popularity of traditional Mexican cuisine is also on the rise. Here are some dishes to be on the lookout for when you’re craving some more traditional eats:\n· Mole: Mole is a sauce that comes from different regions, but Oaxaca and Puebla are probably the most famous. Ingredients vary but rely on a large selection of spices to create this beloved velvety sauce.\n· Chilaquiles: Believed to date back to Aztec times, chilaquiles are almost like breakfast nachos, but better. Chilaquiles consist of crunchy tortilla pieces drenched in a chili salsa and then topped with a variety of different ingredients like onions, eggs, queso fresco and crema.\n· Torta: A torta is basically a Mexican sandwich. You’ll see different names depending on where you are, and ingredients vary by region. They can be eaten cold or hot and are delicious day or night.\n· Carnitas: Carnitas originated in Michoacán and are usually made with pork and red or green salsa. They can be eaten as a main dish or added to tacos, burritos, etc.\n· Huevos Rancheros: This breakfast dish has fried eggs on top of crispy corn or flour tortillas, salsa fresca, beans and/or rice.\n· Tamales: Tamales vary by region, but you’ll primarily see ones made with masa, filled with meat, wrapped in corn husks and then steamed.\n· Pozole: This soup or stew includes ingredients like hominy and pork and is garnished with radishes, cabbage or lettuce, onion, oregano and limes. There are different colors of pozole — red, white and green to represent the Mexican flag. One of the most common styles is red from Jalisco.\n· Cochinita Pibil: One of the most well-known dishes from the Yucatan, pibil, refers to the cooking method where foods are wrapped and cooked underground. Cochinita pibil is eaten as a main course or can be added to tacos. In the Yucatan, you’ll also find it on salbutes, sopes and panuchos.\n· Al Pastor Tacos: Tacos al pastor is one of the most beloved Mexican eats, but they are actually a fusion of Middle Eastern shawarma and guajillo-rubbed pork from Mexico City. The best al pastor tacos are soft corn tortillas filled with pastor meat, chopped onion and cilantro and a piece of pineapple on top.\nHigh-End Mexican Cuisine\nThere are numerous chefs that have taken Mexican cuisine to new heights in America. One of these is Enrique Olvera, who has the highest-rated restaurant in Mexico on Latin America’s 50 Best. He already has several restaurants stateside, with two new projects expected to open later this year in Los Angeles. His creativity and use of obscure, locally-sourced ingredients showcase the versatility of Mexican cuisine, proving there’s even a place for it in the fine-dining scene.\nEnjoy this article?

{"question":"How does post-surgery physical therapy differ between hip arthroscopy and total knee replacement?","answer":"For hip arthroscopy, physical therapy is prescribed when the hip begins healing, with patients following a rehabilitation program both at the therapist's office and at home to achieve optimal range of motion and functional outcome. For total knee replacement, outpatient physical therapy is typically required for up to three months post-surgery, with a skilled therapist using dedicated machines and therapeutic modalities to accelerate rehabilitation. The duration of therapy depends on the patient's pre-surgery condition, motivation, and general health.","context":["Contributing physicians in this story\nHip arthroscopy has gained in popularity over the past 20 years due to the minimally invasive nature of the surgery and the ability to address different types of disease or injury. Surgeons primarily use arthroscopic surgery (tiny camera and instruments inserted into the joint) to remove loose bodies, which are small pieces of cartilage (tissue that covers the ends of bones) that have broken off and then move around inside the hip joint. Surgeons also use this surgery to treat labral tears, injuries to the cartilage of both the femoral head (ball) and acetabulum (socket), and femoroacetabular impingement (Fig.1).\nThe hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint that connects the femur to the pelvis (Fig. 2). There are different elements in and around the hip joint that can be a source of pain, such as damaged cartilage and ligament (tissue connecting 2 bones) tears. When the physician evaluates a patient, it is critical to determine whether symptoms are intra-articular (coming from within the joint itself), or extra-articular (around the joint). For conditions that arise within the joint, hip arthroscopy can be a possible solution to address these problems.\nDiagnosing hip pain\nYour physician will complete a thorough physical exam, record your health history, and order x-rays to determine the cause of your hip pain. X-rays are a good tool for evaluating the bony structures around the hip joint. Most patients with suspected intra-articular disease who do not have obvious arthritis on x-rays will also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A MRI is especially useful to evaluate the soft tissue structures around the hip, such as the cartilage, labrum, and tendons, which may be injured.\nIf you have no mechanical symptoms, such as catching, popping, or a clicking sensation in your hip, your physician often begins with nonsurgical treatment. Nonoperative treatments can include resting the joint if you are involved in regular exercise or athletic activity, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and steroid injections. If these treatments fail to alleviate your pain and you continue to have difficulty either walking or standing, your physician may recommend hip arthroscopy.\nYour physician will discuss arthroscopic surgery with you if nonsurgical treatments have failed and your symptoms disrupt your normal day-to-day activities. Surgeons perform hip arthroscopy under general anesthesia and routinely use a special table to allow distraction (a gentle separation) of the ball from the socket to access to the intra-articular structures. Two common hip injuries treated arthroscopically are femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears (Fig. 3).\nFemoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a disorder of the hip in which the femoral head and neck rubs or “impinges” on the acetabulum. There are 2 types of FAI: cam impingement refers to a femoral-based disorder and is often seen in young athletic males and pincer impingement refers to an acetabular or socket-based disorder usually seen in active, middle-aged women. For both of these impingements, pain results from the proximal, or top of the femur abutting the acetabulum during range of motion, especially while bending. Patients often present with symptoms that include activity-related groin pain, difficulty sitting, and mechanical symptoms that includes a catching, clicking, or popping sensation during movement. If your physician suspects FAI, he or she will order x-rays to determine the shape and contour of the femoral head and neck as well as look for any abnormalities of the acetabulum. Your physician will also order a MRI to evaluate further the soft tissue structures in and around the hip.\nAt the time of arthroscopic surgery, the surgeon introduces the arthroscope into the hip joint to perform an initial diagnostic examination. Once inside the joint, the surgeon will look for disease or damage, such as cartilage defects of the femoral head and socket, loose bodies, and tears of the labrum.\nThe labrum is a horseshoe shaped structure that lines the outer rim of the hip socket. It is made of fibrocartilage and dense connective tissue. Sometimes when femoroacetabular impingement occurs, the labrum is torn. This tear can lead to pain during movement and you may experience catching, snapping, or locking. You may also feel a vague pain in your groin. If your doctor suspects a labral tear, as with FAI, you will undergo a MRI of the hip for further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis.\nThere are 2 main treatments of labral tears in regards to hip arthroscopy, labral debridement and labral repair. Labral tears not amenable to fixation are usually debrided, or trimmed back, to a stable base to the point that the unstable piece of torn labrum no longer causes symptoms. Your surgeon will remove any inflamed tissue in the hip joint and address any other underlying problems during surgery as well. This usually involves shaving some bone off the femoral head-neck junction as well as the hip socket so the bones do not rub against one another.\nA labral repair often involves attaching the labrum back to its original site with the use of specialized anchors and sutures. Postoperatively, patients use crutches to aid in walking and are restricted to limited weightbearing and limited hip bending for approximately 4 to 6 weeks while the labrum heals.\nHip arthroscopy for either FAI or labral tears is not without complications, although the complication rate is low. Complications reported with hip arthroscopy occur at a rate between 1.3% and 6.4%. Most complications are minor and are often self-limiting, but there are several major complications that have been described in hip arthroscopy that the patient should be aware of. These include traction neurapraxia, where there is a temporary loss of motor and sensory function of nerves surrounding the hip. This occurs when traction is placed on the operative leg to help distract the hip joint in order to gain access for the arthroscope. This often resolves soon after surgery and most patients have a complete recovery. Damage to major nerves and blood vessel structures around the hip joint can also occur. Additionally, damage from instrumentation can happen; but with proper positioning and technique, the incidence of this complication is low.\nOn the mend\nAfter surgery, you will be given instructions to follow for the weeks and months following surgery, including returning to see your physician for follow-up to see how you are progressing. Some of these instructions will include how to care for your portal sites and when you can shower or submerge the incisions in water. Additionally, you will be give crutches to use. Depending on the extent and type of repair, you may be on crutches for days, weeks, or months. When the hip has begun healing and the time is appropriate, your physician will refer you to rehabilitation. You should follow your rehabilitation program as instructed at the physical therapist’s office and at home. Physical therapy is a part of your treatment; therefore, you should adhere to the rehabilitation regime to achieve your best possible range of motion and functional outcome.\nHip arthroscopy can be an effective procedure and the risk of complications is low, although they do occur. Most patients are pleased with their outcomes and have resolution of symptoms, which allows them to get back to a more active lifestyle.\nAuthor: Garland J. Gudger, Jr., MD | Columbus, Georgia\nLast edited on October 18, 2021","Should I Have a Total Knee Replacement? Answers from a Vail Orthopedic surgeon\nQ&A: The Total Knee Replacement Procedure, Recovery, and Physical Therapy\nWhen considering performing a Total Knee Arthoplasty (TKA), our first priority is to attempt to minimize the arthritis of the knee via non-operative treatments or lifestyle adjustments. This will certainly entail some type of lifestyle change, at least in the short term. We take into consideration the following methods:\n- Introducing an appropriate exercise regimine\n- Injections or medication\n- Weight loss strategies\nOf course, if you are considering a TKA, chances are that you are having advanced arthritis of the joint, and possibly experiencing uncomfortable levels of pain. An x-ray will tell us what we are dealing with.\nWHAT SHOULD YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE HAVING A TKA?\nA TKA is a major decision, so the choice to have your knee replaced should be discussed at length with your surgeon. Measuring your levels of pain and activity scores, we can make an informed decision about whether it's realistic to lead the lifestyle you want to live and continue to participate in your chosen activities.\nAs I've mentioned before, we're now focusing on \"Activity Preservation\" as one of our primary tools to evaluate treatment. This includes total knee replacements. If non-operative treatments have failed when it comes to allowing you to live your preferred lifestyle when it comes to activities, then it's time to consider a TKA.\nHOW LONG DOES A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT LAST?\nGood news here, a total knee replacement can last fifteen to twenty years. Annual failure rates point to a percentage between .5% and 1% for hip and knee replacements.\nWILL I BE SLOWED DOWN AFTER MY TKR?\nInitially, yes. However, you should be able to do most activities after your recovery, although running and jumping may be restricted. There are some restrictions to your activities for several weeks post-surgery, and your surgeon will discuss those with you before and after your knee replacement.\nPOSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS OF A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT\nAs with any major surgical procedure, there are the chances of complications. These include the following:\n- Increased joint stiffness.\n- A loss of motion in the joint.\n- An infection requiring antibiotics and the possibility of additional surgery to eliminate the infection completely\n- Failure of implants due to long term wear and tear\n- Life-threatening complications\nHOW LONG WITH MY HOSPITAL STAY BE?\nThe answer to this question is going to be influenced by your age, health, and medical situation pre-surgery. Usually, we see people staying in the hospital from one to three days, depending on circumstances.\nWHEN CAN I WALK AFTER MY KNEE REPLACEMENT?\nWe know you're probably excited to go back to your regular life, so we try to get you walking as soon as possible. With the assistance of a walker, most people are mobile right after surgery, and walking with a cane or unassisted by three weeks out.\nIS A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT PAINFUL?\nThe level of pain people experience after this procedure is really going to vary. We have some very talented people who are devoted to helping you develop your range of motion quickly post-surgery. These devoted therapists are also well-schooled in protocols to lessen stiffness and pain dramatically. It all comes down to your body, but we certainly have plenty of people who merely experience mild pain after the procedure.\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO RECOVER?\nIt can take up to three months for you to return to most activities. For a total recovery, we expect six months to one year to achieve maximum strength and endurance following a TKR. This depends on your condition before surgery, additional medical problems, and your expectations.\nWILL I NEED PHYSICAL THERAPY? FOR HOW LONG?\nMost people who have undergone TKR require outpatient physical therapy following surgery. A skilled therapist can accelerate the rehabilitation as well as make the process more efficient with the use of dedicated machines and therapeutic modalities. Depending on your condition before surgery, physical therapy is beneficial for up to three months. The amount of therapy needed depends upon your condition before surgery, motivation, and general health.\nWHEN CAN I GET BACK TO WORK AFTER A TKR?\nYou should definitely plan for an extended break after you TKR. If your job is a \"sitting\" job such as spending lots of time at the computer, we are looking at six to eight weeks before you return to work. For you folks who have jobs with a high level of physical requirements, it could be up to three months before you are fully back in the saddle.\nSHOULD I CONTINUE TO SEE MY SURGEON AFTER I’M HEALED FROM MY KNEE REPLACEMENT?\nYou definitely want to stay in close contact with your orthopedic surgeon after your procedure. We want to make sure to monitor your joint replacement as you continue to pursue a lifestyle that is enjoyable and pain-free.\nAs you've heard before, every case is different, and your physician will carefully consider a program to monitor your joint. It is reasonable to expect to see your surgeon every three to five years.\nHope that helps!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0df33e08-4a9c-4765-b63e-49cee223d707>","<urn:uuid:48a68c42-585b-447b-a284-e2282156bd16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"In which specific regions of the adult mammalian brain does neurogenesis continue to take place?","answer":"In mammals, adult neurogenesis has been shown to occur in three primary places of the brain: the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, subventricular zone (SVZ), and the olfactory bulb.","context":["Neurogenesis is the process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells. Through precise genetic mechanisms of cell fate determination, many different varieties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are generated from different kinds of neural stem cells.\nNeurogenesis occurs during embryogenesis in all animals and is responsible for producing all the neurons of the organism. Prior to the period of neurogenesis, neural stem cells first multiply until the correct number of progenitor cells is achieved. For example, the primary neural stem cell of the mammalian brain, called a radial glial cell, resides in an embryonic zone called the ventricular zone, which lies adjacent to the developing brain ventricles. The process of neurogenesis then involves a final cell division of the parent neural stem cell, which produces daughter neurons that will never divide again. The molecular and genetic factors influencing neurogenesis notably include the Notch pathway, and many genes have been linked to Notch pathway regulation. All neurons are thus 'post-mitotic', and most neurons of the human central nervous system live the lifetime of the individual. In mammals, adult neurogenesis has been shown to occur in three primary places of the brain: the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, subventricular zone (SVZ), and the olfactory bulb.

{"question":"What are the durability characteristics of solid surface countertops regarding daily wear, and how does this compare to quartz's resistance to damage?","answer":"Solid surface countertops demonstrate excellent durability in daily use, being extremely resistant to staining and etching from common kitchen spills without requiring periodic sealing. They can withstand cutting and dicing, with any resulting marks being easily repairable through fine-grit sanding. On the other hand, quartz countertops rank 7 on the Mohs hardness scale (out of 10), making them extremely resistant to chips, scratches, and cracks. Quartz's non-porous nature also makes it highly stain-resistant. Manufacturers are so confident in quartz's durability that they typically offer warranties ranging from 10 to 25 years. Both materials offer superior durability compared to traditional options, though they achieve this through different material properties.","context":["In 1967, DuPont Chemical Corporation developed the rigid polymer (plastic) composite known as Corian®. In the late 1970s, DuPont introduced this product as an upscale countertop material as an alternate to the widely popular laminate surface normally found on countertops. Since its introduction into the marketplace, Corian® has been joined by several other manufacturers’ products in establishing the formidable solid surface countertop alternative. These solid surface materials are characterized by their clean, monolithic appearance, inherent resistance to staining and etching, as well as their ability to be ‘easily’ repaired should unfortunate accidents occur to the extremely durable surface of the material. They are manufactured in sheet format and are typically available in thicknesses of 1/4”, 1/2”, and 3/4” stock, enabling these products to be used in both horizontal (countertop) and vertical (backsplash) kitchen applications. Inasmuch as they are a thru-solid surface, the exposed edges may be ‘turned’ or cut to project a customized ornate edging.\nBenefits of Solid Surface vs. Other countertop materials\nThe benefits of solid surface countertops certainly outweigh the drawbacks associated with this option. Solid surface materials are, by natural form and design, extremely resistant to staining and etching discoloration caused by errant spills of things normally found in kitchens; and this is accomplished without periodic sealing or dressings applied to the surface. Stone countertops must be sealed, tile grout must be sealed, in order to create resilience to such agents; laminate can be stained permanently and has no preventative solution. Cutting and dicing foods on countertops is a doable practice for those with solid surface; and should ‘cut marks’ appear, these are simply sanded invisible again with fine grit sandpaper. Stone counters will dull knives and laminates will be permanently damaged by knives. Solid surface countertops are also extremely forgiving when it comes to using common household cleaners or sanitizing chemicals like bleach. Solid surface materials are not affected by these agents, but these same chemicals can wreak havoc on the luster and integrity of the sealers on stone or the factory finish of laminate materials.\nSolid surface materials possess advantages with regards to aesthetics and customization of a kitchen countertop versus their counterparts. As stated before, solid surface counters are slick, monolithic surfaces that appear seamless. Stone surfaces may boast this same feature, but that is largely dependent upon the skills of the installer; and with laminate, every seam will be visible. Solid surface materials may be thermoformed, which means that a fabricator may subject the slab to an even level of heat (300 degrees F) in order to mold, contour and form the slab in order to accommodate a dramatic angle–like creating a contiguous ‘coving’ up, into the backsplash. Other countertop materials cannot be formed in such a manner. Solid surface materials also lend themselves to stylish edging options whereby, like granite and other stones, the exposed edges may be finished with an ornate, router detail. Yet, solid surface can take this edging one step further: An alternate shade of solid surface can be sandwiched (glued) between the underside of the countertop and a piece of identical stock beneath it and then turned in order to integrate a coordinating feature strip. This accent strip may also be made of wood, matching the cabinetry, for a truly attractive and customized look. You will also find that this same solid surface material is utilized in the production of under-mount, flush and top-mount kitchen sinks–rendering a highly serviceable, stylish, fresh and sanitary kitchen work area.\nRaise your hand if you object!\nSolid surface countertop materials do solve a host of common kitchen issues while offering a visual that is unmatched in the industry. However, solid surface is not necessarily for everyone. One of the foremost detractions for solid surface materials is the price point that they tend to land. While, on one end of the cost spectrum they’re a modest climb from the price of laminate or tile counters, the more expensive solid surface products are aligned against some granite and quartz options. There appears to be a valid justification to climb a few dollars away from laminate or tile into solid surface, but solid surface’s inherent benefits become more scrutinized when up against natural stone and quartz surfaces as these surfaces have more history in recognition as premium countertop surfaces. The other notable objection is that of a solid surface being susceptible to scorching or burning in a kitchen application. It’s true that, being a plastic, that caution has to be made to ensure that nothing over 300 degrees F make contact with this surface–it will ‘burn’ and it could melt. Minor burns, of course, can be relieved by lightly sanding the blemish; but any severe burns or ‘melting’ is a permanent imperfection that is not going away. However, approach such things with a realistic mindset and understand that any countertop material has its weaknesses; and entertain the benefits as they correspond to the normal, everyday activities in your household–as well as your budget!","The average homeowner spends just shy of $3000 on countertop installation.\nNew countertops are a significant investment, which is why you want to take your time when choosing the materials, colors, patterns, and contractors.\nFor many people, the biggest decision when it comes to choosing countertops is the material. Without a doubt, quartz is one of the most popular countertop materials.\nBut, is this material right for your kitchen? Does it live up to the hype?\nCheck out this guide to learn about the top pros and cons of quartz countertops.\nWhat is Quartz?\nBefore we dive into the pros and cons, let’s take a close look at what exactly quartz is. Many people think that quartz is a humanmade material. However, quartz is a natural mineral that’s composed of silicon and oxygen. And, it’s the most abundant mineral on earth.\nThe confusion usually comes from the fact that even though quartz is natural, quartz countertops are humanmade. To make a quartz countertop, one must grind quartz into dust and then combine it with other natural and synthetic materials.\nSynthetic materials that quartz is usually combined with include pigments, polymers, and resins. The polymers and resins work to bind the quartz together to make it durable and hard. The dyes work to give the quartz countertop its color.\nTypically, natural quartz makes up 90 percent of the entire countertop, while the other ten percent is made out of synthetic materials.\nPros of Quartz Countertops\nLet’s start by looking at why people love quartz countertops:\nQuartz countertops come in a wide range of colors and patterns. If you wish, you can even get your quartz countertop in a design that very closely mimics natural stone.\nOr, if you’re looking for an extremely contemporary look, you can purchase a quartz countertop made from recycled materials or one that has metallic flecks.\nIf you’re looking for a countertop material that’s sleek, elegant, and modern, then quartz is your answer.\nBecause manufacturers of quartz countertops can mimic pretty much any design, they can make your quartz countertop look as classy as a real marble countertop.\nOne of the main reasons to invest in a quartz countertop is because of its strength.\nIf you’re looking for a material that doesn’t chip, scratch, or crack, then quartz is your answer.\nIn fact, on the Mohs scale of hardness, which is a scale that geologists use to measure the scratch resistance and hardness of a mineral, quartz ranks as a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10.\nIn contrast, marble falls between a rating of 3 and 5.\nManufacturers are so confident in quartz’s durability, that many of them offer a very generous warranty.\nMost companies offer a warranty between 10 and 25 years.\nIf the material is porous, it means that liquids can seep beneath its surface. This can lead to discoloration, staining, and irreversible damage.\nEven worse, bacteria and germs can make their way into the pores, making the countertops hard to clean and disinfect.\nBecause of this, if you invest in a porous surface, you’ll need to seal it to prevent staining.\nLuckily, because quartz is a non-porous material, you never have to worry about sealing it. This also means that quartz is incredibly stain-resistant.\nOne of the other main benefits of quartz is that it’s incredibly low maintenance.\nBecause it’s non-porous, cleaning quartz is a breeze. For the most part, all you need to do is wipe down your countertops with soap and water, and you’ll be good to go.\nCons of Quartz\nAs you can see, there are a lot of benefits to quartz countertops. But, there are also some drawbacks, such as:\nIf you’re on a tight budget, then quartz might not be the best choice for you.\nAll the beautiful benefits of quartz- non-porousness, durability, ability to customize- come with a cost.\nTypically, you can expect to pay between $65 to $100 per square foot for your quartz countertop.\nSusceptible to Heat Damage\nWhile quartz is incredibly durable, it is vulnerable to heat damage. While quartz is heat resistant, the polymers and resins it’s made out of, are not.\nTherefore, if you expose your quartz countertop to hot cookware, there’s a chance that the resins could melt, causing permanent damage and discoloration.\nSo, if heat is a significant concern for you, you may want to reconsider purchasing a quartz countertop.\nIf you want to install quartz countertops, it’s essential to know that this is not an afternoon DIY project.\nQuartz should always be installed by a trained professional. This is in part due to its extreme heaviness, as quartz weighs about 20 to 25 pounds per square foot.\nInstallers also need to be very careful about minimizing the appearance of seams when installing quartz countertops.\nIn other words, if you’re looking for a countertop material that you can install yourself, this isn’t it.\nCan’t Use Outdoors\nIf you’re looking to build an outdoor kitchen, quartz is not the right countertop material for you.\nQuartz can discolor when exposed to direct sunlight for extended hours.\nPros and Cons of Quartz Countertops: Is it Right for You?\nNow that you know about the top pros and cons of quartz countertops, it’s time to decide if this material is right for you.\nIf you decide that quartz is the right material for you, then you need to make sure you choose the correct installer. The right installer can make all the difference in the final appearance of your quartz countertops.\nBut, if you don’t think quartz is the right material for you, we suggest looking at other materials such as graphite, marble, or quartzite.\nAnd, if you’re looking to get new countertops installed soon, contact us today."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bd3fa9e4-e103-41cb-9b07-eca6c25ac8fd>","<urn:uuid:e34878c8-2c9c-48ff-a0a1-f4d85072c540>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do single-point lasers and Michelson interferometers compare in terms of their measurement approach? While both are laser-based measurement tools, what fundamental differences exist in how they gather data?","answer":"Single-point lasers and Michelson interferometers use different approaches to measurement. Single-point lasers project a beam onto a single point on the target and determine distance by measuring the percentage of light reflected back - the closer the object, the higher the percentage returned. They can achieve spot beams as small as 50 microns and are commonly used for measuring thickness of materials like aluminum foil and sheet metal. In contrast, Michelson interferometers split a coherent light beam into two paths and recombine them to create interference patterns. They measure distance changes with extreme precision (down to nanometer scale) by analyzing these interference patterns. The Michelson approach requires precise alignment of optical components and relies on phase differences between the light beams, while single-point lasers use a simpler reflection-based method.","context":["What is an Interferometer and how does it work?\nAn interferometer is a measurement device that uses coherent light and creates a superposition of two light beams which is called interference. The Michelson Interferometer is a simple type of interferometer which needs only few optical components, is easy to align and thus is widely used for many applications. A sketch of a typical setup is shown in Fig. 1.\nTo take advantage of the interference effect a coherent light source is essential. Usually a monochromatic laser is used. Both, continuous wave as well as pulsed lasers can be used.The incoming beam hits a thin beam-splitter and its intensity amplitude is split into two weaker beams. Each of these beams is reflected back to the thin beam splitter by an adjustable mirror, where the beams are combined again. If the phase difference of the two light beams is zero, the two beams will interfere constructively, and a high intensity signal will be measured on the photodetector. In contrast, if the phase difference is half the wavelength of the light the two beams will cancel, and the detector signal will drop to zero. As the phase difference of the two light beams depends on the difference of their optical beam path, slight changes of the distance between one of the mirrors and the beam-splitter result in strong intensity modulations on the photodetector.\nThe sensitivity of these intensity modulations on the optical delay naturally depends on the wavelength used in the spectrometer. For example, when using a standard Helium-neon alignment laser with wavelength of 633 nm a change in the optical path difference of only 317.5 nm will change the interference signal on the detector from maximum to minimum or vice versa. This illustrates the extreme sensitivity of this measurement technique.\nWhat can I use it for?\nDue to its ability to measure changes in the optical pathlength difference of the two interferometer arms with\nnanometer precision, interferometers are often used for highly demanding distance measurements and positioning tasks. One of the mirrors is kept fixed and the movement of the other one which is part of the positioning system is monitored by observing changes in the interference pattern.\nAnother very important application is the determination of the wavelength of the incoming light. For this purpose, the intensity fluctuations of the interference pattern are monitored while one external arm mirror (e.g. mirror 2 in Fig. 1) is moved and its position is logged. The intensity of the interference can now be plotted over the time difference dt for which the light travelled in both interferometer arms. A Fourier transformation of this time domain trace gives the spectrum of the source.\nA typical use case in the laser lab is the determination of the spectrum of a laser source which was generated in a nonlinear process (e.g. sum-/difference-frequency generation, optical parametric amplification…). Thus, the interferometer is used to tune these processes to give the desired output frequencies.\nThis exact effect is also used in the construction of a spectrometer (cf. Fig 2). Here, usually a broadband light source is used as the input light of the interferometer and a sample is placed in one of its arms after the beam-splitter. By comparing the spectra of the light withand without the sample in place it is possible to observe what wavelengths were absorbed by the light. Depending on the wavelength range, this enables materials analysis by comparison with reference spectra and determination of molecular vibrations.\nWhat parts do I need to build it?\n- A Coherent light source in the desired wavelength regime. In case you are using a pulsed laser and / or are working with invisible light (e.g. Infrared) it is highly suggested to use a simple alignment laser for the pre-alignment of the setup. It is much easier to find the interference pattern with visible cw light first and afterwards couple the invisible light on the same path (e.g. via two irises) for a last fine tune.\n- An adjustable thin beam-splitter (pellicle) for the wavelength of your laser (ideally R:T = 1:1). If you plan to use a thick beamsplitter see the section below. You will also need a compensation plate.\n- Two adjustable mirrors\n- A translation stage – if you want to automatically measure spectra of your laser beam a motorized stage is very helpful.\n- A screen to display the interference pattern\n- A photodetector to quantify the brightness of your interference signal\n- A data acquisition system which can display (and record) the output signal of your detector. This could be a simple oscilloscope to start with and/or a data acquisition card / lock-in amplifier to digitize the data.\n- A ruler / tape measure to measure the length of the interferometer arms\nHow do I align it with a thin beamsplitter ?\nAligning a Michelson interferometer is not difficult when following a systematic procedure. The following recipe is based on the design of Fig.1.\n- Ensure that your input laser beam is at a constant height above your table and align mirror 2 (which should be in the middle of the translation stage) so that the reflected beam is nearly coming back to the input of the laser and is in line with the axis of the stage. If you don’t know how to efficiently align a translation stage have a look for this tutorial on our website.\n- Place the beam-splitter at an angle of 45° in the path and make sure the reflected beam towards mirror 1 keeps its height constant and has an angle of 90° to the incoming beam. Especially if you are working with pulsed lasers this is the moment you really want to make sure that the length of the two arms is equal. So, use your ruler and try to match the distances of the two mirrors from the beam splitter as good as you can.\n- For a successful alignment it is very important to note that having both beams overlap back on the beam splitter is necessary but not sufficient. Rather, the two combined beams need to be colinear so that they overlap everywhere between the beam splitter and the photodetector / screen.\nThe easiest way to align an interferometer is to make sure that both arms retroreflect back on their incident position on the beam splitter independently. If this is the case they must be aligned to each other also after the beam splitter.\nTherefore, first block one arm and make sure the reflected beam is retroreflected on the same spot on the beam splitter. To do this it might be helpful to hold a paper with a hole a little smaller than the beam in the path just after the beam splitter. This allows the light from the beam splitter to pass through the middle and the reflected light can be aligned to the hole on the paper.\nNow repeat this procedure with the other arm.\n- You can now have a look on the combined beam by placing a screen. Depending on how precisely you did the alignment of the last step you should already see an interference pattern. This pattern might look like circles, or even circle segments / stripes. Since no laser source can produce a perfectly collinear beam, the intrinsic divergence leads to slight changes in the optical path depending on where on the display screen you are looking at. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 3. If the divergence of your input light is high or the optical path length of the two arms is not similar, you might want to re-collimate the input beam or use lenses in the arms. This helps to mode match the interfering beams and results in bigger and easily observable interference fringes. If you think there are interference fringes you could check if they are vanishing when you block either arm of the interferometer.\nIn general, if you see vertical (horizontal) stripes this means the beams are not perfectly aligned in the horizontal (vertical) direction. You can try to compensate for this with mirror 1 (as this is not on a stage you would misalign again). If the stripes are neither horizontal nor vertical probably both horizontal and vertical direction of the beams should be optimized. The interference pattern should get coarser with fewer stripes / rings the better the alignment is.\nThe aligned interferometer should be very sensitive to mirror movements – so for a He-Ne laser you should get strong intensity fluctuations on the screen even when you only tap one of the mirrors.\n- In case you are using a pulsed laser, this is the moment to swap your laser source and couple the actual pulsed one into the interferometer. Use two irises to make sure the pulsed laser is matching the beam path of the alignment laser as good as possible. Don’t worry if you do not see an interference pattern on the screen immediately. On top of a good alignment you of course must find the time overlap between the two beams as well. Therefore, you can carefully adjust the stage of mirror 2 while looking for intensity fluctuations on the screen / detector.\n- Once you have everything aligned you can check your interferometer by scanning the stage of mirror 2 while monitoring the output intensity (make sure your detector is in the middle of the interference pattern). Fig. 4a. shows several examples of such interferograms. In this case THz radiation was tuned by changing the difference frequency between the two linearly chirped near-IR pulses. Fourier transformation of the transient electric fields results in the spectra shown in Fig. 4b.\nWhat is the difference in a Michelson Interferometer with a thick beamsplitter ?\nIf you build a FTIR using a thick (more than lets say 100 um thick) coated beamsplitter you want to use a compensation plate in one of the arms. The coated reflective surface (indicated in black on the beamsplitter in Fig. 5) will be the surface giving you hopefully an ideal 50:50 reflection/transmission ratio and the beamsplitter material itself is without losses for the wavelength you use.\nYou can imagine that the green beam should have beam passed 3 times through the beamsplitter material thickness (times square root of 2 because of 45 degree incidence). If every passage through the material leads to some dispersion or whatever effects on your pulse it is necessary to introduce the same dispersion in the other interferometer arm also. Therefore you have to add a compensation plate of the same material and thickness as the beamsplitter material so the orange beam will experience the same dispersion.\nA thin pellicle beamsplitter on the other hand is so thin that you can take it as negligible and just consider it as a reflective surface without material behind it. The pellicle beamsplitters have the disadvantage of vibration (drum noise) and on top of this pellicle beamsplitters do not exist for all wavelengths with the necessary coating.\nHow do I align it with a thick beamsplitter ?\nAligning a Michelson interferometer with a thick beamsplitter is not as easy but possible of course when you consider the rules mentioned below. The discussion is based on the design of Fig. 5.\n- Follow the steps 1-3 for the thin beamsplitter and do not insert the compensation plate yet. Make sure that the reflections from the mirrors 1 and 2 go back onto the beamsplitter where the respective beams exited the beamsplitter. Especially the beam coming from mirror 2 will exhibit a first reflection on the back surface of the beamsplitter material before entering the material and being reflected at the front surface.\n- Be aware that the reflection intensities might not be the same at your visible alignment wavelength compared to the MIR design wavelength of the beamsplitter. So the reflection from the back side of the material might be stronger in the visible than it will be in the mid infrared. Make sure you understand which reflection comes from which side of your beamsplitter and overlap only the reflections that should overlap.\n- Now insert the compensation plate into your setup. You will see even more beams as you may have internal reflections in your compensation plate. Suddenly you have many beams and you should not go crazy. The exact pattern depends on the wavelength of your alignment laser and of your beamsplitter (coating). It is very important that you figure out which reflection is which. Normally the most strong beam is the back-reflected beam that you are searching for. Put yourself an iris in front of the setup and make the alignment beam small to understand better what is going on.\n- After successfully overlapping the correct beams you should again see interference in the beams. Keep in mind that doing this in the mid infrared where you cannot see anything would be even more difficult with all the beams.\nA general remark about thick beamsplitters and wedged surfaces\nYou might think that it is a good idea to get beamsplitters with a wedged back surface so that you know that you do not have ghost reflections in your way and life will be easier. But also keep in mind that your compensation plate should compensate this wedged surface. Otherwise you have parts of your wavefront passing through thicker material than other parts. This will deteriorate your contrast. In the end you have to decide what is possible and necessary for you. We used thick beamsplitters (not wedged) and compensation plates with success also with short coherence length sources but in general a thin beamsplitter avoids a lot of pain if it can be used.","QUALITY MEASUREMENT: Lasers Pinpoint Measurement\nHow does laser measurement pinpoint quality? The answer to this question is a broad one, even for such a precise and exacting measuring technique. Laser measurement uses the optical properties of focused light for noncontact dimensional scanning of a subject part, material or object yielding 1-D, 2-D or 3-D coordinate point surface positional information. Its use in\nmanufacturing-related activities consists of collecting many times more measured points in a given time compared with conventional techniques, allowing better definition of complex geometries.\nEngineers and designers confirm quality by using the data from laser measurement devices to reverse-\nengineer, improve or create new parts and products, or improve how parts are made. Quality control personnel use laser measurement to verify that parts have been made correctly, and if not, where they need to be corrected.\nLaser measurement ensures quality in manufacturing-related activities by creating absolute references for measurements, which do not change over distances the way mechanical or relative references do. Fast data acquisition is possible without the potential distortion that often occurs with conventional contact measurement. Because a laser does not touch the part it is measuring, the laser is not compromised when measuring soft materials, which might move or wear when touched.\nCompared to conventional contact measurement, laser measurement has fewer moving parts required to manipulate the part or the contact device. \"This will increase the durability and longevity of any manufacturing cell,\" says Stephen Sochowski, director of sales and marketing at Micro-Epsilon (Rolling Meadows, IL). \"Many contact devices can and will break, and must be replaced which increases downtime. Because tolerances are getting tighter, accurate measurement down to the microns is impossible with conventional contact technology. Even the smallest force applied by touching the specimen will affect the reading, or the target is too sensitive and does not allow any contact without compromising the quality.\"\nLaser Types and Lights\nSelecting the correct laser system best ensures quality. Laser systems range from single-axis measurers to large 3-D point cloud devices. According to Glenn Valliant, managing partner of Optical Dimensions (Lake Forest, CA), at the low end, there are simple laser sighting and surveying measurements that take advantage of the ‘straightness' of light. Other types of laser-beam configurations allow for the checking of surface flatness, porosity, diameters, gaps, positioning, velocity, eccentricity, surface inclination, thickness and height.\nSingle-point lasers with spot beams as small as 50 microns can be used on very small objects or features to confirm their presence. Single-point lasers project the laser beam onto a single point on the target and then return data. The laser sensor receiver can use the percentage of laser light reflected off the test object surface to determine the distance from the laser. The closer the laser is to the object, the higher percentage of light will be returned.\nThis method's accuracy is subject to variations in the reflective surface of the test object; however, it is the most cost-effective laser sensor. Applications for these types of lasers include measuring the thickness of a part, aluminum foil, plastic film and sheet metal.\nA laser tracker automatically tracks and follows the movement of the target by rotating the measurement head. Laser trackers measure the 3-D coordinates of a mirrored target by combining two measurement steps. The laser measures the distance between measurement device and a target. Then, incremental encoders measure the azimuth and elevation angle of the measurement head on which the laser is positioned. This results in the 3-D spherical coordinates of the target.\nThree-dimensional laser measurement scanners use projected light to determine a solid part's dimensions by generating a representative surface or solid model. Returned light and a photosensitive device, such as an array, generate point cloud data. \"The point cloud data is used to produce meshes, that are transformed into surfaces,\" says Christine Smith, laser metrology system project manager at Neptec International (Houston, TX). \"The surfaces can be stitched together to generate a solid model that is the same dimension as the part that has been scanned. This model can then be compared with the ‘as designed' computer-generated model to determine if the part meets the as designed dimensional criteria.\"\nJim Clark, vice president of marketing and business development at Metris North America (Rochester Hills, MI) says 3-D laser measurement scanners are best suited for:\n• Freeform surfaces, car exteriors, seating, car interiors, sculpture, archeology, heritage pieces and consumer products\n• Soft, deformable or fragile objects that cannot be touched during measurement\n• Surfaces with enormous detail, feature and webs\nThere are inexpensive, low-end and more complex high-end laser measurement devices. According to Cris Holmes, machine vision and sensor product manager at Axis Systems (Auburn Hills, MI), what makes a laser high end is primarily how the data is handled because inexpensive controllers can be configured to look for a set point match for a specific measurement.\nTo further ensure quality, most laser measurement devices have accessories performing calibration checks, alignment checks or part referencing of scan data. \"System and laser calibration accessories make automated calibration confirmation easy and fast to ensure the laser probe itself is operating within tolerance,\" says C. Martin Schuster, president of Laser Design Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). \"Alignment accessories allow for the scanning system to make sure it has aligned the laser scanner to the coordinate system orientation of the scanning system or part coordinate space.\" Part referencing accessories allow object scanning from different orientations of the scanner to the part to be merged together into the same coordinate system easily, or in some cases automatically.\nLaser quality, or measurement precision, is a function of the laser power, focusing optics, part surface roughness, surface reflectivity and the amount of error introduced by external factors such as temperature fluctuations and vibration. High-quality scanners require precision optics and stable electronics and platforms.\nDifferent types of light and wavelengths are used in laser measurement devices. Halogen light is used in fringe-type scanners. Laser light of various wavelengths is used in stripe and area scanners. Laser light is not affected by gravity, only by atmospheric effects, which are infinitesimal at this level of application.\nLaser ApplicationsLaser measurement has several applications, most better than mechanical contact measurement. Laser measurement is favored when measured objects are fragile and can be damaged by contact with mechanical devices. When measured objects are very hard, laser measurement will not damage and degrade the performance of a mechanical measuring device.\nThe best laser measurement applications are those requiring accuracy and precision. According to Darin Sahler, product manager at Faro Technologies Inc. (Lake Mary, FL), these include reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, complex shape profile analysis, flimsy part measurement-such as plastic and sheet metal-and anywhere a high-density of points and detail is needed.\nHigh-volume manufacturing is aided by laser measurement because it is faster than mechanical measurement. Speed of laser measurements often can allow 100% inspection compared to statistical sampling often used with mechanical measurements. Laser measurements can sometimes even be employed in real time on-line.\nBecause of laser measurement's different applications and technologies, it is not possible to categorize laser measurements in general terms. \"Even within a single application this is not possible,\" Jos Jans, business development director at Metris (Leuven, Belgium) says. \"Take a handheld laser scanner as an example. Although it is less accurate than a coordinate measuring machine (CMM)-based laser scanner, it does not mean that handheld laser scanning is a lower-end application in the eyes of the user; the user trades accuracy in for more flexibility and a bigger working volume. Furthermore, the way a certain technology is implemented by the different vendors will give results with a different quality.\"\nUnmeasurableDespite its many applications, there are situations where laser measurement should not be used. This includes any application that will have a change in temperature over the line of the laser. According to Dean Solberg, vice president at Exact Metrology Inc. (Algonquin, IL), laser is a light measurement tool and temperature changes the wavelength to give inaccurate results-a clean and controlled temperature environment is critical for a good measurement.\nHighly precise, geometrical machined surfaces and highly polished surfaces inhibit laser measurement's efficacy. \"In the first case, laser measurement is not as accurate as a touch probe and loses its advantage because few measured points are required,\" says Giles Gaskell, director of business development at NVision Inc. (Wixom, MI) says. \"In the second case, highly polished surfaces have a degraded level of accuracy compared to some other materials.\"\nLasers can only measure locations where the beam can contact the part. It is difficult to measure the bottom of a hole from an angle, because the laser beam is occluded.\nIn general, most transparent objects cannot be measured with lasers. Anything that can interfere with the standard model of the laser's light reflection can affect performance. However, just because a surface or material is transparent does not mean it cannot be measured. According to Clark, painting the part or spraying a fine dust can permit measurability. Many new laser measurement scanners allow operators to either automatically or manually alter the scanner's laser power and camera sensitivity to overcome undesirable reflectivity effects.\nPurchasing and TrainingLaser measurement technologies have their advantages and disadvantages. Potential buyers need to educate themselves on available technologies and how well they are suited for their specific application.\nBefore purchasing a laser measurement system, Holmes recommends always getting an engineering study using actual parts to ensure that the application is a success. Most companies will do it for no charge or credit the cost back if a system is purchased. It is always good to ask for references on similar applications. Smith suggests buyers ask about accuracy, resolution, scan area and volume, number of points per second, NIST traceability and what file formats to interface to.\nLaser measurement devices often are more expensive than traditional measuring systems. Valliant advises using a lower-cost, mechanical device to meet specifications when volume does not justify the extra expense.\nAlso, there are few standards for laser measurement that make it possible to compare the solutions of different vendors on paper in an objective way. Because of this, Jans says a benchmark on the customers measurement object will always be needed to compare the quality of the different vendor solutions.\nAccording to Sahler, questions that must be asked prior to purchasing a laser measurement system include:\n• Is it safe?\n• What is the warm-up period?\n• What is the accuracy and how is it determined?\n• What is the operating distance range?\n• Can it do the job in time?\n• What about optical noise?\n• Can it be used in ambient light and any other disturbing factors?\n• What is the weight and size of the unit?\nTraining is different for every laser measurement system. \"The use of a laser-measuring system should be quite easy assuming the manufacturer provides the necessary software and adequate instruction for operating the system,\" says Melissa Young, marketing coordinator at Automated Precision Inc. (Rockville, MD). \"A good laser measuring system should be MS Windows-based to ensure ease of use. If a user has basic computer skills and knowledge, then training to use a laser system should not be difficult.\"\nWhile the laser function is relatively easy to learn; handling and deciphering the data afterward can be a challenge. According to Martin Morris, president of Laser Measurement Services Inc. (Playa Del Rey, CA), while it is somewhat straight forward to train an operator to use currently available laser measurement systems to measure various aspects of machine tools and CMMs, it is more difficult and much more important to train the operator to analyze the measurements taken and apply corrections, mechanically or via software parameters, to correct the inaccuracies of a machine tools.\nTo ensure quality, laser measurement suppliers are simplifying procedures, and providing improved design, automation and fixturing. But laser measurement is different than mechanical measurement, and many international and commonly accepted training standards and procedures for measurements have evolved over decades based on mechanical devices.\nLaser measurement capabilities did not exist when many mechanical measurement standards and procedures were developed. These procedures and standards do not always apply to the laser measurement. Valliant advises that operators need to be open to new ideas and concepts. He says it is not always possible to directly relate mechanical procedures to laser procedures. Operators must be willing to accept the changes required to use the laser technology.\nLaser Measurement's FutureIn the future, as computers get faster, laser measurement will further ensure quality by producing more data per second from scanners. Increased competition should force prices to decrease. There will be a wider range of localizing devices, improved software and higher speeds of data acquisition. Devices should become lighter and smaller, have higher accuracies and distance capabilities, and enhanced automated feature recognition.\nAccording to Martin Dumberger, vice president of Micro-Epsilon (Raleigh, NC), semiconductor-based laser triangulation is currently about as fast and as accurate as it can get. \"More economical systems will be introduced that will have more features for the dollar,\" he says. \"Laser sensors with less than 0.03% linearity are at their limits of what is physically possible in spot penetration. So there will be even more sophisticated systems with even higher integration of intelligence to improve the performance.\"\nUntil now the majority of laser scanners have been manually operated and flexible. Gaskell says this is ideal for design and development environments, but less so for in-line applications. He forecasts increasing numbers of in-line contact measurement solutions available in the future.

{"question":"How do Physical Therapists approach contracture management differently in LOTS (Late Onset Tay-Sachs) vs Duchenne patients?","answer":"Physical Therapists approach contracture management differently in these conditions. For LOTS patients, PT focuses on developing exercise programs to promote independence and function in everyday life, while managing mobility challenges. In contrast, for Duchenne patients, PT has a more preventive approach - while other conditions may focus on increasing range of motion, in Duchenne the goal is specifically to preserve range of motion, strength and function. Both conditions require regular PT evaluations every 4-6 months, but Duchenne requires more specific monitoring of joint mobility and implementation of stretching routines and night braces, particularly for the ankles.","context":["Late Onset (LOTS)\nTay-Sachs, Sandhoff and GM1 diseases\nA common issue for people living with Late Onset Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff or GM1 is the progressive loss of mobility or in other words, a person's progressive loss of their ability to get from one place to another. Poor mobility may be caused by a combination of muscle weakness, spasticity of muscles and/or coordination problems. Whatever the particular cause, however, a Physical Therapist and/or Occupational Therapist can offer help.\nIt is important to notice the signs of reduced mobility:\n- Frequent falls\n- Difficulty getting from point A to B\n- Exhaustion after short movements\nOften people with LOTS view another step on the mobility progression as a new limitation, but in fact the right assistive devices used properly as per instructions can provide people with LOTS with more independence, a greater degree of freedom and with more autonomy than might otherwise have been possible.\nRegular exercise is strongly recommended for all affected individuals to help them maintain the highest level of mobility possible. Everyone can do some type of daily physical activity, regardless of particular limitations. For example, you can raise and lower your arms, turn your head slowly from side to side or up and down, and tighten and relax your muscles. Any exercise is better than no exercise at all. However, it is important to not over-exercise muscles, especially weak muscles, and an exercise program should be designed under the supervision of a qualified Physical Therapist.\nNTSAD appreciates the high cost of new mobility assistive devices and can work with you, if necessary, to put together an appeal to a denial of health insurance coverage. Many times, assistive devices, especially motorized wheelchairs and scooters, ramps, and stairway chairs, can be purchased secondhand. However, it is important to make sure that the correct device is purchased, and it is always best to have a Physical Therapist evaluate the assistive device to make sure it is being correctly used.\nThe Physical Therapist (PT) develops an exercise program to address your particular mobility challenges in order to promote independence and function in everyday life. The PT also orders mobility aids and teaches you their proper use.\nThe Occupational Therapist (OT) works to enhance function and independence in everyday life by:\n- Exploring new ways of engaging in favorite activities or hobbies\n- Demonstrating adaptive techniques which can help one to overcome hand tremors and improve dexterity\n- Suggesting appropriate home and work space modifications\n- Providing tools and strategies to deal with symptoms that interfere with driving\n- Ordering adaptive aids and demonstrating their proper use in particular circumstances.\nHow to Find a Physical Therapist and/or Occupational Therapist\nGenerally, the treating physician will provide a referral to you for Physical and/or Occupational Therapy. The PT and OT will then coordinate their work with that of other members of your care team. Treatment by a PT and/or OT may be covered by your health insurance.\nUse the State Association search found on the homepage of American Occupational Therapy Association to find the occupational therapy association in your state so it can help you find an OT in your area whose services may be covered by your insurance plan.\nThe American Physical Therapy Association provides a national database of members for you to find a PT in your area whose services may be covered by your insurance.","Your Rehabilitation Team\nRehabilitation teams should include physicians, physical and occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, orthotists and providers of durable medical equipment. This team works to collaborate with the other subspecialty members of the Duchenne care team (i.e., neuromuscular specialist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, endocrinologists, etc.).\nPhysical therapy (PT) will be an important part of life from the time of the Duchenne diagnosis. It is important that you have specialized physical therapy evaluations every 4-6 months. This way, any and all changes can be tracked overtime and needs can be addressed quickly.\nPhysical therapists play an important role in:\n- Minimizing contractures by introducing regular stretching into your daily routine\n- Maintaining function and adapting to any loss of function\n- Monitoring function over time through standard tests and measures\n- Assessing for and managing compromised skin integrity\n- Preventing and managing pain\n- Prescribing exercise and supervising safe physical activity (i.e. low load, low resistance exercise)\n- Recommending mobility devices, adaptive seating, and other equipment\n- Rehabilitation after injury or fracture\nPhysical therapy is different in Duchenne than in other situations. In other diagnoses, PT can help increase range of motion, strength, and function; in Duchenne, the goal of therapy is to preserve range of motion (the flexibility of a joint), strength, and function. PPMD videos will help your PT to provide the best therapy for you/your child.\nPhysical Therapy’s Role in the Care Team\nYour physical therapist should work closely with your neuromuscular specialist, physical medicine & rehabilitation (PM&R) physicians, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, or any other providers who make up your rehabilitation team. This team will focus on your individual goals and lifestyle and provide appropriate care. Physical therapists play a major role in obtaining appropriate adaptive seating and other types of equipment. They can also work with your family and help advocate on parent’s behalf to insurance companies. Physical therapy will be involved in the rehabilitation after an injury or fracture to regain function and ambulation. You should have a thorough physical therapy evaluation (strength, function and range of motion of the hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and wrists) at least every 4-6 months. These measurements should be tracked longitudinally so that indications of muscle weakness or joint tightness are found, and treated, early. Such evaluations can also indicate when some forms of equipment may be needed in the future.\nSkeletal muscle attaches to the tendons and joints of the body. In Duchenne, skeletal muscle is replaced by fat and scar tissue. The fat and scar tissue that replace the skeletal muscle are less flexible. This loss of flexibility in the muscle can lead to loss of range of motion at joints limiting how much a joint can move. Loss of joint mobility in combination with muscle weakness and less active movement can lead to a contracture or a fixed position of a joint. In Duchenne, an area of tightness commonly seen is at the ankle with a result of loss of flexibility of the Achilles tendon or heel cord.\nThere is still a lot to learn about contractures in Duchenne, however keeping the joint mobile within the available range of motion is important and has many benefits (see below). You should see a PT for an evaluation at least every 4-6 months. Stretching regularly and wearing night braces (feet and ankles) will help the joints stay mobile. Your PT team will also monitor the strength, function and range of motion of all of your joints at each visit. This evaluation should include shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, hips, knees and ankles). The results of this evaluation will help them to know when joints are becoming tighter so that they can make recommendations specific to you for appropriate stretches and/or braces for these joints.\nNon-Surgical Contracture Management\nWorking to prevent contractures proactively (before they occur) is always best. Contractures are not always preventable. If they do occur, there are ways to manage contractures and maximize the function of the joint. PPMD worked with a team of expert Physical Therapists (PTs) to develop an easy to follow Range of Motion handout (download) for parents and physical therapists. This handout summarizes the current physical therapy guidelines explained below.Download Range of Motion Guide >\nStretching should be a part of your daily routine and should be guided by your physical therapist. Regular stretching of joints including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle, knee, and hip should begin early and continue through adulthood. Potential benefits of stretching may include:\n- Temporary improvement in blood flow to the muscle\n- Decrease report of discomfort\n- A feeling of wellbeing\n- Temporary increase in tolerance to stretch\n- Temporary decrease in muscle stiffness\n- Continued movement through the joint’s full available range of motion\nWatch: Video Demonstrations\nTo view a collection of videos demonstrating stretching routines in people living with Duchenne of all ages, please visit our PT video series page.View Stretching Videos >\nBracing helps to keep the joints in alignment and maintain flexibility and function of the joint by providing a long (maintained) stretch. Braces can be used on the lower limbs (ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) and knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO), the wrists, and the hands. Braces are often made of plastic and are made specifically to fit an individual, custom fitted by an experienced occupational therapist or orthotist.\nAs we mentioned above, in Duchenne, tightness first develops in the ankles, due to the shortening of the calf muscle and pull on the Achilles tendon. Wearing braces at night (“night splints” or “moon boots”) enable the joints of the ankle and feet to be stretched for several hours. Most children are encouraged to start to wear night splints at, or near, the time of diagnosis to improve tolerance and wear time. These braces are called “AFO’s” (ankle, foot orthoses). The specific type of brace that you will need will be ordered by your physical therapy team. Wearing splints of this type are not recommended during the day, as they have a tendency to increase falls and increase the demand on the quadriceps (thigh) muscle. It is important that you are evaluated by a PT who is familiar with Duchenne.\nPPMD has created videos demonstrating how to properly apply AFOs to children and adults with Duchenne. To view these videos, please visit our PT video series page.View Stretching Videos >\nSerial casting refers to a process of applying a series of rigid casts (typically plaster) over an individual’s joint (most often used for heel cords at the ankle). The casts are used to slowly (with frequent cast changes over several weeks) increase range of motion at a specific joint. The joint is stretched “slightly” further with each new cast placement, which is typically 1-2 times per week. This procedure is not done at all centers, and should only be done at centers familiar with both the procedure and Duchenne. Careful monitoring by an PT with experience in serial casting and Duchenne is critical for success.\nAs mobility devices become necessary, these, too, will need to be evaluated by your physical therapy team. It is important that the device is used safely (wear your seat belt always and chest strap, if needed) and that the device offers optimal support and proper positioning. Following the advice of your physical therapist regarding when specific mobility devices are needed, is important. Your physical therapy team will help you to access the devices most appropriate for optimizing your function and quality of life.\nUse wheelchair inserts and support\nBolsters, rolls, or pillows can be used to position or support a body part in a good alignment. When individuals are spending increasing amounts of time in a seated position or lying down, muscles and joints become stiff more quickly. It is important to be sure they are in good position to help maintain their range of motion and comfort. Ideal seated positions include:\n- Both feet flat on the floor or footrest (or box step for younger boys), with hips and knees at a 90-degree position and back and pelvis aligned with hips\n- Avoid long periods of time with legs in a frog position (splayed out). Knees should be in line with feet & hips.\n- During growth, changing the dimensions of the chair helps maintain the best upright posture without having to lean.\nSubtle changes in wheelchair posture may indicate possible changes in the spine. Wheelchairs should have inserts on it so you are able sit upright and keep all parts of your body supported and in the proper position. If you are not having spinal surgery and your back pain is getting worse, a back brace may help.\nFor a detailed look at posture and seating, refer to our Mobility & Accessibility page. PPMD created a series of videos demonstrating safety and benefits of various wheelchair positions, which can be found on the PT video series page.View Stretching Videos >\nStanders are custom-fitted equipment designed to help an individual stand up for a prolonged amount of time. Standers could be considered in children who are unable to stand by themselves, have difficulty standing, or have lost the ability to walk. There are a few options for standing devices:\n- Sit-to-stand standers: allow ta person to go from sitting to a standing position\n- Supine standers: provide support along the back of the body; the child lies down and then is brought to standing\n- Wheelchairs that transition to standing\nFor a detailed look at standers, refer to our Mobility & Accessibility page.\nPreventing falls will go a long way to helping to maintain ambulation. Inside, making sure areas are as free from clutter, slippery surfaces or fall hazards, as possible, is helpful. Outside, paying attention to uneven surfaces and slippery surfaces can also help to prevent falls. And, again, if you are on a mobility device, wear your seat belt!\nPhysical Activity and Exercise\nPhysical therapists have an important role in prescribing, monitoring and guiding exercise. Aerobic exercise should be low or no impact, with minimal resistance. Swimming is generally the best exercise as there is less stress on postural muscles in an aquatic environment. It is important not to become over fatigued and to allow for rest periods. Talk to your physical therapist and rehabilitation team about what is safe.\nAdditional Daily Reminders\nIn addition to daily stretching and night-time bracing, there are a number of smaller items you should remember to incorporate into your daily routine to help preserve flexibility, strength, and function of your skeletal muscles, including:\n- Sitting up straight with good support\n- Keeping knees together and feet supported\n- Moving hands and wrists often\n- Keeping your tongue in your mouth\n- Exercising jaw muscles\n- Staying safe\n- Remembering to rest when you need to\nWatch: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\n- PT Management Document (download): This article details the importance of physical therapy in treating Duchenne.\n- Important Aspects of Physical Therapy (review): Presented by Helen Posselt at PPMD’s 2010 Connect Conference.\n- Templates for developing letters of medical necessity and letters of appeal"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8d10a0b3-6c43-4972-aac6-93443db5feaf>","<urn:uuid:664a846d-7bfc-4026-b4eb-eb06e266ec1a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es más estable para la pesca: un kayak or canoe with flat bottom hull?","answer":"A flat bottom canoe is more stable than a kayak for fishing. While kayaks allow anglers to access smaller and shallower fishing areas, flat bottom canoes are extremely stable in calm water and are a common choice for recreational activities like fishing. Flat bottom canoes are the local favorite of canoe liveries and rentals worldwide due to this stability advantage, though they do become less maneuverable when weighted down with excessive loads.","context":["It is kayak fishing season! Well, it seems that way as summer starts and more anglers are starting to explore kayak fishing. Kayak fishing is great for adventurous anglers or for those who want to get out on the water, but cannot afford a larger boat. Kayaks give anglers the ability to access smaller and shallower fishing areas and to reach places that bigger boats or even shore anglers cannot reach. Plus, there's the added benefit of physical activity gained from kayaking.\nToday, you can find all kinds of fishing accessories tailored to kayak fishing. I would recommend starting out with some basic gear, and then adding what you need as you go. One of the first items I needed for my kayak was a swivel rod holder. The Scotty Bait Casting/Spinning Rod Holder is a great swivel rod holder that is easy to mount to a kayak. It is also a good idea to get a paddle leash and a rod leash or rod floats. These ensure that gear is not lost if accidentally knock it into the water.\nFor tackle storage, I found it easy to carry a Plano 3700 StowAway ProLatch Adjustable Compartment Box with just the basic lures, jigs, bait, and terminal tackle that I need. When I want to carry more tackle, I strap my Berkley Powerbait Tackle Bag on the front of the kayak. The large size bag holds up to four Plano 3700 boxes and unzips on the front for easy access from the cockpit. For those anglers who need to take their smartphone, wallet, or other items that can get damaged when wet, the LokSak Waterproof Storage Bags are great for keeping things dry.\nOther gear that is useful for kayak fishing is an anchor, fish storage, and fish finder electronics. A small anchor is all that is needed to hold a kayak. Some anglers opt for an anchor trolley system that helps to keep the kayak facing a certain direction no matter which way the wind is blowing. A fishing net, such as the Frabill Trout Landing Net or the Frabill KwikStow Folding Net are great to have, especially for \"Catch and Release\". Another piece of equipment that I use is a floating fish basket. The Eagle Claw Floating Wire Fish Baskets or the Berkley 15” Floating Fish Basket are great baskets to keep your catch in throughout the day.\nOne of the newest products available in fishing electronics is the Vexilar SonarPhone Sonar System. The SP100 model can be cast or pulled behind a kayak and links up to your Android or iOS device to provide a fully functional sonar system.\nWith a kayak, you can easily sneak right up on the fish, so you don’t always need to cast out far. Quiet, short casting works well with Berkley Flicker Shad Pro Series Crankbaits or Rapala Shad Rap Lures. Varying your retrieve allows you to catch more fish.\nVertical jigging out of the kayak is often extremely effective. I use slip bobbers such as Thill Wobble Bobbers or Thill Pro Series Slip Floats with Thill Premium Bobber Stops. My go-to bait is the Berkley Gulp! Alive! Minnow in Emerald Shiner or Smelt color on a Lindy Fuzz-E Grub jig or with a Southern Pro Triple Tip Grub on a Southern Pro Painted Minnow Head jig head.\nTrolling is another technique you can use while kayaking. Often I have to paddle a distance to reach the spot where I want to fish anyway, so I will throw a Rapala crankbait on my rod and troll it behind me. Some anglers even use small planer boards to troll beside their kayak. The Off Shore Tackle Reversible Mini Planer Board works well for a kayak with minimal resistance when paddling.\nKayaks come in many sizes and styles, and more companies are producing kayaks designed specifically for fishing. Using a sit-on-top versus a sit-in kayak is mostly a matter of preference, as they will both work for fishing applications. An important thing in choosing a fishing kayak is determining what type of gear and how much gear you want to take along. A basic kayak can work for most casual anglers, and gear can be added as needed. Serious anglers may want to opt for a fully tricked-out fishing kayak. I purchased a basic fishing kayak that included two rear rod holders and some extra storage space so I could carry a cooler and tackle.\nSafety is very important when kayak fishing. Always wear a personal floatation device, and carry a whistle or air horn. I was able to find a life jacket designed for fishing with mesh uppers that does not restrict casting and includes extra pockets for my tools. Pay extra attention to the weather reports before going out. If you plan to fish at night, make sure you have the proper lighting. In addition to any required lighting, I also use the HT Enterprises ClipOn Cap Light to help see directly in front of me. This is helpful for tying knots, removing hooks, and more.","If you’re in the market for a canoe, we’ve put together this buying guide to get you clued up on the key features to look for in your new boat.\nWhether this is your first canoe, or you’re upgrading your boat, we answer all your questions to make sure everything goes without a hitch.\nKayak or Canoe: What’s the Difference and What Suits You?\nI’m assuming that if you’re reading a canoe buying guide, you’ve at least done a little bit of research and know the difference between kayaks and canoes?\nIf you don’t, you should check out our article that explains the difference between the two types of boat in detail. But for now, we’ve summed up the main points below.\n- Canoes are open vessels that can carry multiple passengers and lots of equipment. They’re highly functional and can be thought of as the pickup trucks of paddling. You use a single blade oar to paddle a canoe.\n- Kayaks are closed vessels – although you do get sit-on-top models now - where you sit inside the cockpit. They’re usually smaller and more nimble than canoes, but the downside is that they don’t have as much storage capacity. They’re paddled with a double-bladed paddle.\nSometimes it isn’t obvious which boat is right for you, especially as the traditional characteristics of kayaks can now be found on canoes, and vice versa.\nBut generally, you would opt for a canoe if you’re going on long expeditions, planning a camping trip with lots of gear, or want to take multiple passengers onboard.\nIf a canoe ticks all your boxes, here are a few questions to ask yourself before you go dropping $500+ on your new boat.\nPre-purchase Questions for Canoes\nBuying the correct tool means one must first understand the job at hand. Similarly, before the purchase of a canoe, it’s crucial to know what type of canoeing you’ll participate in.\nThe following are a few things to consider:\n- Will you be paddling open water such as lakes, or rivers?\n- Will you be encountering white-water on your trip?\n- Number of seats – how many people need to fit in your canoe?\n- Storage space – how much gear will you need to carry (how long will you be out)?\n- Do you have any plans for fishing from your canoe?\n- What’s your budget?\n- Have you considered how you’re going to transport your boat?\nDon’t forget to think a few trips ahead, too. It would suck to buy a beautiful new canoe only to find out that a month later, you’ll be paddling an area where it’s necessary to have an entirely different type of boat.\nOn the other hand, though, no one canoe will be perfect for every type of trip. It’s a balance.\nThis short video sums up the considerations when choosing your canoe.\nWhat Type of Canoe is Right for You?\nThere are several broad categories of canoes, each with a different purpose. Here’s a summary of the various types of canoes which will give you a better idea of which one best suits your lifestyle and intentions.\nThese hyper-expensive and ultralight boats are for serious racers. Often made of advanced composite materials, they’re light enough to pick up with a couple of fingers. Not for the weekend warrior.\nBudget and Recreational Canoes\nThese are the larger, bulkier, heavier boats you might see for rent at the local canoe livery. They’re inexpensive comparatively and very durable.\nAt the budget end of recreational canoes, you won’t find any top-class features or a thoughtful design, but they will allow a fun, family day trip on the water.\nFishing canoes would fall into this category, whether they’re purpose built for fishing, or a recreational canoe that’s had a few tweaks.\nYou’ll also find inflatable canoes in this section. Inflatable canoes aren’t just a gimmick and are surprisingly sturdy and capable of some rough usage. They’re perfect for beginners who aren’t quite sure if canoeing is for them, or for people who don’t have space for a hard shell canoe.\nThis category can bleed over into others but, generally, boats in this category have a very purposeful design.\nCharacterized by high levels of customizable features, often these niche canoes can (or must) be made to order from small manufacturers.\nRanging in size, length, passenger capacity, storage space, and featuring lightweight and advanced materials, these boats can be tailored to the requirements of the trip.\nMade for shooting rapids and navigating whitewater, these canoes are agile and durable. Not the best choice for flat water travel or longer trips, but perfect for sneaking through those class IV’s.\nIf you’re planning to do a substantial amount of paddling on rivers where whitewater is available, you’ll want to pick up one of these specific canoes for your activities.\nCanoe Hull Shapes and Why They Matter\nThe shape of the bottom of a canoe greatly influences its maneuverability and stability. Here are the four hull shapes and their characteristics.\nProbably the most common hull design, the flat bottom is the local favorite of canoe liveries and rentals the world over.\nFlat bottom canoes are extremely stable in calm water and easier to turn. But they’re inefficient due to large amounts of drag, and they quickly lose their maneuverability as soon as they’re weighted down by excessive loads.\nRound hull canoes feature an evenly curved bottom which arches from side to side.\nThese boats, as you might expect from something with a round base, are hard to balance and stabilize at first – like trying to balance on a foam roller.\nHowever, a rounded-bottom canoe can prove much more dependable on rough conditions; which is why more advanced paddlers can have a preference for them.\nAt speed, these boats demonstrate high efficiency and stability.\nShallow arch hulls are halfway between flat bottom hulls and semi-round hulls. For that reason, they display half of the characteristics of each design.\nV Shaped Hull\nMore akin to what you might see on your average bass boat, these canoes feature a pronounced keel. Arguably the best tracking and stability of any boat hull type available.\nCombining V-shaped hulls and shallow-arch bottoms yields excellent initial and secondary stability, optimal maneuverability, and good tracking. They’re often regarded as a middle-of-the-road solution for those who want to traverse a quiet river with some rougher sections.\nCheck out this video from Old Town Canoe for further explanation of how the shape of the hull influences boat performance.\nCanoe Size and Dimensions\nThere are three main factors which affect a canoe’s characteristics and, thus, its best-suited purpose. These are relatively obvious – length from bow to stern, width across the beam, and depth of the sidewalls.\nMeasure from the top of the gunwales to the lowest point in the canoe, this is the depth of your canoe. Canoes with higher sidewalls sport great carrying capacity and keep water out much better than shallow canoes.\nCanoes with short sidewalls are - pound for pound - lighter than the deeper canoes but come with a drawback. These short sidewalls allow water in much more easily in rough water!\nWidth and Beam\nIn boat terms, the beam is the width of your boat at it’s largest point.\nWider boats are heavier, but more stable laterally. They’re much harder to topple and good for beginners who are still finding balancing tricky. These boats are better suited for open water and rough weather.\nNarrow beam canoes can cut through the water more effortlessly and conserve your energy better by minimizing drag. That means they’re more agile, but at the expense of reduced stability.\nIt’s not all about length, that much we do know. But seriously…\nThere’s a lot of variation in length ranging from the smaller and quicker ten feet vessels, up to the 23-foot, four-person canoes used for long trips. However, most canoes will be in the 16 to 17 foot range.\nLonger boats (17+ ft) are usually faster and display great stability and carrying potential once up to speed. Longer boats track better in straight lines and are less prone to varying course due to paddle strokes. These are excellent choices for longer paddle camping trips.\nOf course, the downside is that the extra material weighs more, and it takes a bit more grunt to get long canoes off the mark.\nShorter boats (16 ft and under), not surprisingly, are the inverse of long boats. They’re more agile, easier to steer, have quicker acceleration, and can dart into smaller spaces much more easily. They’re also easier to portage and to transport.\nShorter boats are usually recreational or fishing canoes designed for one or two passengers, or river canoes used for whitewater.\nThe shape and design of the side of your canoe can be one of three main styles:\n- Outwardly flared - greatest stability, harder to paddle\n- Inwardly flared – “tumblehome”, less stability, easier to paddle\n- Straight – an excellent balance of the two prior designs\nJust like skis and snowboards, rocker on a canoe refers to the upwardly recurved profile of the boat from bow to stern. Or in laymen's terms, it’s the banana shape of the boat when looking at it side on.\nThe more curved the hull is, the more rocker the boat is said to have. More rocker equals more agility and efficiency of motion, and you will have an easier time turning canoes with a lot of rocker. You can also handle choppy water better in a boat with high rocker.\nThe downside to high rocker is that it makes it difficult to keep the boat on a straight line, high wind can influence the boat more, and it makes balancing harder on calm waters.\nThis is the term which describes the shape of the boat where the front end meets the water. Sharply pointed boats are highly efficient as they slice into the water.\nHowever, they can be prone to diving under waves when compared to their more rounded, blunt counterparts.\nA recurved or raked stem, is way better to ride over waves, but it’s much less resistant to side winds and makes the canoe slightly slower.\nYou’ll want to consider the weight and durability of your canoe, both of which are factors influenced by the materials it’s made from.\nThere are a ton of materials out there, many of which are proprietary designs. We’re only going to cover a few of the more common large classes of materials here.\nAluminum is a heavy material, but it also has excellent strength and durability properties. It is becoming less common in canoe design.\nGlass canoes are lighter than their older aluminum counterparts. Fiberglass canoes are reasonably robust and relatively inexpensive to buy or to repair. These canoes can be extremely light!\nABS is a plastic used in some canoe construction. Many times it is reinforced with other materials and layered to make a superior final product. Often quite heavy!\nCarbon fiber, Kevlar, and other future-tech composites are extremely lightweight, making them less draining to paddle. They’re used in advanced canoe construction as they have superb strength to weight ratios and are extremely impact-resistant.\nThe drawback of a feather light and tough-as-nails canoe? A huge price tag, sometimes in the thousands.\nIt’s important to keep in mind your ideal paddling trip and conditions. Most beginner canoe enthusiasts do not need a boat which can handle waves and extreme long distance touring. If open water touring is your goal, however, then you may need to think forward a bit.\nPRO TIP: Invest in an aftermarket seat addition (or order an upgraded seat from the manufacturer) if you have a sitting canoe (as opposed to kneeling).\nDon’t forget to save room in your budget for a comfortable PFD and lightweight paddle."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:50d24d68-602d-4c1a-a654-1ead7865e256>","<urn:uuid:dec22236-3d4a-4b76-8137-e734e09ba97a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the primary ecological relationships that get disrupted in both forest and coral reef ecosystems, and what role do invasive species play in these disruptions?","answer":"In forest ecosystems, the crucial symbiotic relationship between trees and mycorrhizal fungi gets disrupted, where fungi normally provide essential nutrients to tree roots in exchange for carbon. When this balance is upset by pollution, some fungi become more parasitic, taking carbon but giving few nutrients in return. In coral reef ecosystems, various ecological relationships can be disrupted by invasive species, particularly through algae like Sargassum. When overabundant, these invasive algae can harm coral reefs by shading corals, limiting space for coral larvae, and transmitting pathogens. Invasive species can enter these ecosystems through multiple pathways, including ship traffic, aquaculture operations, and recreational activities.","context":["European pollution limits may be set far too high.\nLondon: Pollution is changing the fungi that provide mineral nutrients to tree roots, causing plants in Europe to become malnutritioned, a study has found.\nTo get nutrients from the soil, trees host fungi, known as mycorrhizal fungi, in their roots. These fungi receive carbon from the tree in exchange for essential nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which they gather from the soil. Some of these fungi are known above-ground from the mushrooms and truffles they form.\nThis plant-fungal symbiotic relationship is crucial for the health of the tree. Recent studies have noted signs of tree malnutrition across Europe, such as discoloured leaves or leaves lost from the crown, but the mechanisms underpinning these symptoms are unclear.\nA 10-year study led by Imperial College London (ICL) and the Royal Botanic Gardens in the UK showed that tree characteristics and local air and soil quality have a large impact on mycorrhizae.\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, examined 40,000 roots from 13,000 soil samples at 137 forest sites in 20 European countries. This allowed researchers to discover large-scale trends in mycorrhizal communities, including their tolerance to pollution. \"There is an alarming trend of tree malnutrition across Europe, which leaves forests vulnerable to pests, disease and climate change. To see if changes in mycorrhizae might be behind this trend, we opened the 'black box' of soil,\" said lead researcher Martin Bidartondo, from ICL.\nProcesses happening in soil and roots are often ignored, assumed or modelled, because studying them directly is difficult, but it is crucial for assessing tree functioning.\n\"A major finding of the study is that European pollution limits may be set far too high,\" said Bidartondo. \"In North America the limits are set much lower, and we now have good evidence they should be similar in Europe. For example, current European nitrogen limits may need to be cut by half. Our trees in Europe are not more tolerant than those in North America - their fungi are just suffering more,\" he said.\nThe team found that the characteristics of the tree (species and nutrient status) and the local environmental conditions (atmospheric pollution and soil variables) were the most important predictors of which species of mycorrhizal fungi would be present and their abundances.\nMinerals like nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for life, but in high enough concentrations can be damaging, acting as pollutants rather than nutrients. The new study discovered 'thresholds' of these elements - concentrations above which the community of mycorrhizae changes. Some mycorrhizal fungi are outcompeted by those that are more tolerant of pollution, such as species that can take advantage of the excess nitrogen from air pollution.\nThese ecosystem changes can negatively affect tree health. For example, the team proposes that some community changes result in more 'parasitic' mycorrhizae: those that take carbon but give little back in the way of nutrients.\nThe researchers say these first large-scale results should be used to design new in-depth studies into the link between pollution, soil, mycorrhizae, tree growth and tree health. \"The study throws up many new questions in tree health and mycorrhizal diversity. For example, we found that while mycorrhizae are more specialised than expected - i.e. the majority of species will only associate with certain types of trees - specialist fungi were also less adaptable to changing conditions,\" said Sietse van der Linde who worked at Imperial at the time of the study.\n\"The thresholds uncovered in this study should impact how we manage our forests. From now on, with this wealth of new information we can take a broader view of fungi and forests across the continent, and also design new fungal monitoring systems, using this study as the first ever underground baseline to test directly for large-scale drivers of change,\" said Laura M Suz, from Royal Botanic Gardens. \"We can also now investigate new questions in depth. For example, we did not expect that the levels of potassium would affect mycorrhizae as strongly as they did, but we can now try to determine why that is, and what impact potassium levels are having on our forests,\" said Bidartondo.","Beyond threats associated with climate and ocean change, coral reefs are also affected by various local and regional threats. These threats may occur alone or synergistically with climate change adding to the risks to coral reef systems.\nOverfishing and Destructive Fishing\nUnsustainable fishing has been identified as the most pervasive of all local threats to coral reefs. ref Over 55% of the world’s reefs are threatened by overfishing and/or destructive fishing. Overfishing (i.e., catching more fish than the system can support) leads to declines in fish populations, ecosystem-wide impacts, and impacts on dependent human communities. Destructive fishing is associated with some types of fishing methods including dynamite, gill nets, and beach seines. These harm coral reefs not just through physical impacts but also through by-catch and mortality of non-target species including juveniles. Read more about threats and management strategies in the Reef Fisheries Toolkit.\nTraditionally, impacts from wastewater pollution have been associated with human health, but the detrimental effects of wastewater pollution on marine life – and the indirect impacts they have on people – cannot be overlooked. Wastewater transports pathogens, nutrients, contaminants, and solids into the ocean that can cause coral bleaching and disease and mortality for coral, fish, and shellfish. Wastewater pollution can also alter ocean temperature, pH, salinity, and oxygen levels disrupting biological processes and physical environments essential to marine life.\nOther sources of pollution to coral reef waters include land-based pollution associated with human activities such as agriculture, mining and coastal development leading to the discharge or leaching of harmful sediments, pollutants, and nutrients. Marine-based pollution associated with commercial, recreational, and passenger vessels can also threaten reefs by discharging contaminated bilge water, fuel, raw sewage, and solid waste, and by spreading invasive species. Learn more in the Wastewater Pollution Toolkit or in the Wastewater Pollution Online Course.\nMore than 2.5 billion people (40% of the world’s population) live within 100 km of the coast, ref adding increased pressure to coastal ecosystems. Coastal development linked to human settlements, industry, aquaculture, and infrastructure can cause severe impacts on nearshore ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. Coastal development impacts may be direct (e.g., land filling, dredging, and coral and sand mining for construction) or indirect (e.g., increased runoff of sediment, sewage, and pollutants).\nTourism and Recreational Impacts\nRecreational activities can harm coral reefs through:\n- Breakage of coral colonies and tissue damage with direct contact such as walking, touching, kicking, standing, or gear contact that often happen with SCUBA, snorkelling, and trampling\n- Breakage or overturning of coral colonies and tissue damage from negligent boat anchoring\n- Changes in marine life behavior from feeding or harassment by humans\n- Water pollution by tour boats through the discharge of fuel, human waste, and grey water\n- Invasive species which can be spread through transportation of ballast water, hull fouling of cruise ships, and fouling from recreational boating\n- Trash and debris deposited in the marine environment\nCoral disease is a naturally occurring process on reefs, but certain factors can exacerbate disease and cause outbreaks. Coral disease outbreaks can lead to an overall reduction in live coral cover and reduced colony density. In extreme cases, disease outbreaks can initiate community phase-shifts from coral- to algal-dominated communities. Coral diseases can also result in a restructuring of coral populations.\nDisease involves an interaction between the coral host, a pathogen, and the reef environment. Scientists are learning more about the causes of coral disease, especially in terms of identifying the pathogens involved. To date, the most infectious coral diseases are caused by bacteria. Transmission of coral diseases can be facilitated in areas of high coral cover ref as well as through coral predation, as predators can act as vectors by oral or fecal transmission of pathogens. ref\nThe causes of coral disease outbreaks are complex and not well understood, although research suggests that important drivers of coral disease include climate warming, land-based pollution, sedimentation, overfishing, and physical damage from recreational activities. ref\nOn coral reefs, marine invasive species include some algae, invertebrates, and fishes. Invasive species are species that are not native to a region. However, not all non-native species are invasive. Species become invasive if they cause ecological and/or economic harm by colonizing and becoming dominant in an ecosystem, due to the loss of natural controls on their populations (e.g., predators).\nPathways of introduction of marine invasive species include:\n- Ship traffic, such as ballast water and hull fouling\n- Aquaculture operations (shellfish aquaculture is responsible for the spread of marine invasive species through global transport of oyster shells or other shellfish for consumption)\n- Fishing gear and SCUBA gear (through transport when moving from place to place)\n- Accidental discharge from aquaria through pipes or intentional release\nSargassum are a type of brown, fleshy macroalgae that can have detrimental ecological and economic impacts on coral reefs when overabundant.\nIn the Indo-Pacific, high percent cover of Sargassum is common on degraded coral reefs and often represents a phase-shift from a coral to algae-dominated reef system. ref Their reproductive biology and morphology make them excellent colonizers of free space and particularly resilient to disturbances such as tropical storms. ref When overabundant, they can negatively impact the reef by shading, limiting space available for coral larvae to recruit, and transmitting pathogens. ref\nIn the Atlantic, two species of floating sargassum, S. natans and S. fluitans, are responsible for causing large mats of algae blooms which are particularly harmful and prevalent on the Caribbean and West African coastlines. ref Floating algae mats are naturally prevalent in the Northern Atlantic and provide many ecological benefits such as habitat, food, and nursery grounds to many species of fish, crustaceans and even sea turtles. ref However, in the last ten years, a shift in oceanic currents has led to an algae invasion in coral reef areas, causing reduced sunlight required by corals and anoxic and hypoxic conditions on reefs, as well as poor conditions on beaches that are detrimental to the tourism industry. ref\nCoral predators (or 'corallivores') are naturally occurring organisms that feed on corals for their polyps, tissue, mucus, or a combination of the above. Such predators typically include echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins), mollusks (snails), and some fish.\nCorallivory is a common process that, under normal conditions, allows for natural turnover in the ecosystem. However, when these predators are overly abundant (e.g., outbreak conditions), they can cause significant declines in coral cover.\nCommon coral predators include:\n- Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS), which are found throughout the Indo-Pacific region, occurring from the Red Sea and coast of East Africa, across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, to the west coast of Central America. COTS can be a major driver of coral loss in the Indo-Pacific, particularly under outbreak conditions.\n- Drupella snails, which are commonly found living on corals in reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific and Western Indian Ocean.\n- Coralliophila snails, which are often more problematic for Caribbean reefs, although some species are prevalent in the Pacific."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:596fcb24-0778-498e-bdbf-a8cff27dd0c8>","<urn:uuid:6dd87468-19aa-450b-b9cc-46d264a1ee33>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What historical significance did Patrizia Scascitelli and Eddie Palmieri have in breaking barriers in their respective musical contexts during the 1970s?","answer":"Both musicians were significant barrier-breakers in their respective contexts during the 1970s. Patrizia Scascitelli was the first woman to play jazz in Italy, pioneering the way for female jazz musicians in her native country. She demonstrated this groundbreaking role through performances at major Italian jazz festivals like Umbria, Bergamo, Bologna and Pescara. Meanwhile, Eddie Palmieri was breaking musical boundaries in New York City by being at the vanguard of salsa music development, particularly through his innovative 'trombanga' sound created with his group La Perfecta. His 1971 album 'Harlem River Drive' was influential in fusing African American musical styles like soul, funk, and rhythm and blues with salsa rhythms. Their achievements were recognized differently - Scascitelli through accolades in Italian jazz magazines and Palmieri by winning the first-ever Grammy Award for best Latin recording in 1974 with 'The Sun of Latin Music.'","context":["Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians\nScascitelli, Patrizia, pianist, composer, arranger, educator, b.Rome, Italy, October 15, 1956.

Eddie took up the piano at age 8 and then switched to the timbales (a pair of shallow single-headed drums) at age 13 when he began playing in his uncle’s group. After just two years, however, he returned to the piano, the instrument that ultimately became the foundation of his musical career.\nDuring the 1950s Palmieri played piano with a number of Latin dance ensembles, including Tito Rodriguez’s mambo orchestra, before forming his own group, La Perfecta, in 1961. Although La Perfecta resembled other Latin dance combos in many respects, it differed from them in several important ways. Perhaps most significant, it adapted the instrumentation of the popular charanga ensemble—which featured violins and flute as the main melodic instruments—by replacing the violins with a trombone section. The resultant “trombanga” sound, as Palmieri called it, was distinct not only from the sound of charanga but also from that of the many Latin ensembles that used a trumpet-driven front line. Adding to the sonic signature of La Perfecta was Palmieri’s uniquely percussive piano style. All these innovations helped drive the development of the similarly percussive, brash, and brassy salsa music that had emerged in New York City in the 1940s and ’50s and that peaked in popularity in the ’70s in conjunction with a surge in Hispanic cultural pride. Palmieri was in the vanguard of the movement.\nAfter La Perfecta disbanded in 1968, Palmieri recorded the influential solo album Harlem River Drive (1971), which fused African American musical styles such as soul, funk, and rhythm and blues with the salsa rhythms of his own Hispanic heritage. In 1974 The Sun of Latin Music (1973) won the first Grammy Award given for best Latin recording; his Unfinished Masterpiece (1974) won the award the following year.\nPalmieri continued to record prolifically and to maintain an active performance schedule throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He won several more Grammy Awards, two of which were for collaborations—Masterpiece/Obra Maestra (2000), with salsa multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Tito Puente, and Simpático (2006), with trumpeter Brian Lynch.

{"question":"What connects HBO's pay equity initiative and Meryl Streep's Oscar history in terms of recognition of women's contributions to entertainment?","answer":"HBO's initiative represents institutional change in addressing gender pay disparities, as they conducted comprehensive audits and made corrections across all their shows in response to the Time's Up movement. Meanwhile, Meryl Streep's achievements demonstrate individual recognition of female talent, having received 21 Oscar nominations and winning three Academy Awards - one for Best Supporting Actress in Kramer vs. Kramer and two for Best Actress in Sophie's Choice and The Iron Lady.","context":["An HBO executive said the company examined and corrected pay disparities at the network — thanks to Reese Witherspoon.\nThe actor, who stars in and serves as an executive producer for HBO’s Big Little Lies, played an instrumental role in HBO’s pay parity assessment through her work with the Time’s Up movement, created earlier this year by prominent women in the entertainment industry.\nCasey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming, told The Hollywood Reporter the decision to identify and eliminate any pay disparities came out of “thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese, who’s really at the forefront.”\n“We’ve proactively gone through all of our shows,” he told the magazine. “In fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward. And that is a direct result of the Time’s Up movement.”\nWitherspoon is one of the high-profile actors who launched the Time’s Up movement in response to an outpouring of accusations of sexual misconduct against numerous high-profile men in Hollywood. Witherspoon has long been an advocate for promoted women in Hollywood, giving impassioned speeches about equality and starting her own production company dedicated to making films and shows with strong female leads. Her production company Pacific Standard Films produced Big Little Lies, as well as 2014’s Gone Girl and Wild.\n“Bring women to the front of their own stories, and make them the hero of their own stories,” Witherspoon said in September 2017 when HBO won Outstanding Limited Series at the 69th Emmy Awards.\nThe Time’s Up movement has taken on issues that face women in the workplace beyond sexual harassment. Initiatives within the movement include a legal defense fund for survivors of sexual misconduct, a committee dedicated to filling more boards with women and people of color and raising awareness about the gender wage gap.\nHBO is one of several companies that have conducted internal or third-party audits of its payrolls in recent years to eliminate existing pay disparities. Equal pay advocates have said payroll audits are vital for businesses to ensure wage equality, and companies like Starbucks and Adobe have announced the elimination of any pay disparities after conducting payroll audits.\nOf course, in Hollywood, massive wage differences can come as a result of the existing fame of an actor or an actor’s negotiation tactics. Last month, Left Bank Pictures, the production company behind Netflix’s The Crown, came under fire when an executive revealed the Matt Smith, the actor who played Prince Philip on the show, earned more than Claire Foy, the actor who played Queen Elizabeth II. The company attributed Smith’s higher salary to his already-existing Doctor Who fame, and Foy’s smaller salary due to her newcomer status. Still, fans and critics were still angered by the pay difference — especially since Foy went on to win a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for her portrayal of the Queen.\nIn his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, HBO’s Bloys addressed this issue faced by networks and production companies when actors come onto shows with different levels of experiences. “But when you get into season two or three of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers,” Bloys said, “and that’s where you have to make sure that you’re looking at the numbers — that they don’t end up just on the path they were on from the pilot stage.”","The Oscars are considered the most significant and prestigious of all awards in the entertainment industry. The AMPAS presents the awards – Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences – every year and recognizes the achievements of nominees and the winners through an internal assessment of the Academy’s voting members.\nThe golden statuettes were first presented way back in 1929 by Douglas Fairbanks in a dinner that he privately hosted at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.

Katharine Hepburn received a total of 12 nominations at the Oscars. All awards she received were for the Best Actress category. No other actor or actress has received this honor in the history of the awards.\nIn 1979 Meryl Streep won the ‘Best Supporting Actress’ award for her role in Kramer vs. Kramer. She then in 1982 bagged the ‘Best Actress Award’ for Sophie’s Choice. In 2011 she won again for The Iron Lady. In total, Meryl Streep received 21 nominations and won 3 awards.\nJack’s first win for ‘Best Actor’ was for his film One Flew Ove the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1975.

{"question":"Which causes more formation damage - using 100% corn cob particles vs using RECLAIM technology for drilling fluid treatment?","answer":"Using 100% corn cob particles causes significantly more formation damage compared to the RECLAIM technology. The corn cob particles caused 42.3% formation damage at 50 psi and 62% damage at 100 psi. In contrast, the RECLAIM technology is specifically designed to reduce formation damage, as it removes fine solids and brine while recovering valuable base oil, ultimately improving drilling fluid performance and reducing formation damage incidents.","context":["By Alan Gilmour, J.O. Pruett II, M-I-SWACO\nA chemically enhanced centrifugation process, designed to remove the bulk of fine colloidal particles and/or increase the oil/water ratio (OWR) in oil- or synthetic-based drilling fluids, has proved its capacity to reduce costs significantly during a Wyoming field trial.\nThe patented RECLAIM technology comprises proprietary flocculants and surfactants and a 20-ft skid containing all components required to effectively flocculate fine solids in a non-aqueous fluid. Surfactants may be used to weaken the emulsion, and flocculating polymers are used to agglomerate the fine solids so they can be easily removed by centrifugation. The polymer also promotes the demulsification of the brine droplets in the mud, and a secondary effect of this process is that water is removed with the solids, raising the oil/water ratio.\nThe portable system is suitable for all onshore and offshore rigs employing synthetic- or oil-based drilling fluids, where extending the useful life of the mud system is paramount. In addition, RECLAIM is applicable to operations where the objective is recovering reusable base fluid from spent mud and in liquid drilling fluid plants for reducing costs associated with fluid reconditioning and disposal.\nConventional solids-control equipment is unable to remove low-gravity solids smaller than 5 to 7 microns that accumulate and degrade the performance of premium oil- and synthetic-base drilling fluids. Using a combination of proprietary chemistry and specialized equipment, RECLAIM removes low-gravity solids while recovering valuable base oil.\nMoreover, the technology has been shown to improve drilling fluid performance and increase ROP while reducing formation damage, stuck-pipe incidents and disposal, storage and transportation costs. From an environmental perspective, the RECLAIM technology reduces the volume of waste mud and the risk of spillage during transportation.\nRECLAIM provides a dry, closed-loop system onsite and produces cleaner fines for disposal.\nWyoming pilot test\nThe system has been used in a variety of locations worldwide, including Abu Dhabi and Calgary. More recently, a successful trial of the RECLAIM technology for an operator in Wyoming clearly demonstrated economic value. As a result, the equipment has been retained on contract and will continue to recondition diesel oil-based mud (DOBM) on location.\nThe specification for mud being delivered to the rig is a density of 10.0 lb/gal with an 80/20 OWR. While drilling, the density of the fluid is raised to between 14.0 lb/gal and 15.0 lb/gal, and often there is significant water contamination, in some cases resulting in a decrease in the OWR to 60/40 or lower.\nAt the end of a well, the standard treatment of the mud is to centrifuge the mud to lower the density as much as possible, then dilute with base oil to further lower the density and re-adjust the oil/water ratio. In most cases, this results in high costs for dilution, and in additional temporary storage and/or increased disposal costs for excess volumes of mud. The purpose of the field trial was to demonstrate that the RECLAIM technology would effectively remove fine solids and part of the brine phase; reduce the density of the fluid, while at the same time eliminating the need for expensive dilution.\nThe RECLAIM package used for the trial was trailer-mounted, consisting of the RECLAIM unit, a generator and a CD500 centrifuge with stand. The location was situated next to an existing rig-site waste pit that was used for storage of cuttings from DOBM drilling operations, and was lined and bermed prior to setting up the equipment. Three 400-bbl storage tanks were provided to receive mud and processed fluid.\nThe customer operates 15 rigs in the area, and the objective was to use the RECLAIM package as a central in-field processing facility, with the capability to receive and process mud from any of the rigs after each well had been completed.\nCriteria for Success\nThree distinct phases have been identified in the RECLAIM process to help identify when the process is effectively removing the fine solids. Phase 1 is achieved when flocculated solids start to appear in the centrifuge underflow discharge. If there is no change/increase in the OWR, this indicates the RECLAIM process has not been achieved and only the coarser non-colloidal solids are being flocculated and removed. Phase 2 is achieved when the flocculated solids discharged contain significant amounts of brine. This indicates successful RECLAIM treatment and results in removal of the bulk of the solids, including colloidal solids, and a portion of the brine phase. Phase 3 occurs when the bulk of the brine phase is removed along with the solids and results in the generation of virtually clean base oil.\nTherefore the criteria for success is the removal of both fine solids and a portion or all of the brine phase, i.e., a reduction in solids to 1% or less, and a significant increase in the OWR to 85/15 — 99/1 or higher. The transition between the three phases is controlled by the levels of chemical treatment used in the RECLAIM process.\nField Trial Results\nThe DOBM processed during the trial was delivered from another rig that had just completed drilling a well. A total of 375 bbl of water-contaminated DOBM was received, with an initial density of 14.5 lb/gal, 55/45 OWR and 24% solids. A baseline result was initially established by processing the fluid through the CD500 centrifuge with no RECLAIM treatment. This resulted in a reduction in density from 14.5 lb/gal to 9.3 lb/gal.\nUsing a feed rate of 8 gpm, and with additions of 1.5% to 2% surfactant and 3% to 4% flocculant polymer, phase 1 conditions were achieved, resulting in effluent densities in the range 8.4 lb/gal to 8.6 lb/gal and no change in the OWR. Phase 2 conditions were reached by introducing some dilution of the feed mud with base oil. With 15% diesel dilution and an 8-gpm feed rate, the density was reduced to 7.9 lb/gal using 2% surfactant plus 3% flocculant polymer. The OWR was increased to 85/15 and solids reduced to less than 2%.\nA second batch of 205 bbl used mud was received, after having been centrifuged to reduce the density to 11.2 lb/gal. This fluid had a 63/37 OWR and contained 24 solids. After further centrifuging with the CD500, the density was reduced to 9.6 lb/gal. Using a feed rate of 7.5 gpm, with 2.3% surfactant, 3% polymer and 10% dilution with diesel, the RECLAIM process successfully reduced the density of the effluent to 7.9 lb/gal, with a 90/10 OWR and 0% solids.\nA total of 580 bbl of used mud was processed on location during the trial. Over 380 bbl of solids-free fluid was recovered with a density of 8.0 lb/gal fluid and 90/10 OWR. The cost for the RECLAIM process was approximately 15% below the cost of dilution to recondition the fluid, not including mixing, handling, trucking or disposal costs for the contaminated solids. Along with reduction in dilution cost, several intangible benefits were a by-product of the process.\nThese include :\n• The ability to recycle and re-use oil-base fluid.\n• Reduce the volume of slop-oil to be disposed, thereby reducing disposal costs.\n• Reduce offsite trucking.\n• Reduce temporary storage costs.\n• Reduce processing time for mud changeovers from 14.5 to 10.0 lb/gal.\nRECLAIM proved to be an economically viable, “fit-for-purpose” solution and demonstrated that the technology is applicable to the full range of oil-base mud used in this field.","- Open Access\n- Authors : Godwin Chukwuma Jacob Nmegbu , Emenike N.

Wami, and Bekee Bari-Agara\nDepartment of Petroleum Engineering, Rivers State University, Nigeria,\nAbstract The formation damage and fluid loss control potential of water based mud formulated with corn cob particles treated with sodium hydroxide as a partial replacement for polyanionic cellulose (PAC) has been studied. Core samples were obtained from a well in Nembe Creek in the Niger Delta at a depth of 5400 feet and stored in a humidity-oven. The core samples were invaded with the formulated mud using a liquid permeameter to force the mud through the core sample at certain pressure. Physio-chemical properties such as moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, hemicellulose and cellulose were analysed and results obtained showed that cellulose content increased in the cob when treated with sodium hydroxide solution. Porosity of core samples was between 16.65- 22% and permeability was up to 5,890mD. Fluid loss volume over time was highest at 12.61mls in mud sample with only corn cob particles as the fluid loss additive and was within6.5- 10.49mls in samples with different percentage combination of corn cob and PAC particles. Rheological properties such as apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, yield point and gel strength decreased as the percentage concentration of corn cob increased in the mud samples. These properties decreased gradually as temperature increased from 80OF to 200OF. Mud samples with 25%-75% and 50%-50% corn cob to PAC particles showed good rheological properties close to those of the standard mud. pH was slightly higher at 10.2 in mud sample with 100% of corn cob particles as fluid loss additive but lower at between 7.5-7.8 in samples where corn cobs were combined with PAC. Differences in initial and final permeability of the core samples were used to calculate the percentage damage on the core. The mud sample containing 100% corn cob as fluid loss additive caused more damage of 42.3% at 50 psi and 62% at 100 psi respectively but percentagedamage reduced in samples containing different combinations of PAC and corn cob particles.\nKeywords Corn cob, fluid loss, rheological properties, formation damage, percentage combination\nDrilling operations expose the producing formation to the drilling fluid and any solids and chemicals contained in that fluid. Some invasion of fluid filtrate and / or fine solids into the formation is inevitable. Damage to the formation can occur either near the wellbore face or deep into the rock during several processes such as drilling, coring, well completion, production, work over by physically plugging of pores by mud solids, rock wettability alteration, insoluble material precipitation in pore spaces, migration of fines into pore throats, introduction of an immobile phase and formation of an emulsion and blockage. On average, the cost\nof drilling fluid is 15%-18% of total well cost . However, a small marginal spend on drilling fluid can be offset by a superior fluid performance achieved which translates to cost savings and lowers total well cost.\nA drilling department can be adjudged to be successful when the well is drilled and cemented at a reduced cost without major problems. However, upon handing over to the production department, any fluids or solids invasion will affect production adversely and the same well could be seen as a failure.\nA good number of wells are completed without casing and perforations and in these completions, near wellbore damage is not by passed by perforations. Hence formation damage has to be minimized because avoiding it is not possible. The type of drilling fluid used is one of the most important factor that determine the success of a well drilling operation, the ability to minimize formation damage or seal permeable formation by reducing fluid passage into the formation. The drilling operations are however faced with lots of challenges and among them is the drilling fluid loss. Fluid loss which results in formation damage can be minimized using a wide range of additives in the drilling mud [2,3,4,5,6,7, 8]. The use of local materials is also advantageous in terms of cost [9, 10, 11]. Huge amount of money spent yearly by the industry to combat fluid loss and its after effect which in some cases leads to abandonment of expensive wells. Estimates put cost of fluid losses in the industry around $800 million yearly, and fluid loss products cost around $200 million . To combat this several cellulose based additives have been proposed but are expensive therefore the need to test other raw materials that can serve the same purpose become necessary. This work will evaluate the potential of formulated water based mud with corn cob particles to control fluid loss and formation damage.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nA. Equipment and InstrumentsB.

{"question":"How do I identify ultimate beneficial owners in real estate transactions? Necesito saber el proceso completo!","answer":"Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) must be identified when companies purchase real estate. A UBO is the individual who ultimately owns or benefits from a company, typically holding more than 25% of shares or voting rights. Real estate companies must: 1) Identify all UBOs when starting a business relationship 2) Conduct ID verification 3) Perform screening to ensure legitimacy 4) Assess each UBO's risk profile, including political exposure, adverse media coverage, and legal enforcement measures where necessary.","context":["Firms from across the real estate sector were fined £190,000+ in 2021 for failing to comply with money laundering regulations. In information publicly available from HMRC, with the highest fine a crippling £52,000.\nWith penalties being issued for failures in having the correct controls and procedures, internal controls, conducting due diligence and failing to apply for registration at the required time, the European Parliament warns of a number of ‘shortcomings in anti-money-laundering practices’ in the real estate sector.\nAs real estate continues to be an attractive avenue for money laundering criminals, we take a look at how real estate agents can spot some of the most common signs of financial crime in property transactions.\nIs the Source of Funds Suspicious?\nAs part of many property transactions, lenders and conveyancers will request copies of bank statements to ensure a legitimate source of funds.\nAs part of Money Laundering Regulations, you must scrutinise these documents to ensure they are consistent with what you know about the client. Large deposits can be a warning sign of money laundering.\nOf course, in some cases, these large deposits may be a gift from family, inheritance or from other legitimate sources which can be verified through further evidence to support this such as bank statements or other documents confirming its source.\nIn cases where cash is being used, identifying where these funds have come from becomes more difficult. Bank statements showing large amounts of withdrawals don’t provide sufficient information about its source. In any case where the source of funds is suspicious or can’t be vetted satisfactorily, ask yourself if you’re suspicious of money laundering or other financial criminal activity based on the evidence you have and what you know about the client.\nIf the answer is yes, firms are obligated to raise a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with the National Crime Agency to alert law enforcement to potential instances of money laundering or terrorist financing.\nIs there a Reluctance to Provide Proof of a Legitimate Source of Funds?\nSimilarly, a reluctance to provide proof or further documentation to prove the legitimate source of funds should set alarm bells ringing. Legitimate clients should be able to supply a complete overview of the source of funds to prove its legitimacy.\nA reticence to supply such evidence is suspicious and should be treated as a potential money laundering or financial crime risk. Once again, a SAR should be raised with the National Crime Agency to investigate further.\nIs the Buyer Subject to Sanctions?\nRecent events have placed a more rigorous spotlight on sanctions than ever before. The invasion in Ukraine has led to significant sanctions on Russia from governments across the globe.\nWith lists of individuals associated with Putin’s regime being targeted as part of the latest wave of Russian sanctions, real estate firms must be checking transactions and the parties involved against global sanctions lists to ensure an individual or company seeking to acquire real estate isn’t a risk to UK security or international peace, or a known proponent of terrorism.\nThe location of the buyer as well as the individuals themselves and their known associates must be verified against constantly changing sanctions lists and requirements.\nThese restrictive measures are put in place to fulfil a range of purposes. In the UK, these include complying with UN and other international obligations, supporting foreign policy and national security objectives, as well as maintaining international peace and security, and preventing terrorism.\nCan you Identify all Ultimate Beneficial Owners?\nIn cases where companies are purchasing real estate, it is key that the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (or UBO) is identified and screened. A UBO is the individual (or individuals) who ultimately owns or benefits from a company. The UBO is not always directly known as the owner and may hold a significant % of shares or voting rights in the company (usually more than 25%).\nStructuring businesses in this way is not illegal, but is often used for covert criminal activities and money laundering due to the complex networks of companies created to mask its true ownership.\nReal estate companies and those involved in property transactions must identify the UBOs of each entity at the time they start a business relationship with them. Once identified, ID verification and further screening must be undertaken to ensure the legitimacy of each UBO.\nDepending on the situation and associated risk at hand, checks may also assess each UBO’s individual risk profile including political exposure, adverse media coverage and legal enforcement measures that could contribute to risk.\nIs the Client Politically Exposed?\nWhile not always a certain indicator of money laundering activities, a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is often at higher risk of involvement in money laundering and/or terrorist financing due to their position in the public domain.\nMPs, Heads of State, Councillors and those appointed to prominent public functions are all considered to be politically exposed. This extends to their family and close business associates too.\nAs part of FCA guidance, if a buyer is identified to be a PEP, firms must “have in place appropriate risk-management systems and procedures to determine whether a customer or the beneficial owner of a customer is a PEP (or a family member or a known close associate of a PEP) and to manage the risks arising from the firm’s relationship with those customers.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:36f4b043-fead-40b6-8130-3436252d2d2a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the differences between intervention intensification strategies in the Problem Solving process compared to moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3 in RTI? Please outline the specific modifications in each approach.","answer":"In the Problem Solving process, intervention intensification involves three basic strategies: reducing group size, increasing intervention time, and narrowing the lesson focus. These can be used individually or combined. In contrast, moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3 in RTI involves more comprehensive changes: group size is reduced from 4-6 students to 2-3 students or individual instruction, session frequency increases to daily support with either one 60-minute session or two 30-minute sessions (compared to Tier 2's 30-45 minute sessions 3-4 times per week), and progress monitoring frequency increases to at least weekly or 2-3 times per week (versus every two weeks in Tier 2). Both approaches maintain their core instruction while adding these intensive supports.","context":["Volusia County Schools Problem Solving process is a data driven process that assists students, families and teachers in seeking positive solutions for all students. The primary goal of the PST is to support teachers and parents by generating effective research-based academic and behavioral strategies for individual targeted students. In addition, Problem Solving Teams can use school-wide and class-wide data to monitor the success and difficulties of groups of students and can offer academic and behavioral interventions to be applied to class or school- wide issues.\nWithin this problem-solving model, teams follow the PAIR format. PAIR stands for: problem identification, analysis of the problem, intervention implementation, and response to intervention.\nProblem Identification- occurs when the team identifies in objective and measurable terms what is expected and what the student can do (e.g., Expected – Observation = Problem). For example, a third-grade student whose oral reading rate near the end of the school year is 58 words correct per minute (wcpm) with the end of the year expectation being 100 wcpm. Thus, the expectation (100wcpm) – observation (58wcpm) equals the problem (42wcpm). Therefore, the problem is that the student is reading 42 words fewer per minute than what is expected.\nAnalysis of the Problem- is intended to determine why the problem is occurring. Thus, using the above example, why is the student reading 42 words fewer per minute than what is expected. During this step, the relevant information known about the problem is considered, potential hypotheses about the possible causes of the problem are generated, and information is gathered to confirm or disconfirm the hypotheses.\nThe domains assessed for information to analyze the problem are instruction, curriculum, environment, and learner (ICEL). Some of the questions asked are – \"Has the child received instruction in the target skill?\" (Instruction), \"Does the curriculum contain the target skill?\" (Curriculum), and \"Does the environment support the acquisition of the skill?\" (Environment). Specifically, the analysis of the problem phase includes:\n- Gaining a clear understanding of the causes (functions) of the problem.\n- Determining if the problem is a skill deficit or performance deficit.\n- Development of hypotheses as to why the problem is occurring.\n- Identifying if the problem is Instructional, Curriculum, Environmental, or Learner (ICEL) related?\n- Identifying relevant obstacles.\n- Developing a goal to address the problem (observable and measurable).\nOften, this is not a linear process. Consideration of known information/data, possible causes, and unknown information happens nearly simultaneously. Hypothesis generation involves the balancing of known information, possible causes, and gathering of unknown information in an ongoing process until a hypothesis with a high likelihood of correctness is derived.\nIntervention Implementation- occurs once the problem has been defined and analyzed. The goal is to take the information gathered through problem analysis and utilize it to develop an instructional plan that matches the identified student need. This is accomplished through intervention design and establishing a goal so the team can identify when the child has learned the desired skill/concept. A goal should be attainable and specific. An example is as follows:\nIn 10 weeks, Student will read aloud a 2nd grade level passage from DIBELS Next ORF OPM at 75 words read correctly in 1 minute with at least 97% accuracy.\nThis goal is very specific in terms of time, skill, and level of accuracy. The identified missing skills are targeted for explicit instruction within a supported learning environment.\nAn intervention should be purposeful, planned and grounded in data. It is about making decisions about alterable variables within instruction, curriculum and the environment. Problem Solving teams focus on those modifications in these areas that will directly impact or alter the targeted behavior. Instructional strategies that are based on the nature of the defined problem and yield the most likelihood for success are selected.\nResponse to Intervention- requires ongoing progress monitoring, which is a methodology for measuring the effectiveness of an intervention. In order to design an intervention, the problem must have been analyzed adequately. For problem analysis to have occurred, the problem must have been accurately defined. So, intervention progress monitoring should not occur unless the first three steps of problem solving have been conducted.\nSince we need to make decisions quickly if our interventions are not delivering the desired results, it is necessary we gather this information frequently. Thus, key features of the instrumentation used to collect these data are that they can be administered frequently and are sensitive to small changes in behavior.\nAlso important, this information must be plotted on a graph so that trends in student performance can be visualized. That is, we must be able to see where we're headed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of instructional efforts. Data are used to make important decisions about whether to continue the intervention, modify it, or change it completely.\nIf an intervention is not producing the desired results, a first step is to evaluate whether the intervention plan is being implemented as designed. If not, adjustments are made to ensure that it is. If the treatment integrity has been verified, all the previous problem-solving steps should be reviewed. A mistake may have been made in problem identification, problem analysis, or intervention design.\nIf an intervention is not producing the desired results it does not necessarily mean that it is the wrong intervention. It may be the right intervention, but the intensity needs to be increased. Three basic ways to increase the intensity of an intervention are: 1) Reduce the size of the group; 2) Increase the amount of time that the intervention is delivered; and 3) narrow the focus of the lesson. These strategies for intensification may be used individually or in combination.\nProblem solving is a self-correcting methodology dependent upon instructional decisions made using reliable data collected frequently.","Response to Intervention: A General Overview\nResponse to Intervention (RTI) is a 3-tiered assessment, identification, intervention, and monitoring framework that provides information about student academic and behavioral success. The impetus behind RTI is to identify struggling learners before they fail, and to provide them with appropriate, scientifically research-based interventions, in order to accelerate their learning. Identification, scientifically research-based interventions, and progress monitoring provide educators with information related to the effectiveness of instruction, specific and targeted areas in need of more intense or frequent instruction, reduced referrals to special education, and individual student data for the creation of measurable goals and objectives.\nThe RTI process utilizes data-based decision making for the early identification of struggling students and monitoring of student progress. Universal screenings of students are usually conducted three times during the school year and provide educators with baseline data (fall screening) and student progress data (winter and spring screenings). These screenings typically focus on those foundational areas that research has shown to best predict success. For example, reading screenings often focus on accuracy, rate, and comprehension while math screenings focus on computation and concepts. Educators analyze screening results, along with other available data, to determine if students require more intense and more frequent instruction than what is provided in the regular classroom. Students are then placed on a tier depending upon the data analysis results.\nTier 1: Universal Instruction and Intervention\nTier 1 consists of high quality core instruction in the regular classroom. Instruction of the curriculum is presented with fidelity by a qualified educator, the classroom teacher. All students should have access to the core curriculum. Instruction at Tier 1 is either whole class or in flexible groups.\nSome students in Tier 1 may need additional supports. These are typically categorized under “best teaching practices” and include:\n- Differentiating Instruction\n- Providing task clarity\n- Increasing student engagement\n- Providing mini lessons on skill deficits\n- Change pacing\n- Providing and/or changing corrective feedback\nStudent progress is monitored with common formative and summative assessments as well as with universal screening data. Students who receive Tier 1 supports may be progress monitored every two weeks, and don’t respond to Tier 1 interventions, based upon progress monitoring data eight weeks are recommended for Tier 2 intervention.\nTier 2: Targeted Instruction and Intervention\nStudents on Tier 2 are provided with more intense and frequent interventions in addition to their Tier 1 instruction and interventions. Again, these interventions are in addition to not in place of Tier 1 instruction and support. Therefore, Tier 2 services supplement the instruction and interventions provided by the core curriculum and classroom teacher. Tier 2 interventions are targeted in order to try to determine and remediate the root cause of the learning problem. Interventions are strategic and may be based upon a brief diagnostic assessment.\nThose students in Tier 2 receive targeted interventions in small groups 4 to 6 students who need to learn the same skill or who would benefit from the type of teaching strategy being used. It is possible for a classroom teacher, reading or math specialist, or paraprofessional to provide targeted Tier 2 interventions. These groups generally meet for 30 to 45 minutes sessions (more intense) 3 to 4 times per week (more frequent). It is important to keep in mind that intervention time has to be built in to the students’ day. Taking students out of language arts, reading, or math to provide targeted instruction and interventions will not be beneficial because students will miss out on core instruction. To help with this, many schools construct their schedules with specific grade level intervention times built into the day.\nStudents take mini-assessments, often called probes, at least every two weeks or, ideally, weekly in order to determine how well they are responding to Tier 2 instruction and interventions. Probes or mini-assessments are typically curriculum-based measures that have grade level research-based benchmarks identifying typical student performance levels by time of year. Progress monitoring provides teachers data on how well students are responding to targeted instruction and interventions in relation to their personal baseline performance. It also allows educators to have data in regard to where individual students are in relation to where they need to be in order to return to Tier 1. Targeted instruction, intervention, and progress monitoring typically last for 8 to 10 weeks. At that time, the grade level RTI team analyzes student progress monitoring data to determine if the student should return to Tier 1, continue on Tier 2 with the same services, continue on Tier 2 with different services, or move to Tier 3 for more intensive or individualized interventions.\nTier 3: Intensive and Individualized Interventions\nStudents on Tier 3 require additional supports above and beyond those provided at the Tier 2 level. Tier 3 interventions include daily support provided in either one 60 minute session or two 30 minute sessions. Again, these services supplement the core curriculum not replace it. Interventions at this level are provided in even smaller groups (two or three students) or individually, with students being grouped by the same skills deficit.\nIn addition to increasing frequency and intensity of instruction, frequency of progress monitoring is also increased as part of Tier 3. At this level, data collection, in the form of mini assessments or probes, occurs at least weekly and quite often 2 to 3 times per week. The increased frequency of progress monitoring at Tier 3 allows educators to quickly determine intervention success and provides them with the opportunity to rapidly respond to lack of progress by fine tuning and adjusting instruction and intervention based upon up to date student data. However, valid progress monitoring data typically requires 8 to 10 data points before an accurate trend can be established and a decision confidently made. With this in mind, Tier 3 intensive instruction and progress monitoring usually continue for up to 8 weeks before a major decision is made.\nWhat happens as a result of Tier 3 intensive interventions depends upon how well the student responds to intensive interventions as measured by their progress monitoring data. If students make progress they can be moved to Tier 2 or they can continue receiving Tier 3 support. If students don’t display a positive response to intervention at this level they are then referred to special education for a comprehensive evaluation.\nSpecial Education Referral and Comprehensive Evaluations\nIt is important to keep in mind that a parent, guardian, teacher, counselor, pediatrician, or other care-giver can make a referral to special education at any point during the RTI process. After a referral is made the student will continue to receive RTI services and progress monitoring will continue.\nIn the RTI framework, a comprehensive evaluation may consist of an analysis of the student’s progress monitoring data in addition to or in place of more traditional and standardized ability, achievement, and processing evaluations. Having a student receive targeted interventions and monitoring his/her progress to those interventions frequently provides Individual Education Planning (IEP) teams with enough information to make a determination of eligibility and develop appropriate and measurable goals and objectives. However, sometimes the IEP team has additional questions or concerns and other evaluations will be conducted. These evaluations will provide the team with the necessary diagnostic and prescriptive information needed for eligibility determination and IEP development.\nAs a multi-tiered assessment, identification, intervention, and monitoring framework, Response to Intervention is an extremely useful data-based decision-making system. Educators are able to use it as a problem solving approach to breach the gap between a student’s current or baseline, level of performance and their expected level of performance or goal. As such, it takes much of the emphasis off of the “failure” of the student and puts the onus on professional educators to use research-based practices in the remediation of below expected levels of student performance. With this model, educators don’t wait for students to fail before being concerned: Instead, they use assessment data to identify gaps in knowledge, and then they use research validated interventions to fill these gaps and accelerate student learning. Therefore, Response to Intervention should not be looked at as a special education identification process or assessment (although it can certainly serve in those capacities); rather, RTI should be viewed as the scientific method that supplements and supports the art of teaching.\nDr. David Pino has worked in education for the last 20 years as a school psychologist, consultant, advocate, and adjunct professor. In that time he has used his expertise in the areas of learning disabilities, behavior assessment and management, special education, and IEP development to help children and families access appropriate services and succeed in school. David Pino is currently functioning as an education advocate and assists families through the IEP process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:59fe23e8-6d9e-4ff7-913f-68052eaadf8c>","<urn:uuid:fa071ec9-b7bf-4c7f-a5d0-1b1ec03b591e>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do the religious dietary restrictions compare between Roman Catholics and Chinese Muslims (Hui)?","answer":"Roman Catholics and Chinese Muslims (Hui) have different dietary restrictions. Catholics believe all foods are given by God for good and are only required to fast on specific Holy Days (like Lent and Good Friday), with the sick being exempt from fasting. The Hui Muslims have stricter dietary restrictions - they cannot eat pork or fierce animals and their blood, and any permitted meats must be prepared in a special way. Additionally, while Catholics have no restrictions on alcohol, Hui Muslims are prohibited from drinking wines, though they are encouraged to enjoy tea.","context":["Historical Preparation and appreciation of food has been developed to the highest level in the country of China. Cooking is considered an art in Chinese culture whereas all other philosophies consider it a craft. The two main philosophies of the Chinese culture are Confucianism and Taoism. Both influenced China’s history and the Culinary Arts. Confucianism stressed the importance of enjoyment of life involving the art of cooking. If you have a gathering, there must be food. If there is not the gathering is considered incomplete and improper.\nConfucius loved and respected the art of cooking. He established table etiquette and culinary standards. Most of which are still considered to be the standards of today. The cutting foods into small pieces during preparation and not at the table is exclusive to the Chinese culture. The use of knives at a Chinese dinner is considered “offensive. ” Taoism was responsible for establishing the hygienic parts of foods and cooking. The main part of this philosophy was for the nourishment of the body and the search for longevity.\n(Long life) In comparison to Confucianists who were interested in the taste, texture and appearance, Taoists concentrated on the life-giving aspects of various foods The Chinese have investigated many plants, roots, fungi, herbs and seeds to discover life giving ingredients. They discovered that many items had medicinal value such as Ginger which is beneficial to sooth stomache aches. They also found out that by improper cooking the nutritional value could be destroyed. Unlike the majority of eastern cuisines most Chinese dishes are low-calorie and low-fat.\nFood is cooked using poly-unsaturated oils, and milk, cream, butter and cheese are not a. part of the daily diet. Cultural Factors Our countries cuisine is deeply enriched with China’s history. If you visit a Chinese restaurant or a Chinese home you will see that culinary manners and etiquette are extremely important and a main factor of dining. When you sit down to eat, you must respect all sitting with you, whether they are elderly, children or disabled people. Chinese people stress the factor of presenting the best food first to the senior members of the table and has been done this way for many years.\nMost Chinese hosts are pleasant and hospitable you must show them respect. Sometimes before beginning dinner, your host may say a few words of greeting. Make sure you do not start to eat until they have done so otherwise it is seen as rude. On Chopsticks Chopstick’s are a miracle among the creations of Chinese food culture. This utensil helps the dinner to really relish his or her food. Once you have mastered how to use chopsticks, they will help you to savour your food and really enjoy the flavour. An important part of a Chinese person’s life is their birthdays.\nWhen a person is young, he or she is most likely to eat noodles before his birthday which indicate Longevity and Immortality. On a person’s wedding day, it is traditionary to serve Chinese dates, peanuts and chestnuts together which ensures that the couple will soon have a baby. For most Chinese people, upon returning home after a long trip is significant and sp there are also food customs associated with this. The person returning home is greeted with noodles and a person who is about to farewell family and friends is offered dumplings.\nThere are superstitions associated with chopsticks. Eg, If you find an uneven pair of Chopsticks at your table setting, it means you are going to miss a boat, plane or train. They believe that dropping chopsticks will also bring bad luck. Crossed chopsticks are, however, permissible in a certain restaurants. The waiter will cross them to show that your bill has been settled and you can do the same to show the waiter that you have finished you meal and are ready to pay the bill.\nThe reason Chinese people use chopsticks as their cutlery instead if a knife and a fork is because according to Confucius, a Knife and a Fork represent a style of violence, as they resemble cold weapons which is the complete opposite of Conuficius’ whole philosophy of gentleness and compassion. Geographical Located in Southeast Asia along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, China is the world’s third largest country, after Russia and Canada, with an area of 9. 6 million square kilometres and a coastline of 18,000 kilometres.\nEight Regional Variations- Chinese cuisine has many different areas but the most public and well known by the Chinese population are named the “Eight Cuisines”. These are; Shangdong Cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Guangdong Cuisine, Fujian Cuisine , Jiangsu Cuisine, Zhejiang Cuisine, Hunan Cuisine, and Anhui Cuisine. The main factors that form an area are very detailed, include history, cooking styles, climate, resources, geography and life styles. Sometimes cuisines from different regions are so differently distinctive even though the two areas are geographical neighbours! Religious.\nDifferent Religions have different dietary needs according to their rules and geographical zones. Below is one of the main Religions that require special foods. Hui Cuisine- Muslim The Hui ethnic group contains the most Muslims. This influences the cuisine greatly and makes it the representative of the Chinese Muslim food. Their diet doesn’t involve pig meat or fierce animals and their blood. But the meats that are allowed and which have been prepared under the special way can be made into delicious dishes. Muslims are not allowed to smoke or drink wines, but encouraged to enjoy tea.\nWhen Muslims have guests visiting, they would welcome them with tea together with fruits and fried cakes. The tea cup can include there sugar, white sugar, Chinese wolfberry, sesame, red Chinese date, longan, and raisins. All of which are rich in nutrition. There are four main characteristics of Hui Cuisine. Most of the main foods are made of flour instead of rice. Hui people like eating beef and mutton which are good for the appetite and are nourishing to the body. One of the typical meals for Hui People is roast mutton. Sociological aspects.\nFood plays an extremely important part when it comes to a Chinese person’s social functions. As Confucius said something along the lines of, “People need to be happy and relaxed, and when they are with friends and eating, they will be happy”. So if your function is laden with foods for your guests it is very good and polite. If you have a gathering with friends and family and don’t prepare food for your guests to eat, it is considered extremely rude and inappropriate. Traditional foods or ingredients and any other related information When cooking, the Chinese use a lot of herbs and spices to enrich their foods.\nThe main foods that are eaten in China are; Rice, Noodles, Chicken, Dumplings, Sweet Corn, Vegetables, Wheat, Fish (Including crayfish etc), Pork (Although not for the Muslims), Beef, and BBQ Lamb. Chinese cooking makes use of quick stir fry at high temperature to seal in the flavor of the food and it also ensures that the food is not too unhealthy. Certain foods are Traditional to eat at certain times of the Year, for example, Chinese New Year which plays a very big part in Chinese culture and life.\nHere are a list of foods commonly found being cooked and eaten at Chinese New Year; * Lotus seed – signify having many male offspring * Ginkgo nut – represents silver ingots * Black moss seaweed – is a homonym for exceeding in wealth * Dried bean curd is another homonym for fulfilment of wealth and happiness * Bamboo shoots – is a term which sounds like “wishing that everything would be well” * Fresh bean curd or tofu is not included as it is white and unlucky for New Year as the color signifies death and misfortune.\n* Platters of fresh fruit (tangerines and oranges symbolize good luck and wealth) When cooking, Chinese people mainly use Woks, Steamers, and Boilers.\n1. http://www. chinastyle. cn/cuisine-drink/cuisines/\n2. http://asiarecipe. com/chiculture. html\n3. http://asiarecipe. com/chicookinghistory. html\n4. http://www. nicemeal. com/foodculture/\n5. http://www. educ. uvic. ca/faculty/mroth/438/CHINA/traditional_foods. html\n6. http://www. thetasteofasia. com/traditional_foods. asp.","Presentation on theme: \"Selected Religious-Cultural Views on Health Issues Many denominations own and operate health care facilities and make significant financial contributions.\"— Presentation transcript:\nSelected Religious-Cultural Views on Health Issues Many denominations own and operate health care facilities and make significant financial contributions to health care.

{"question":"Can you explain how arbitration survival works after contract termination, and what are the key aspects of award execution under Indian law kya hai?","answer":"The arbitration clause survives even if the contract is terminated. This is because it is considered a collateral term related to dispute resolution, not performance. According to Section 16(1) of the Arbitration Act, an arbitration clause must be treated as independent from other contract terms, and contract invalidity does not automatically invalidate the arbitration clause. Regarding award execution, it is governed by Section 36 of the Act, which states that arbitral awards can be executed as court decrees once the challenge period expires or challenges are dismissed. The Supreme Court has clarified that awards can be executed in any court where assets are located, without needing a transfer of decree from one court to another.","context":["2007 (5) SCC 692\nThe Petitioner (P) and Respondent (R) entered into an agreement with R agreeing to purchase from the P certain amount of of iron-ore fines at a definite price. Clause 17 of the agreement provided that if no settlement can be reached by negotiation and mutual agreement, the matter in dispute would be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Hong Kong in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any other statutory modification, enactment or amendment thereof for the time being in force.\nP alleged that R failed to take delivery of the cargo and that in view of such breach, the petitioner incurred losses and other costs. Therefore, R is now liable to pay a definite sum. The refusal by R to pay the sum led to dispute and P invoked the arbitration agreement and furnished a panel of three names to enable R to give concurrence for appointment of any one of them as the sole arbitrator. R again refused to comply. This gave rise to the filing of application under Section 11(5) of the Act, seeking appointment of the sole arbitrator.\n- Part I of the Act applies only where the place of arbitration is in India. As place of arbitration is Hong Kong, outside India, the provisions in Part I including Section 11 of the Act are inapplicable and this Court has no jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator. It is the law of arbitration, as in force in Hong Kong, which will govern the arbitration.\n- Since, the contract was abrogated by mutual agreement, the contract came to an end. With this the arbitration agreement which forms part of the contract, also came to an end.\n- Whether an arbitration clause comes to an end, if the contract containing such arbitration agreement, was abrogated?\n- Whether Section 11 of the Act is inapplicable in regard to the arbitrations which are to take place outside India?\n- Whether the appointment of the Arbitrator and the reference arbitration are governed by the laws in force in Hong Kong and not by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996?\n(w.r.t 1st Contention of the Respondent) The Court referred to the judgment in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. and held that R’s contention cannot be sustained.\nThe relevant para of the judgement in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. are cited below-\nSub-section (2) of Section 2 provides that Part I would apply where the place of arbitration is in India. To be immediately noted, that it is not providing that Part I shall not apply where the place of arbitration is not in India. It is also not providing that Part I will “only” apply where the place of arbitration is in India.\nBy omitting to provide that Part I will not apply to international commercial arbitrations which take place outside India the effect would be that Part I would also apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India.\nIn cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of India provisions of Part I would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. In that case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to or excluded by that law or rules will not apply.\n(w.r.t 2nd contention of the Respondent): An arbitration clause is a collateral term in the contract, which relates to resolution disputes, and not performance. Even if the performance of the contract comes to an end on account of repudiation, frustration or breach of contract, the arbitration agreement would survive for the purpose of resolution of disputes arising under or in connection with the contract. Sub-section (1) of Section 16 of the Act makes it clear that while considering any objection with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, an arbitration clause which forms part of the contract, has to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and a decision that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. The first contention is, therefore, liable to be rejected.\nCONCLUSION: An independent arbitrator may be appointed as the sole Arbitrator, keeping in view Sub-section (9) of Section 11 which provides that in the case of appointment of a sole arbitrator in an international commercial arbitration, the Chief Justice of India or his designate may appoint an arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationality of the parties if the parties belong to different nationalities.","November 9, 2023\nArbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) that allows parties to settle their disputes or claims without resorting to litigation. Arbitration is governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in India, which is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. One of the key aspects of arbitration is the arbitral award, which is the final and binding outcome of the arbitral process.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, of 1996 does not provide a clear definition of “award” in its provisions. However, it can be inferred from the context that an award is the final decision or determination of a dispute or claim that has been submitted for arbitration by the parties. The award can either be monetary or non-financial, such as a cessation of a particular act or an addition of employment. The award can also be interim or final, depending on whether it resolves some or all of the issues in dispute.\nThe jurisdictional issues related to the award are addressed in Section 42 of the Act, which states that “Not withstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court.”This means that once an application related to an arbitration agreement is made in a court,that court will have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of that agreement and the arbitration proceedings. This provision is intended to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting decisions by different courts. However, this provision does not apply to execution applications when it comes to the enforcement of an award through its execution.\nThe execution of an award is the process of giving effect to the award by ensuring that the party who has won the award receives what they are entitled to. The execution of an award can be done either voluntarily by the losing party or compulsorily by the intervention of a court. The execution of an award is governed by Section 36 of the Act, which states that “Where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, or such application having been made, it has been refused, the award shall been forced under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) in the same manner as if it were a decree of the Court. ”This means that an arbitral award can be executed as a decree of a court after the expiry of the time limit for challenging the award or after the dismissal of such challenge.\nHowever, unlike Section 42, Section 36 does not specify which court will have jurisdiction to execute the award. This issue was clarified by the Supreme Court in Sundaram Finance Ltd. v. Abdul Samad, where it held that an arbitral award can be filed for execution in any court whereas sets are located, irrespective of which court passed the award or decree. This decision was reiterated by the Allahabad High Court in Cheran Properties Ltd v. Kasturi and Sons Ltd, where it held that there is no need to obtain a transfer of decree from one court to another for executing an arbitral award. It is important to note that Section 32 of the Act states that arbitral proceedings stand terminated by the final arbitral award, and execution can only be sought after the final award is rendered. Therefore, an execution application can be filed by an award holder before any Indian court where the award is enforceable, without the need to obtain a transfer of decree from the court that passed the award or decree.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 provides a comprehensive framework for arbitration in India. It covers various aspects such as definition, jurisdiction, and execution of arbitral awards. The primary goal of the Act is to promote arbitration as a speedy and effective mode of dispute resolution. It also aims to ensure minimal judicial intervention and maximum party autonomy. Furthermore, the Act seeks to align Indian arbitration laws with international standards and best practices."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:80fe2757-b593-4133-a67c-245d1ed2e0a3>","<urn:uuid:a6546db7-80b1-4933-bee9-560e385639db>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the combat weight of the MLI-84M with CARDOM mortar compared to the baseline BTR-4?","answer":"The MLI-84M with CARDOM mortar weighs approximately 17 tonnes in battle-ready condition, while the baseline BTR-4 also has a combat weight of 17 tons (which can increase to 19.30 tons with a GROM weapons station).","context":["An un-silhouetted, but low quality rendering from the patent of the MLI-84M with a CARDOM mortar. Some internal details can be seen.\nOn the 25th of September, 2015, Pro Optica S.A. and MFA S.A. Mizil, two prominent Romanian defense companies, filed a patent for a new variant of the MLI-84M. The five inventors who were credited on the patent were Lespezeanu Ion, Jipa Vasile, Oțelea Traian, Șerbănescu Paul, and Mareș Marcel. This MLI-84M variant is equipped with a 120mm mortar and carries some unique features. There is no real name given to this variant, however, MFA’s official website has it listed under “Future Military products”, but the link leads to a couple of images of the MLVM variant with a 120mm mortar, a MLVM variant which MFA has deemed as one of their “Past Military products”.\nMLVM armed with a domestic 120mm M1982 mortar. The newly discovered 120mm mortar armed MLI-84M variant is likely the spiritual successor of this vehicle. Image source: mfa.ro\nMFA’s website refers to it as “120mm Mortar on MLI-84M chassis” and the patent refers to it as ‘Mașina de Luptă cu Sistem de Armament Tip Aruncator Calibru 120mm, Integrat’ which translates in English to ‘Fighting Vehicle with a 120mm Caliber Mortar Type Armament System’.\nThe purpose of this vehicle is to support ground forces directly by ensuring the annihilation and neutralization of enemy personnel, equipment, and positions using its 120mm mortar. In addition, the invention brings an increase of firepower, precision, mobility, and modularity. Presumably, compared to the 120mm mortar carrying MLVM variant which it may or may not be replacing.\nEarliest mention known mention of the MLI-84M mortar variant is during the Cincu 2004 test and trials. MFA showed off the design of the vehicle. Some time before 2015, MFA was negotiating with the Romanian Ministry of National Defence to equip the Forțele Terestre Române (Romanian Land Forces) with MLI-84M mortar variants between 2015-2017. It appears such a thing has not happened. So far, whether the vehicle design has been built, still in development, or the project was scrapped entirely is unknown.\nAn image taken during Cincu 2004 showing boards with supposed drawings of the MLI-84M mortar variant. Due to poor image quality, the drawings can not be properly seen. A Zimbru 2000 and an MLVM mortar variant (possibly modernized), presumably being trialed, can be seen on the left side of the boards. Source: MFA\nThe vehicle is based on the MLI-84M standard which itself is based off the MLI-84, a licensed Romanian BMP-1 copy with a slightly modified design. Whether the 120mm mortar armed MLI-84M variant is or will be converted from the MLI-84M or MLI-84 is unknown, but it is likely the latter due to MLI-84s being mass converted into MLI-84Ms and its variants.\nAlternatively, according to unverified sources, the MLI-84M mortar variant will be based on the Obuzierul autopropulsat românesc, Model 1989, a Romanian version of the 2S1 Gvozdika. The Model 89’s hull is based off the MLI-84 and 42 Model 89s are in storage since the 2000’s which makes them a prime candidate for conversion.\nThis variant most definitely retains the same 400 hp, 2,200 rpm, 6 cylinder, 4 stroke, turbocharged, C9 Caterpillar diesel engine as on the other MLI-84M variants. An exact weight is not given though it is likely around the 17 tonnes as on the other variants. This means an exact power to weight ratio cannot be determined. The mechanical transmission for the MLI-84M has five gears forward and one gear backwards.\nLength and width are expected to be the same as the other MLI-84M variants as they all have the same length of 7.32 meters and a width of 3.3 meters. However, since this variant uses a 120mm mortar instead of a remote weapons station, superstructure, or crane as on the other variants, the height will most likely differ.\nThe suspension is also likely similar if not the same as on the MLI-84M. The MLI-84M’s suspension consists of drive gears at the front, three return rollers on each side, six road wheels on each side connected to torsion bars, and the idler wheels at the rear. Hydraulic shock absorbers with bilateral action are installed on each side on the first, second, and sixth road wheels.\nAs on the other MLI-84M variants, a single driver controls the vehicle.\nAn illustration from the patent of the 120mm mortar being used on the MLI-84M mortar variant.\nThere is no information about the 120mm mortar itself listed on the patent. However, from what the illustrations of the 120mm mortar show, it is identified as the Israeli 120mm CARDOM mortar manufactured by Soltam Systems (now owned by Elbit Systems). It is currently not known whether Romania has acquired the CARDOM mortar, is in the process to do so, or if negotiations have ended.\nCARDOM 120mm/81mm recoil mortar system being marketed in Brazil by Elbit Systems’ Brazilian subsidiary, ARES. Image source: Thai Military and Asian Region blog\nAccording to Elbit Systems, the CARDOM is an autonomous and computerized 120mm recoil mortar system which fits with NATO standards. The state-of-the-art fire control system combines an ‘Inertial Navigation System’ (INS) which automatically lays the CARDOM to the intended target via electrical drives and a ‘Battle Management System’ (BMS). The CARDOM is in service with the U.S. Army, Israeli Defence Force, and various other militaries. The 700 kg 120mm mortar is able to rotate 360 degrees with the rate of fire of 16 rounds per minute with a firing range of 7000 meters. A minimum of 2 crew members are required although 4 is recommended.\nThe 120mm CARDOM is likely operated by a crew of two since when the vehicle is on the move, only two foldable chairs for the mortar operators are drawn with the battery box (most likely to power the 120mm CARDOM) attached.\nA silhouette illustration from the patent of the foldable seats (shown unfolded) for the mortar crew. Number 28 points to the battery box.\nThe 120mm mortar armed MLI-84M variant will likely have an accessory identified as an anti-double load attachment at the end of the barrel. This is shown in the diagram of the wiring scheme of the fire control system of the 120mm CARDOM for this variant. This attachment prevents another mortar round from being loaded until the one previously loaded has fired in order to prevent combustion of the two mortar rounds.\nA diagram of the wiring scheme of the fire control system for the CARDOM on the MLI-84M. On the middle-right, an anti-double load attachment can be seen for the CARDOM.\nThe 120mm mortar has a certain degree of modularity. For example, it can be relatively easily removed from the vehicle and attached to the ground. It is mounted on a specially made holding frame and the interior side walls have been strengthened to effectively handle the recoil. The ammunition is stored laterally with the vehicle on each side of the CARDOM mortar.

This APC can be employed as a main fighting platform for rapid reaction and naval infantry forces. The vehicle can operate with a high degree of efficiency on a 24 hour basis, in various climatic conditions, on roads of all types (paved as well as unsurfaced, and also off -the-road), at free-air temperatures ranging from minus 40 to plus 55 degrees Centigrade.\nThe BTR-4 layout design -- which allows its fighting and troop compartments to be easily reconfigured without the need of rearranging the engine transmission block -- could be used as baseline configuration for a comprehensive family of armoured fighting vehicles.\nThe APC’s chassis has load carrying capability which not only allows for a broad variety of spinoff variants and AFV families to be designed on its basis, but also enables installation of appliqué armor protecting against small-caliber automatic gun fire. This APC fully conforms to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense’s operational requirements for future armored fighting vehicles in this category. In terms of its overall layout design, the BTR-4 APC is a far cry from any of the older modifications of the BTR series (BTR-60/70/80/90).\nThe vehicle is divided into three compartments, with the driving compartment in the front hull, the power pack compartment in the mid-center and the fighting and personnel compartments at the rear of the hull. The power pack compartment is located immediately behind the driver’s seat on its left, and it is linked to the troop compartment via a right-side passageway. The troop compartment in the rear hull has a two-part door (upper and lower parts which open outwards) for troop mount/dismount. The commander and driver can enter and exit the vehicle by side doors fitted with integral bullet-resistant windows. Like the commander’s and driver’s doors, the windscreen is of bulletproof glass-block construction, and it can be additionally protected with back folding armor screens. The baseline BTR-4 has combat weight of 17 tons (19.30 tons with a GROM weapons station), and with applique armor protection (against 30-mm gun fire) this can amount to 27 tons. The BTR-4 can carry a squad of eight personnel, in addition to its three-man crew.\nThis armored troop carrier can mount multipurpose above-hull weapons stations of various types, particularly the ones designed for lightweight armored fighting vehicles. The power pack consists of a two-stroke 3TD diesel engine developing 500 hp, integrated with an automatic hydrokinetic transmission, with options including a Deutz diesel generating 489 hp or 598 hp.\nThe BTR-4 can operate in dense dust environments, at ambient temperatures ranging from -40oC to +55oC. It has good cross-country capabilities, and is capable of a maximum speed of 110 km/p when riding on hardsurface roads and 10 km/p when afloat. The baseline BTR-4 design can be reconfigured for various applications, including: fire support vehicle, command vehicle, armored medical evacuation vehicle, self-propelled anti-aircraft gun system, reconnaissance and observation vehicle and recovery vehicle."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:81e136de-445c-47cb-a66d-d29d11c12afd>","<urn:uuid:86d184c6-427a-4283-a541-2a750e7d6f3c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Where natural pacemaker located in heart and what complications possible from artificial pacemaker?","answer":"The natural pacemaker (SA node) is located in the right atrium and spreads electrical activity through atrial walls.

The sinoatrial node (SA node) is the primary pacemaker and the atrioventricular node (AV node) is the secondary. The AV node is in a bundle of tissues on the border that separates the right atrium and the right ventricle.\nWhat are the 3 pacemakers of the heart?\nThere are three basic kinds of pacemakers:\n- Single chamber. One lead attaches to the upper or lower heart chamber.\n- Dual-chamber. Uses two leads, one for the upper and one for the lower chamber.\n- Biventricular pacemakers (used in cardiac resynchronization therapy).\nWhat is nature’s pacemaker?\nNatural pacemaker: The natural pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node, one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system, the system that controls the heart rate.\nDoes a pacemaker replace your heart?\nYour doctor may recommend a temporary pacemaker when you have a slow heartbeat (bradycardia) after a heart attack, surgery or medication overdose but your heartbeat is otherwise expected to recover. A pacemaker may be implanted permanently to correct a chronic slow or irregular heartbeat or to help treat heart failure.\nWhat is artificial pacemaker of heart *?\nAn electronic device that is implanted in the body to monitor heart rate and rhythm. It gives the heart electrical stimulation when it does not beat normally. It runs on batteries and has long, thin wires that connect it to the heart. Also called cardiac pacemaker and pacemaker.\nWhat happens if the heart’s natural pacemaker fails to fire?\nWhen something goes wrong with the sinoatrial node, you may develop a consistently slow heartbeat (sinus bradycardia) or the normal pacemaker activity may stop entirely (sinus arrest). If sinus arrest occurs, usually another area of the heart takes over pacemaker activity.\nWhere does a pacemaker go?\nA pacemaker insertion is the implantation of a small electronic device that is usually placed in the chest (just below the collarbone) to help regulate slow electrical problems with the heart. A pacemaker may be recommended toensure that the heartbeat does not slow to a dangerously low rate.\nWhat is the life expectancy of a person with a pacemaker?\nBaseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1: The median patient survival after pacemaker implantation was 101.9 months (approx. 8.5 years), at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years after implantation 65.6%, 44.8%, 30.8% and 21.4%, respectively, of patients were still alive.\nWhat can be used instead of a pacemaker?\nA defibrillator also shocks your heart if needed\nAn ICD is implanted similarly to a pacemaker and will detect irregular rhythms to give a life-saving shock.\nWhy can’t you raise your arm after pacemaker?\nDon’t raise your arm on the incision side above shoulder level or stretch your arm behind your back for as long as directed by your doctor. This gives the leads a chance to secure themselves inside your heart.\nDoes a pacemaker keep you alive?\nPacemakers are not resuscitative devices, and they will not keep a dying patient alive. Most dying patients become acidotic before cardiac arrest, which effectively renders a pacemaker nonfunctional, as under such conditions, the myocardium does not respond to the pacemaker’s discharges.\nHow do you avoid getting a pacemaker?\nYou need to be able to basically protect her against having slow heartbeats. So. So tacky Brady syndrome is a very common diagnosis.\nCan you drink with a pacemaker?\nAlthough you may not be aware of it, sedation can remain in your system for up to 24 hours and can cause you to be less alert then normal. If you have had sedation it is important that you do not drive, drink alcohol, operate machinery or sign legally binding documents within 24 hours of the procedure.\nCan I fly with a pacemaker?\nInform the TSA officer that you have an artificial knee, hip, other metal implant or a pacemaker, defibrillator or other internal medical device. You should not be screened by a walk-through metal detector if you have an internal medical device such as a pacemaker. Consult with your physician prior to flying.\nWhat are the signs of needing a pacemaker?\nWhat Are the Signs You Need a Pacemaker?\n- You Feel Extremely Fatigued. …\n- You Frequently Get Lightheaded or Dizzy. …\n- You Fainted, But You Don’t Know Why. …\n- You Have Palpitations or an Intense Pounding in Your Chest. …\n- You Have Chest Pain. …\n- You Are Short of Breath or Have Difficulty Breathing.\nCan you exercise with a pacemaker?\nModerate-to-vigorous exercise, such as aerobic activity and strength training, are safe for people with a pacemaker. Individuals who have been inactive and start moving get the biggest bang for their buck. Experts now say that any physical activity counts toward better health — even just a few minutes!\nCan you sleep on the same side as your pacemaker?\nYou may sleep on the same side as your pacemaker. Loose fitting tops may feel better.\nWhich sleeping position is best for your heart?\nThose who have had heart failure or other heart conditions should sleep on their right side whenever possible. Right-side sleeping lets the heart rest in place with help from the mediastinum, preventing the disruption of your heart’s electrical current.\nCan WiFi affect pacemakers?\nWireless transmissions from the antennae of phones available in the United States are a very small risk to ICDs and even less of a risk for pacemakers.","What is a pacemaker?\nA pacemaker is an implanted device that monitors your heartbeat and prevents your heart from beating too slowly. It consists of a box (‘pulse generator’) attached to one or two wires (‘leads’). The pulse generator is usually placed underneath the skin or muscle beneath your collarbone. The lead or leads pass inside the large veins of your chest from the generator to your heart. The leads transmit information about your heartbeat to the generator. If your heart beats too slowly the pacemaker sends out a tiny electrical impulse to ‘pace’ the heart, i.e. to make it beat at an appropriate speed. If your heart then speeds up again, this is detected by the pacemaker, which then stops pacing your heart.\nWhat does pacemaker implantation involve?\nA pacemaker is usually implanted under local anaesthetic; you can also have some sedation to make you feel sleepy and more relaxed. The procedure generally takes about an hour and is performed in a ‘cardiac catheterisation laboratory’. Your heart rhythm, blood pressure and the oxygen level in your blood are monitored continuously. The doctor puts local anaesthetic under the skin below your collar bone. The anaesthetic stings for a few seconds as it gets to work but the area rapidly goes numb. An incision about 3-4 cms long is made below the collarbone. The next stage of the procedure is for the doctor to find a vein through which the leads are passed to the heart. Once the leads are in the veins they can be positioned in the heart. This is not in any way uncomfortable although you may feel a few extra heart beats for a short period. Care is taken to find the ideal position for the lead or leads and you will hear numbers being called out, referring to measurements made through the leads. When the doctor is happy that the leads are in the best position, they are stitched in and a pocket is created to house the pulse generator. This pocket may be underneath the skin or deeper, under the muscle of the chest wall. Finally the incision is closed up with stitches. For the skin stitch some doctors use a dissolvable suture while others prefer a suture that is taken out at your doctor’s surgery after 7 days. You will be told which you have.\nCan complications occur?\nThis procedure cannot be performed without some element of risk; you need to understand the risks before you sign the consent form. It is important that you understand that these risks are potential and unpredictable. The majority of patients, however, have no problems. The potential risks are listed below for your information:\nPneumothorax (air leak around the lungs): this occurs in approximately 1 in 100 patients. The veins used to get the pacemaker wires to your heart lie very near to the lung. It is possible to nick the lung on the way past causing an air leak. Sometimes this resolves on its own. Occasionally a chest drain is needed; if so your stay in hospital may be delayed by several days.\nPericardial effusion (blood leak around the heart): this occurs in approximately 1 in 500 patients. When the wire is positioned in the heart it can cause a fluid collection around the outside of the heart. Sometimes this resolves on its own but occasionally a drain is needed; very rarely an operation is needed. If so your stay in hospital may be delayed by several days.\nInfection: this occurs in approximately 2 in 100 patients. Antibiotics are given routinely to help prevent this. In the unlikely event that the pacemaker does become infected, it will probably need to be removed and a new pacemaker implanted.\nHaematoma (severe bruising): this occurs in approximately 4 in 100 patients. Rarely this bruising may need drainage. Patients taking blood thinning drugs are more prone to haematoma formation.\nWire displacement: this occurs in approximately 2 in 100 patients. This causes the pacemaker to pace inappropriately. In most cases the wires need to be repositioned requiring further surgery.\nDeath: this is fortunately an extremely rare complication\nWhat to expect after pacemaker implantationYou can expect your shoulder and arm to be sore for a few days afterwards. Simple pain-killers like paracetamol are usually helpful. It is important to keep the arm and shoulder moving, to avoid a ‘frozen shoulder’; however you should be gentle and not use the arm for heavy lifting for a few weeks, until your first pacemaker check. Try not to lift your arm above shoulder height again until the first check. You should avoid getting the wound wet for about a week after the implant. The wound usually appears a little bruised for several days afterwards. Although the bruising may become more prominent after you go home, any discomfort and redness around the wound should get better rapidly. If you have concerns about the wound it is important that you contact us directly.\nFollow-up after pacemaker implantationAfter discharge from hospital you will need to be followed up regularly. The first visit is usually about six weeks after implant and usually every 9-12 months thereafter although there is some variation. At these visits your pacemaker is checked to make sure that it is working well and to make any adjustments necessary to the way it is programmed. This visit usually lasts about twenty minutes.\nWhat happens when the battery runs down?Many factors determine how long a pacemaker battery will last. Currently available generators typically last about 7-10 years under standard conditions. The pacemaker battery behaves in a predictable fashion. By following you up regularly we can determine accurately when the pacemaker generator will need replacing. The pacemaker will be functioning perfectly normally throughout this time and you will be readmitted in a planned fashion to replace the pacemaker generator. When the generator is replaced the procedure is similar to that of the original pacemaker implant although we aim to use the original leads and simply attach a new generator.\nIs there anything you should avoid with a pacemaker?In almost every respect life with a pacemaker is completely normal. Household appliances and mobile telephones do not interfere with your pacemaker’s function, although you should not keep your mobile telephone in a pocket directly over the pacemaker. You will receive a pacemaker card giving full information about your pacemaker. If you are flying you should hand this card to security to show you have a pacemaker and you will not have to go through the security gate. If you are concerned about interference from a particular piece of equipment at home or at work, ask your consultant or the cardiac physiologists in the pacemaker clinic.\nDriving after a pacemakerYou should not drive for one week after pacemaker implantation if you hold an ordinary (group 1) licence or six weeks if you hold a vocational (group 2) licence.

{"question":"What is the relationship between polo pony breeding history and modern gameplay positions, and how has this evolved since the 1890s?","answer":"The Polo Pony Stud Book Society, established in 1893, initially focused on breeding ponies specifically for polo, incorporating small pure blood native ponies to maintain height limits. This breeding foundation supports modern polo's specialized positions, where four players numbered one through four have distinct roles - Number One focuses on scoring, Two combines scoring with defense, Three is typically the team captain and best player, and Four is mainly defensive. The society's early emphasis on breeding 'a very valuable breed of animal which can be used for any purpose' aligns with current requirements for polo ponies, which must be versatile enough to perform these varied positional roles in matches where balls travel up to 110 miles per hour.","context":["The Polo Pony Stud Book Society was formed in a large tent in the Royal Agricultural Society’s show yard in Chester in 1893, 20 years later it was renamed the National Pony Society. In 1896, HRH the Prince of Wales became the first in a long line of Royal Patrons.\nAt the inaugural meeting in Chester the society’s aims were set out, that a society be formed for the improvement and encouragement of the breeding of high class Riding Ponies and that a Stud Book be formed for the registration of pedigrees and detailed descriptions of height and colour and that it be called the Polo Pony Stud Book.\nThe most basic rule was that stallions and mares were not to exceed 14.2hh and that all candidates for registration be inspected by appointed judges.\nThe importance of show classes to publicise the ponies and thus the society was recognised in 1893 and a resolution was passed to approach the Royal Dublin, the Islington and the Royal Agricultural shows to offer prizes at their shows for Riding Ponies from 13.2hh – 14.2hh.\nThe most important task of the society was to establish the Stud Book and in 1894 it was decided that this should be based on that of the Shire Horse Society. 500 copies were printed and were sold to members for the princely sum of 3 shillings or 10 shillings to non- members. It contained 57 stallions and 316 mares and their produce. The first ever entry and No 1 in the book is a 13.31/2 hh Arab stallion, Abdul Hamid IV, he was American bred and owned, which showed that the Stud Book was already recognised internationally. A huge variety of animals, ranging from small thoroughbreds to Welsh Cobs, Welsh Mountain Ponies and an Exmoor x thoroughbred mare, described as “ an extraordinary jumper “ were registered.\nAlthough the aim was to encourage the breeding of high class Riding Ponies, the preface of Vol 1 suggests that Polo was the foremost consideration at this point. The Earl of Harrington noted that the founding of the Stud book was a means of founding “ a very valuable breed of animal which can be used for any purpose “. As one of the difficulties in breeding Polo ponies was keeping the height within the limit, small pure blood native ponies were useful in this role, rather than being used as riding animals. Nonetheless, the importance of preserving and encouraging the improvement of the native stock became a constant theme of the society, one which continues to this day.\nIn June 1885 the society held it’s first show at Ranelagh Polo Club, London, as well as classes for animals likely to breed Riding Ponies there were classes for brood mares owned by tenant farmers. Entry fees ranged from 2 shillings ( 12 1/2p) to 10 shillings ( 50p), with fantastic prize money of £20.00, £15.00 or £10.00 depending on the class. The following year saw a 2 day show at Hurlingham, where classes were introduced for Welsh Mountain, Exmoor, Dartmoor and New Forest animals, suitable for breeding Polo or Riding Ponies.\nIn 1899 a major change took place when a separate section was introduced for Welsh Mountain and other native breeds of the Mountain and Moorland type. District committees were formed to establish standards and types and ponies were, in due course inspected for inclusion in the Stud Book. Volume VI, for the first time included separate sections for, Dartmoor, Exmoor, Fell, New Forest, North Wales, South Wales and Highland ponies. Lord Arthur Cecil expounded the importance of using native breeds to limit the size of Polo and Riding Ponies and to prevent the deterioration of the native breeds by further neglect.\nBy 1900 the society had turned it’s attention to the accurate measuring of ponies, an issue that is still of concern today. After several years of controversy and discussion, an eight and a half page document was finally published in 1907 detailing the rules concerning the measurement of Polo ponies. Several anatomical details were included concerning measurement and neither the owner nor his servant were allowed to be present during the measurement. Despite extensive rules governing condition and shoeing some competitors still sought to bypass the rules by removing and /or replacing shoes on the show ground, until this practice was banned.\nIn 1910 Lord Arthur Cecil began a train of events which culminated in the Society changing it’s name. The Board of Agriculture proposed that part of the Development Fund for Horse Breeding be used for the encouragement of pony stallions . Lord Arthur suggested that a grant be offered for Polo and Riding Pony stallions to be awarded at the Society’s Spring Show and that those for Mountain and Moorland Breeds be offered at selected regional shows. A grant of £200.00 was awarded to some of the native pony breeds with a possibility of more for the improvement of Highland ponies and Welsh Cobs. The request for the Polo and Riding Ponies was rejected on the grounds of insufficient funds.\nIn July 1912 a deputation visited the President of the Board of Agriculture to argue their case. After several persuasive arguments , the President agreed with much of what the deputation had to say but observed in a jocular way that the word Polo in the title of the Society did not seem to carry with the element of poverty expected in such cases. It was remarked by Lord Helmsley that “ the Societies name might possibly mislead as to it’s object, which was to improve the breed of ponies generally” Minds had been concentrated and the seeds of change sown.\nEarlier in 1912 a committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Arthur Cecil had been formed to advise on measures for the improvement of the Mountain and Moorland breeds .A 36 page report was produced on all the native breeds, their past and present status and characteristics, including markets for the ponies, premiums payable, and native habitat. The recommendations included encouragement of district Pony associations, registration of suitable stallions and mares in recognised Stud Books and awards of premiums to native stallions to roam at large. Premiums to young mares until they produced a foal and the careful interchange of registered stallions to avoid in breeding. It is interesting how many of these recommendations have survived in one form or another to the present day.\nAs 1912 drew to a close, following a Council meeting, an Extraordinary General meeting was called at the Society’s office in Hanover Square London for the 30th July 1913, at that meeting the decision was taken to change the Society’s name to The National Pony Society.\nAs the popularity of showing British Riding Ponies increased, a new society was formed to administrate ridden pony classes. This was called the British Show Pony Society in association with The National Pony Society, and in 1954 was renamed just the British Show Pony Society (BSPS)\nA first Scottish Committee was formed in 1960 when Commander Brown and Mr Driver came up from Headquarters to meet pony enthusiasts in Scotland. The new Committee encouraged shows to put on mixed M&M classes and more Riding Pony Breeding classes. A stallion parade was started at Kelso Spring sales to showcase a wide range of available stallions. In 2001 National Pony Society Scotland was re-launched from the NPS Scotland Steering Committee as an independent Scottish based and managed organisation.","One of the world’s oldest games is also one of its fastest – balls travel up to 110 miles per hour – and most dangerous. Man and horse work in partnership to get a ball through a goal, while using every possible strategy to prevent the opposing side from doing so. What happens on that quest is both brutish and beautiful.\nA polo game is played between two teams with four players on each side. The members are designated as “attack” or “defense” and each has the job of furthering their own goal tally while preventing the other side from scoring. Most of the rules were established to keep the riders and horses, often called ponies, safe. Teams line up, in numerical order, opposite each other. Then an official begins the match with a throw-in, the ball is rolled between the teams, and play begins. (Throw-ins occur to begin a match and to resume play after a time out.)\nThe line of the ball is a “right of way” established by the path of a traveling ball. Right of way occurs when a player has the line of the ball on his right; the player who struck the ball last has right of way. Riding alongside a player with the right of way is permitted, as long as his way is not hindered. The umpire primarily looks out for right of way and the line of the ball.\nTeams change ends after each goal is scored to account for any wind advantage which may exist.\nFour players are on each team. Each player wears a numbered jersey, one through four, which indicates their position and responsibilities on the field.\n•One – Mainly concerned with goal scoring – often played by the lowest handicapped player on the team.\n•Two – Scorer, but greater defensive responsibilities then Number One.\n•Three – Adept at scoring, playing defense and determining the strategy. Generally the team’s best player and captain.\n•Four – Mainly a defensive player.\nA polo match is approximately one and one-half hours long and is divided into seven-minute time periods called chukkers. There are six chukkers in a high-goal match. Breaks between chukkers are three minutes long, with a 15-minute halftime.\nPlayers score by driving the ball into the opposing team’s goal.\nThe mounts are full-size horses, ranging in size from 14.2 to 16 hands high at the withers, or horse’s shoulders, (one hand equals four inches) and weigh between 900 and 1100 lbs. Many polo ponies are thoroughbreds or thoroughbred crosses. They play for a maximum of two non-consecutive chukkers per match.\nAll players are assigned a handicap. Handicaps go from minus two to ten goals and are determined by competition committees in the countries where the players compete. There are only 12 or so ten goalers in the world.\nPlayers must hit right-handed for safety reasons.\nTwo mounted umpires control the game; a midfield referee steps in when the umpires disagree. A flagman is positioned behind each goal; he indicates when a goal is scored.\nThe umpires generally call fouls for dangerous riding or use of the mallet. Penalty for a foul can be anything from a free hit to a free goal for the opposing team.\nPolo fields are 300 yards long and 160 yards wide. An eight-yard wide goal, marked by ten-foot high goal posts, is centered on each end of the field.\nA player may use his mallet to block or interfere with an opponent’s swing by hooking the other player’s mallet. This is only allowed when a player is on the side where the swing is occurring or directly in front of or behind their opponent.\nA bump, or ride-off, is used to break an opponent’s concentration, move him off the line of the ball or ruin his shot. When one player rides his pony alongside and physically connects with his opponent to lead him away from the ball, it is called a ride-off. A ride-off is permissible only at a 30-degree angle and at the horse’s shoulder."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d446fe46-c21e-445f-85ec-98afd3e9c0fc>","<urn:uuid:7205e167-e8ae-40ef-9511-8bb94ad71925>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key steps for starting film photography, and what essential storage conditions must be considered for preserving photographic materials in the long term?","answer":"For starting film photography, you should first acquire a film camera (either new, second-hand, or borrowed from family/friends) and choose appropriate film based on factors like grain structure, contrast, exposure latitude, and speed. After shooting, you can either develop the film yourself in a darkroom or send it to a commercial lab service. For preservation, photographs should be stored in a cool (8-12°C for black and white, below 5°C for color), dry (30-40% relative humidity) and dark environment. Avoid storing near water sources or external walls. Use archival quality storage materials like uncoated polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene sleeves, and acid-free paper envelopes. Photos should be handled with clean hands, by the edges only, and should never be fastened with metal pins, paper clips, staples, or rubber bands.","context":["Beginner's Guide Posted on April 27, 2017 to Beginner Series\nWhether you are new to film photography or picking it up again after a number of years, it is very easy to get started and a rewarding activity regardless of your level of expertise.\nIntroduction to film photography\nTo get you started we've created a series of animations that will introduce you to the world of film photography. These short 60 second animated videos cover a range of topics and terminologies to quickly get you up to speed. From f-stop to film types, these videos are the perfect entry point into your analogue journey.\nBuying / borrowing your first film camera\nThere are still several manufacturers making film cameras today, however, a great way to get started is to take a look at the thriving second-hand market. It is very possible to pick up an excellent used film camera for a bargain price. As with any piece of second-hand equipment, we would advise you to check its condition before purchasing.\nYou should also check with family and friends to see if they have an old camera they can lend you. You would be surprised how many people still have one somewhere in their house! For those familiar with digital photography, unsurprisingly film cameras work in much the same way with the main difference being you can’t instantly view your images on the back of the camera. To see how a film Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera works watch this animation.\nChoosing a film\nChoosing a film might at first appear a daunting proposition. How do you know which one is right for you and what are the differences?\nWe love all our films equally (naturally) but many film photographers have a personal preference based on several attributes including grain structure, contrast, exposure latitude and speed. Our film format animation gives a quick overview of the different types of film and our ISO animation covers the applications of each film speed. Which to choose will be down to personal preference but we have given you some pointers here\nWhere to buy\nMany retailers around the world stock our products but they aren’t always on display (films, for example, are best kept refrigerated). If you can’t see what you are after in your local photographic store we recommend asking at the counter. If they don’t stock it then get in touch with us and we will speak to our regional distributors.\nWe have also created a handy tool which will let you find a local stockist as well as online retailers in your country. If you live in the UK you can also buy directly from us via this website.\nFinding a darkroom\nCongratulations you have shot a roll of film and are half way through your analogue journey. Luckily processing film and printing in a darkroom is just as much fun as the shooting! There is something very special about seeing your print develop for the first time and with a little bit of practice, you will soon be able to master a variety of creative techniques to take your images to the next level.\nOur creative customers convert everything from their bathrooms and bedrooms to their garden sheds and even the cupboard under the stairs! Many are willing to share their darkrooms and our darkroom finder tool enables you to find one in your area*. We also list commercial darkrooms here too.\nPicking a paper\nLike choosing a film, paper choice is based on personal preference and largely depends on the look you want to achieve. Our MULTIGRADE papers are the leading black & white analogue photographic papers and come in cool, neutral and warm tones and a choice of surfaces (i.e. Pearl, Glossy, Matt etc) and substrates (i.e. Fibre or Resin Coated bases). Again, we appreciate this choice can be a little daunting for those unfamiliar with the different terminology and options so we have written a guide to picking your perfect paper.\nWhat chemistry should I use\nDon’t know the difference between your Bromophen and your Hypam? Confused with whether you need ID-11 or Ilfotec DD-X? Don’t worry we have simplified it here and you’ll pick this up in no time. Our guide to getting started with Chemistry, will have you chanting “dev, stop, fix and wash” before you know it!\nFind a lab\nIf you don’t want to develop your own film or make your own prints just yet, then you will need to send them off to a commercial lab service. We run an award-winning lab service in the UK and USA. We have also pulled together a list of labs that specialise in black & white prints. Please note that with the exception of XP2 SUPER, you cannot print our films with the colour C41 processing available in high street chemists and supermarkets.\n*Please note that we cannot validate the facilities or the hosts of our darkroom finder service. Using this service is done so at your own discretion.\nBeginner's Guide to Choosing Chemistry for Printing\nPosted on 12th April 2017\nChoosing your first ILFORD film\nPosted on 30th March 2017\nIntroduction to ILFORD Film Developers\nPosted on 30th March 2017","As technology progresses many people are digitising their photographic collections. In undertaking this process it is important to take care of your original materials for access in the future. The following guidelines are some simple steps that you can undertake to protect your photographic collection for the long-term.\nBefore discussing storage it is important to keep in mind that most photographic material is made up of several layers. The most important being:\nSupport layer (base): In the case of prints this is either fibre based photographic paper or resin coated paper (B&W and colour prints post 1970). For negative and transparencies this will be either cellulose nitrate (1890-1950) cellulose acetate (c.1925 to present) or polyester (1960 onwards).\nImage layer (emulsion): Generally this is composed of a gelatin emulsion containing image forming materials. The most common image forming materials are silver in the case of black and white material and chromogenic dyes for colour material.\nEach of these layers has its own particular deterioration characteristics and, in some cases, have different storage requirements. When looking at storage you need to consider both environment and enclosures.\nPhotographic material is susceptible to deterioration by elevated levels of temperature, moisture, air borne pollutants (dust, peroxides, acids) ultraviolet light and manual handling.\nFor long term storage, archival institutions generally aim for temperatures between 8-12°C for black and white material and below 5°C for colour material. They also try and maintain a stable relative humidity moisture range between 30-40 per cent. The basic principle to keep in mind is to achieve a cool, dry and stable environment.\nIf storing at home a clean, cool, dry and dark environment is best, such as an internal cupboard in a bedroom. The following areas should be avoided as they are susceptible to fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity (moisture):\n- cupboards next to a water source such as kitchen, bathroom or laundry\n- cupboards next to an external wall\nIf you intend to construct shelving, use coated metal rather than wood, as wood may, over time, release harmful vapours and provide a home for insects.\nStore oversize items flat in drawers or boxes as unrolling material later can damage the material.\nAlways store deteriorating material separately from the rest of your collection.\nThere are a variety of suitable storage enclosures that can be used for long-term storage of your photographic collection. Use of a multi-layered system i.e. sleeve, box, cabinet will provide you with increased protection.\nPlastics: Plastic sleeves, envelopes and bags are suitable for storing prints and negatives in good condition. They should be made of a chemically inert material such as uncoated polyester, polypropylene or polyethylene. Avoid enclosures made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as this produces harmful products when it deteriorates.\nPaper: Archival quality acid free paper envelopes are suitable for storing prints and deteriorated negatives. It is generally recommended that the paper be unbuffered as some photographic processes react adversely to buffered papers. Seamless envelopes are preferred.\nAlbums: When choosing an album there are several things you need to be aware of. Avoid self-adhesive albums (also known as magnetic albums) and any products that contain PVC plastics. Use archival quality photo-corners to adhere photographs to pages in non-adhesive albums.\n- When choosing enclosures look for materials or products that have passed the 'PAT’ (Photographic Activity Test). This certifies that the material is safe for use with photographs.\n- Prints and negatives are best packaged individually but if packaging in groups is unavoidable, the photos should be interleaved with acid-free paper or board. Package loose material in small groups in files or folders, then package inside boxes.\nWhen framing a photograph insure that the backing and insert are of archival quality materials. Avoid wooden frames, which may be constructed using glues and varnishes. These may break down over time to form gases harmful to the photograph.\nTry to minimise the amount of light exposure while on display. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight and if possible use an ultraviolet light filtering glazing in the frame. Colour photographs are particularly susceptible to deterioration by over exposure to intense light.\nAvoid hanging locations near heating or cooling sources as these will produce adverse temperature and moisture conditions that can affect the photograph.\nAlways wash and dry your hands before handling photographs. As natural oils can accelerate deterioration, handle photographs by the edges ensuring that your fingerprints never touch the surface of the photo. Lint-free gloves may be used if they don’t make handling difficult.\nBe aware that the photo emulsion is easily scratched by stacking of photographs.\nNever fasten or bind photographs with metal pins, paper clips, staples or rubber bands.\nUse a blower or soft brush (available from photographic stores) to gently clean dusty photographic material.\nUse a soft lead pencil, which is inert and easy to use, for making a small note on the reverse of the photograph. (6B pencils are best.) It is important to identify photographs for future reference but do not use pens, stamps or adhesive labels as any of these may leave an impression in the photo paper and, over time, damage the photograph at a chemical level, impairing the image and integrity of the paper.\nDo not use adhesive tape, post-it notes or sticky labels when identifying photographs.\nDo not have food or drink near photographs. Aside from the possibility of spillage, consumables may attract mould and insects.\nAny advice regarding care, handling, storage and packaging of photographs is doubly applicable to digital prints (prints produced on a printer from digital images, rather than by photographic development.) Digital prints are even more susceptible to the detrimental effects of light, air and moisture, so especial care should be taken to keep them safe from exposure to these elements.\n*NFSA cannot supply acid free packaging but you may be able to obtain it from companies specialising in its manufacture, such as Zetta Florence, (Victoria) Conservation Resources (Vic) and Australian Paper (NSW)\nPlease note — The advice given here in regard to the care of photographs is based on best international experience and the best information available to the NFSA.

{"question":"How do the detection requirements for rare particle interactions compare with the challenges of scientific imaging in extended wavelength ranges, and what specialized cooling solutions are implemented in each case?","answer":"For rare particle interactions, WIMP detection requires ultra-sensitive conditions achieved by cooling detectors to 20mK, measuring energy deposits of just tens of keV, and using multiple shielding methods to reduce radioactive interference. Similarly, in extended wavelength imaging, InGaAs FPA cameras require deep cooling to -85°C to minimize dark current and enable long exposure times. Both applications use specialized cooling solutions: WIMP detection employs cryostats to maintain near-absolute-zero temperatures, while InGaAs cameras use thermoelectric cooling with vacuum-sealed chambers and cold-shields to reduce ambient radiation. The cooling requirements are driven by different needs - extremely weak signal detection for WIMPs versus managing inherent dark current in InGaAs sensors.","context":["General presentation of the EDELWEISS-III experiment\nEDELWEISS is a french acronym meaning \"experiment to detect WIMPs in an underground site\". WIMPs are not french ;-) , they are hypothetical, Weakly Interacting and Massive Particles.\nA cosmological quest\nCurrent astrophysical observations tend to show that, if Einstein's laws of gravitation are correct, then there must be some new kind of matter at different scales in our Universe. It is called Dark Matter. The gravitational effects of Dark Matter are observed, for examples, with the cosmic microwave background at 3K, with gravitational lensing observations, clusters of galaxies, measurements of \"rotation curves\" of galaxies...\nIn particular some dark matter should exist in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The nature of this matter is unknown and it may be formed of a gaz of a new kind of particles. We know also that our knowledge of fundamental particles and interactions, the so-called \"Standard Model\" of particle physics, is still incomplete. Several theories, proposed as extensions of this Standard Model, predict the existence of so-called \"WIMP\" particles: beeing Weakly Interacting with matter, and Massive, these particles are good candidates to constitute dark matter.\nThe goal of the EDELWEISS-III experiment, like other \"dark matter direct detection\" experiments throughout the world, is to test this WIMP hypothesis by attempting to observe directly some interactions between WIMPs from our own galaxy and an appropriate detector.\n|The energy content of our Universe. Dark matter (23%) remains an enigma, as is also dark energy.||Principle of WIMP detection by the nucleus of an EDELWEISS detector: the WIMP arrives left and creates a nuclear recoil (orange arrow) which is detected.|\nUltra-sensitive detectorsThe signals induced by WIMPs would be of very weak energy (tens of keV) and very rare. To reach the required sensitivity, the researchers of Edelweiss have choosen detectors working at a very small temperature: 20mK, very near from the absolute zero of temperature.\nThese detectors are named ionization-heat bolometers: during a WIMP interaction, they measure at the same time a temperature variation produced by the deposited energy - a few millionths of degree - and the number of produced electrons. This double measurement enables to distinguish WIMPs from residual radioactivity with an efficiency better than 99,98 %.\nIn order to reduce as much as possible the residual radioactivity, the experiment is located under the Frejus mountain, in the underground laboratory of Modane at the French-Italian border. Detectors are also strongly shielded by different screens.\n|Zoom on a bolometer: it is a Germanium cristal instrumented by electrodes and a small, utra-sensitive rectangular thermometer which you can see glued on the lateral side of the cristal.

Detectors are located inside the big coper cover.|\nA worldwide competitionThe Edelweiss researchers have not yet observed WIMPs but they could obtain excellent sensitivities with the version I of the experiment (three 320-gram detectors) and latter the version II (ten 400-g detectors). These results put the experiment among the first ones worldwide.\nThe version III of the experiment, more sensitive (40 detectors og 800 grams with improved performances), is now starting data taking.","Working in the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the spectrum offers researchers several advantages, such as the abilities to circumvent unwanted fluorescence backgrounds and to probe more deeply into sample surfaces.\nImaging and spectroscopy techniques performed in the NIR/SWIR are playing an increasingly important role in many leading-edge scientific and industrial endeavors, including the latest R&D efforts to improve solar cells, nanotubes, and semiconductors, as well as studies involving multispectral investigation. The recent introduction of deep-cooled camera systems that employ indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) focal plane arrays (FPAs) promises to both amplify and broaden the utility of NIR/SWIR imaging and spectroscopy.\nEven though light in the NIR and SWIR regions is invisible to the naked eye, its properties are quite similar to those of light in the visible (VIS) region of the spectrum. Like VIS light, NIR/SWIR light is reflective and can provide fine contrast and resolution in images acquired with an appropriately sensitive detector (e.g., an InGaAs FPA). This technical note offers an overview of InGaAs FPAs and discusses key performance features of InGaAs-based cameras for lowlight scientific imaging and spectroscopy applications in the NIR/SWIR regions of the spectrum.\nInGaAs FPA Basics\nInGaAs is a III-V compound semiconductor that provides excellent photosensitivity in the NIR/SWIR (see Figure 1). Changing the doping concentration of InGaAs alters its sensitivity, thus enabling the spectral response characteristics of the material to be tailored to best meet specific application requirements.\nAn InGaAs FPA consists of a two-dimensional photodiode array (PDA) — itself comprising an indium phosphide (InP) substrate, an InGaAs absorption layer, and an ultrathin InP cap — that has been indium bump bonded to a readout integrated circuit (ROIC), as shown in Figure 2. State-of-the-art Teledyne Princeton Instruments’ NIRvana family of cameras, for example, feature a two-dimensional 640 x 512 array bonded to a low-noise ROIC.\nIn an InGaAs FPA, the two-dimensional array detects incident light and then generates and collects charge; the ROIC clocks and converts the collected charge to voltage and transfers the resultant signal to off-chip electronics. InGaAs FPAs are typically back illuminated and are typically sensitive over the 900 – 1700 nm wavelength range (Figure 3).\nInGaAs FPA vs Si-CCD Cameras\nCurrently, many life and physical science applications use low-light-level CCD (silicon-based) cameras for optical imaging and spectroscopy. Although these Si-CCD cameras provide excellent QE in the UV-to-NIR range due to silicon’s bandgap properties, even the best NIR-optimized CCDs cannot offer sensitivity beyond 1100 nm (see Figure 4).\nFor over a decade, back-illuminated, deep-depletion silicon CCD cameras have been a preferred tool for NIR imaging and spectroscopy due to their high resolution, relatively inexpensive cost, and acceptable – albeit less than ideal – QE in this region of the spectrum.\nNew InGaAs FPA cameras, however, extend application utility well into the SWIR (see Table 1). While InGaAs provides sensitivity over an extended NIR range due to its lower bandgap. The lower bandgap is also responsible for much higher dark current (thermally generated signal) compared to Si-CCDs. As a result, scientific InGaAs FPA cameras require very deep cooling (i.e., down to -85°C) to minimize this unwanted noise source.\n|Typical Pixel Size||20 μm2||<8 μm2 to > 24 μm2|\n|Typical Resolution||<640 x 512||512 x 512 to >2k x 2k|\n|Wavelength Response (nm)||900 – 1700||<200 – 1100|\n|Typical Dark Current (e-/pixel/sec)||300 (incl. ambient background)||0.0001|\n|Fixed Pattern Noise||Present||Low|\nScientific InGaAs FPA Camera Performance\nCommercial NIR cameras incorporating InGaAs FPA sensors are typically designed for use in night vision and thermal inspection applications. Scientific applications, on the other hand, impose extreme demands on camera systems to achieve the best possible signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This section discusses the key performance features of scientific InGaAs FPA cameras.\nAs discussed above, typical InGaAs FPAs have sensitivity between 900 and 1700 nm. However, great care must be taken to maximize photon collection before the incident light reaches the sensor. For example, it is important to use a single optical window in the camera, treated with an antireflective coating (AR coating) to maximize photon throughput.\nOne of the particularly noteworthy behaviors of InGaAs FPAs is that their long-wavelength cutoff is reduced when they are cooled. As a rule of thumb, the long-wavelength cutoff shifts by 8 nm for every 10°C of sensor cooling. This phenomenon can actually be advantageous, as the sensor is insensitive to background signal beyond the shifted far-end wavelength cutoff. In other words, the sensor acts like a “tunable” lowpass optical filter (see Figure 5).\nInGaAs FPAs are dark-noise-limited devices. Deep cooling, down to -85°C, is required to reduce dark charge (see Figure 6) and preserve the signal-to-noise ratios needed for scientific applications. Refer to “The need for cooling” below.\nUsing a deep-cooled InGaAs FPA camera, continuous exposure times of several minutes are practical (see Figure 7).\nDue to a very complex manufacturing process, almost every InGaAs FPA has a small percentage of defective pixels – non-uniform, dark, and bright. A non-uniform pixel demonstrates greater or lesser photosensitive response than the surrounding pixels (i.e., its response, though linear, differs from the average response demonstrated by the rest of the device’s array). A dark pixel, meanwhile, is unresponsive to light and appears black in an image. Finally, a bright pixel is a pixel that saturates independently of incident light and appears as a white spot in an image (see Figure 8).\nWhile pixel defects are inevitable when dealing with InGaAs FPA devices, it is desirable to have a defect-correction algorithm built into the camera’s acquisition software or hardware for scientific applications. LightField™ software from Teledyne Princeton Instruments, for example, provides automatic pixel defect correction for defects up to 2 x 2 pixels in size.\nFixed pattern noise\nIn addition to the aforementioned pixel defects, InGaAs FPA camera system users should be aware of one more performance characteristic of these devices. In a typical InGaAs FPA, each pixel (or pixel column) is connected to an individual preamplifier for readout, so any gain/response variations will cause fixed pattern noise (FPN). In advanced cameras such as the NIRvana:640, the FPN is fully subtractable (see Figure 9).\nThe Need for Cooling\nDue to the low bandgap of InGaAs material, InGaAs FPA cameras have much higher dark current than Si-CCD cameras. Therefore, it is absolutely critical to minimize InGaAs FPA cameras’ dark noise via deep cooling. Scientific InGaAs FPA cameras, for example the NIRvana:640 use advanced thermoelectric cooling and vacuum technology to cool sensors down to -85°C and achieve the lowest possible dark noise.\nThe NIRvana family of cameras uses an all-metal, hermetically vacuum-sealed chamber (see Figure 10) with a single vacuum window for maintenance-free operation:\n• State-of-the-art design cools sensor down to either -85°C or -65°C.\n• Single optical window with double-sided AR coating provides the highest photon throughput, >98% transmission, in the NIR band.\n• Hermetic seals afford maintenance-free operation. No vacuum re-pumping is necessary over the camera system’s long lifetime.\n• High vacuum levels deliver deep sensor cooling and condensation-free operation.\n• Built-in air or liquid cooling options allow researchers to utilize a built-in fan for optimal ease of use or an external liquid circulator for vibration-free operation (the built-in fan can be turned off via software).\n• A proprietary cold-shield minimizes the detection of unwanted ambient NIR radiation. The cold-shield is a metal component that sits on top of the InGaAs FPA and is cooled to the same temperature as the sensor. It limits the f-cone of the sensor (typically f/1.5) and reduces background for lower overall noise.\n• Cooling shifts the long-wavelength cutoff by about 8 nm for every 10°C, thus reducing unwanted background noise.\nNewly available scientific, deep-cooled, large-format InGaAs FPA cameras such as the as the NIRvana family from Teledyne Princeton Instruments (see Figure 11) will enable researchers to work more effectively than ever before at longer wavelengths in the NIR and SWIR regions of the spectrum. Key applications include nanotube fluorescence, emission, absorption, small animal imaging, nondestructive testing, and singlet oxygen detection.\nBack-illuminated, deep-depletion silicon CCD cameras such as the Teledyne Princeton Instruments PIXIS:1024BR, meanwhile, continue to offer superb resolution and sufficient quantum efficiency for cost-effective imaging and spectroscopy at shorter NIR wavelengths.\nTeledyne Princeton Instruments is the only company that provides both deep-cooled InGaAs FPA and silicon CCD cameras suitable for advanced imaging and spectroscopy applications in the NIR and SWIR."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1bf21dca-fc30-4109-bfd6-041449141984>","<urn:uuid:4ebbf97f-31a0-46a3-92d3-b68289274f09>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When planning for hospital equipment, which allows for easier position adjustments: a manual hospital bed that requires hand cranks, or new medical technologies like PET/MRI machines that need careful implementation planning?","answer":"Manual hospital beds require hand cranks to adjust positions and can be difficult to use, especially for those with limited hand/arm strength. They also may not move to as many positions as electric beds. Meanwhile, new medical technologies like PET/MRI machines require comprehensive implementation planning by biomedical engineering staff who research the technology requirements and assess implementation needs, but the focus is not on position adjustments since these are imaging devices rather than patient beds.","context":["How To Choose And Safely Use A Hospital Bed\nWhy do I need to know about hospital beds?\nA hospital bed may be needed if you or a family member is ill or recovering from an illness at home. You can buy or rent a hospital bed at medical supply stores. Most hospital beds look like a twin bed made of heavy metal parts. The bed has moveable side rails. Hand cranks or electricity may be used to change positions of the bed. Talk to your healthcare provider about what kind of bed is best for you or your family member.\nWhat types of hospital beds are available?\n- Manual hospital beds need to be moved or adjusted by using hand cranks. This may be difficult if you have limited hand or arm strength. If you are unable to do this, you will need to ask someone to help you. The cranks are located at the foot or head of the bed. Manual beds may not move to as many positions as electric beds.\n- Electric hospital beds can be moved or adjusted by pushing buttons. These beds may be easier to use. An electric bed has a motor and a cord to plug into an electrical outlet. There is a hand control pad hooked to the bed that may look like a television remote control. Each button on the hand control may have a picture showing how the bed will move when you push the button. Many people like an electric bed because the positions of the bed can be changed easily. These beds may also have a built in scale.\nWhat type of mattress should I use?\nThere are foam, air, and gel mattresses available for a hospital bed. Some mattresses can reduce pressure on certain areas of the body and help prevent pressure sores. You can buy or rent the mattress at the same supply store where you buy or rent the bed. The mattress usually comes with a waterproof cover. You may need other pads or bed attachments.\nHow can I safely use a hospital bed?\n- Keep the wheels of the bed locked at all times. Unlock the wheels only if the bed needs to be moved. Once the bed is moved into place, lock the wheels again.\n- Put a bell and a telephone within reach of the bed. These should be available so you can call for help when needed.\n- Keep the side rails up at all times except when you get in and out of bed. You may need a footstool next to the bed. Use a night light if you need to get out of bed at night.\n- Put the hand control pad within easy reach to adjust positions. Learn to use the hand control and practice moving the bed into different positions. Test the bed's hand and panel controls to be sure the bed is working correctly. You may be able to lock the positions so the bed cannot be adjusted.\n- Follow the specific manufacturer's instructions for using the bed. Check for cracks and damage to the bed controls. Call the bed manufacturer or another professional if you smell burning or hear unusual sounds coming from the bed. Do not use the bed if there is a burning smell coming from it. Call if the bed controls are not working correctly to change positions of the bed.\n- When you adjust any part of the bed, it should move freely. The bed should extend to its full length and adjust to any position. Do not place the hand control or power cords through the bed rails.\nCare AgreementYou have the right to help plan your care.

The priorities are based on a number of factors, including the strategic needs of the hospital and a variety of fiscal, risk, clinical, and technical factors.1,7\nAccording to the ECRI Institute, if the planning process for healthcare technology (that is, medical equipment) is implemented correctly, it ensures the availability of suitable medical equipment in the hospital all the time.2 It also allows for the best use of the hospital’s capital investment. Needless to say, up-to-date and functioning medical equipment also improves the quality of patient care.\nHealthcare technology strategic planning can be divided into two broad categories. The first is planning for new or additional equipment and technologies. The second involves the replacement and upgrading of older existing equipment.\nNew Equipment Planning\nWhen new or additional facilities are built, the biomedical or clinical engineering staff works closely with the architects, engineers, clinical and nursing staff, and other hospital personnel in the planning for new equipment. With their understanding of the requirements for medical equipment, biomedical or clinical engineering staff can provide recommendations on the equipment location, evaluate safety and technical requirements, and apply human factors engineering principles to the process of designing the area.2\nBiomedical or clinical engineering also assists in researching the new technologies, assessing the requirements, and planning for the implementation of new technologies or new categories of medical equipment. For example, PET/MRI is a new hybrid imaging technology, combining magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, that has promise for oncologic applications.3 There are other new emerging technologies in a wide range of clinical areas, including surgery.4\nEquipment Replacement Planning\nBiomedical or clinical engineering can also play an important role in the renovation process for existing facilities.5 They possess a broad background in engineering principles and also understand the practice of medicine, healthcare technology, electrical and mechanical safety, and regulations, as well as codes that must be applied to the new construction process. They should be closely involved in construction from the initial design stages, throughout the entire construction period, during the postconstruction inspection, and up through the admission of patients to the newly built area.\nBiomedical or clinical engineering staff should likewise be involved in the construction planning, including the following activities:\n- Setting specifications for space and location of medical equipment.\n- Making sure that the appropriate codes, standards, and regulations are followed.\n- Ensuring that proper specifications are provided for medical equipment interconnectivity.\n- Specifying electrical power requirements for the medical equipment (for example, ampacity and emergency power).\n- Establishing specifications for medical gas and vacuum systems.\nThey can provide guidance in replacement of old equipment by developing replacement recommendations that use various factors, including age, technology status, maintenance cost, the availability of parts and support, utilization, and safety and downtime.6\nAnother part of equipment replacement planning is the upgrade (of both software and hardware) of existing medical equipment. For example, some existing newer CT scanners can be upgraded using radiation dose reduction applications.\nMore details about the exam are provided in the 2013 Candidate Handbook, available at the Healthcare Technology Foundation website at thehtf.org. 24×7\n1) A hospital’s medical technology priorities are based on the following factors except for which one?\n2) Benefits of medical equipment planning include the following except which one?\na) Availability of suitable medical equipment in the hospital\nb) Optimal utilization of financial resources\nc) Improvement in the quality of care\nd) Availability of the most up-to-date medical equipment in the hospital\n3) The biomedical or clinical engineering staff assist in equipment planning by providing recommendations in the following areas except for which one?\n4) The biomedical or clinical engineering staff assist in the planning of new technologies by doing which of the following?\na) Researching the new technologies\nb) Assessing the requirements\nc) Planning for the new equipment\nd) All of the above\n5) The following factors can be used for equipment replacement except for which one?\nb) Technology status\nc) Availability of parts and support\nd) Environmental factors\n6) The biomedical or clinical engineering staff can assist with which of the following activities of construction planning?\na) Ensuring that appropriate codes and regulations are followed\nb) Specifying electrical power requirements for the medical equipment\nc) Helping with the specifications for space and location of medical equipment\nd) All of the above\nSee answers below\n1.

{"question":"How does banning suppliers who use child labor impact the actual problem of child labor?","answer":"Simply banning or replacing suppliers who use child labor often makes the problem worse rather than solving it. When companies stop sourcing from non-compliant suppliers, children may be forced underground into more dangerous situations like domestic servitude or other sectors such as tourism. The underlying issue of deep poverty that forces children into labor remains unaddressed. Additionally, in poor regions, some suppliers cannot afford the costs associated with full compliance, so cutting them off denies them the opportunity to develop and improve their practices. This is why experts suggest that engagement and remediation are more effective than outright prohibition.","context":["Published in Coffee & Cocoa International, November 2019\nResponses to problems in supply chains such as child labor need companies to go beyond ‘yes-no’ checklists and stop penalizing farmers. A more holistic approach is required that actually addresses the problem.\nWhen child labor is discovered in a company’s supply chain, panic can ensue. And rightly so: not only is the nature of the problem appalling to us, the sheer number of children affected may be as big as the combined population of the United Kingdom and Germany. But are we taking these children as seriously as if they lived in the UK or Germany?\nWe have reviewed the different streams of ideas on this topic and offer some insight on what may be the most promising ways to go beyond just beefing up compliance or aiming anemic program efforts toward it.\nWhen child labor or issues of great concern such as banned pesticides are discovered in a company’s supply chain, managers often react to contain the problem. They may want to determine who is to blame as well as distance the company from the issue and the suppliers. But with today’s emerging consciousness about such problems, there are smarter ways to prepare for and respond when disturbing conditions are found.\nConsider that, in poor supply chains (usually smallholders) the best course for thoughtful companies is not to back away and may instead be to use the opportunity by choosing to engage the problems head-on. Does that take courage? You bet.\nNot sourcing from those suppliers has not worked and often drives the problem underground. Clearly, our business solutions are not making enough of a difference as 152 million children are in child labor globally, with 73 million of them engaged in hazardous work that directly endangers their health, safety, or moral development. In cocoa, where the topic is often studied, credible reports suggest that the standard array of efforts have not made a substantial dent. It takes something more to make a profound impact.\nTaking a stand to face and address the issues has the potential to powerfully alter the problem and the perception at the same time. What practical steps can a business take to get results?\nLeading experts suggest that by understanding the context that leads to non-compliance, we may open ourselves up to deeper and more meaningful engagements with producers that can produce big sustainability wins. For brands and companies with the courage to take the route of engagement, this presents a powerful opportunity to differentiate themselves in the sustainability space and craft a compelling new narrative that speaks of a brand with a big heart, and a real commitment.\n“News travels fast and bad news travels at lightning speed.”\n– Cath Hill, Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply1\nWe know that seemingly intractable problems such as poverty, modern slavery, child labor, and deforestation are minefields for firms (and their supply chains) who are often ill-equipped to deal with them. These risks are not easy to avoid for even the most diligent companies that handle coffee, tea, cocoa, palm oil, cotton, sugar, timber, and other commodities. Leading companies often begin their efforts to minimize the risk of such scenarios by assuring that their suppliers comply with a real code of conduct, not just the outdated yes-no checklist. Most brands and major buyers however, are realizing that compliance checks are simply not enough. Responsible sourcing managers are beginning to use their code of conduct more as a needs assessment that identifies the opportunity to address and resolve challenging findings.\nExperience suggests that this approach is best taken with a locally savvy partner, usually a civil society organization. Sophisticated companies like Mars have announced plans to work with certifiers and suppliers to address child labor challenges through community monitoring and intervention schemes2. Nestle is extending its child labor monitoring intervention with the International Cocoa Initiative’s Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS)3, designed to address child labor issues through an array of localized actions as basic as helping children obtain birth certificates to continue their education, bridging classes for children that have dropped out of school, and sending local facilitators into homes to talk with parents and children. Through its Cocoa Life program Mondelēz has made annual gains in establishing local Child Protection Committees, and it also implements the ICI’s Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation Systems4. Ferrero too has partnered with NGOs including Save the Children and local cooperatives, among others5.\nMore often, however, when noncompliance in issues such as child labor or banned pesticide use is found, company responses only touch the surface. Even worse for poor communities, they may replace ‘failed’ suppliers with new ones, a common practice to meet compliance standards. Some of these may simply be more adept at hiding their non-compliance. Other companies offer offenders a probationary period to resolve the issue. From a brand perspective, this is a reasonable reaction to eliminate poor conduct and protect a brand’s reputation.\nBut often suppliers with failing grades are unable to comply. In poor regions, some cannot afford to incur the necessary cost that comes with real compliance. As researchers Hannibal and Kauppi recount, “If you impose criteria which aren’t…feasible…all you are doing is throwing [the supply chain actors] out of the market and denying them (the opportunity) to develop…6”\nIn the case of children, they may go underground into domestic servitude or other sectors such as tourism. Supply chain codes of conduct or compliance checklists do nothing to address the deep poverty that forces children into labor. Simply identifying the problem does not solve it and may worsen it by eliminating an option.\nThere are no easy answers. A ban on child labor, for example, “requires a child-centered approach addressing the enablers and push factors” says Aarti Kapoor, Managing Director of Embode and a thought leader on human trafficking and child labor. “The point is to reduce child labor [or other non-compliance], not to hide it or push it under the fence.”\nWhen serious violations occur that are clearly willful — such as plantation forced labor or a polluter that has other options — a strong response is appropriate and such violations should be fully reported. While strict rules are meant to create an incentive for compliance, when they make the problem worse, it is necessary to ask: is this really “responsible” sourcing? As a 2015 report in The Guardian7 suggests, a categorical ban on child labor is “a policy with its head in the sand, one that will overshoot the intended goal of improving the lives of children workers” if not thought through properly.\nKapoor and others have made distinctions between children occasionally contributing labor in a safe and parent-supervised manner and child labor that robs children of opportunities and exposes them to dangerous practices, abuse, and manipulation. Certification bodies such as Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade are also adjusting their understanding of failed compliance. Rather than outright prohibition and sanctioning they can now apply due diligence approaches and remediation that they find have a higher impact than only prohibition.\nS&D Coffee, Inc. – a supplier of major US brands with thousands of farmers supplying their RAIZ coffee line – gives farmers a period of time to take corrective actions, where non-compliance is found by auditors (except in the most egregious findings). In some cases, S&D supports the farmers directly to address their issues. For example, to help farmers avoid contaminating waterways with processing effluent, they have provided materials and training to build catchment ponds so they could comply with S&D’s codes. This commitment was not only recognized by some of S&D’s major clients but also improved their relations with local suppliers and farming communities.\nTraceability protocols are the foundation for understanding the functional realities of communities and suppliers embedded in the supply chain. Some of the world’s largest confectionary companies “still cannot identify the farms where all their cocoa comes from, let alone whether child labor was used in producing it8.” With the increasing accessibility of agile data systems that minimize effort and cost while still lending themselves to verification, companies can now learn about the social characteristics associated with farms.\nEnsuring that workers are paid a living wage in the first place is a major incentive that can obviate the need for children to work, and hence can be a tenet of responsible firms. Groups like the Living Income Community of Practice9, led by GIZ, ISEAL Alliance, and the Sustainable Food Lab are working to help determine what a living income in different places is, and promote that for small farmers.\nWe all admire a caring and courageous company. Even though an intangible like moral courage or caring may not always show up on a company’s valuation it may capture consumer hearts and perhaps market share. One thing is certain, children have been waiting for such moral courage for too long.\n- McClelland, Jim “Human rights falter in grey areas of procurement policy.” Raconteur: Future of Procurement.

{"question":"What are the benefits of using hedges near roads for air quality, and how does this relate to research on children's health near highways?","answer":"Low hedges are particularly effective at reducing air pollution from vehicles in urban areas with large buildings close to roads, more so than taller trees. This is especially relevant for public health since research has shown direct impacts on children - for example, a study of elementary schools within 300 feet of the Patriot Freeway in El Paso monitored 23 students for lung function and inflammation due to traffic emissions, with an average of 109,000 vehicles passing daily. Green infrastructure solutions like hedges not only help clean the air by capturing pollutants but can also provide additional benefits like urban heat island mitigation and better stormwater management.","context":["Health, Air Quality Study Seeks Pollution Solutions\nDANIEL PEREZ | May 3, 2018 | UNIVERSITY COMMUNICATIONS\nLeah Whigham, Ph.D., left, and Wen-Whai Li, Ph.D., recently collaborated on research into the effect of air pollution on elementary school students with asthma and some possible solutions.\nThe Paso del Norte Institute for Healthy Living (IHL) promotes healthy eating and active lifestyles, but it also engages in interdisciplinary research with The University of Texas at El Paso and dozens of other groups to enhance its ability to address public health needs.\nStaff of the 4-year-old institute, which moved its offices to UTEP from downtown El Paso during the fall 2017 semester, strive to combine their expertise with that of other researchers to learn more about issues that affect the health and welfare of individuals throughout the community. Their findings are used to develop simple and effective strategies to improve or alleviate those situations.\nAmong the handful of UTEP/IHL research projects is an ongoing study about air quality and the effect of air pollution on elementary school students with asthma. The investigation included 10 weeks of noninvasive tests during the fall 2017 semester on 23 students from campuses that are within 300 feet of the Patriot Freeway in Central El Paso. The participants, who lived in non-smoking households, were tested for lung function, lung inflammation, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity levels, and the naturally occurring carbon isotope ratios in their breath. The data collected will be part of a report that should be ready by fall 2018.\nThe relatively new wrinkle to this investigation is the inclusion of nutrition and physical activity specialists who bring a different perspective to possible solutions to air quality issues.\n\"(El Paso) is a very important area geographically to better understand the impact of poor air quality and how to address it,\" said Leah Whigham, Ph.D., IHL director and one of the program's co-principal investigators. \"We can use those data to develop strategies that the school district can put into place to optimize healthy behaviors.\"\nFor example, Whigham said the results of this research could show if air pollution leads to an increased need for fruits and vegetables in our diets, or if physical activities could be scheduled at times when the air quality is better. Another finding could be the planting of trees to act as a buffer between the traffic and students.\nWen-Whai Li, Ph.D., professor of civil engineering and the project's principal investigator, praised his collaborators for the expertise and resources they brought to the project. His other co-PIs were the late Joan Staniswalis, Ph.D., professor emeritus of mathematical sciences; and William Hargrove, Ph.D., director of UTEP's Center for Environmental Research Management.\nLi, an internationally recognized expert in air quality research, said the presence of a nutrition scientist on his team was new, but it is becoming more common throughout the country to connect health and environmental monitoring. One of his team's primary objectives is to understand the association between traffic emissions and children's respiratory health.\n\"This kind of collaborative research is extremely important because it provides synergistic outcomes,\" Li said. \"As engineers, these (health data) will give us an advantage. They go hand in hand.\"\nThe UTEP team, with the cooperation of the El Paso Independent School District, conducted its research at Bliss and Coldwell elementary schools. The campuses are about two miles away from each other. A Texas Department of Transportation Statewide Planning Map showed that in 2016, the most recent data available, an average of almost 109,000 vehicles passed the two campuses every day while traversing the Patriot Freeway.\nJose E. Gijon, principal of Coldwell Elementary School, 4101 Altura Ave., said 12 of his students participated in this research and they had a positive experience. He said the UTEP researchers were organized, respectful and personable, which helped put his students at ease. Some of the Coldwell students involved in the study told him that they may pursue careers as engineers and scientists as a result.\nHe has invited Li and other members of the UTEP team to help at the school's Math Night to discuss what it takes to succeed in higher education and as a professional.\n\"We hope that we can continue to work with UTEP students,\" said Gijon, a UTEP alumnus who earned his bachelor's degree in business in 1998, and his Master of Education degree in 2005. \"They are welcome anytime.\"\nAmong the UTEP research team members was Juan Aguilera, M.D., a second-year doctoral student who is specializing in interdisciplinary health sciences (IHL). The IHL graduate fellow earned his Master of Public Health degree from UTEP in 2016.\nHis previous work with the institute was to evaluate nutrition and physical activities at after-school and community programs. His job on this project was to collect health measurement data from the elementary school students.\n\"This has been an awesome experience,\" said Aguilera, a native of Juárez, Mexico, who earned his medical degree in 2009. \"I feel fortunate to have been invited to participate in this research that is so important to the community.\"\nThe research is part of a multi-institutional effort that involves the Georgia Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Texas A&M University, and the University of California, Riverside. They make up the CAR-TEEH, Center for Advancing Research in Transportation Emissions, Energy and Health. The program is funded through a multimillion-dollar U.S. Department of Transportation grant.","The Tree Council explain the importance of hedgerows in both rural and urban areas. You can view the original piece on the Tree Council website.\nThe Tree Council has been promoting the benefits of hedges urban and rural since the launch of our Hedge Tree Campaign in 1999, over the past 18 years we have delivered a wide range of projects that have supported people who plant and manage hedges, made the case for more hedge planting to government and worked with communities across the country by grant funding the planting of wild hedge.\nWe are passionate about the importance of hedges for people and for wildlife. So, it’s great to see this study that focuses on an additional important benefit which gives us another really good reason to plant more urban hedges.\nOur Wild Hedges for Urban Edges project focuses on planting hedges around school playgrounds, along park boundaries and at community projects in the South East, The West Midlands and in the The South West, this programme was very successful so we will be looking to extend it into other regions in the future.\nThe report says cities need to “green up” to reduce the impact of air pollution on residents\nThe harmful impact of urban air pollution could be combated by strategically placing low hedges along roads in a built-up environment of cities instead of taller trees, a new study has found.\nThe study points out that low hedges reduce the impact of pollution from vehicles in cityscapes where there are large buildings close to roads, far more effectively than taller trees. Higher trees only have more of an impact in reducing air pollution in areas which are more open and are less densely populated by taller buildings.\nUrban air quality continues to be a primary health concern as most of the world’s population currently lives in urban areas (54% in 2014), and percentage is projected to rise to 66% by 2050; this is coupled with the fact that one of the main global sources of air pollution in cities is traffic emissions.\nProfessor Prashant Kumar, who is Chair in Air Quality & Health at the University of Surrey, said future urban planning need to consider designing and implementing more “green infrastructure”, such as trees or hedges in the built environment to create a more healthy urban lifestyle.\nGreen infrastructure in cities is an urban planning solution for improving air quality as well as enhancing the sustainability of cities for growing urban populations. These green solutions include street trees, vegetation barriers (including hedges), green (or living) walls, and green roofs. They act as porous bodies which influence local dispersion of pollution and aid the deposition and removal of airborne pollutants, making the air cleaner.\nProfessor Kumar said: “We all know air pollution is a major factor of everyday urban life. This comprehensive review highlights that trees and hedges, as well as other green infrastructure, must be used strategically to help create healthier, less polluted cities that are also more pleasant for everyone to live and work in.\nApart from air pollution reduction, other benefits of urban green infrastructure include urban heat island mitigation, the potential reduction in energy consumption, better stormwater management, and climate change mitigation.\nProfessor Kumar added: “Under the framework of the iSCAPE project, we are currently performing targeted field investigations to quantify the effects of different types of green barriers along the busy open-road sides. This will help to develop evidence-based guidelines to support future urban planning and the public to make informed choices to “green up” their surrounding environments.”\nRead the report here iscape report\nPhotos: The Tree Council\nThe Charter for Trees, Woods and People will guide society towards a future in which trees and people stand stronger together.

{"question":"How is the Institute studying the impact of Eastern European home care staff on German families?","answer":"The Institute conducts research examining how Polish or Romanian home staff assistance affects family cohesion in Germany and the impact on the caregivers' families in their home countries. The project investigates the conditions for all involved parties, including limits and opportunities, through inquiries in Bavaria, Germany, and in the families of origin in Poland and Romania.","context":["Institute for Nursing Research, Gerontology and Ethics\nThe Institute for Nursing Research, Gerontology and Ethics is one of the research institutes of the university. It faces the challenges in the intersection of the science of the age on the one hand and the science-based teachings of values on the other hand. In our days manifold ways of life and lifestyles, old age, but also multimorbidity which causes a higher need of support and professional care in the final years of one´s life are widley known attributes of the lifespan of old age.\nAt the same time values have been defined differently in our multifarious society and mutual responsibilities for people are reassigned constantly by each generation. The culture of helping changes between the priorities of the ways of funding and volunteering, the understanding of service in the social sector and the sophisticated lifestyles of families and social groups. Many ethical questions are devolped by this.\nThe Institute for Nursing Research, Gerontology and Ethics applies itself to these questions by its own and through cooperation arranged research projects and the publication of research results at public lectures, symposia and in the magazine „Zeitschrift für Gerontologie und Ethik“.\nHistory of the Institute\nIn 2003 it was founded as an independent Institute with support association. It became an In-Institute of the Lutheran University of applied sciences Nuremberg by senate resolution in July 2009.\nDifferent fields of work of the first few years, for example the qualification to a nursing auditor were relieved by others and extended. The current focus is on research projects and their public presentation for an interested common or professional audience.\nSelection of Research Projects\nThe Institute of Gerontology and Ethics supports communes in planning, establishing and modifiying offers for demented people and their dependents. Integrated into the initiative „Dementia-friendly commune Middle Frankonia“ of the dependent council e.V. Nuremberg and the geropsychiatric professional coordination (GeFa) of Middle Frankconia, which is supported by the Robert-Bosch-Foundation, and the district of Middle Franconia as well, community and urban district analyses are established, which can be the basis for further communal planning.\nThe following questions have priority:\n- What partners, mediators, facilities offer programs for demented people and their dependents? What kind of programs are these?\n- How is the collaboration between these partners, mediators and facilities arranged (network)?\n- What options and resources of the actual offers can be identified for the organization/development/improvement?\nProject manager: Prof. Dr. Christine Brendebach\nIn view of the demographic change, civic commitment as an addition to established and professional geriatric care will become increasingly more important in the next few years. Also it plays a central role to the local authority districts by planning and controlling voluntary services. The Department of Gerontology and Ethics supervises communities and work groups by establishing as well as developing voluntary services. It also conducts demand and user analyses as well.\nProject manager: Prof. Dr. Christine Brendebach\nKidZ -Kids and Dementia\nChildren are faced with the issue of demential diseases as well: for example they see their sick grandparents, they immediately feel that their own parents are involved in caring for their parents or they experince the effects of dementia to the sick family member and their environment. The Institute of Gerontology and Ethics offers the following programs to children:\nDesigning of topical devices for kindergarten and schools\nCounseling for parents, kindergarten teachers and educators\nProject manager: Prof. Dr. Christiene Brendebach\nHuman rights at retirement homes\nA study about the realization of human rights at retirement homes, in cooperation with the Human Rights Office of Nuremberg, for the inquiry of possibly existing and by the nursing staff requested training requirements.\nEastern European home staff\nThis research project considers the change of the culture of helping within generations which is caused by families with care-dependent old family members who employ Eastern European home staff. How does a female Pole´s or Rumanian´s assistance affect the family cohesion in Germany? What kind of impact does this work have on these female´s families in their home country for example Poland and Rumania? What are the conditions for all involved parties?

{"question":"In what ways do the cognitive processes involved in animal discrimination learning compare to the memory techniques used by human memory champions?","answer":"Animal discrimination learning and human memory champions' techniques involve different cognitive processes. Animals learn to discriminate between stimuli through associative learning processes and develop metacognitive abilities in discrimination tasks. In contrast, memory champions use the method of loci, which deliberately creates associations between items and spatial locations in familiar environments. While animals form natural associations through conditioning and experience, memory champions consciously construct elaborate mental frameworks, with 90% of superior memorizers using the method of loci technique. This strategic approach allows humans to memorize large amounts of arbitrary information, unlike animals' more naturalistic learning processes.","context":["Animal Learning and Cognition: An Introduction (3rd Revised edition)\nBy: John M. Pearce (author)Paperback\nAnimal Learning and Cognition: An Introduction provides an up-to-date review of the principal findings from more than a century of research into animal intelligence. This new edition has been expanded to take account of the many exciting developments that have occurred over the last ten years. The book opens with a historical survey of the methods that have been used to study animal intelligence, and follows by summarizing the contribution made by learning processes to intelligent behavior. Topics include Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, discrimination learning, and categorization. The remainder of the book focuses on animal cognition and covers such topics as memory, navigation, social learning, language and communication, and knowledge representation. Expanded areas include extinction (to which an entire chapter is now devoted), navigation in insects, episodic memory in birds, imitation in birds and primates, and the debate about whether primates are aware of mental states in themselves and others. Issues raised throughout the book are reviewed in a concluding chapter that examines how intelligence is distributed throughout the animal kingdom.\nThe broad spectrum of topics covered in this book ensures that it will be of interest to students of psychology, biology, zoology, and neuroscience. Since very little background knowledge is required, the book will be of equal value to anyone simply interested in either animal intelligence, or the animal origins of human intelligence. This textbook is accompanied by online instructor resources which are free of charge to departments who adopt this book as their text. They include chapter-by-chapter lecture slides, an interactive chapter-by-chapter multiple-choice question test bank, and multiple-choice questions in paper and pen format.\nJohn Pearce gained a B.Sc in Psychology from the University of Leeds, and a D. Phil in Experimental Psychology from the University of Sussex. After conducting research at the Universities of York and Cambridge he moved to a lectureship in the Department of Psychology at Cardiff University in 1980, where he is now Professor of Psychology.

The method of loci is also known as the memory journey, memory palace, or mind palace technique. This method is a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous Rhetorica ad Herennium, Cicero's De Oratore, and Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria). Many memory contest champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words. These champions' successes have to do with brain structure, intelligence, however more to do with using spatial memory and the use of the method of loci.\nThe term is most often found in specialised works on psychology, neurobiology, and memory, though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on rhetoric, logic, and philosophy. John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel refer to:\n'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by Yates (1966) in her book The Art of Memory as well as by Luria (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.\nThe items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations. The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish, order, and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the \"Journey Method,\" used for storing lists of related items, or the \"Roman Room\" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.\nMany effective memorisers today use the \"method of loci\" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the World Memory Championship, was initiated in 1991 and the first United States championship was held in 1997. Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to long-term memory a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, \"stop\" at each locus, and \"observe\" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book Moonwalking with Einstein how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.\nMemory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time World Memory Champion Dominic O'Brien uses this technique. The 2006 World Memory Champion, Clemens Mayer, used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in \"number half marathon\", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise pi to over 65,536 (216) digits.\nUsing this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.\nThe technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses. It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:\n- Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and\n- Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.\nThe Rhetorica ad Herennium and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with elaborative encoding (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory. However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.\nA variation of the \"method of loci\" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.\nThe technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot Timothy Doner described in his 2014 TED talk. The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book \"How to learn and memorise German vocabulary\". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.\nApplicability of the term\nThe designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the art of memory, the origins of which are related, according to tradition, in the story of Simonides of Ceos and the collapsing banquet hall. For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks \"[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery.\" Skoyles and Sagan indicate that \"an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps\" originated with the story of Simonides. Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, \"One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC\" Loftus cites the foundation story of Simonides (more or less taken from Frances Yates) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the art of memory. She states, \"This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the \"method of loci\". While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to \"method of loci\" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.\nIn other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: \"The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house.\"\nThis term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the art of memory, hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images and places. The designator \"method of loci\" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.\nSpatial mnemonics and specific brain activation\nBrain scans of \"superior memorizers\", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the medial parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and the right posterior hippocampus. The medial parietal cortex is most associated with encoding and retrieving of information. Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation. In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.\nIn a classic study in cognitive neuroscience, O'Keefe and Nadel proposed \"that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated.\"\nIn a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.\nFictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as ancient Greek myths. The method of loci also features prominently in the BBC series Sherlock, in which the titular main character uses a \"mind palace\" to store information. In the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, Sherlock Holmes referred to his brain as an attic. In Hannibal Rising by Thomas Harris, a detailed description of Hannibal Lector's memory palace is provided. The My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic season eight episode \"The Maud Couple\" features the character Mudbriar, who possesses a mind palace in reference to Sherlock. In the CBS series The Mentalist the titular main character Patrick Jane also claims the use of this technique in memorizing specific information and details.\n- Jusczyk, P.W.; Klein, R.M., eds.

{"question":"What are the main types of pollution sources found in nature, and how do they specifically impact human health when it comes to air quality?","answer":"Natural pollution sources include volcanic eruptions that emit dust, smog, and chemicals like sulfur oxides and hydrogen sulfide; forest fires that release carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and organic smog; and wind-carried desert sand. These can have significant impacts - for example, Mount Pinatubo's 1991 eruption released 18 million tons of SO2 into the stratosphere. Regarding health impacts, outdoor air pollution, whether from natural or human sources, can cause serious health problems including heart attacks, asthma, strokes, cancer, and premature death. In Washington State alone, an estimated 1,100 people die each year due to outdoor air pollution.","context":["Search keywords : Bag filter VOC exhaust gas treatment Wet dust collector Dry dust collector Spray tower\nClassification of air pollution sources\nOrigin：Hefan Hit： Time：2020-03-17\nPollution source refers to the source of various pollution factors that cause environmental pollution. For example, a plant, site, or equipment that releases pollutants to the environment or releases harmful factors.\nI. Classification of pollution sources\nPollution sources can be divided into two categories, namely natural pollution sources and human pollution sources. For environmental science, the main object of research and control is man-made pollution sources.\n(I) Natural pollution sources\nNatural pollution sources Natural pollution sources refer to the sources of various pollutants caused by the movement of nature. For example, a volcanic eruption can emit a large amount of dust (volcanic ash), smog and chemical pollutants such as sulfur oxides and hydrogen sulfide; forest fires bring a large amount of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and incompletely combusted organic smog to the atmosphere; wave motion can Drops of saline water are thrown into the air, and the water evaporates to form salt grains; strong winds can bring sandy soil in desert areas into the air, and even re-sediment thousands of kilometers away; plant pollen is also a source of allergies to humans. Pollutants emitted by some natural pollution sources have a huge amount of adverse effects on the human environment. For example, in June 1991, a massive eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted a large amount of ash and SO2 into the stratosphere. Pinatubo erupted about 18 million tons of SO2 into the stratosphere at one time, which is almost equal to the total amount of SO2 emitted by the United States in one year. After the volcanic eruption reached the stratosphere, it drifted from east to west around the equator and eventually covered the world. The SO2 gas is converted into extremely small sulfuric acid droplets, which generates a mist that reflects and scatters sunlight. Experts believe that this mist will reduce the average earth temperature by more than 0.3 ° C in 3 to 4 years. Some scientists also believe that volcanic particles may act like ice crystals over Antarctica, causing chemical reactions that destroy the ozone layer in densely populated mid-latitude regions. The environmental harm caused by natural pollution sources has attracted people's attention, but it is still difficult for human beings to control the main introduction of man-made pollution sources.\n(2) Anthropogenic pollution sources\nThe source of environmental pollution caused by human production and living activities is the man-made pollution source. The categories are summarized below.\nAccording to the nature of human activities, it is divided into industrial pollution sources (metal smelting, power generation, oil refining, mining, petrochemical, electroplating and other industrial and mining enterprises), agricultural pollution sources (using pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc.), transportation pollution sources (modern vehicles, such as aircraft Exhaust gas from automobiles, ships, ships, etc.) and sources of domestic pollution (living coal such as heating and cooking).\nAccording to the nature of the polluted object, it is classified into sources of air pollution, sources of soil pollution, and sources of water pollution.\nAccording to the spatial distribution of pollution factors, quantile pollution sources (point distribution, such as the three wastes discharged by industrial and mining enterprises, towns, hospitals, scientific research institutions, etc.), surface pollution sources (also known as non-point pollution sources), and line pollution sources (shown as lines) Pollution sources such as exhaust gas from cars, trains, and other means of transportation on the main transportation lines also include noise from traffic workers). Point pollution sources and surface pollution sources are fixed pollution sources, while line pollution sources are mobile pollution sources.\nAccording to the physical and chemical properties of pollution factors, they are classified into organic pollution sources, inorganic pollution sources, mixed pollution sources (pollution sources that emit multiple pollutants at the same time), thermal pollution sources, noise pollution sources, radioactive pollution sources, and pathogen pollution sources.\nClassified according to the form of pollutants, it is divided into waste gas, waste water, solid waste, noise, and radioactive materials. This chapter focuses on anthropogenic sources of pollution in the atmosphere. Emphasis is on man-made pollution sources from fuel combustion and industrial processes, as well as sources of exhaust emissions from cars in transportation pollution sources","Air Pollution & Your Health\nOur long-term vision is for all people to benefit from clean healthy air all the time, everywhere. To achieve this, we target the largest sources of the most harmful pollutants in our region to protect public health.\nThreat of Air Pollution\nWe believe all people would benefit from clean healthy air all the time, everywhere. In our region, particle pollution, smog, and air toxics pose the greatest risk to our well-being. Outdoor air pollution can cause heart attacks, asthma, strokes, cancer, and premature death. An estimated 1,100 people die each year in Washington State due to outdoor air pollution.\nBecause we are concerned about our climate we also focus on the reduction of greenhouse gases, which are the leading cause of climate change. In our region, climate change will likely lead to warmer, drier summers which increase levels of smog pollution, posing health risks to those with lung and heart diseases.\nIf you have plans to be active outdoors and are sensitive to air pollution, check the air quality forecast on our website.\nLearn about how to construct a DIY air filter to help reduce particle levels in your home.\nWood Smoke & Your Health\nSmoke from fireplaces, wood stoves, backyard and land-clearing burn piles and wildfires contains fine particle pollution, which is one of the most serious air quality problems in the Puget Sound region. Fine particles are tiny, microscopic pieces of pollution that can easily enter your bloodstream and cause breathing and heart problems. The health effects even from short-term exposure are serious, and include:\n- Asthma attacks\n- Heart attacks\n- Premature death\nFine particle pollution is especially dangerous for children, the elderly and people with sensitive immune systems.\n- How Wood Smoke Harms Your Health (PDF) - Washington State Department of Ecology\n- Outdoor Air Quality - Washington State Department of Health\n- Particle Pollution - American Lung Association\n- Particle Pollution and Your Health - United States Environmental Protection Agency\n- Smoke From Fires - Washington State Department of Health\n- Wood Smoke - Your Health, Your Wallet and the Law (PDF)\nDiesel Exhaust & Your Health\nWhat Are the Health Effects of Diesel Exhaust?\nBreathing diesel exhaust can cause serious health problems. The tiny particles in diesel exhaust are highly toxic.\nDiesel exhaust represents 78% of the potential cancer risk from all air toxics in the Puget Sound area. It is also linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, such as:\n- Heart attacks\n- Premature death\nChildren, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems or illnesses are especially vulnerable.

This type of policy can tailored to the exact requirements of the business. A full disclosure of the types of work, vehicles worked on and vehicle values must be made, otherwise the insurer may seek to avoid some or all the cover in the event of a claim. At the mobile end of the market, the insurances most commonly purchased are public liability and motor insurance. Again these are common insurances and most would think the ‘off the shelf’ products would provide adequate cover, but there are pitfalls to be aware of with both of these.\nAm I covered if I damage a customer’s vehicle while detailing?\nA vehicle detailer may expect their liability for damage to vehicles in their custody or control, or being worked upon to be covered by their ‘Vehicle Detailers’ Public Liability, as, after all, it would be damage to third party property which one of the cornerstones of Public Liability insurance. However, despite issuing policies with a Business Description of ‘Vehicle Detailing’ or similar, most Public Liability insurances do not cover these risks. Many policies contain a specific exclusion of ‘property being worked upon’ which is a key exclusion and greatly restricts the cover. Even if the policy does not contain a specific exclusion, there may be a similar exclusion contained in the basic policy wording or the insurer may rely on the standard exclusion of liability for loss or damage to property in the Insured’s care, custody or control. To be sure that cover is in place, it is best buy insurance from an insurer that positively includes cover. A small number of insurers endorse their policies to include cover for property being worked on, albeit with a lower limit of indemnity and higher excess, for little or no additional premium. In addition to adding a property being worked upon exclusion, some insurers add additional exclusions or restrictions such as excluding work on certain types of vehicle and removing the contingent motor extension. It is important to read the insurance documentation provided to ensure there is a full understanding of what is and what is not covered.\nWhat type of motor insurance does a detailer need?\nMotor insurance can be an issue as well. The use of vehicle in connection with the motor trade is an excluded usage in standard motor insurance, whether for car or van insurance. It is critical that the insurer knows that the vehicle is going to be used for vehicle detailing and not for generic business such as ‘ Cleaning Services’. An insurer providing cover may want to remove ‘Driving Other Vehicles’ cover they may ordinarily give, as this cover is not intended to replace motor trade risks insurance which a detailer will need if driving of customers’ vehicles is required. In summary, the key is to be careful when purchasing insurance and to be aware that not all insurances are the same. It is worth spending some time comparing quotations to ensure the product best suited to the needs of the business is purchased. If in doubt, advice should be sought from the insurance adviser."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dd5c4727-15f8-493a-afd6-d61834ab4629>","<urn:uuid:e6e4b4fe-72d1-45bd-bc22-7a4e93e72a0a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How are IEP evaluations conducted to determine special education eligibility, and what recourse do parents have if they disagree with the evaluation results?","answer":"IEP evaluations are conducted by a team representing all areas of suspected disability and may include assessments of health, motor ability, speech and language, academic performance, cognitive ability, career interests, and social-emotional status. The evaluation must be completed within 60 school days after receiving parental consent, and assessment tools must be valid and administered by trained professionals in the child's primary language. If parents disagree with the evaluation findings, they can request an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) at no cost. The district must either provide the IEE or initiate a due process hearing to prove its own assessment was adequate. If parents proceed with due process, they maintain 'stay put' rights, meaning the current IEP services remain in effect until the dispute is resolved.","context":["When a dispute arises between a parent and the school in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting there are a few methods that can be utilized to work out the disagreement. Most School Districts will have at least one Informal Dispute Resolution (IDR) system in place that can be employed to work out the dispute. IDR will look different in every school district but most likely it will involve a meeting or phone call with a District employee who was not at the original IEP meeting discussing the disagreement and trying to come to a successful resolution. IDR is not mandatory and can be skipped if the parents want to exercise their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) procedural safeguards which could include Mediation or Due Process.\nA mediation is a meeting facilitated by a mediator used to find a peaceful settlement of the disagreement prior to starting costly litigation. The Requirements are:\n- Mediation is voluntary for both parties.\n- Mediation may not be used to delay or deny a parent’s right to a due process hearing or to deny other rights guaranteed under the IDEA.\n- Mediation must be conducted by a qualified and impartial mediator trained in effective mediation techniques.\n- Mediation can be on its own (informal mediation) or part of a due process complaint (formal mediation).\nIf a resolution is reached at the mediation, a legally binding settlement agreement will be signed by all parties involved. Once a settlement agreement is executed a new IEP meeting must be called to implement the services outlined in that agreement. If a resolution is not reached the next step would be a Due Process Hearing.\nDue Process Hearing\nA Due Process Hearing is typically held by the state department of education and presided over by an impartial hearing officer. The Due Process complaint form must outline the complaint and the proposed resolution. The other party has the right to respond and can file a Notice of Insufficiency (NOI) if they feel the complaint does not have enough information to proceed. Since the School District will involve an attorney it is recommended that you consult with an experienced Special Education Attorney before filing for due process.\nIf the Parents file for due process they have the burden of proof and a resolution session must be held between the School District and the Parents prior to the hearing. This resolution session can be waived if both parties agree and a formal mediation can be held instead. If a settlement is not worked out in either the resolution session or formal mediation then the case would proceed to a hearing. The hearing is similar to a court presiding and will include opening statements, presentation of evidence and cross examination.\nHearing Officer Decisions are final unless appealed to either State or Federal courts. You can’t file in State or Federal Court until after going through due process. Hearing decisions shall be made on substantive grounds unless procedural violations impeded the child’s right to a free appropriate public education, significantly impeded the parents opportunity to participate in the decision making process or caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\nWhat are Substantive Issues?\nSubstantive issues result in the denial of a free appropriate public education when the School District:\n- Does not address the child’s unique needs;\n- When the IEP does not provide some education benefits;\n- When the IEP is not followed; and\n- When the placement is not in the least restrictive environment.\nSome Due Process remedies might include:\n- Reimbursement – Such as, private therapies, private schools or Non-Public Schools paid out of pocket by the parents.\n- Compensatory Education – Receiving services from the school district that should have been provided over the past 2 years such as additional therapy hours.\n- Additional Services or Therapies both in school and out of school paid for by the District.\n- Different Placement including potentially a Non-Public School placement.\n- No punitive damages – parents can only get back money they spent.\n- Parents can get reimbursement of legal fees if they win the case. Expert witness fees are not reimbursable at this time.\nDue process complaints have a two year Statute of Limitations meaning the parents or school has up to 2 years to file. It is also important to note that if your child already has an IEP and you disagree with any part of it, the School District must maintain the current educational placement pending any proceedings. This clause most commonly referred to as a “Stay Put” means there can be no reduction of services while the disagreement is being worked out.","Click on a heading to expand or collapse that heading’s content.\n- What if a parent believes the school district is not doing its job (i.e. failing to implement a valid Individualized Education Plan (IEP))?\nIf a parent believes the district has failed to implement a valid IEP or has failed to follow special education law, or is discriminating against a student or a group of students, the parent may file a complaint directly with the Oregon Department of Education (ODE). The ODE will investigate and will issue a decision regarding non-compliance within sixty days. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2023 (2011).\n- What happens when a student with an IEP moves from one district to another?\nIf a child with an IEP moves to a new school district within Oregon, the new district must immediately provide FAPE. The services must be similar to those included in the child’s existing IEP, until it either adopts the existing IEP or develops a new IEP. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2230(1) (2011).\n- What is special education?\nSpecial education programs in Oregon are governed by both federal and state law. In most instances, state law and federal law are the same. Sometimes state law may provide greater or more specific protections than federal law, but state law can never limit the protections offered by federal law. Under both federal and state law, school districts must provide each student with a disability a free appropriate public education (FAPE).\n- Who is eligible for special education?\nChildren with a qualifying disability who need special educational services to benefit from their education are entitled to receive special education and related services. Eligible disabilities include:\n- mental retardation;\n- hearing impairments (including deafness);\n- speech or language impairments;\n- visual impairments (including blindness);\n- emotional disturbance;\n- orthopedic impairment;\n- traumatic brain injury;\n- other health impairments;\n- specific learning disabilities;\n- deaf blindness\n- communication disorder\n- What factors are taken into consideration when determining a student’s eligibility for special education?\nWhen determining eligibility, many districts may determine if a child’s condition affects his or her educational performance. Districts are required to consider a variety of factors when determining eligibility, including:\n- aptitude and achievement tests\n- teacher recommendations\n- physical condition\n- social or cultural background\n- adaptive behavior\nWhat are some special education services my child may be eligible for before they turn 5?\nIn Oregon, children born with disabilities until the age of three may be eligible for Early Intervention (EI) services. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2700(9) (2011). Children with disabilities from the age of three until 5 years old may be eligible for Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE). Or. Admin R. 581-015-2700(6) (2011).\nWhat is “Child Find”?\nChild Find is an Oregon policy requiring school districts to locate, identify, and evaluate all children from birth to age 21 that have disabilities and need special education services. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2080(1) (2011). School districts’ Child Find efforts must include:\n- promoting public awareness,\n- publishing notice of confidentiality of Child Find activities\n- ensuring staff members are knowledgeable about the characteristics of disabilities and referral procedures,\n- informing parents about the availability of special education services.\nA child is NOT eligible for special education if the factor in the child’s special needs is:\n- a lack of appropriate instruction in reading\n- a lack of instruction in math\n- or limited English proficiency\n- What type of education are children with a qualifying disability entitled to? What is a “free appropriate public education”?\nUnder both federal and state law, school districts must provide each student with a disability a FAPE. FAPE means:\n- Special education and related services that are provided at public expense free of charge\n- Meet appropriate standards\n- Include preschool through secondary education\n- Conform to an Individual Education Program (IEP).\n- What is a specialized education?\nSpecial education means specially designed instruction, at no cost to the parent, to meet the unique needs of a child with disabilities.\n- “Specially-designed instruction” means adapting the content, method or delivery of instruction to address the unique needs of a child that result from their disability. This instruction also ensures that child have access to the general curriculum so educational standards are met 34 C.F.R. Sec. 300.38(b)(3).\n- In addition to a free appropriate public education, are there other services a child with a disability is entitled to? What are “related services”?\nIn addition to providing a free appropriate public education, school districts are required to provide “related services.” In Oregon, related services may include any of the following:\n- orientation and mobility services;\n- speech language pathology and audiology services;\n- interpreting services;\n- psychological services;\n- physical and occupational therapy;\n- recreation including therapeutic recreation;\n- school health services and school nurse services;\n- counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling;\n- social work services in schools;\n- parent counseling and training;\n- school health services and medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes; and\n- early identification and assessment of disabling conditions in children.\nAlso, a student’s individual education plan may specify that extended school year services be available to the child. Extended school year services are provided at no cost to the parent to maintain the student’s skills and behaviors, but not to teach new skills. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2065 (2011).\n- Who provides special education?\nThe state education agency and the local school district are responsible for ensuring that appropriate special education services are administered.\nOregon’s Regional Program provides services for children with low frequency, high needs disabilities. These disabilities include:\n- autism spectrum disorder\n- deaf blindness,\n- hearing impairment\n- severe orthopedic impairment\n- traumatic brain injury\n- vision impairment\nServices administered through the Regional Program are administered through eight regional contractors throughout the state. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2540 (2011). The school district or the EI/ECSE refers children to the Regional Program, where appropriate. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2555 (2011).\n- Where should a child receive his or her special education and related services? What is a “least restrictive environment”?\nSpecial education must be provided in the least restrictive environment (LRE).\nA least restrictive environment means that students with disabilities should be educated alongside non-disabled students as much as possible. 34 C.F.R. Sec. 300.114.\nStudents with disabilities may be removed from the regular educational environment only when disability is so severe that modifications, supplementary aids and services are not enough in the general education environment. 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1412 (a)(5)(A); 34 C.F.R. Sec. 300.114; Or. Admin R. 581-015-2240 (2011).\nSpecialized education can also be offered in the mainstream classroom, in a resource room, at home, or in hospitals or residential programs. Special education also includes the related services mentioned before.\n- How is a child determined to be eligible for special education? Is there an assessment or evaluation?\nA parent or public agency may request that the school district conduct an evaluation to determine if a child has a disability. When a parent requests an assessment, referrals are not optional. Or. Rev. Stat. Sec. 343.165(1)(a) (2011). The school district is required to obtain the informed written consent of the parent. An evaluation for special education cannot occur without parental consent. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2110(2)(b) (2011). After receiving consent, the district has 60 school days to complete the assessment.\nEvaluations or assessments are conducted by a team that represents all areas of suspected disability. Depending on a child’s needs, an evaluation may include:\n- an assessment of health\n- motor ability\n- speech and language\n- academic performance\n- cognitive ability\n- career or vocational interest,\n- communication and social or emotional status.\nNo one assessment completely determines whether or not your child is eligible or what type of educational needs they require. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2110(3)(b),(4)(d) and (e) (2011). Assessment tools must be valid and given by trained and qualified professionals. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2110(4)(a)(D) (2011). Tests must also be administered in the child’s primary language. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2110(4)(a)(B) (2011).\n- What if the parent disagrees with the proposed evaluation?\nParents are entitled to a copy of the assessments. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2120(6) (2011). If the parent disagrees with the findings or recommendations, the parent may request an independent education evaluation (IEE), which must be considered at the child’s IEP. The district must provide an IEE to the parent at no cost unless it chooses to seek a due process hearing to determine whether its own assessment was adequate. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2305 (2011).\nUpon a parent’s request to determine their child’s eligibility, the school district is required to provide a Procedural Safeguards Notice published by the Oregon Department of Education. The notice tells parents of the procedural protections available for special education students. The school district must provide the Procedural Safeguards Notice in the parent’s native language unless it is “clearly not feasible,” or easy, to do so. Additionally, the school district must provide a copy of the notice every year to all parents of special education students. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2305 (2011).\n- Once a child is identified as being eligible for special education, what are the next steps?\nThe IEP must include:\n- the student’s present levels of educational performance;\n- measurable annual goals;\n- a description of how the child’s progress toward goals will be measured and reported;\n- specific special education services;\n- anticipated initiation, duration, frequency, and location of services and modifications;\n- extent to which the child will not participate with nondisabled child in regular education classes as well as extracurricular and nonacademic activities;\n- modifications necessary for state or district-wide assessments; and\n- transition services needed for students 16 years or older.\n- Who develops the IEP?\nA team meets and develops the IEP. The team includes the parent, a special education teacher, a regular education teacher, and a district representative. A parent may invite additional participants who have special knowledge or expertise regarding the child. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2210 (2011).\n- What is an “IEP” (Individualized Education Program)? Do parents have any say so in the IEP?\nThe school district must conduct an IEP meeting within thirty days of determining that a student is eligible for special education and related services Or. Admin R. 581-015-2220 (2011).\n- What happens when a student with an IEP moves from one state to another?\nIf a child moves into Oregon with an IEP from another state, the receiving school must provide that child with FAPE, including services that are similar to those included in his or her existing IEP until the receiving district conducts necessary assessments and, if it is necessary, a new IEP. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2230(2) (2011).\n- What options does a parent have if he or she disagrees with the proposed IEP placement or services? What are the procedures for due process?\nIf a parent disagrees with the proposed IEP placement or services, or if the parent believes the district has failed to fulfill the child’s IEP, the parent is entitled to file for due process.\nWhere can a parent file for a due process hearing?\nTo file for due process, the parent must send a written request for a hearing to the school district and the ODE. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2345 (2011). The Office of Administrative Hearings will appoint an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2340(1) (2011).\nWhat needs to be included in the petition for a due process hearing?\nThe petition should include:\n- Identifying information and detailed facts to notify the district of the nature and legal basis for the dispute and the facts supporting the parent’s position.\n- It should also include a proposed resolution or outcome.\nIf the Petition doesn’t include these things:\n- The district may file a notice of insufficiency within fifteen days of receiving the complaint. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2350(1) (2011). Within another five days, the administrative hearing officer may dismiss the complaint all together if this problem is not adequately addressed by the parent’s corrected complaint. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2350(2) (2011).\nWhat happens after the parent’s complaint?\nIf the district did not send prior written notice about the issue the parent alleges in the due process request, it must answer the parent’s complaint within ten days of receiving it by describing why it refused the parent’s request, the basis for such a refusal, other options, and reasons for the district’s action or inaction. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2345(2)(a) (2011).\nWhat is a resolution meeting?\nIn Oregon, the parent and district must participate in an informal meeting to resolve the issue, unless both parties agree to waive it or pursue mediation. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2355(1)(d) (2011). This meeting must occur within fifteen days of the parent’s complaint, and must be completed within thirty days. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2355(1)(a), (2)(a) (2011). This resolution session includes the parents and the district. The parent is allowed to bring a lawyer to the resolution meeting but the district cannot Or. Admin R. 581-015-2355(1)(b) (2011).\nIf the parties reach an agreement at the resolution meeting, the agreement must be put in writing. Both parties have three days to revoke their agreement but in the event they do not, the agreement is binding and enforceable in state or federal court. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2355(3) (2011).\nWhat is mediation?\nParents who waive the resolution session may still participate in mediation. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process in which a trained, objective facilitator works with both parties to reach an agreement. Mediation is available at any time up until the hearing. The time span between when a due process hearing must be held and a decision made is not stopped during mediation as it is during the resolution session. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2335 (2011).\nWhat are the parent’s rights at a hearing?\n- The parent must be notified of free or low-cost legal assistance. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2360(1)(d) (2011).\n- The hearing must be held at a time and place convenient for the parent. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2370(7) (2011).\n- A parent may make a request to the administrative law judge for a continuance. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2370(4) (2011).\n- A child may attend the hearing, and the parent may request that the hearing be closed to the public. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2360(5)(c) (2011).\n- The hearing must be fair. This means that the hearing officer must be impartial and that the parent may bring an attorney or advocate. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2360(5)(b)(A) (2011).\n- Parents may present witnesses and evidence and may cross-examine witnesses and evidence presented by the district. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2365, 2360(5)(b)(B) (2011).\n- The parent is entitled to a written decision within forty-five days of filing the complaint, and may appeal within ninety days of the final order. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2355(1) (2011).\n- The decision will be mailed to the parent, along with a description of the method for appeal within the forty-five day timeline. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2375(3) (2011).\nWhat happens to the student once the petition has been filed?\nOnce a complaint has been filed, the student is entitled to “stay put.” This means that the placement and services of the child’s most recent IEP remain in effect until the complaint has been resolved. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2360(5)(a) (2011). Both the parent and the district may agree to a change in placement or services depending on the outcome of the hearing. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2360(5)(a)(A) (2011). In addition, a child who is awaiting expulsion for certain discipline violations may be moved to an interim alternative educational setting pending the outcome of a hearing. Or. Admin R. 581-015-2360(5)(a)(C) (2011).\n- Can a special education student be disciplined?\nStudents with disabilities may be suspended for any one of the misbehaviors in the student conduct handbook that applies to all students, even if the misbehavior is a manifestation, or due to the child’s disability. Students with disabilities are subject to the same suspension rules as nondisabled students, except that students with disabilities cannot be suspended for more than ten consecutive days without a manifestation determination review.\n- Can parents see the school records of their special education child?\nParents are entitled to inspect, review, get a copy of, and request amendment to all of a child’s school records. Or. Admin R. 581-021-0260(1), (2)(a) and (b) (2011). The parent request to review the child’s records to the child’s teacher, principal, or the special education administrator for their school district. In Oregon, the school district must arrange for the parent to inspect and review education records without unnecessary delay, before an IEP meeting or due process hearing, and, in any case, within forty-five days of the request.\nA parent also has a right to request a timely and appropriate explanation of any information in an education record upon request to the school district. Or. Admin R. 581-021-0270 (2011). The school district may charge a fee for copies of a child’s education records, unless that fee prevents the parent from exercising the right to review the records. Or. Admin R. 581-021-0280 (2011). Parents have the right to request correction or removal of information the parent believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or a violation of privacy by filing a request with the school district. If the request is denied, the parent is entitled to a hearing, and if the appeal is denied the parent may still submit an objection in writing to the child’s file. Or. Admin R. 581-021-0300 and 0310 (2011)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b065c7bc-2a42-48f4-9a1c-49f2afae53cf>","<urn:uuid:c3ca4f18-d0e3-46c2-a289-66e0d08cd54c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the timing for high tides work entre lunar day and regular day? Need explanation por favor.","answer":"A lunar day is 24 hours and 50 minutes long, while a regular day is 24 hours. This difference affects high tide timing - since there are two high tides per lunar day, they are spaced 12 hours and 25 minutes apart. The extra 50 minutes in a lunar day causes the timing of tides at any beach to shift by about an hour each day. This happens because the earth spins in the same direction as the moon's orbit, making the cycle slightly longer than a regular day.","context":["Water pipes left over from disappeared houses in Washaway Beach, Washington state. If you count carefully you can see that 4 rows of houses have disappeared.\nPhoto: Orrin Pilkey\n- Low tides and high tides\n- Spring tides and neap tides\n- Storm surges\n- Climate change and sea levels\n- How is sea level rise measured?\nLow tides and high tides\nMost people are familiar with the terms low tide and high tide and know that the reference is to where the water is on the beach, either low or high. Water levels change as the result of the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the oceans’ waters. When an ocean is directly underneath the moon, the water will mound up under the gravitational pull of the moon. On the opposite side of the planet, the ocean’s surface also will bulge as a result of the combination of less lunar gravity plus the rotational force of the earth. These two bulges are the high tides, and in between where the water is correspondingly depressed the tides are low.\nThe moon will pass any point once every 24 hours and 50 minutes, which causes that point to experience two high tides and two low tides each day. Since the moon passes with that extra 50 minutes every day, the timing of the tides at any beach will shift by an hour or so every day. Daily changes in sea level are caused by the lunar tides. In North Carolina, the difference between high and low tide levels hovers around three feet. In other parts of the world the tides may differ by as little as one foot to as much as 40 feet. In Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, winds affect water level more than lunar tides.\nSpring tides and neap tides\nThe moon and sun pass the earth in different positions throughout the year. For this reason, the height of the local tides changes from time to time. The maximums are called spring tides, when the tidal range on a beach is the greatest. This maximum happens when the moon is either full or new. The minimum or neap tide occurs when the moon is in its first or third quarters. The spring tide at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, is typically six feet and the neap tide is two feet. Depending on the orientation and position of a shoreline, it may experience different numbers and heights of tides. In many parts of the world, the tides are semidiurnal, meaning there are two high tides of approximately the same height and two low tides of roughly the same height each day.\nSea level changes over the short term in a variety of ways. Storms blowing ashore cause the level of the sea to rise for hours at a time or winds blowing offshore may cause the level of the sea to temporarily drop. Seasonal wind patterns (i.e., winter/summer differences) or changes related to El Niño can cause rises or falls in sea level that last several months. The most spectacular short-term rises in sea level occur during big storms. The high water levels caused by a storm are called storm surges, which is known to raise the shoreline water levels of some areas over 20 feet! Such a rise is the result of the combined effects of low atmospheric pressure, mounding due to the circular wind and surface currents moving about the center of the storm, and the piling up of water as it is pushed from the deep ocean into shallow nearshore waters. Storm surge carries sand (and buildings) landward as it comes ashore, and sweeps the same seaward on its ebb as the storm moves away and the wind reverses direction.\nClimate change and sea levels\nOver the last 3 million years, sea level around the world has repeatedly risen and fallen by over 300 feet. When ice covers the extreme northern and southern portions of the continents, sea level is low, and when glaciers and ice caps melt, sea level is high. North Carolina’s coastline has been as far out as the edge of the continental shelf during low sea level, and over 75 miles inland from the present coastline during periods of high sea level. The last low sea level was around 18,000 years ago. The continental glaciers then melted and sea level approached its present position around 5,000 years ago. Throughout that time span, beaches were always present along the landward retreating shoreline.\nSea level has continued to rise very slowly over the last 5000 years. In part, this was because the weight of the water on the continental shelf (formerly high and dry) is causing coastal land to sink. About 100 years ago the rate of rise accelerated as the result of a number of coinciding events probably related to the Greenhouse Effect although it is important to note that the connection of global warming and the greenhouse effect is still controversial. There is however no question that global warming is occurring. Global warming is increasing the temperature of the oceans. Warmer water expands and takes up more space than cooler water, so the present rise in sea level is partially due to warmer water. Global warming also is melting mountain glaciers all over the world and adding water to the ocean. These processes lead to higher sea levels. When sea level rises, the beach must adjust by shifting landward and slightly upward.\nHow is sea level rise measured?\nTide gauges provide the best record of sea level as it fluctuates daily, annually, and over decades and centuries. From the longest viewpoint and as an example, sea level along the North Carolina shore in the United States is rising at about one to one and one half feet per century. This number is obtained by taking the average level of the sea surface each year as determined by tide gauges. This rate may not be an impressive number, but considering that the slope of the Coastal Plains (the mainland behind the beaches) there averages around a one foot increase in elevation for every 2000 feet of horizontal distance (1/2000), a one-foot-per-century sea level rise becomes very significant. In theory each foot of rise should push the regional shoreline back an average of 2000 feet (Fig. 1.5). But it’s never quite that simple. Other factors influence the sea level rise such as storm surges, high and low tides, and wind.\nFigure 1.5. Relation between sea-level rise and the gentle slope of the coastal plain, showing why a rise of one-and-a-half feet per century (the rate in North Carolina) is very significant. The average slope of the lower coastal plain here is 1:2,000 (for every one foot in elevation there is a two-thousand-foot horizontal distance), which means that, in theory at least, for every one foot of sea-level rise there should be two thousand feet of shoreline retreat. (Adapted from Pilkey et al., The North Carolina Shore and Its Barrier Islands . Drawing: Amber Taylor","Predicting the Tides\nKnowing when and how much the tides will rise and fall each day is important to beachcombers, mariners, fishermen, and the people who operate seaside industrial and commercial facilities. Miscalculating the arrival and size of the tides can have expensive, even deadly, consequences.\nPredicting the tides is complicated because the tides are affected by many factors. In this activity, you’ll have a chance to consider some of the most important and universal influences, those due to the movements of the sun, the moon, and the earth. In reality, a number of local and transient factors, such as the shape of the coastline, the flow of currents, and the weather, must also be taken into account.\nInstructions: Observe the relationship between the lunar day and the time, then answer the questions below.\nOver the course of what is called a lunar day, a spot on earth that is directly beneath the moon rotates once until the moon is again exactly overhead. Because the earth spins in the same direction that the moon orbits the planet, the cycle is slightly longer than a regular day -- it takes 24 hours and 50 minutes.\n- How much time passes between one high tide and the next?\nThe tides are caused mainly by the gravitational attraction between the moon and the earth, so the spacing between tides will depend on the length of the lunar day. Since the lunar day is 24 hours and 50 minutes long and the earth rotates through two tidal bulges in that time, high tides will be spaced 12 hours and 25 minutes apart.\n- How much time passes between low tide and the next high tide?\nHigh tides are 12 hours and 25 minutes apart and are separated by a low tide. So low tide must come 6 hours and 12.5 minutes after one high tide and before the next.\nPosition of the Sun and Moon\nThe height of the tides varies over the course of a month. The highest highs and lowest lows, called spring tides, occur when the moon and the sun are aligned. Moderate highs and lows, called neap tides, happen when the sun and the moon are at 90° to one another.\n- Explain how spring and neap tides are created.\nThe tides are created by the pull of the moon and the sun. When those bodies are aligned with one another, their gravitational forces act in the same direction and reinforce one another, creating the maximum possible tidal bulges, called the spring tides. When the sun and moon are at 90o from one another, relative to Earth, their tidal forces are also pulling in different directions, so the neap tides are minimized.\n- How many spring and neap tides occur each month? Why?\nThere are 2 spring and 2 neap tides each month. The moon rotates around the earth once in a month, so in that time it will be aligned with the sun twice, and at 90° to the sun twice.\n- Why does the distance from the earth to the moon or the sun affect the tides?\nThe tide generating force depends on the mass of an object and its distance. As the distance between the earth and the moon or sun changes, the tidal force each produces will vary.\n- When will lunar tides be higher, at perigee or apogee? How often does each occur?\nThe lunar tides will be highest when the moon is closest to the earth, a point in the moon’s orbit that is called perigee. It takes the moon a month to complete an orbit, so perigee will happen about once a month.\n- When will solar tides be higher, at perihelion or aphelion? How often does each occur?\nThe solar tides will be highest when the sun is closest to the earth, a point in the earth’s orbit that is called perihelion. It takes the earth a year to complete an orbit around the sun, so perihelion will happen once a year.\nBe the Captain\nClick the image above to test different scenarios of time of year, moon phase, and orbital phase, to see which tidal levels permit safe travel. Then answer the following questions:\n- Describe the conditions that made a safe trip possible.\nTidal ranges are greatest (higher high and lower lows) when the gravitational forces of the sun and moon are at their maximum and working in the same direction. This will happen when the sun is at its closest point to earth (during perihelion in early January) and so is the moon (at perigee), and when the two are in a line with Earth (during the full and new moons).\n- Your sister ship will have to wait to make the same attempt until you unload your cargo and clear the dock. If you leave on a high tide that crests at noon, when should your fellow captain make his move?\nIf the dock becomes clear at noon, the subsequent low tide will follow 6 hours and 12.5 minutes later. So the other captain should try to pass under the bridge just after 6 p.m."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ecb39a58-e477-49e6-98ec-d8a4759f4720>","<urn:uuid:3b47dbdc-8192-493b-8862-490baee36301>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Como funciona el proceso de adaptación mental en niños según Piaget y cual es su importancia para el desarrollo cognitivo?","answer":"According to Piaget's theory, mental adaptation occurs through two key processes: assimilation and accommodation. In assimilation, children fit new information into existing mental schemas or cognitive structures. When information doesn't fit existing schemas, accommodation occurs - the child either modifies an existing schema or forms a new one. This process leads to equilibration, which is essential for cognitive growth and represents a balance between using old learning (assimilation) and changing behavior or learning new things (accommodation). Through this adaptive process, children actively construct their knowledge of reality by interacting with their environment, behaving like 'little scientists' who learn through exploration and experimentation.","context":["Reading Comprehension Practice Questions\nJean Piaget (1896-1980) was a Swiss developmental psychologist and philosopher. Originally trained as a botanist, he developed one of the most important theories of cognitive development in the field of developmental psychology. He was born in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The son of a university professor, Jean was an intellectually precocious child who was interested in the natural world and the subject of biology. Piaget was growing up during a time when Sigmund Freud’s theory and practice of psychoanalysis was developing and becoming popular, which also influenced his interests.\nAfter graduating from his university studies, Piaget moved to Paris and taught at a school directed by Alfred Binet, who developed standardized intelligence tests still used today. As he helped to score Binet’s tests, Piaget noticed patterns of consistent errors made by younger children but not by older children and adults. He formed a hypothesis that young children thought differently than adults. This was the germ of what would eventually become his theory of progressive, distinct stages of cognitive development that people go through universally as they grow.\nPiaget went from France back to Switzerland in 1921, where he directed the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. When he and his wife had three children of their own, he studied their behavior and learning from their births and through their childhoods. He used the techniques of direct observation and the case study, a method of developing an in-depth, multidimensional profile of each individual child. Piaget described children as “little scientists” who learned through exploring, interacting with, and acting upon their environments.\nPiaget proposed in his theory that in learning, just as in biology, humans adapt to their environments through processes of assimilation and accommodation. He proposed that babies form mental constructs to represent their world, which he called schemata. An infant assimilates new information by fitting it into an existing schema. When it will not fit, the child accommodates to it by modifying an existing schema or forming a new one. Because of his emphasis on children’s roles in actively constructing their own knowledge of reality, Piaget has been called a great pioneer of constructivism, the theory that people build knowledge based on interactions between their thoughts and experiences.\n1.

The theory that humans build knowledge from interactions between their thoughts and experiences is called:\nC. Cognitive development.\nD. Developmental psychology.\nE. None of these.\nJean Piaget’s theory states that infants are in a sensorimotor stage of cognitive development, wherein they get information through their senses, engage in motor activities, and receive feedback from the environment about the effects of their motor actions. He formed these ideas by watching his own children, and those of his university professor colleagues, as they learned about their surroundings through trial and error and discovery.\nPiaget called his second stage the preoperational stage, from around ages 2-7 years. Children are acquiring motor skills at this time. Their thought is characterized by egocentrism, thinking everything revolves around them with an inability to assume others’ viewpoints. Animism—attributing human characteristics and behaviors to inanimate objects—and magical thinking—the belief that their thoughts or actions cause unrelated external events—are typical. Children are not yet capable of thinking logically or of conservation, the ability to retain mentally such properties as amount, number, or volume despite changes in shape, appearance, or arrangement.\nIn the following stage of concrete operations which lasts until around age 11, children begin to think logically and perform what Piaget termed mental operations; but they can only do these relative to concrete objects they can see, touch, and manipulate. They can thus learn simple arithmetic and science. They no longer think egocentrically. They can solve conservation problems involving concrete materials, first realizing that quantities of solids or liquids are the same even when their shapes or the shapes of their containers are changed; and that the number of objects remains constant even when they are arranged differently. However, they are not yet capable of thinking abstractly or performing entirely mental operations.\nIn Piaget’s stage of formal operations, which begins just before puberty and continues into adolescence and adulthood, youngsters develop the ability to perform wholly mental operations and to consider logical arguments and philosophical ideas. They understand abstract concepts such as justice, democracy, truth, and beauty, and can consider moral issues. In fact, Piaget also developed a theory of moral development accompanying his theory of cognitive development. This influenced later developmental psychologists like Lawrence Kohlberg, who used it as a basis for his own developmental theory of moral reasoning, which expanded on the foundations that Piaget had provided.\n6.

It cannot be known which is true from the passage.\nAnswers – Reading Comprehension\n1. A: The second sentence states that Piaget was originally trained as a botanist. While the first sentence identifies him as a developmental psychologist and philosopher (B), and the second sentence states that his theory of cognitive development (D) is one of the most important in the field of developmental psychology, these fields are not identified as his first discipline.\n2. B: The first sentence of the fourth paragraph in the passage states that Piaget proposed in his theory that “just as in biology, humans adapt to their environments…” Freudian psychoanalysis (A) is named earlier in the passage as an influence on Piaget’s interests, but not as including a principle he applied to environmental adaptation. Binet’s intelligence test (C) is identified as an instrument Piaget helped Binet to score, and as a source for his hypothesis that children think differently than adults, but not as a source for his proposal of adaptation through assimilation and accommodation. Direct child observation (D) is identified as a method Piaget used to study children, not as containing a principle he applied regarding adaptation.\n3. C: The passage states that Piaget helped Binet to score his intelligence tests, but not that he helped by actually developing the tests (A). The passage says that Piaget identified error patterns in younger children’s test results, but not that these patterns made the tests inappropriate for younger children (B) or that they invalidated the results (D). Rather, these patterns he noticed helped him to form his hypothesis that children thought differently than adults (C).\n4. D: Piaget’s theory involved progressive stages of development which all humans universally undergo, as the passage states. His theory did not involve gradual and continuous progression (A), because he formulated distinct stages of cognitive development. Gradual and continuous development would preclude separate stages. The statement that this progression through stages was universal means that it was not completely different for each individual (B). The passage never says Piaget’s theory had a premise that younger children make errors but adults do not (C). It only says Piaget noticed consistent patterns of certain errors by younger children but not by adults on Binet’s tests and he concluded from these that younger children think differently than adults.\n5. B: The theory that humans build knowledge from interactions between their ideas and their experiences is known as constructivism. This information is given in the last sentence of the passage. Biology (A) is not the name of this theory; it is the scientific field of Piaget’s early interest, which influenced his own theory. It was from biology that he applied the idea that in learning, humans also adapt mentally to their environments through assimilation and accommodation. Cognitive development (C) is the area on which Piaget’s own theory is focused. Developmental psychology (D) is the disciplinary field wherein Piaget’s and other theories of cognitive development are categorized.\n6. A: The second paragraph of the passage identifies the preoperational stage as being approximately from ages 2-7 years. This age range would include toddlers. Infants (A) are identified in the first paragraph of the passage as being in the sensorimotor stage of cognitive development. Teens (C) and adults (D) are identified in the last (fourth) paragraph as being in Piaget’s stage of formal operations. This information is given, so it is not unknown (E).\n7. B: Magical thinking is defined in the second paragraph as believing one’s thoughts or actions cause unrelated external events. In the same paragraph, animism (A) is defined as attributing human characteristics and behaviors to inanimate objects. Egocentrism (C) is defined in the same paragraph as thinking the world revolves around oneself, and the inability to assume others’ viewpoints. While animism and magical thinking are characteristics of the egocentrism Piaget found typical of the preoperational stage, the example is most specifically of magical thinking, so egocentrism is not the most specific answer choice. Conservation (D) is defined in the second and third paragraphs as the ability to retain mentally the properties of objects despite changes in their appearance, shape, or arrangement. Conservation with concrete materials is identified as developing in the concrete operations stage, while the first three answer choices are characteristics of the preoperational stage.\n8. C: The third paragraph of the passage indicates that children can first think logically during the stage of concrete operations. However, this logic only applies to concrete objects; the passage also states that they cannot yet think abstractly during this stage (A). This paragraph also says that children no longer think egocentrically in this stage (B). The passage indicates that the concrete operations stage is the period when children can first perform mental operations (D). All of this information is available from the passage (E).\n9. C: The passage identifies the stage of concrete operations as the first one wherein a person achieves conservation, as long as it involves concrete materials. Students in this stage can understand that the volume of liquid remains the same regardless of the shape of its container, as in the example. The passage states they cannot perform wholly mental operations until the stage of formal operations (D), but the experiment described uses concrete materials, so the earliest stage when a student could answer correctly is concrete operations (C). The sensorimotor stage (A) is identified as that of infants and the preoperational (B) of children around 2-7 years; both are described as stages wherein logical thought has not yet developed. This information is available (E) from the passage for application to the experiment described in the question.\n10. D: The end of the passage states that Kohlberg’s theory of moral reasoning expands on the foundations Piaget provided in his theory of moral development. Kohlberg’s theory is also a cognitive theory, but it is based on Piaget’s theory and does not oppose it (A). Being based on Piaget’s work, Kohlberg’s theory is not unrelated to it (B). Kohlberg’s theory is identified in the passage as a theory of moral reasoning; this is its primary focus, not cognitive development (C) overall. It is not true that this answer cannot be known from the passage (E).","Jean Piaget's model of intellectual development continues to have a profound impact on how children, their thinking and development are viewed. Piagetian theory and concepts (via a mass of publcations and empirical data) transformed the developmental psychology field of the early twentieth century Behaviourist leanings. It is considered that Piaget played a role of the same ilk in that realm as Darwin played in the evolutionary arena (Thomas, 1996).\nPiaget's cognitive theory has its genesis in his background and the chronological timeframe of his academic world. He was born in Switzerland in 1896, and from an early age showed much promise with an abundance of precocity as a scholar with interests in biology. He had achieved a Ph.D. by the age of 22 years and experienced a period of directionless wandering around Europe,on the fringes of the embryonic psychological movement. It was at Binet's laboratory, administering standardized tests to young children, that Piaget ignited his lifelong interest in the thought processes of children. Piaget died in 1980 but is survived by a 'monumental' theoretical legacy in developmental psychology. (Flavell, 1996)\nPiaget was the first theorist to recognise that children and adults had different cognitive processes. Miller (1993) contends (in Flavell, 1996:200) that Piaget altered the course of psychology with his unique observation and questioning techniques so that once \"psychologists looked at development through Piaget's eyes, they never saw children in quite the same way.\" It is from this uniquely Piagetian mode of observing subjects in a 'father/experimenter' role in a semistructured interviewing approach that Piaget pioneered the 'methode clinique'. This significant contribution is still in use today, with most clinicians in this field utilizing variations in their research. For Piaget, it was important to probe the underlying understandings and knowledge bases in children's cognition, with repeated questionings and a focus on the reasonings behind their answers. Such novel insight was in contradiction to all previous understandings of this field. Flavell 1996:202 states that Piaget believed he could learn far more about child cognition \"by noting and querying their incorrect answers than just by tallying their correct ones.\" It is from such 'clinical' intensity that provided the vast wealth of research data upon which Piaget based his cognition theory, much of which largely endures to the present day in some form. Piaget had the 'greenest thumb', in his rich empirical discoveries to reveal his model on the development of cognition. He \"systematically ploughed his way through most of the principal modes of human experience and knowledge--- space, time, number, and the rest\" (Flavell (1963) in Flavell, 1996:202).\nPiaget's cognitive development approach became the springboard for all other intellectual theories. He was most concerned with the structures and growth of knowledge or 'genetic epistemology' and recognized that an excellent place to study such processes would be with young children. Piaget believed that cognitive development happens through the rich interplay of biological processes of maturation, neural development (Central Nervous System and memory) as well as language formation via the interaction of social learning experiences.A child's physical maturation in combination with sensory- motor development enables the active experiencing and discovery of the physical environment. Piaget believed that all thought begins with physical activity in the early stages of a child's development evolving in maturity with complex abilities to manipulate mental functions that are abstract/hyperthetical. Piaget's most famous metaphor to describe this endogenous or internally motivated process, is viewing the child as a 'little scientist' who experiments and explores his world. Social interaction as a source of learning was not emphasized by Piaget. When compared to the Russian cognitve theorist, Lev Vygotsky, Piaget's views are starkly contrasting. Vygotsky used he metaphor of the learning child as a 'little apprentice' with his teachers placed in the central role providing and supporting all possible learning situations. Such cognition is exogenous or externally motivated.\nBasic Concepts of Piagetian Theory\nPiaget was the first theorist to recognise the qualitative differences between child and adult intellectual abilities. He also believed that the child was very much the active learner in an age-stage process whereby the child progresses qualitatively through the stages of cognitive development in a two-pronged adaptive/interactive process which allows for new information to be fitted (assimilation)into already existing cognitive structures (accommodation).\nAccommodation is defined by Lefrancois (1995) as the \"modification of an activity or ability in the face of environmental demands.\" He defines its twin, assimilation, as the \"act of incorporating objects or aspects of objects into learned activities\" (pp.329-330).\nThe end product of this is called Equilibration which results in more effective ways of processing information from the environment. Lefrancois describes this process of equilibration as how \"people maintain a balance between assimilation (using old learning) and accommodation (changing behavior; learning new things)\" (p.335). This state of balance is pivotal in cognitive growth.It is necessary, according to Piagetian theory for children to progress through each stage in turn accommodating/assimilating towards the balances of equilibration and meeting the challenges of 'disequilibration' (cognitive conflict) through the child's life span to adulthood cognitive sophistication.\nIn this model,the phase termed 'Organization' stands alongside the Adaption level to describe the structures of human cognition. From this Piaget utilizes the concept 'Operation' to describe it as the \"thought process... an action that has been internalised in the sense that it can be \"thought\" and is reversible in the sense that it can be \"unthought\" (Lefrancois,1995:342). Here Piaget proposes that the child develops through hierarchial quantitatively different stages, each building on the preceding one, towards an ever increasingly complex array of 'schemas'or knowledges of what is known about at a particular time. Lefrancois' explanation for a schema is simple; \"a unit of cognitive structure...an activity together with whatever biology or neurology might underlie that activity... an idea or a concept\" (p.345). An example of a schema's evolution is the innate ability of an infant to suck for sustenance at the breast eventually expanding the sucking schema to include similar behaviour with tiny fingers and hands, a bottle etc.\nPiaget's Stages of Intelligence\nPiaget contended that children developed their intelligence through a series of qualitatively differentiated stages and that their intelligence was radically different to that of adults. Such a notion was revolutionary for the times, where the prevailing belief was that children's cognition was the same as adults but less efficient in quantitative terms. Piaget maintained in his theory that children progressed through each of the stages in an 'invariance sequence'; that strictly in the same order(Sutherland,1992).\nMany readings of Piaget's stage theory will notice that most academics acknowledge that he wrote about a four stage theory (Lefrancois, 1996). However, recently it has been mooted (by Flavell?) that there are really only three stages. This work will use the three stage framework.\nThe General Periods of Development\n1. The sensorimotor stage; with six sub-stages, (birth to two years).\n2. The stage of concrete operations, with two sub-stages- pre-operational thought (two to seven years) and concrete operations (seven to eleven years).\n3. The stage of formal operations (eleven years through to adulthood).\nSensorimotor Intelligence (birth to two years)\nSub-stage (i) Reflexive Actions: (O-1 month)\nThis stage is characterized by \"mere mechanical responses to outside stimuli\" according to Piaget (Sutherland,1992:9).\n(ii) Primary Circular Reactions: (1-4 months)\nThe infant is capable of primitive intelligent responses to his environment termed 'circular' by Piaget, due to their repetitive nature. Circular reactions are actions (unlike reflexes) that are repeated by the baby himself because of their pleasantness; i.e.sucking a thumb. A pool of such actions is integral in accommodation processes as new activities become integrated by the domoinant mechanism of this stage - assimilation, an example of circular reactions. It is at this time that one canmark the origins of intent, and the capacity to repeat acts. Here begins \"the dawning of memory\" (Sutherland, 992:9).\n(iii) Secondary Circular Reactions: (4-8 months)\nThe infant becomes increasingly more interested in his environment. Actions are now deliberately repeated; grabbing toys and putting them in his mouth. Actions are intended now to achieve goals in a secondary circular reaction allowing the baby to extend it's range of possible action thus building schemas. The baby is able to recognise objects - a rattle - as ones that he can shake. Piaget calls this Recognitory assimilation.\n(iv) Co-ordination of Secondary Circular Reactions: (8-12 months)\nAt this stage the infant's behaviour assumes a more purposeful and deliberate, co-ordinated flavour as this time coincides with the onset of crawling and his whole world enlarges. He is not, however, capable of understanding and searching out hidden objects. Object permanence is embyronic, in that he is able to anticipate in play; i.e. the peckaboo game. Schemas are becoming more and more elaborate.\n(v) Tertiary Circulary Reactions: (12-18 months)\nSutherland writes of Piaget's most famous experiment used to illustrate the enormous leap forward that the achievement of 'object permanence' brings to the child's cognitive development. In Piagetian terms, this liberates the understanding that a person or object will exist even when it is not able to be seen. Mental representations are a key concept in this theory and linked to'object constancy'. The baby explores its rich environment and actively interact with novel situations, objects and events using trial and error to solve problems.\n(vi) Inventive Abilities via Mental Combinations: (18-24 months)\nThe baby is now able to mentally represent himself. He is able to invent his own play activity and play becomes the most important learning realm. With his toys, he uses symbolic representation to transform objects; i.e. animism or the tendancy to attribute life to inanimate objects. Cognition at this stage moves beyond mere sensorimotor towards preconceptual thought and the genesis of early language, transforming cognitive activity in what Piaget referred to as Post-sensorimotor representational intelligence. Here, the youngster is constructing and recording experiences from a language framework, rather than an action base (Sutherland, 1992).\nIt is characterized by pre-conceptual thinking, centration, language acquisition, animism and irreversibility at the pre-operational level. Concrete operations is characterized by reversibility, decentration, classification, ability to order, number seration - large to small and conservation abilities. The term 'operation' is a key concept for Piaget, and is defined as an internalized activity subjected to rules of logic (Lefrancois,1995).\n(i) Pre-operational thought:(2-7 years)\nThe preoperational child is much more capable of understanding his world but markedly different to adults in terms of efficency. This stage is divided into two sub-phases;\nPreconceptual thinking: 2-4 years.\nThis stage is characterized by a lack of ability to classify and regards similar objects as though they are identical in a type of muddled categorization; i.e. all men must be 'Daddy', all animals are 'doggies', all toys are his, one pile of green beads has more than another pile of non-green beads. The preconcepts child cannot hierarchially discriminate between oranges and apples for instance but has a hunger to constantly ask 'what is that?'.\nIntuitive thinking: 4-7 years.\nThinking has become more logical and perception plays a striking role now. Piaget's experiments for Conservation indicate the child is able to be easily tricked by dominant and immediate perceptions. 'Egocentrism' or self-centred understanding dominates the thinking in the intuitive child who is unable to understand the point of view of others. Dominant question is 'why?'\n(ii) Concrete Operations:(7-11/12 years)\nThis is the stage of operational thinking characterized by the child's ability to hold ideas in his head simultaneously as problem-solving is going on. Here, Lefrancois (1995:214) says the child begins the transition from \"prelogical, egocentric, perception dominated kind of thinking to a more rule-regulated thinking.\" He learns the acquires the logic of conservation. This is illustrated by the tall and wide beaker experiment so famous in Piagetian theory (also the two pieces of different shaped plasticene).\nPiaget terms the notion of Decalage to refer to the 'lag' within different tasks, at different ages of achieving full operations (horizontal). Vertical decalage refers to mastery at different stages of cognitive progress; i.e. sensorimotor etc.\nFormal Operations:(11/12- Adulthood)\nThis stage is characterized by abstract and logical thinking, complex verbal and problem-solving abilities as well as hypothesis formation.\nThe formal operatioal thinker is a most effective abstract and symbolic thinker. This has implications in education with a wide range of subjects and difficult concepts able to be applied at this stage. Piaget called this hypothetico-deductive whereby the adolescent is able to conceive an idea and use deductive powers to draw conclusions. Sutherland (1992) states that thinking \"is no longer limited to reality or personal experience\" (p.19). The adolescent is now able to sift through a knowledge field in a process of combinational analysis (Lefrancois,1995).\nPiaget's 'Methode Researche' and Theory Criticisms.\nMuch criticism has been aimed at the methodology and sampling on which Piaget based his empirical data and theoretical stances. He used his own children and those of his Genevian colleagues to develop his huge array of concepts about all childrens' cognition. This very small sample - of academic, high socio-economic status and cultural variables, make for the possiblity that his results/data may be unreliable and, at the very least, unrepresentative. Piaget generalized from a tiny sample base, ignored individual differences and prior learning. His experiments were difficult to replicate and artificial, considered too informal and unscientific.\nAs well, many have criticized Piaget's pessimistic questioning techniques and feel he tried to catch children out in his experiments; i.e. Donaldson in Sutherland, 1992. The use of more optimal language and help is required compared to the traditional teaching styles of Piaget's era. The same source states that he underestimated children's abilities whilst overestimating adult cognition. He is criticized by Hamlyn (1978) in Sutherland for ignoring the value of social learning - in the mother's arms or with teachers, but not as Piaget suggested, in a social vacuum.\nMany critics have found fault with his notion of a lockstep progression through the various stages, commenting that more recent studies have discovered discrepancies in the cognitive abilities within any particular child,and between children. They would dispute Piaget's notion of cognitive 'homogeneity' (Sutherland, 1992).\nThe monumental work of Jean Piaget has influenced an array of academic fields - education, philosophy and, of course, psychology to this day. He left a mass of data and empirical material which continues to be the springboard for much of the scientific theorizing of contempoary psychologists. The 'clinical method' he pioneered continues to be utilized in some form by many. Others have evolved his theory beyond Formal operations, in adult intelligence theories.\nFlavell, J.H. (1996).

{"question":"What are the effects of benefit-based product displays on consumer choice, and how do pricing policies impact market competitiveness?","answer":"When products are displayed by benefits, consumers perceive greater similarity among items and use price as a main selection criterion, typically selecting cheaper items. However, when products are organized by features, they are seen as less similar and there is less focus on price. Regarding pricing policies, companies must choose between increasing market share or profitability, as achieving both simultaneously is not possible. Price can be used as a strategic marketing tool, with options like price skimming (high initial prices) when demand is price inelastic, or price penetration (lower prices) when demand is price elastic and competitors are likely to enter quickly.","context":["Benefits vs. Features\nHow you display products may make a difference\nPosted by Val Srinivas, research leader, Deloitte Services LP, on July 2, 2013\nI recently came across a paper from the Journal of Consumer Research, which found that “retail choice architecture” (i.e., how products are displayed on store shelves or websites) influences consumer choice in some interesting ways.1\nThe study concluded that when consumers are faced with a choice among products organized by benefits, such as picture quality in the case of cameras, they select the cheaper items. Yet, when products are shown according to their features, like megapixels or optical zoom, consumers don’t necessarily gravitate towards the less-expensive options.\nApparently, individuals use different choice criteria in benefit- vs. feature-based settings. When products are displayed by the benefit they confer, consumers perceive greater similarity among items promising the same benefit and use price as one of the main criteria in making their choice. However, when these same products are exhibited by their features, they are seen as less similar, and there is less focus on price.\nAt first, this struck me as somewhat counterintuitive… But as I reflected, it seemed to make more sense once considering the often-puzzling nature of consumer choice. I suppose this is why consumer behavior is so intriguing.\nBoth benefit- and feature-based choice architectures are common in many retail shopping environments – bricks-and-mortar and online.\nLet’s say you are shopping for toothpaste in your friendly neighborhood store. The first thing you will notice is that items with the same brand name are displayed together. This sort of product assortment is typical in most retail settings. But the more interesting aspect you might observe is that toothpastes promising the same benefit (e.g.,teeth whitening or cavity protection) are also shown next to each other.\nBut in other situations, as when shopping for a digital camera online, you might be presented with options organized by features such as megapixels or shutter speed. This feature-based approach seems rather common for most consumer electronics.\nSo what can this benefit- vs. feature-based architecture mean for financial services? Looking at some consumer financial websites, I noted some interesting approaches.\nFor instance, on one bank website, credit card options were presented according to the main benefit offered: cash-back on purchase, establish a strong credit rating, or faster rewards. While on the website of another institution, various types of credit cards were shown by product features, such as annual fee, balance transfer, APR, and so on.\nIn applying the findings of the aforementioned study to these two credit card examples, we might conclude that the feature-based architecture (the second example) would have provoked less price comparison ─ an outcome not unlike most marketers’ wish, perhaps.\nAs I continued browsing, I discovered that financial products are generally presented using a feature-based architecture. Many mutual fund websites typically show funds along the risk-return spectrum or by asset class. However, there were other examples, such as home insurance, which employed the benefit-based approach also in showcasing their products.\nSo what is the main takeaway here? Should financial products be shown by the benefits they offer or grouped by product features?\nSpeaking as a consumer, I think I would prefer to see products organized by benefits as the primary layer. Now whether this benefit-based choice architecture increases price sensitivity is something to consider, of course.\nBut the bigger message for me here is that financial marketers may not be paying enough attention to the design of retail choice architecture ─ how products are displayed, organized, and described on websites and in other information spaces.\nInsights into consumer psychology and decision-making have expanded rapidly over the last decade or so. The consumer financial services industry may benefit from learning and applying this new knowledge to design better product information spaces. The source for such inspiration might be closer to home than one might think!\n1Cait Poynor Lamerton and Kristin Diehl, “Retail Choice Architecture: The Effects of Benefit and Attribute-Based Assortment Organization on Consumer Perceptions and Choice,” Journal of Consumer Research, October 2013.","Product pricing is one of those aspects of the marketing plan that is neglected\n– in some plans it is completely absent! The reason for this stems from the\nfact that all other aspects of marketing can be easily identified and quantified\nwhereas pricing is more of an ‘art’ than a science.\nThe product pricing issues that face any company are very\ncomplex in nature – due to the numerous variables that have to be considered\nbefore understanding pricing parameters.\nA company may have two objectives in its pricing policy. One may be to increase\nmarket share – the other to increase profitability. It is NOT possible to\nachieve both objectives simultaneously.\nWe will now consider the factors that should be taken into\naccount when trying to resolve the question of whether the business should try\nto gain market share or increase profitability.\nThese factors are:\nObjective of the business and the product portfolio;\nThe product life cycle;\nCosts (own and competitors);\nChannels of distribution\nObjectives and the product portfolio\nEvery business should have a series of objectives relating to sales, profits,\nmarket share and return on capital. The business objectives might be such that\nit calls for short term profits. However, the business owner should be conscious\nthat any decision made only for short term profitability will impact the long\nterm survival of the business. This is especially true if pricing decisions are\nmade in an ad-hoc manner it is probable that the goodwill that the company has\ngenerated with its customers will be destroyed due to unreasonably high prices.\nThe setting of marketing objectives for any particular product is therefore\nwithout doubt the starting point in any consideration of pricing.\nProduct life cycle\nAccording to the product life cycle a product passes through 4\nstages, they are:\nIntroduction: Product has been just introduced to the\nmarket – so the price will typically be at the higher end;\nGrowth: this is the stage in which a products sales\nincreases rapidly – price is set high at the growth phase to skim the\nMaturity & saturation: Here the product reached\noptimal sales and plateaus out – price is gradually reduced to maintain\nmarket share and meet the threat of competition;\nDecline: The product ceases to be popular due to a\nvariety of reasons and decline sets in – price cutting is in full swing to\nmake sure that all inventory is exhausted before market demand runs out, a\ntype of harvesting the market.\nThe importance of the product life cycle in pricing cannot be\nunderstated. Obviously the pricing strategies at the different stages should\ndiffer to ensure that profits are maximized.\nThe term product positioning has already been explained. It is a\nvery important concept in setting the price of the product. It is clearly very\nfoolish to position a product as a high quality exclusive item, and then price\nit too low.\nPrice is one of the clearest signals that the customer has about\nthe value of the product being offered. So there should always be a sensible\nrelationship between the product and the price.\nCompetition and potential competition\nAlthough the product has been well positioned there will always\nbe competitors and it goes without saying that the threat of the competition\nshould be carefully considered. In a situation of high competition it is\nimportant to note that competing purely on price is counter productive. The\nbusiness should consider all elements of the marketing mix and how they interact\nto create demand and value for the product should be considered in setting the\noverall competing strategy.\nSome firms launch new products at high prices only to find that\nthey have made the market attractive to competitors who will launch similar\nproducts at much lower prices. A lower launch price might make diffusion in the\nmarket quicker and allow for greater experience and the margin for a competitor\nto enter the market will be reduced.\nAnother key variable in pricing is costing – this is not only\nthe business cost but also the cost to competitors. There are many cost concepts\nbut the two main concepts are marginal cost pricing and full absorption costing.\nThe conventional economists model of product pricing indicates\nthat pricing should be set at the point where marginal cost is equal to marginal\nrevenues i.e. where the additional cost of production is equal to the additional\nincome earned. The theory is undisputed but considers only price as variable. In\nthe real world there are many more variables than only price.\nIn practice the cost of production provides key guidelines to\nmany businesses in setting price. This is called the ‘cost plus method‘ of\npricing where a fixed mark up is added to the price.\nChannels of distribution\nThe standard product pricing theory does not provide insight to\nwhat should be one’s policy toward distributor margins. The distributor\nperforms a number of functions on behalf of the supplier which enables which\nenables the exchange transaction between the producer and the customer.\nThere are a number of devices available for compensating the\ntrade intermediaries, most of which take the form of discounts given on the\nretail selling price to the ultimate customer.\nTrade discount – This is the discount made on the\nlist price for services made available by the intermediary. e.g. holding\ninventory, buying bulk, redistribution etc.\nQuantity discount – A quantity discount is given to\nintermediaries who order in large lots\nPromotional discount – This is a discount given to\ndistributors to encoutage them to share in the promotion of the products\nCash discount - In order to encourage prompt payments\nof accounts, a small cash discount on sales price can be offered.\nGaining competitive advantage\nIt is possible to use price as a strategic marketing tool. The\naspects of competitiveness have been listed below:\nReduce the life cycle/ alter the cost mix – customers are\noften willing to pay a considerably higher initial price for a product with\nsignificantly lower post-purchase cost.\nExpand value through functional redesign. E.g. a product\nthat increases customers production capacity or throughput, product that\nimproves quality of the customers product, product that enhances end-use\nExpand incremental value by developing associated\nintangibles. For example service, financing, prestige factors etc.\nPreparing the product pricing plan\nWe have considered some of the factors that affect the pricing\ndecision. We now have to amalgamate all these decisions into one framework. It\nhas been demonstrated that as a firm develops expertise in producing a\nparticular product the cumulative cost of producing every additional unit falls.\nThis is demonstrated by the learning curve. The effect of the learning curve\nshould be considered in pricing of new products.\nThere are in principle only two main pricing policies they are\nprice skimming policy and price penetration policy. The factors that should be\nconsidered before implementing either policy are given below.\nThe factors that favour a price skimming policy are:\nDemand is likely to be price inelastic;\nThere are likely to be different price market segments,\nthereby appealing to those buyers first who have a higher rage of acceptable\nLittle is known about the cost and marketing the product\nThe variables that favour a price penetration policy are:\nDemand is likely to be price elastic;\nCompetitors are likely to enter the market quickly;\nThere no distinct price-market segments;\nThere is possibility if large savings in production and\nmarketing costs if large sales volumes can be generated.\nGo back to marketing plan guide\nDetailed articles and tools on product pricing"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:81dd6c96-a460-453a-9c42-113712eac910>","<urn:uuid:fe4ff945-1ca6-4ec6-98f6-78aad893c305>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key research capabilities of the MeerKAT radio telescope compared to the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in terms of their observational strengths?","answer":"The MeerKAT and GBT telescopes have different observational strengths. MeerKAT has unprecedented sensitivity and imaging capabilities, particularly for observing the Galactic centre at wavelengths near 23 centimeters, allowing it to penetrate dense dust clouds that block visible light. It has proven particularly effective at revealing new structures like the hourglass-shaped radio bubbles at the galaxy's center. The GBT, on the other hand, operates across a much broader wavelength range (0.1-116 GHz or 3.0m-2.6mm) with its 100-meter diameter collecting area and unblocked aperture. The GBT offers greater flexibility and ease of use, allowing for rapid response to new scientific ideas and dynamic scheduling based on weather conditions. While MeerKAT has revolutionized our view of the galactic center, the GBT excels in diverse applications from detecting gravity waves to studying star formation and searching for organic molecules in space.","context":["From: University of Oxford\nPosted: Wednesday, September 11, 2019\nPublished in Nature today, scientists have shown how this hourglass-like feature, which dwarfs all other radio structures in the Galactic Centre, is likely the result of a phenomenally energetic burst that erupted near the Milky Way's supermassive black hole a few million years ago.\nUsing the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT telescope, Ian Heywood of the University of Oxford's Department of Physics and his colleagues mapped out broad regions in the centre of the galaxy, conducting observations at wavelengths near 23 centimetres. Radio emission of this kind is generated in a process known as synchrotron radiation, in which free-floating electrons are accelerated as they interact with powerful magnetic fields. This produces a characteristic radio signal that can be used to trace energetic regions in space. The radio light seen by MeerKAT penetrates the dense clouds of dust that block visible light from the centre of the galaxy.\nLead author Dr. Heywood, who processed the large amount of observational data which led to this result, said: 'The centre of our galaxy is relatively calm when compared to other galaxies with very active central black holes. Even so, the Milky Way's central black hole can become uncharacteristically active, flaring up as it periodically devours massive clumps of dust and gas. It's possible that one such feeding frenzy triggered powerful outbursts that inflated this previously unseen feature.'\nBy examining the nearly identical extent and morphology of the twin bubbles, the scientists believe they have found convincing evidence that these features were formed from a violent eruption that over a short period of time punched through the interstellar medium in opposite directions.\nMeerKAT has unprecedented sensitivity and imaging capabilities which, coupled with its geographic vantage point for observing the Galactic centre, has resulted in the clearest ever image of the radio waves emanating from the centre of the Milky Way, a part of the sky that is notoriously difficult to image at such wavelengths.\nThese new observational capabilities are unlocking a \"fossil record\" which allows scientists to piece together the history of the Galactic centre and the supermassive black hole that lurks there. Although the structure is likely to be a few million years old it is still possible to observe it, and from there scientists can infer from where it came.\nHead of Astrophysics at the University of Oxford, Professor Steve Balbus, said: 'It is extremely exciting to be able to peer at the centre of the Galaxy with such high definition and precision. This is the nearest supermassive black hole to us in the Universe, and MeerKAT has provided us with front row centre seats. We are going to learn an enormous amount about how black holes feed themselves and how they influence their environments. In the relatively brief time that MeerKAT has been up and running, the science that the team at Oxford has already produced has been transformational. Oxford can be rightly proud of their leadership involvement with the MeerKAT Project, and I personally can't wait to see what more there is to come - this is only the beginning of a new era in radio astronomy.'\nCo-author, William Cotton, from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, said: 'The shape and symmetry of what we have observed strongly suggests that a staggeringly powerful event happened a few million years ago very near our galaxy's central black hole. This eruption was possibly triggered by vast amounts of interstellar gas falling in on the black hole, or a massive burst of star formation which sent shockwaves careening through the galactic centre. In effect, this inflated energetic bubbles in the hot, ionized gas near the galactic centre, energizing it and generating radio waves which we could eventually detect here on Earth.'\nThe event, reported today in Nature, could also be the origin of the population of electrons that are required to power the radio emission from mysterious magnetised filaments. These thread-like structures have been seen nowhere but in the Galactic centre, and there has been no definitive explanation for their origin since they were first discovered 35 years ago. \"Almost all of the more than one hundred filaments are confined by the radio bubbles,\" said co-author Prof. Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\nCo-author Fernando Camilo of SARAO in Cape Town, said: 'These enormous bubbles have until now been hidden by the glare of extremely bright radio emission from the centre of the galaxy. Teasing out the bubbles from the background 'noise' was a technical tour de force, only made possible by MeerKAT's unique characteristics and propitious location in the Southern hemisphere. With this unexpected discovery we're witnessing in the Milky Way a novel manifestation of galaxy-scale outflows of matter and energy, ultimately governed by the central black hole.'\nToday's result cements the great \"discovery machine\" potential of the new generation of radio telescopes as we move towards the construction of the Square Kilometre Array.\n// end //","TAEM- The Arts and Entertainment Magazine is thrilled to interview Dr. Karen O’Neil of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (or GBT). Our publisher had visited the facilities several years ago, and he posted his visit in another segment of the Science section of TAEM. The observatory is a much recommended site for those interested in astronomy and radio astronomy. Dr. O’Neil is the site Director and we are very excited to be able to tell her story.\nDr. O’Neil, Please tell our readers about your educational background and your interest in astronomy.\nKO- I have always been fascinated with the why and how of most everything. I was initially drawn to working in physics and mathematics as these subjects are the primary foundation for all scientific phenomena. Yet the more I studied these two fields the more I realized my fascination was not with the details of how things work as the broader question of why the Universe looks, and behaves, as it does. Telescope images of the planets and other galaxies are both beautiful and fascinating to me, leading me to wonder why. Why do galaxies have swirls and bubbles in their gas and dust? How doe stars go supernovae? Why does the sun flare? And the more I learned about galaxies and stars the more the field of astrophysics fascinated me, drawing me in until I finally moved all my studies and subsequent research into the field of astrophysics.\nI received my Bachelor of Science degree from Marlboro College in physics and mathematics. Both my Master degree and PhD are from the University of Oregon’s physics department.\nKO- The undergraduate school I attended, Marlboro College, is highly focused on individual research and responsibility. This was excellent preparation for both graduate school and my future career, where the ability to work independently and reliably has remained extremely important. The coursework I took was, of course, also extremely important. Clearly the classes directly in my field on mathematics, physics, and astronomy were vital is providing me with a sufficient understanding to accomplish my research career. However the “non-core” courses in religion, literature, and philosophy which I took as an undergraduate have also served me extremely well, providing me with a broad base from which to understand my research and related work.\nTAEM- Please describe the current facilities to our readers.\nKO- The National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s Green Bank site is home to seven large radio telescopes ranging in size from 14m – 100m in diameter. The site also has significant infrastructure which allows for the installation of any instrument which may benefit from the radio quiet location of the site, as well as an excellent test range for receivers and other hardware and a large anechoic chamber outfitted for testing antenna beam patterns and radio emissions from all types of equipment. The primary function of the Green Bank site is for scientific research of all types. As a result the facility telescopes have been used in a wide variety of ways, including satellite tracking, spacecraft tracking, atmospheric studies, monitoring of astronomical and planetary phenomenon, and educational programs. The site is also the location of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s Center for Science Education, which brings roughly 50,000 visitors each year to learn more about astronomy and science. Finally, The NRAO Green Bank, West Virginia site lies within both the National and West Virginia Radio Quiet zones, providing a unique level of protection against radio interference for all projects which occur on site. Facilities on the site also include an indoor and outdoor antenna test range and a large anechoic chamber which can be used for the determination of radio emissions from many types of equipment.\nTAEM- Please describe the Main Dish for us.\nKO- The Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, or GBT, is the world’s premiere single-dish radio telescope operating at meter to millimeter wavelengths. Its enormous 100-meter diameter collecting area, its unblocked aperture, and its excellent surface accuracy provide unprecedented sensitivity across the telescope’s full 0.1 – 116 GHz (3.0m – 2.6mm) operating range.\nTAEM- What is its flexibility and ease of use?\nKO- Part of the scientific strength of the GBT is its flexibility and ease of use, allowing for rapid response to new scientific ideas. It is scheduled dynamically to match project needs to the available weather. The GBT is also readily reconfigured with new and experimental hardware, adopting the best technology for any scientific pursuit. Facilities of the Green Bank Observatory are also used for other scientific research, for many programs in education and public outreach, and for training students and teachers.\nTAEM- What other site instruments are there, and who uses them?\nKO- The site hosts a total of 9 telescopes, including the GBT. In addition to the GBT, these are:\n- A 40’ diameter radio telescope used for educational purposes\n- A 20m diameter telescope which is not part of the SkyNet educational project\n- A 14m telescope which is looking at the Sun’s radio waves to look for, and study, solar bursts of energy\n- A 43m diameter telescope which is being refurbished to work as a ground station for the Russian RadioAstron astronomical satellite\n- Two small arrays of radio telescopes. One, called PAPER, is being used to look at the earliest times in the Universe. The second is part of the LOFASM experiment which is looking for “radio transients” – brief bursts of energy from astronomical sources.\n- The remaining three site telescopes, all of which are 85’ in diameter, are not in current use.\nKO- The GBT is currently open for use by any qualified researcher in the world. Observing time is granted based on the highest scientifically ranked proposals. This mode of operation, though, is likely to change as the funding from the National Science Foundation for the instrument decreases over the next few years.\nTAEM- What recent discoveries has the facilities made in nearby galaxies?\nKO- Some very recent newsworthy discoveries from the GBT include:\n- Using areas of intense star formation to understand and map the Milky Way galaxy\n- Discovery of a new galaxy which, along with its companions, appears to ripping apart a nearby neighbor, the M101 galaxy\n- A surprising discovery of a massive outburst of energy from a nearby galaxy\n- Using the GBT to search for gravitational waves, ripples in space-time predicted to exist by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity\nFurther details about these, and other, discoveries can be found at\nKO- By studying the emission of pulsars – rapidly rotating, extremely dense, stars, radio telescopes, including the GBT, have are commonly used to look for and study binary stars and have been used in the past for the discovery of exoplanets. In fact the first exoplanets was discovered using a large radio telescope.\nTAEM- What programs have been created for GBT’s use in the past, and what future programs for its use are planned?\nKO- The near future the GBT will contribute to our understanding in areas as diverse as the detection of gravity waves, the formation of stars, galaxies and galaxy clusters, the origin of life, the composition of the planets and their satellites, and the scientific principles that govern the Universe. Although the most important science may come from projects not yet conceived, there are a number of key science areas in which the GBT will excel over the coming decade.\n- Fundamental Physics: As I mentioned earlier, the GBT is the central instrument of the NANOGrav collaboration’s efforts to detect space-time ripple, known as gravitational radiation. Direct detection of gravitational waves through pulsar timing will open a completely new window on physical processes in the Universe and confirm this fundamental prediction of general relativity.\n- Stellar Birth and Evolution: There are many mysteries about star formation. It occurs on the scale of a solar system, but can be triggered by events at the scale of a galaxy, through a wide variety of mechanisms. The GBT is ideally suited for measuring conditions in areas where stars are forming in both both nearby and distant galaxies.\n- Origin of Life: How did life come to be on Earth? This question is as old as humanity, and the answer will require research across many fields, from biology and chemistry, to physics and astronomy. The GBT has a leading role in this research, detecting many new organic molecules in space, including bmpre-biotic molecules and basic sugars, both necessary ingredients to life.\nTAEM- Can you proved links to how GBT can be reached by students, teachers, and the public to visit and use the facilities, and can group tours to GBT be accepted?\nKO- The primary link to the public tours and other information for visiting the Green Bank site is http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/gbsc\nInformation about the GBT and other site telescopes, as well as links to the various news articles on the GBT can be found at https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/gbt.\nTAEM- Dr. O’Neil, it has been an honor and a privilege to be able to interview you for our publication. I am sure that the many students who use our magazine as a learning tool for their careers will be thrilled to learn of your work and of the GBT facilities.

{"question":"What makes container growing possible for both roses and the hydrangea paniculata, and what special considerations are needed for each?","answer":"Both roses and hydrangea paniculata can be grown in containers, but each requires specific conditions. Roses need large enough containers to accommodate their root system and proper drainage, with patio or miniature roses being the best varieties for container growing. They require regular watering and feeding since containers dry out faster than garden soil. For hydrangea paniculata, container growing requires porous, well-drained soil, and it's recommended to add compost to help with water retention and pine bark to prevent soil compression and increase stability. Both plants must be given adequate spacing for air circulation when grown in containers, and proper light exposure must be maintained - roses need six hours of direct sunlight, while hydrangea paniculata needs full spring light but benefits from afternoon shade in summer.","context":["Roses and hydrangeas: two iconic blooms that grace countless gardens around the world. Each boasting their unique charm and beauty, these plants have captured the hearts of gardeners and flower enthusiasts alike.\nWhether it’s the classic allure of the rose, with its diverse range of colors and fragrances, or the captivating large clusters of hydrangeas that change color based on the soil’s pH, both flowers have much to offer. As we delve into the details, we’ll discover their differences, ideal growing conditions, and the fascinating role they play in our environment. Let’s take a closer look at these popular flowering plants and explore the reasons behind their widespread appeal.\nRoses And Hydrangeas: What Are The Differences?\nRoses and hydrangeas are two popular garden plants, each boasting distinct characteristics that set them apart. First, roses are known for their iconic, beautifully-formed flowers that come in a wide variety of colors. Each rose plant typically has its own individual flowers, and their petals are usually layered in a circular pattern, creating a swirl-like effect.\nOn the other hand, hydrangeas are appreciated for their large, ball-shaped clusters of flowers. Rather than a single flower per stem like the rose, hydrangeas produce a mass of smaller flowers on each of their stems. Furthermore, the color of hydrangeas can change based on the soil pH, a feature not seen in roses.\nIn terms of foliage, roses have smaller, waxy leaves with thorny stems, while hydrangeas have larger, broad leaves without thorns. Also, the growth habit varies, with roses being pruned into specific shapes and hydrangeas typically left to grow naturally into bushy shrubs.\nAre Roses And Hydrangeas Flowering Or Non-Flowering Plants?\nBoth roses and hydrangeas are flowering plants. They are members of the Angiosperms, the largest group in the plant kingdom. This group includes a vast array of plant species that produce flowers as a means of reproduction.\nRoses belong to the Rosaceae family, known for its abundant flowering species. The rose’s iconic blooms are admired worldwide, offering a diverse range of colors, sizes, and fragrances.\nHydrangeas are part of the Hydrangeaceae family. They produce distinctive clusters of smaller flowers, creating a showy display that can cover the entire shrub. The flowers can range in color from blue, pink, white, to even purple, depending on the soil conditions.\nDo Roses And Hydrangeas Attract Bees And Butterflies?\nBoth roses and hydrangeas are very attractive to a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. They produce nectar and pollen, which these insects feed on, and in return, help the plants in pollination.\nRoses, especially those with single flowers where the pollen and nectar are easily accessible, are particularly appealing to bees. On sunny days, you’ll often see bees busy collecting nectar from the heart of the roses.\nHydrangeas, with their clusters of small flowers, also attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. In particular, the lacecap type of hydrangeas, with their flat clusters of small fertile flowers surrounded by larger sterile ones, are particularly attractive to bees.\nWhich Plant Has More Vibrant Colors: Roses Or Hydrangeas?\nRoses and hydrangeas both offer a wide variety of colors, and deciding which is more vibrant can be subjective as it depends on individual preferences. Roses are celebrated for their wide color range, which includes shades of red, pink, yellow, white, orange, purple, and even multicolor blends.\nHydrangeas, on the other hand, are famous for their unique color-changing characteristic. They can produce blooms that range from deep blue to vibrant pink, depending on the pH level of the soil. A more acidic soil will result in blue flowers, while alkaline soil tends to produce pink blooms.\nHowever, the sheer size and abundance of hydrangea blooms may give them a more vibrant appearance in the landscape when compared to the individual blooms of roses. Each hydrangea head is actually a bouquet of smaller flowers, creating a bold visual impact.\nWhat Are The Ideal Growing Conditions For Roses And Hydrangeas?\nRoses and hydrangeas both require specific conditions to thrive. Roses, in general, need at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. They prefer well-draining soil and require regular watering but do not tolerate waterlogged conditions. In terms of soil pH, roses are adaptable but slightly acidic conditions are often preferred.\nHydrangeas also enjoy a lot of sunlight, but unlike roses, they can tolerate partial shade. In fact, in hotter climates, some afternoon shade can prevent the flowers from wilting in the intense heat. Hydrangeas prefer moist, well-draining soil and can be more sensitive to water levels than roses. The pH of the soil plays a big part in the color of hydrangea flowers.\nHow Tall Do Roses And Hydrangeas Typically Grow?\nThe height of roses and hydrangeas can vary significantly depending on the variety. Some types of roses, such as ground cover roses, remain low to the ground, while climbing roses can reach heights of 12 to 15 feet or more. Generally, bush roses, the most common type grown in gardens, can reach 3 to 6 feet in height.\nHydrangeas, on the other hand, generally grow as shrubs and can range in height from 3 to 10 feet, depending on the variety. Some species like the ‘Grandiflora’ can reach heights of up to 25 feet if left unpruned.\nAre Roses And Hydrangeas Prone To Any Specific Diseases Or Pests?\nLike most plants, roses and hydrangeas can be prone to specific diseases and pests. Roses are susceptible to black spot, a fungal disease that causes black or brown spots on the leaves. They can also be affected by aphids, small insects that feed on the sap of the plant.\nHydrangeas can suffer from a variety of fungal diseases, including leaf spot and powdery mildew. These diseases can cause spots, discoloration, and a powdery white coating on the leaves. Pests such as aphids and spider mites can also affect hydrangeas.\nCan Roses And Hydrangeas Be Grown In Containers?\nYes, both roses and hydrangeas can be grown in containers, making them a popular choice for patios, balconies, and other small spaces. However, it’s important to choose a container that’s large enough to accommodate the plant’s root system and to ensure proper drainage.\nWhen growing roses in containers, choose varieties that are suited for this purpose, such as patio roses or miniature roses. Regular watering and feeding are necessary, as containers dry out faster than garden soil.\nHydrangeas are also well-suited for container gardening, especially the smaller or dwarf varieties. They require a large pot and rich, well-draining soil. Hydrangeas in containers will need more frequent watering than those in the ground, as they can dry out quickly.\nWhat Are Some Common Uses Or Benefits Of Growing Roses And Hydrangeas?\nRoses and hydrangeas each offer unique benefits and uses. Roses, with their vibrant colors and pleasing scents, are popular for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes. They are also frequently used in floral arrangements and as cut flowers. Some rose types are used for their rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C and can be used in teas, jams, and other culinary uses.\nHydrangeas, due to their large, showy flower heads, are a favorite for landscape use, providing a dramatic splash of color during their blooming period. They are also popular as cut flowers and dried flowers. Their ability to change color based on soil pH makes them an interesting addition to the garden.\nIn terms of ecological benefits, both plants serve as a food source for pollinators, contributing to biodiversity in the garden. Their dense growth habit also provides shelter for small creatures.","Our site is reader supported, this means we may earn a small commission from Amazon and other affiliates when you buy through links on our site.\nHydrangeas are a beautiful form of shrub that is quite popular among gardeners. Because they are easy to maintain experienced gardeners and newcomers alike can add hydrangeas to their gardens. Of course there are many varieties of hydrangeas with a great deal of flexibility in terms of their flowers. The hydrangea paniculata, or panicle hydrangea, is a unique specimen for its beautiful panicle like blooms. Caring for them is easiest done by following this simple guide:\nHydrangea paniculata prefer pH levels between 5.8 and 6.2. It is recommended that you use moderate to high fertilization for this particular variety. The soil pH level will not influence the color of the flowers but you do need to make sure you have proper soil pH level so that you can avoid any type of iron deficiency in the foliage.\nIf you are going to grow your plants in pots and you want to move them at any point into their first set of pots or you want to move them from your garden into pots for the winter you can do so once they reach an appropriate size. If you want to move them to protect them from the open environment to make sure that you protect the stems and the roots while transferring them and be sure to move the plants into an area with good air circulation.\nThis particular hydrangea requires moderate to moist watering. You want to water the plants thoroughly without oversaturating them. It’s important to keep the soil consistently moist but never wet it too much for the duration of the growth cycle.\nThe hydrangea paniculata performs best when it is planted in porous, well-drained soil. If you are growing this type of shrub it’s recommended that you add compost to your soil mixture to help it with that water retention. You can also add pine bark to increase the weight and the stability of your mixture as it will help prevent the soil from compressing over time which will increase the longevity of your shrub. If you need to alter the pH level of the soil you can always add different nutrition in the form of fertilizer to your planting medium.\nDuring the beginning of Spring, this plant should be given as much light as possible throughout the day. It’s important that you properly space out your hydrangea paniculata such that they do not cover one another and prevent one another from acquiring the necessary sunlight. If you plant them too close together and they are not properly spaced, the plants will naturally try to stretch out and you’ll have to prune them more often. This is particularly problematic if you are trying to cultivate the plant as a form of natural wall or shrub.\nDuring the summer heat, it may be beneficial to provide a bit of light shading, especially in the afternoons. If you live in an area that has very hot summers be cognizant of this and make sure to plant in an area where your hydrangea will get afternoon shade. Morning sunlight is typically perfectly acceptable and in fact, encouraged for this type of shrub but in the afternoon too much direct sunlight can burn the plant.\nTrimming and pruning\nIf you want to create a more tightly bound plant appearance you can always prune and trim appropriately. It is best to prune the hydrangea in the summer and fall after the leaves have sprouted. If you notice that there are dead or otherwise sickly branches you can prune those off immediately so that they don’t continue to derive nutrients from the plant. With regard to the blooms, you can deadhead at any time. Deadheading is a process where you simply clip away the old blooms once they have reached maturity. This is something that helps to keep the appearance of the plant attractive while simultaneously helps to redistribute energy to forming new flowers throughout the season.\nIt is important that when you are growing these hydrangeas you provide for proper spacing and adequate air flow. It is always best to grow them in an open environment. you can help to control the height and the strength of the stems by leaving adequate space and when you do go to prune the plant annually, make sure you remove any branches that might be rubbing across one another so that you can help strengthen the overall plant and prevent them from damaging one another.\nPests and diseases\nWhen you are a growing hydrangea paniculata, aphids and spider mites are the most prevalent of insects you will see. You should keep your eyes peeled for these pests in April and May and be sure to spray preventatively during those two months to prevent an outbreak in June or July. The middle of summer is when spider mites grow actively so it is best to take preventative measures. The problem with pests like aphids is that once they are on your plant or shrub you have to be sure you destroy every single one throughout the entire plant otherwise they will come back in full force.\nFun fact: Hydrangea paniculata is the only form of hydrangea that you can prune into the shape of a tree."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9fef1902-9948-4d8f-bea4-72f750eeb9b6>","<urn:uuid:6dc429c3-9ed9-4669-8ab2-d2f6d9342456>"],"error":null}
