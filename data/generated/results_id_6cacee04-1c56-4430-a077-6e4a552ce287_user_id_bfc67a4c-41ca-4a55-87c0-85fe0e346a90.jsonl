{"question":"Soy fan√°tico de la cocina y me encantar√≠a saber... ¬øc√≥mo se usa el sumak en la cocina turca? ¬°Nunca hab√≠a o√≠do hablar de esta especia! üå∂Ô∏è","answer":"Sumak is a crimson-colored spice made from dried ground flowers of a non-toxic relative of North American sumac. It is very affordable and is used as a tart seasoning, typically sprinkled on raw onions or grilled meats. Additionally, in the southern Turkish city of Antakya, fresh sumak blossoms are used to make a complex, astringent sweet syrup called pekmez, which can be used to dress green olives for a delicious relish.","context":["Redolent of perfumes and seasoning from around the globe, Istanbul‚Äôs Spice Bazaar beckons and enchants anyone with the slightest interest in gastronomy. Designed from the start as a food emporium, the market the Turks call the Misir Carsisi, or the ‚ÄúEgyptian Bazaar,‚Äù after the nationality of its first tenants, is an imposing L-shaped structure gracing the southern shore of the Golden Horn.\nThe market‚Äôs courses of stone and pink brick arose in the 17th century as apart of a complex of shops whose rents continue to support the Yeni Valide mosque, to this day known as the ‚ÄúNew Mosque.‚Äù\nThe vaulted roof of the Bazaar covers more than eighty alcoves for individual merchants. Shops are small, their floor-to-ceiling shelving packed with vials, boxes, and tins‚Äîextracts and elixirs, cosmetics and colorants. On sale are bergamot oil, rose-water, acclaimed apricot aphrodisiacs, balms for rheumatism, antimony eyeliner, and costly cochineal-beetles prized as a vivid magenta dye-stuff for both confections and textiles.\nBarrels brim with Mediterranean herbs. For savories and stews: garlic, thyme, mint, and the famous Turkish bay leaves. Sage, chamomile, and linden blossom tisanes will soothe sore throats and colds. But if you‚Äôre looking for oregano (and there are several varieties, all called kekik) double-check that green powder labeled super and ekstra. It‚Äôs probably henna, used not only as a coppery hair rinse, but also for painting women‚Äôs hands and feet as part of traditional wedding festivities.\nCargoes of Arabian dhows and camel caravans‚Äîthe peppercorns, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves carried into Constantinople for centuries‚Äîare eagerly bought by modern Istanbullus. Pyramids of tiny glass jars, each holding a few grams of precious Spanish saffron, rise above burlap sacks of local vermilion safflower petals, hespir. At a fraction of saffron‚Äôs cost, hespir imparts the desired hue, if not the exquisite taste, of those sublime crocus stigmas.\nIn contrast to both saffron‚Äôs color and price, crimson sumak‚Äîthe dried ground flowers of a non-toxic relative of North American sumac‚Äîcosts almost nothing and is enjoyed as a tart sprinkling on raw onions or grilled meats. Ropes of dried okra, strung like beads, and garlands of dried eggplants bedeck shops. Golden prunes, Izmir figs layered with bay leaves, Muscat raisins, toasted melon seeds and chickpeas, six sorts of pistachios‚Äîwhat‚Äôs offered in open bags and bins is likely to be freshest.\nBefore purchasing dried herbs of paprika, one should ask for a whiff, or better yet, a taste of the contemplated condiment. Paprika comes powdered or flaked, with or without pepper seeds, and in many degrees of sweetness and heat. Especially distinctive are the dark red, chewy, oily flakes of sweet-hot Antep pepper, grown in southeastern Turkey. Also recommended is the roasted sweet-sour-smokey pepper from Urfa; its fudge-colored flakes are mildly hot.\nAmong the other uniquely oriental commodities offered are the tiny black seeds of Nigella sativa (better known as the old-fashioned garden favorite, love-in-a-mist) and mahleb. The latter are stones of a local wild cherry, and both are used to flavor sweetened breads and biscuits throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Those hard, semi-translucent lumps are sahlep, the tubers of endangered orchids, long used as a starchy thickener of a hot-milk beverage of the same name. Some of these substances are very costly; most are sold by weight.\nWhether a merchant employs the latest liquid-crystal display scales or the more picturesque brass balances, giving good weight is as serious a matter today as it was under the Ottoman sultans. The wooden loge of the muhtesib, an officer appointed to monitor weights, measures, and the purity of comestibles, still overlooks the intersection of the Spice Bazaar‚Äôs two streets. Though the muhtesib‚Äôs tasks are now the responsibility of less colorful bureaucrats, the fanciful architecture of his office serves as a reminder of times when adulterated honey or spurious saffron were grounds for corporal punishment.\nScores of different spices can be purchased whole or ground. Cumin, coriander, and Jamaican allspice (the last commonly enhances Turkish rice stuffings for grape-leaves and poultry) scent the air. However, the dominant fragrance is one Americans may find hard to identify: fenugreek. Component of many curry powders, the hard seed is actually a pulse, a member of the lentil family. Along with red and black peppers, salt, and garlic, fenugreek seasons the much-appreciated air-dried beef known as pastirma.\nMuch drier than American pastrami, both words‚Äîpastirma and pastrami‚Äîare probably derived from the Turkish verb bastirmak, to press. One legend has it that centuries ago, Central Asian Turkish nomads laid slabs of meat beneath their saddles. Salt from the horses‚Äô sweat is supposed to have cured the meat flattened by the sustained pressure of the riders‚Äô bodies.\nSpice shops best described as delicatessens sell huge loins of pastirma, non-pork sausages known as sucuk, sesame helva, mounds of mountain-pasture butter, and fresh and cured cheeses, like the crumbly tulum, aged in hairy goatskins.\nJars of resiny pine-blossom honey and trays of comb straight from the hive look more appealing than those whiskey bottles refilled with dark fruit molasses. But wait‚Äîteetotaling Muslims have long made thin syrups, known as pekmez, from grapes, dates, and other fruits. The most recherch√©, made from pomegranates and fresh sumak blossoms, have a complex astringent sweetness reminiscent of tamarind and balsamic vinegar. Chopped green olives dressed with pomegranate pekmez make a delicious relish, as served in the southern Turkish city of Antakya.\nIndeed, ingredients for regional dishes from all over Turkey are available in the Spice Bazaar and in smaller, neighborhood markets throughout the city. Thus, the gastronome whose entire Turkish experience may be limited to only a day off a cruise ship docked in Istanbul can sample culinary delights from the entire country.\nIt is LEGAL for tourists returning from Turkey to bring spices, dried herbs, dried fruits, nuts, seeds and syrups into the U.S. Importation of fresh herbs, live plants and meat is subject to control by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:717d97bd-1b03-4f15-8ca0-463a96d80703>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do structural changes in DNA organization compare to drug retention patterns in hair in terms of their stability and detectability?","answer":"DNA organizational changes and drug retention in hair both leave lasting, detectable traces, but through different mechanisms. DNA structural changes remain visible in the chromosomal organization within the cell nucleus and can be analyzed using tools like CHESS to detect variations between healthy and diseased states. Meanwhile, drugs become permanently embedded in hair strands through the bloodstream and cannot be cleansed or removed - they remain detectable as long as the hair exists, with a standard detection window of 3 months using 1.5 inches of hair.","context":["By Dr Sophie Arthur\nThe majority of the cells in our body contain two metres of DNA. All of this genetic information needs to be packaged up into the nucleus of the cell, which is just 0.01 millimetres wide. For comparison, the width of a human hair is 0.1 millimetres. Packing a DNA molecule into something with dimensions ten times smaller than those of a human hair takes a lot of organisation.\nWithin the nucleus of the cell, the DNA is organised into structures called chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, so 46 in total. Previous research has shown that these 46 molecules don‚Äôt intertwine together within the nucleus, like pieces of spaghetti on a plate, but that each chromosome has its own space.\nUnderstanding how all of this genetic material is structured is vital for our knowledge about a cell functions properly. A mutation that affects the packaging of the DNA can lead to developmental conditions, cancers, neuronal disorders and more. This array of potential detrimental effects means that researchers need to be able to monitor how DNA is packaged at high resolution. This has been possible for about 10 years now, but so far most analyses comparing 3D genome organisation have been carried out by looking at the data by eye, or over-simplified approaches. While useful, this is seriously time consuming, and it could be overlooking important information.\nResearch from the Developmental Epigenomics group at the MRC LMS and the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany, published today in the journal Nature Genetics, describes a new tool to help overcome these issues. Using a computational technique called ‚Äòstructural similarity analysis‚Äô, the team has developed an algorithm which compares the DNA organisation data from a healthy individual with that of a cancer patient, for example. Through work in collaboration with researchers at the National Centre for Genomic Analysis from the Centre for Genome Regulation in Barcelona, the algorithm can then identify which regions are packaged differently in the cancer patient, to help identify what might have gone wrong.\nThe algorithm works in a similar way to passport control at the airport. Your passport photo is the reference image. The electronic booth tries to match that reference photo to your face on the day you are travelling, and if there is enough similarity then it lets you through. Here, the algorithm applies this same concept to 3D genome data. It uses the healthy individual‚Äôs data as a reference, and tries to spot any differences in the cancer patient‚Äôs data.\nThis tool helps researchers to scan the entire length of the DNA in an automated process, and much more quickly than by eye. It also allows researchers to give a region of the genome a numerical value. Before, they would only have been able to say whether a given section of DNA was different or not. Now, the algorithm assigns regions of DNA a numerical value that denotes just how different that region is, say in a healthy person compared with a cancer patient. The tool can also highlight differences in regions in which the human eye can see no difference at all. It can also help to analyse data from a group of patients much more quickly.\nJuanma Vaquerizas, Head of the Developmental Epigenomics group at the MRC LMS and senior author of the study, discussed the implications for this research:\n‚ÄúThis tool will be used for fundamental biology research and will have direct applications within that. For example, a lot of cancers display chromosome translocations and rearrangements where parts of a chromosome can break and reattach to the wrong chromosome, causing all sorts of problems. This is a feature of many other diseases too.‚Äù\nAnother unique feature of this tool, which the team named CHESS (Comparison of Hi-C Experiments using Structural Similarity), is that you can compare the 3D genome organisation between different species, which could help to identify areas that are conserved across evolution. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt another available tool that can systematically perform this analysis. This really opens up the possibility of having a quantitative and a systematic approach at characterising how genome organisation changes between different samples or species‚Äù, discuss Silvia Galan and Nick Machnik, joint-first authors of the study.\n‚ÄòCHESS enables quantitative comparison of chromatin contact data and automatic feature extraction‚Äô was published on 19 October in Nature Genetics.

Body hair vs. head hair vs. no hair at all.\nSo, your boss asked you to get a hair test. Or maybe your ex. Or your parent. Or your future employer. You have heard all kinds of rumors about what this test can detect and how far back it can go in those detections.\nBut what is true? And what is false? Let‚Äôs take a few moments to dispel the rumors, the myths, and clear up any confusion surrounding drug hair follicle testing, and while we‚Äôre at it, we‚Äôll explain the truths too.\n- How long do drugs stay in your hair?\n- How far back can the hair follicle test go to detect drug use?\n- How long does the hair need to be for a hair follicle drug test?\n- What drugs can be detected in a hair drug test?\n- Can you test for different drugs at one time?\n- Can body hair be used for the hair follicle test?\n- Does body hair hold drug residue longer than head hair?\n- What if I have no head or body hair?\n- Does the hair follicle drug test work if I‚Äôm an infrequent user?\n- Can I ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù my hair of drugs so I will pass the hair follicle drug test?\n- Can secondhand smoke make me fail a hair follicle drug test?\n- Is hair follicle testing accurate?\nHow long do drugs stay in your hair?\nHair follicles grow at a rate of approximately half an inch per month. In theory, if your hair was 18 inches long, and you tested the far ends of the strands, then you could find drugs consumed more than three years ago.\nHair drug testing goes back much, much longer than urine drug testing. When you ingest drugs, it goes into the hair follicle, and then into the strands themselves, where they stay, pretty much forever.\nHow far back can the hair follicle test go to detect drug use?\nThe hair follicle drug test, when using the standard 1.5 inches of hair, can detect previous drug use up to 3 months. If a longer piece of hair is selected, the drug test results can go back much further (in fact, years further) to detect drug use.\nHow long does the hair need to be for a hair follicle drug test?\nThere is only one standard for this test, which is 1.5 inches of hair, cut from the root. The non-root end is discarded. We recommend that you watch the technician perform the test and ask them to cut off and discard the length beyond the first 1.5 inches. This request ensures that the 1.5 inches equate to approximately three months of history.\nWhat drugs can be detected in a hair drug test?\nA hair drug test can detect the presence of virtually any drug or alcohol substance. Until recently, there were only a few drugs that could be tested through the hair, but the list is growing. Below is the expanding list of drugs that can be tested via hair follicle:\n- Marijuana (THC, cannabinoids)\n- Amphetamines (including methamphetamines)\n- Basic Opiates (heroin, morphine, codeine)\n- Expanded Opiates (hydrocodone, oxycodone)\n- PCP (Angel Dust)\n- Benzodiazepines (Xanax)\n- Synthetic Marijuana\n- Buprenorphine (Suboxone)\n- Zolpidem (Ambien)\nCan you test for different drugs at one time?\nYes. There are more than one dozen different Hair Testing Panels. A panel is the medical term for the type of drug screening. Think of the word panel as a package or a combination. Drug panels give you (or the person requesting the drug test) the option to include alcohol in the test, expanded opiates, synthetic drugs, Benzodiazepines, and more.\nA few of the most commonly requested hair follicle drug testing panels include:\nCan body hair be used for the hair follicle test?\nWe can test underarm, leg, or chest hair. Occasionally, beard hair can be used as well. And, no, we cannot get the hair from any other place on your body other than those previously mentioned!\nDoes body hair hold drug residue longer than head hair?\nThere is much debate about the pace at which body hair grows. Many people are concerned that an inch and a half of body hair will retain drug residue for a much longer period if the body hair grows much slower than the head hair.\nThe reality is that body hair and head hair grow at the same rate. The difference is that body hair tends to stop growing at a shorter maximum length. In both head and body, new hair replaces dormant strands and pushes them out.\nThink about how you naturally shed hair. Shedding happens because a new hair pushed out the old one, which stopped growing and became dormant. When a hair is dormant (i.e., not growing), no new drug deposits can get into it. It can stay there 1 to 4 months, so in theory, head OR body hair can reveal drugs that go back further than 90 days, depending on the person. However, only 10 to 15 percent of your strands are in this dormant phase, so the risk is minimal.\nOn the other hand, there are many anecdotes (and a few labs) that report that body hair can pick up drugs for up to 12 months. Although there are no scientific studies that have shown this conclusively, you‚Äôd be wise to consider it when thinking about how to interpret the results.\nThe bottom line is: the 90-day mark is an educated estimate, but there is no calendar in your hair. Accordingly, a positive result doesn‚Äôt indicate the dates that the drugs were used. In conclusion, your hair retains your drug use history, but not in the same way that, say, an internet browser retains your search history.\nWhat if I have no head or body hair?\nSometimes Health Street gets calls from people who want a hair drug test, but they have no head or body hair. A guy recently told us, ‚ÄúI shave from head to toe.‚Äù Well, how did he think we were going to perform the test? We are still trying to figure that one out! The bottom line: no hair means you can‚Äôt get a hair drug test.\nDoes the hair follicle drug test work if I‚Äôm an infrequent user?\nYes, the hair follicle drug test works regardless of how often one uses drugs. The frequency of drug use does not impact test results. It is the period in which the user used drugs that determines the outcome of the hair follicle drug test. Whether a person used once or 50 times in a three month period, the hair follicle drug test will indicate that drug use.\nCan I ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù my hair of drugs so I will pass the hair follicle drug test?\nContrary to popular belief, there is no way to cleanse your hair of any drug substance. Drugs enter your bloodstream and thus, become embedded in your hair, and it stays there until that hair is removed from your body.\nCan secondhand smoke make me fail a hair follicle drug test?\nNo. While secondhand smoke is inhaled, there is not enough of the substance that causes the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (THC) in secondhand smoke to cause you to fail a drug test. This ‚Äúpassive exposure‚Äù will not impact your hair follicle drug test results.\nIs hair follicle testing accurate?\nYes, hair follicle testing, is, indeed, accurate. In fact, it is more accurate today than it ever has been."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2c0858ce-a6a7-45ed-965c-3b199d1f9937>","<urn:uuid:c28fb141-b274-4b11-8597-dfa955e9643f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do recasts and expansions differ in helping kids learn AAC? Ë¶ÅÊØîËºÉÈÄôÂÖ©Á®ÆË™ûË®ÄÊïôÂ≠∏ÊñπÊ≥ïÁöÑ‰∏çÂêå„ÄÇ","answer":"Recasts and expansions both help children learn AAC but work differently. Expansions involve taking what the AAC user says and responding with a slightly longer and more complex sentence - for example, turning 'more' into 'more tickle' or 'she phone' into 'she called us on the phone.' Recasts, on the other hand, involve reformulating the child's utterance to provide a more accurate linguistic structure while maintaining the intended meaning. Research shows recasts are particularly effective when followed by prompts for the child to repair their utterance, with a 64% repair rate compared to 52% for recasts alone. Both techniques require providing AAC models, but recasts specifically focus on getting children to repair and improve their original utterances, which appears critical for their long-term word retrieval and use.","context":["Language Facilitation Strategies\nWell, it‚Äôs Week 4 of the new semester and, in our AAC classes, we‚Äôve been talking a lot about how language is represented and organized in communication boards/books, SGDs, and AAC apps. We‚Äôve talked about the pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs of representing language in various ways, and discussed the options for how to set up displays so that people can easily access the words they need. At this point, we know how to choose appropriate symbols, select appropriate vocabulary, and arrange it in an appropriate format. In short, we know how to put language ‚Äòin.‚Äô Now comes the hard part: Getting it out.\nHow do we get people to actually use the language that‚Äôs been so carefully stored in the no tech, low tech, and high tech AAC tools?\nOur June Strategy of the Month is about techniques for language facilitation. If you‚Äôre an SLP well-versed in language therapy with speaking children, these posts will cover some familiar territory. Eliciting language and responding in a way that facilitates the learning of more advanced skills is pretty much the same whether you are working with someone who communicates primarily through natural speech, manual signs, or an AAC device. There are a couple of extra things we have to attend to, but if you can facilitate language in a speaking child, you can do it with someone who is communicating through AAC.\nWe start by acknowledging that the best way to get someone to communicate is to help them WANT to communication. Once a person in internally driven to want to express himself, everything else is easier. Need ideas for how to cross that bridge? Check out what we had to say in our April posts on Creating Communication Opportunities.\nOnce we‚Äôve created the ‚Äòteachable moment,‚Äô we want to take what the child/adult has given us and use some strategies for advancing their language skills. In this post, we‚Äôll focus on the E‚Äôs: Extending, expanding, and elaborating on their message.\nIt‚Äôs pretty simple, actually. The person using AAC says something and we respond with a sentence that is slightly longer and more complex. ‚ÄúMore‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúMore tickle,‚Äù for example. ‚ÄúMore tickle‚Äù might become ‚ÄúWant more tickle‚Äù\n‚ÄúShe phone‚Äù might become ‚ÄúShe called us on the phone.‚Äù\n‚ÄúShe called us on the phone‚Äù could then be expanded to ‚ÄúShe called us on the phone yesterday.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe go not‚Äù can become ‚ÄúWe are not going‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe are not going‚Äù can be elaborated into ‚ÄúWe are not going today.‚Äù\nThe idea is to repeat a better version of the original utterance, adding something that fits with what you are targeting in your language goals. Sometimes that will be increasing length of utterance, other times it will be a certain syntactic structure, morphological ending, or semantic concept. What you add will be driven by what you want the child to learn. Language expansions have a robust evidence base of support and are frequently used as part of a comprehensive instructional paradigm.\nThe piece that we add for people who are learning AAC is aided language input. Whenever possible, we want to provide a model of that language target expressed through AAC. So as I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄúWe are not going‚Äù with my natural speech, I‚Äôm also using AAC to say it. In some cases, it means that I am sharing the child‚Äôs communication device. Other times, I may want to use a shared classroom communication device or even make a mock up of their display (such as the poster-sized versions available in the Pixon Project Kit) and use that.\nThe idea is this: Hearing the target language is good, but hearing and seeing it using the same AAC system the child is learning is a big part of what will catalyze language acquisition. (If you‚Äôre not prepared to use AAC when you talk, you better be prepared for the child to learn very slowly.)\nOnce appropriate communication opportunities have been created, move forward with expansions and extensions using AAC. Throughout the month, we‚Äôll continue to talk about ways to facilitate language development in people learning AAC. In the meantime, challenge yourself to do a bit more aided language input with the E‚Äôs: expansions and extensions. It‚Äôs a winning combination.\nFiled under: Strategy of the Month\nThis post was written by Carole Zangari","PrAACtical Research: Recasts in AAC Mediated Interaction\nToday, we welcome back guest author Dr. Kathy Howery for another wonderful discussion of an important AAC research article. Dr. Howery‚Äôs work in AT and special education spans three decades and her research uses phenomenological methods to increase our understanding of the lived experience of people who use AAC. She works with the Ministry of Education low incidence team, and as a consultant to schools and school districts across Alberta focusing primarily on children and youth with complex communication needs. In this post, Dr. Howery reviews an important article describing research on recasting in AAC mediated conversations.\nRecasts in AAC Mediated Interaction\nSoto, G., Clarke, M. T., Nelson, K., Starowicz, R., & Savaldi-Harussi, G. (2020). Recast type, repair, and acquisition in AAC mediated interaction. Journal of Child Language, 47, 250-264. https://doi.org/10.1017/S03035000919000436\nWhat this article is about (the focus of the research)?\nThis article focuses its attention on the power of recasts and repair scaffolding language development in children with severe motor speech disabilities who use speech-generating technologies to communicate.\nRecasting is an adult reformulation of an immediately preceding child utterance where the adult provides a more complex or more accurate linguistically structured model of the utterance while using some elements of the child‚Äôs utterance and maintaining the child‚Äôs intended meaning.\nRepair can best be described as a child immediately changing their initial utterance to take on some aspect of the recasting provided by the adult. An example would be a child says ‚Äúdaddy shoe‚Äù pointing to her daddy‚Äôs shoes near the front door, to which an adult responds (recasts) ‚ÄúYes those are daddy‚Äôs shoes‚Äù and the child says ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs shoe‚Äù or ‚Äúdaddy shoes‚Äù or perhaps even ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs shoes‚Äù repairing some or all of the linguistically incorrect elements of their original statement.\nThe authors note that ‚Äúadult scaffolding of child language through the use of recasts is one of the most commonly adopted intervention approaches in programs designed to facilitate grammatical development in children with language difficulties ‚Äú(p. 251). They point to research that supports the use of recasts as interventions with children with autism spectrum disorder, specific language impairment, language learning disabilities, and for children and youth with motor speech disorders who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC.\nAn overview of the evidence supporting the benefit of immediate repair on language acquisition pointing in particular to the research with second language learners, children with little or no functional speech who rely on speech-generating technologies (Clarke et al. 2017), and in young children learning aided AAC (Romski et al., 2010). The authors suggest that repair not only supports language development, but it also helps the child learn about their device‚Äôs language storage infrastructure, and supports the establishment of motor planning.\nWhile they note that evidence indicates positive relationship between adult recasting and acquisition of novel vocabulary in users of AAC, there is no evidence that explores the relationship between the type of recast provided by the adult, the rate of repair done by the child, and the spontaneous use (therefore acquisition) of the linguistic target.\nThat is then what this study sets out to explore- the relationship between the type of recast, child repair, and child spontaneous use of linguistic targets in children with severe motor speech disabilities who use speech-generating generating devices.\nHow they gathered their information:\nThe information for this study was obtained from data gathered during a previous study of the effects of a conversation-based intervention on children‚Äôs production of pronouns (e.g. I, he, she, you), verbs (e.g. go, like, put, get), bound morphemes (e.g. pre-, dis-, un-), and spontaneous clauses ( i.e. an idea or a statement that can stand alone) (See Soto & Clarke, 2017).\nParticipants in the original study, and therefore also in this study, included eight children (3 girls and 5 boys) between the ages of eight and thirteen years who had speech and motor disorders impacting their ability to use function speech. All participants used an SGD. Inclusion criteria for participation included: the ability to display operational competence at Level III on the AAC Profile (Kovach, 2009); the ability to formulate messages through direct selection or step-scanning; having English as their primary language; using mostly single-word utterances in daily language interaction; functional vision and hearing; and having significantly unintelligible speech.\nThe data for this study was drawn from 60 transcripts, which represented 43.88 hours of clinical interaction. The transcripts included utterances generated by the child and the adult during the intervention sessions. It should be noted that any use by the child of a pre-stored utterance was excluded from the analysis. In order to explore change in language use over time, the authors randomly selected transcripts from the first six (which they identify as ‚Äúearlier‚Äù) intervention sessions and then from the last six (which they identify as ‚Äúlater‚Äù) intervention sessions for each of eight participants.\nIn order to answer the research questions, the authors first identified every turn sequence where adults recast child utterance. They then classified recasts into two groups: recast alone or recasts where there was also a prompt for the child to repair their message using means such as direct verbal encouragement or gesture (e.g., pointing to the linguistic target on the device) (p.256). Recasts without prompts were further classified into declarative recasts (reformulation of a statement), non-inverted interrogative recasts (A: What do you want? C: playground A: You want to go to the playground?) or an interrogative choice where the target is presented as a choice (C: I want for Christmas from Santa Claus. Dora backpack A: I want a Dora backpack for Christmas or I was a Dora backpack from Santa Claus?). And finally, they examined if the child‚Äôs utterance (turn after recast) to determine whether the child repaired their original utterance by incorporating parts of the adult‚Äôs recast/model (partial repair) or all of the adult‚Äôs modeled words (full repair).\nTo answer the question what is the relationship between child repair and spontaneous use of linguistic targets, Soto et al. sampled from all of the words model as recasts across participants and sessions. They then looked at the 15 words most frequently used by typically developing school-aged children of comparable developmental age in the United States. Those 15 words had been targeted during intervention across all participants. These words were: I, it, he, she (pronouns) am, is, was, were (copula forms), go, went, like, like (verbs), the (article), because (conjunction), and to (preposition). Calculations were then done to see which of those 15 words had been:\n- a) recasted or recasted plus prompted;\n- b) repaired by the child immediately following adult recast or plus prompt to repair; and\n- c) used spontaneously (not following a recast or prompt) by the child.\nFinally, they also identified words that the children had used spontaneously in later sessions that had NOT been used spontaneously in earlier sessions to see if they had been found in a recast ‚Äìrepair sequence in the earlier sessions.\nWhat the authors learned from their study:\nIn order to share what the authors found I will, as they do, break the results down into answers to their two research questions.\nQuestion 1. What is the relationship between the type of recast and child repair?\nIn an effort to present the data in a more easily understandable I have chosen to put it into a series of three tables.\n- Rate of child repair for recasts presented alone ‚Äì 52%\n- interrogative choice ‚Äì 81% rate of repair\n- declarative recast ‚Äì 57%\n- non-inverted interrogative recast ‚Äì 29%\n- Rate of repair for recasts of any time followed by a prompt was 64%\nStatistical analysis on the data indicated that recasts followed by a prompt to repair yielded a significantly (p<.001) higher rate of child repair than recasts presented alone. Additionally, the authors found a significant relationship between the type of recast and rate of child repair (this can be seen in the tables above with interrogative choice recasts clearly yielding the most repairs by the children).\nSo one can say, recasting helps to encourage the child to repair their utterance, recasting with a prompt for repair helps more.\nAnd, the kind of recast matters! Or, all recasts are not created equal.\nQuestion 2: What is the relationship between child repair and spontaneous use of linguistic targets?\nNo child showed spontaneous use of the 15 words targeted in the study during the baseline session (prior to intervention).\nOnly two children showed spontaneous use some (Child 1 I, Child 2 He She am is the and to) use of the linguistic targets in the early intervention sessions.\nAll eight participants showed spontaneous use of at least one target in the later intervention sessions.\nFollowing the statistical analysis based on the six participants who spontaneously used four or more targets during the later session, the authors suggest that the repair of the linguistic target during earlier sessions may have contributed to its spontaneous use in later sessions.\nTheir conclusions therefore were:\n- When recasts are followed by a prompt to repair, children are most likely to do so.\n- There is a significant relationship between the type of recast and the child repair. It appears that this is based upon the participants‚Äô ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù evaluation of the pragmatic functions of the recasts. Interrogative choice was commonly treated as forced-choice where the child was obliged to choose one of the options presented by the adult. Non-inverted interrogative choice, in contrast, could be responded to with a simple ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô.\nFurther, their findings were consistent with existing research in AAC that suggests a relationship between child output and learning of linguistic targets. While adult input is crucial, this study reinforces the idea that ‚Äúinput alone is not sufficient to cause change in a child‚Äôs communicative competence when using speech generating technologies‚Äô‚Äù(p. 261, emphasis added).\nThey conclude by suggesting for children who use SGDs language use through immediate repair may be critical for long-term word retrieval and use; perhaps due to the extra demands of the device (organizational structure of language, motor plans, etc.) far more so than is the case for naturally speaking children.\nWhy is this article important for practice?\nThere are several reasons that I believe this article is important for AAC practice.\n- Firstly, although perhaps one shouldn‚Äôt have to point this out, this article implicitly stresses the importance of therapeutic language intervention for children and youth who require AAC. This may be something that most clinicians, at least in the United States, take for granted, but in my experience in my province in Canada, it is not. In my experience children and youth with complex communication needs who are learning to use SGDs to communicate more effectively with others and to develop language are often followed by a consultative model with little to no direct therapy being provided by speech-language pathologists. The Soto et al. article, along with others they cite such as Binger, Maguire-Marshall, & Kent-Walsh (2011) and Romski, et al. (2010) point to the fact that like other children who experience challenges in learning to express themselves effectively through language, children and youth with AAC need and deserve the kind of systematic, evidence-based therapies that we seem to take for granted for children and youth with fluency dysfunction, specific language impairment, dyspraxia, and so on. The evidence that systematic language intervention makes a difference is clear from this work. It is I would argue the role of all of us who are involved in supporting children and youth with complex communication needs to be effective communicators through language, albeit not alternative forms of language, to advocate for what this and other research suggests is necessary.\nvon Tetzchner (2017) suggests AAC is a ‚ÄúAAC represents a developmental pathway to communication and language competence‚Äù, it behooves us to treat it as such.\n- So given my previous argument that this article reminds us that children and youth who are learning to use SGDs need language therapy, the second reason this article is important is that it provides clinicians with guidance to maximize the effect of their interventions by including a range of recasts and prompts for the child to repair.\nSoto et al.‚Äôs research suggests it is not merely recasting that is important but that we must provide a variety of recasts and prompts. If, for example, our recasts were primarily non-inverted interrogatives e.g. C: puppy A: Do you see a puppy? it was shown to be far less likely for the child to respond with a repair perhaps even when prompted as they can just say ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\nTherapy sessions, as well as suggestions for teachers, parents, and others interacting with children and youth who are learning so speak through SGDs need to be informed by the idea that not all recasts are created equally, and we can use this along with other research in the field of AAC to thoughtful interact and support interactions that grow language, both receptively AND expressively.\n- Which brings me to the third reason that this article is important for practice. That is, that repairing matters. When the children repaired their utterances they were more likely to use those forms in later spontaneous speech. In the field of psycholinguistics Michael Tomasello, in particular, has argued for a usage-based theory of language acquisition. His contention is that children learn language by USING language, not only by being immersed in a language-rich environment. To quote the curator of this blog, Dr. Carole Zangari, ‚Äúlanguage doesn‚Äôt grow out of silence‚Äù (Zangari, 2016). It behooves us to encourage children and youth with CCN to use their AAC systems as well as having us model their systems with and for them. As the authors suggest it is perhaps because of the additional demands (linguistic, operational, motoric) put on children and youth who are learning to use SGDs what encouraging them to respond, and repair their responses is crucial.\n- More than modeling! This article underscores the need to go beyond modeling when providing therapy and scaffolding for those children and youth who are learning to use AAC to communicate and develop language. While the evidence for modeling seems solid (see for example Allen, et al., 2017) it may be that the field needs to look again at our practices and question whether as some, including at some points, unfortunately, myself, have suggested that ‚Äúmodeling (aided language stimulation) all day, every day is desired in AAC, with no requirement of a response.‚Äù (ATIA, 2016 cited by Soto, Zangari & Van Tatenhove, 2020).\nThis article and others mentioned in their review bring that assumption into question. It also, I hope brings the very question of what ‚Äúmodeling‚Äù is into question. Soto et al., I believe, challenge us to look deeper and to think deeper about what we know about communication and language development to develop our practices that include aided language stimulation without doubt, but also scaffold, prompt, and overall support AAC development through use by the child.\n- Finally, and again perhaps not necessary to say but I will anyway. The conversational interventions, the recasts, and the prompting for repair in the Soto el al. article ALL started by following the child‚Äôs lead ‚Äì that is talking about (communicating about) what THEY were interested in talking about (communicating about) as the starting point. While this certainly is not the main idea of the article, it is I believe something that it reminds of us of, and that perhaps is worth repeating over and over and over ‚Äì language develops through authentic social interaction, more often than not when the child takes the lead üòâ\nAllen, A.

(NYSE: RSG), a leader in the recycling and waste services industry, are pleased to announce a partnership in support of the Alabama Oyster Shell Recycling Program, the first-of-its-kind in the local area.\nFunded through a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the program helps to support the sustainable growth and rehabilitation of oyster harvests inAlabama, as well as the livelihood of the fishing industry in theGulf of Mexico.\nOyster shells that are collected through this program will go back into Alabama waters to help more oysters grow, provide habitat, limit erosion and improve water quality.\n\"The Alabama Coastal Foundation uses an inclusive, environmental stewardship approach to accomplish our work,\" saidMark Berte, executive director at the Alabama Coastal Foundation. \"One of the reasons this program has had such a successful start is the relationship that we have with Republic Services. Working together, we have established a solid foundation that continues to help get a vital natural resource back into the water. We appreciate the reliable, quality service that Republic provides, and look forward to building on that success in the future.\"\nOriginal Oyster House was among the first restaurants to Pilot Alabama‚Äôs Oyster Shell Recycling Program.\nWith 28 restaurants currently committed to the program, and plans to expand that number this year, ACF partners with Republic to collect oyster shells from coastal restaurants three times per week. The shells are then transported to the Alabama Marine Resources Division where they undergo a curing process. Once ready, the repurposed shells are then deposited in designated locations along theAlabamacoast where they become the building blocks of newly restored oyster beds.\nChris Blankenship, director of Alabama Marine Resources Division, stands atop oyster shells that will be returned to Alabama waters.\n\"We are committed to being a good neighbor in the communities we are fortunate to serve,\" saidJamey Amick, area president at Republic Services.\n\"This means providing our customers with sustainable solutions while fulfilling our promise to responsibly regenerate the environment with the materials we are entrusted to handle every day. We are proud to partner with the ACF, and to support their efforts to help rehabilitate the oyster harvests along theAlabamacoast,\" Amick added.\nMore than 40 percent of the nation's seafood is derived from the GulfCoast. Sustaining and replenishing the habitat for the GulfCoast marine life is vital toAlabama'seconomy and environment.\nIn addition to food value, oysters provide many other ecosystem benefits, including:\nImproving water quality: an adult oyster can filter 15 gallons of water per day;\nProviding habitat: oyster reefs provide safe habitat for fish, shrimp, crabs, birds, and other animals; and\nLimiting erosion: oyster reefs are natural breakwaters that protect shorelines.\nIn its infancy, the program has already collected over 2 million oyster shells, which is equal to the weight of approximately 40 adult elephants. That is enough oyster shells to fill 31 waste collection trucks, or cover 5.5 acres in the Gulf.\nNatural oyster shell is critical and the preferred material for oyster larvae to attach to and grow on. Reefs protect coastline from erosion and tidal surge during inclement weather and Alabama is historically the largest processors of oysters in America. Getting oyster shells back in Alabama waters will affect everyone from the oysterman, to the processor, to the distributors, to the restaurateurs and to the consumer.\nAbout Alabama Coastal Foundation\nThe Alabama Coastal Foundation's mission is to improve and protectAlabama'scoastal environment through cooperation, education and participation. The organization pursues practical solutions to conservation challenges in a non-partisan manner. ACF is dedicated to partner with businesses, local government and other non-profits to achieve common ground solutions to our environmental problems.\nAbout the Alabama Oyster Shell Recycling Program\nThe National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) is providing the funding for this project as a part of the Gulf Coast Conservation Grants Program (GCCGP). This project is being led by the Alabama Coastal Foundation. To ensure the success of this project, ACF has established an Advisory Committee including restaurant owners and chefs in addition to representatives from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, The Nature Conservancy, Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant, and the Mobile Bay Oyster Gardening Program. The first phase of the project began along the Causeway in October of 2016 and expanded with restaurants in OrangeBeach andGulfShoresin spring of 2017.\nThe shells are transported to the Alabama Marine Resources Division where they undergo a curing process.\nAbout Republic Services\nRepublic Services, Inc.

{"question":"What's the main difference between how ceramic tiles and timber flooring handle expansion? ü§î I'm doing some renovations and want to understand how they work differently!","answer":"Ceramic tiles and timber flooring handle expansion differently. For ceramic tiles, grout joints are required in all floor applications (with 1/4 inch or smaller being acceptable) and tiles should never be butted together, as floor settling will cause shearing and buckling. For timber flooring, expansion gaps are required at the perimeter between the floorboards and wall, and sometimes within the floor itself. Timber products contain hygroscopic materials that attract and hold water molecules, causing expansion in humid weather and contraction in dry weather. For example, laminate flooring typically needs an expansion gap every 8-metre span, and these gaps are usually covered by skirting boards or beading.","context":["ceramic tile floors\nCeramic Tile FlooringCeramic tile floors have become much more popular with consumers today, and this is in large part due to the vast improvements that have been made not only in their design and color, but also the strength at which they are being manufactured. The industry has evolved tremendously from the days of the nubby soft pink bisque and primitive glazing techniques similar to the 8 by 8 Pergamina (ancient by today's standards).\nTile made of Porcelain in sizes 16 by 16\nand larger exceed the wear ratings of the previous softer bisque\nand glazed choices of yesterday by leaps and bounds. For instance,\nit wasn't unusual for products made 20 years ago to begin showing signs of\nwear in high traffic areas in 3 or 4 years after installation. The\nglazed surface would actually wear down enough to become dull and\nunsightly. Chipping was also a problem whenever something was dropped on\nA room 12 by 12 in size will actually appear larger to the eye because of being less busy, more open and spacious when using lets say a piece 16 by 16 than it would if you had used a 12 by 12 square. The number of grout lines is drastically reduced as the size of the piece increases, creating this allusion. The basic rule of thumb is this... The larger the square - the fewer the grout lines, the fewer the grout lines - the less busy, the less busy - the more open and spacious, the more open and spacious - the larger a room looks.\nCeramic Tile Wear Ratingstoday is rated by the Porcelain Enamel Institute (PEI) for wearability. This is a number rating scale that goes from a PEI classification of 0 (not good) to 5 (very good). What do these numbers mean? They basically indicate the areas of use recommended by the manufacturer. For instance, one rated PEI 2 should only be considered for an area where very low traffic and soiling is expected. In this classification will be the high gloss selections with vibrant colors which are aesthetically pleasing, but not long wearing.\nOn the other hand, a PEI 5 indicates something designed for heavy commercial wear and traffic. Most good quality Porcelain will have a wear rating of 5, meaning it is the strongest you can buy. It must be mentioned though, that therating system is only for determining wear expectations, not the actual quality of the product. The factors determining quality are calibration (are all pieces the same size), squareness of edges (is there any warpage), and consistency of surface texture (are there imperfections such as small visible cracks in the glaze).\nCeramic Tile QualityQuality then, is just as important a consideration as the wear rating is, for a number of reasons. First, when the installer considers the lay-out of a particular job, his first priority should be setting the individual pieces as close as what is reasonable. Grout joints are required in all floor applications, with anything 1/4 inch or smaller acceptable. At no time should squares be butted together, for when the floor settles (and they all do) shearing (coming up off the floor) and buckling will occur.\nAt any rate, let's\nsay each of the pieces are consistent in size with one another. This is a good\nthing, for because they are calibrated well, the installer can set\na close joint (lets say 3/16 of an inch or even a little closer) and all\nof the grout lines will be uniform. It's not unusual though for a poor\nquality line to have squares within the same shipment and dye lot vary\nas much as an 1/8 of an inch from one another. Calibration is\nterrible (some would say unacceptable) and the end result will be larger\nand considerably more inconsistent size grout lines.\nhave to be much more selective in deciding which pieces to install and\nwhich to set aside when dealing with poorer quality choices. This slows\ndown the job considerably, ultimately costing the installer not only\ntime but money. Installers are not magicians, and cannot make that which\nis crooked and warped, straight. They can only deal with the variables\nthat are present and make the best of it.\n¬© 2010 FloorBiz, Inc. All Rights Reserved","Almost all timber flooring products require expansion gaps to cater for adequate floor expansion. This requirement is applicable to all timber related flooring products including laminate flooring, strand woven bamboo flooring, both tongue and groove and click lock joint system engineered Timber floorboards and solid tongue and groove.\nAlmost all timber related flooring products will contain hygroscopic materials like natural timber fibres that will attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is more likely to occur during more humid weather or weather with high relative humidity causing the floorboards to expand. During drier weather, the floorboards will lose moisture and contract. Laminate and engineered timber flooring maybe a little bit more resistant to obvious expansion and contraction due to their material make up. Laminate flooring is made of a timber fibre board core that is covered on top by several layers of melamine layers and a stabilising layer underneath while engineered timber flooring core is made up of cross laminated timber layers making them comparatively more stable to solid timber flooring.\nAll timber flooring installation instructions and local industry standards will require that floors are installed with expansion allowance. All timber floors will require expansion gaps at the perimeter of the floor, between the timber floorboards and the wall. The gap is then usually covered by skirting board or by beading or scotia. Sometimes it is also necessary to have expansion joints within the floor. As a general rule, an expansion gap will be required every 8-metre span for laminate flooring. However, different laminate flooring and other timber floorboards have differing requirements. It is best to consult the installation instructions of your flooring product or contact your supplier for advice.\nThere are numerous consequences of not installing adequate expansion allowance or insufficient expansion allowances that can affect the floor‚Äôs performance. This can come in visual forms such as buckling and peaking at board edges and ends or in other forms such as squeaking near the wall (and not of the subfloor/substrate). Ultimately, your flooring contractor or installer will decide if expansion joints are required within a floor and there may be room for negotiation in terms of where the expansion will be placed. If the flooring contactor or installer decides that an expansion joint is required, then there isn‚Äôt the option to not have them. A friend‚Äôs floor not having them is not a sufficient reason as the makeup of the dwelling, the location and the flooring product used will most likely be different and cannot be compared. Not having sufficient expansion allowance may affect your flooring product‚Äôs warranty as well.\nIt is also important to consider expansion allowance around all fixed objects, including internal columns, pipes and other floor surfaces such as ceramic tiles. The nature of floating floors is such that it is not fixed or anchored to the subfloor and their timber core is not orientated in any direction and so their expansion movements are not restrained and can expand at an equal rate in both their length and width. It is laid on top of foam or rubber underlay and will move to weather changes and to foot traffic. It is important that floating floor is laid around kitchen island benches and built-in wardrobes and its movement not be restrained by heavy benches and similar objects.\nThere are several expansion joints and trims that can be used to conceal the gaps between the floor and the wall and between two floor surfaces. The most common method used to cover perimeter gap is to install laminate beading or scotia that can be attached to the existing skirting board or the wall with either flexible timber adhesive or brad nails. Some customers may prefer to use new or the existing skirting boards but you may have to consider the damage that maybe caused by removing the existing skirting board from the wall, especially if it is a plasterboard wall. For expansion joints within the floor there is a range of profiles made from laminated MDF with matching decorative paper or coated aluminium with similar colours that are available for purchase.\nAll information and tips in this publication are of a general nature only and Advanced Flooring Services does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information and tips in this publication.

They emphasize year-round conservation as necessary to maintain streamflows and preserve groundwater for autumn uses. Meanwhile, North Marin Water District implements specific mandatory restrictions, including limiting overhead sprinkler irrigation to three days per week, prohibiting wasteful practices like washing sidewalks, and requiring leak repairs within 72 hours. They've also modernized their infrastructure with Advanced Meter Information systems and extensive recycled water programs. Both regions recognize the connection between surface water and groundwater, with Sonoma County focusing on long-term sustainability planning and North Marin implementing immediate usage controls and technological solutions.","context":["‚ÄúAll of us must be protective of all our water sources in order to ensure sustainability for all uses, including what regulators term ‚Äúbeneficial uses,‚Äù which is pretty much everything and everyone, since water is essential to life.‚Äù\nSummer is upon us, and as the hills in our region turn from the lush green of spring to tawny brown dotted with the dark green of oaks, pines and redwoods, we are confronted with the arid nature of our climate. We might collectively feel like water is more precious at this time of year, and our instinctive nature as Californians would incline us to take shorter showers, wash the car less and make sure we water only as much as needed.\nWhile water availability and allocation has been an issue for decades across the state, the recent drought (of which much of the state suffers) it is more important than ever to know where our water comes from, the pressures our water system faces and what we can do to help ensure this natural resource remains in abundance for all our communities. After all, water is life.\nRue Furch, one of Redwood Chapter‚Äôs stalwart volunteers, is a member of the Groundwater Sustainability Agency for the Santa Rosa groundwater basin. The GSA was formed in 2017 to advise management of the local basin. It is one of many GSAs around California tasked with developing, implementing, and enforcing a basin‚Äôs groundwater sustainability program.\nHere, Furch answers some pertinent questions about water in our region and state, conservation and how we can be more cognizant and proactive with our water resources.\nREDWOOD CHAPTER: In this present time, as we are moving into summer and fall and we start thinking more about water conservation, how does groundwater play into the conversation and why is thinking about it important?\nRUE FURCH: The State of California is the last state in the nation to regulate groundwater and has now recognized the interaction of surface and groundwater more formally. While the seasonal rains have provided more water than had been expected this year, we still require sustainable water supply for increasing uses. Our region historically had fewer draws on groundwater. But as agriculture has shifted from dry-land farming to more reliance on irrigation, our population has increased, and our private wells have proliferated‚Äîour reliance on groundwater has increased.\nWhile some groundwater is in aquifers that should be considered in geologic time as some hold sea water, most of our wells draw from aquifers that are fed by surface water, which percolates slowly into the soils recharging the natural underground storage areas. The greatest demand for water in our region is in the hotter late summer/early autumn season, long after the rains have supplied rivers and streams with flow or provided recharge to our groundwater basins.\nIn order to ensure adequate supply to maintain our streamflows to prevent stream drawdown (for human uses, fish and other habitat), and preserve our groundwater for autumn uses, year-round conservation is necessary EVERY year, not just in years when we perceive shortages. Using more than is replaced is not sustainable, and we are too often lulled by the appearance of our region‚Äôs abundance.\nRC: Why do people who live in urban areas and are not on wells need to be aware of the groundwater situation?\nRF: Interaction between surface water and groundwater is established science. If an urban area is supplied by surface water (the Russian, Eel and Klamath Rivers, etc.), the water used affects and is affected by stored groundwater. Rivers and streams can be ‚Äúde-watered‚Äù by too much pumping from connective aquifers (i.e. groundwater). Urban areas also rely on wells, some as back-up sources, or, in the case of Sebastopol, entirely on wells.\nUrban areas also rely on our local farms for food, which primarily depend on wells for irrigation of their crops. Retaining surface water for fish and habitat can only be assured by conscious efforts to maintain flows by limiting extraction rates of both rivers and groundwater.\nAll of us must be protective of all our water sources in order to ensure sustainability for all uses, including what regulators term ‚Äúbeneficial uses,‚Äù which is pretty much everything and everyone, since water is essential to life.\nRC: What is the connection between groundwater and watersheds?\nRF: Geologic formations under the ground are immensely varied. Some strata allow storage of water from sources as old as when the seas filled the basins, and some are fed by rains, melting snow, streams or lakes that recharge the aquifers. A watershed is basically a basin where water flows from the hills into the bottom of the ‚Äúbowl.‚Äù The ridges being the sides and lip of the bowl. Those waters are sometimes delivered by rivers or streams and sometimes by percolation through the rocks and soils into the aquifer. Gravity pulls the water downhill into the ground/aquifers in various ways and is supplied by the entire watershed.\nRC: As marijuana cultivation becomes more open and prevalent, water use issues, plus contamination issues and groundwater will become even more timely a topic. How do you see the pot industry affecting our local water issues?\nRF: Concern about the cumulative effects of cannabis and other water users is growing, both from the standpoints of water supply and degradation. Cannabis operations are very tightly regulated at this time. Unfortunately, not all cannabis operations are requesting permits ‚Äì and that is a separate issue that will require greater funding for enforcement efforts.\nThe number of acres of cannabis is relatively small at this time, so its impact will be felt‚Äîif at all ‚Äîin adjacent localized areas.\nLocal jurisdictions, the Water Quality Control Board, California Fish and Wildlife and others are all involved in regulations and enforcements of cannabis operations in order to limit impacts of cultivation, processing, transportation and other functions of the cannabis industry.\nAs with most things, the majority of operators are trying to do the right thing, but we‚Äôll learn from the few ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù what requirements need to be strengthened and how to limit impacts. Attention to the use and abuse of water may inform other water uses and provide guidance on necessary conditions. Much will depend on how many operations are approved, and where. Not unlike other groundwater uses, we‚Äôll need to protect against over concentration and use of toxic chemicals.\nRC: Post-fire, the loosening of regulations on building could be presenting a problem for water conservation and watershed health. What do you have to say about this?\nRF: Streamlining and ‚Äúloosening‚Äù of conditions for development has been a result of the horrific fires and the increased need for housing statewide. Regulations may still require conservation measures on each new or replacement development. Impacts on watersheds may not fare as well since cumulative impacts are often not considered. Increases in development can affect not only watersheds, but traffic-sheds, light pollution, hazard areas and increase potential for future natural hazards.\nSonoma County (and other jurisdictions) have approved urban growth boundaries, designated open space areas, provided stream side protections and much more in order to concentrate and condition development to protect our shared resources, including agriculture, water, timber, and all the rest.\nHousing is essential. We‚Äôve seen too many years of too many people living without housing or with inadequate housing. Now we have another wave of people who have lost everything, not just their homes, who are in need of housing. Some businesses also lost everything. A wise and thoughtful development process does not mean we have to move at a snail‚Äôs pace, but it does mean we urgently need considered progress.\nRC: How can we Sierra Clubbers work to build water awareness and move to curtail development that will tax our water system more than we understand it will?\nRF: Know your watershed (manmade or natural) and be involved. As the State is mandating sustainable water planning, we should know everything we can to affect our shared future. Be conscious of water use in your home, in your life, both by implementing conservation and by avoiding use of anything you wouldn‚Äôt want in your water supply.","Novato Area Drought FAQs\n- How is the North Marin Water District responding to the regional drought emergency?\nIn early 2021, the North Marin Water District, as part of the Sonoma Marin Saving Water Partnership, launched an aggressive public outreach campaign to emphasize the need to save water by highlighting actions customers can take to reduce water use and improve water use efficiency. The District also approved Ordinance 41 in March of 2021 (amended in May 2021) which prohibits water waste and non-essential use of water (See FAQ 6 below for a list of current water use prohibitions). This is in addition to the District‚Äôs year-round conservation campaign efforts. The District‚Äôs current regional water use of 113 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) represents a 28% reduction in water use, well ahead of the State‚Äôs required 20% reduction in per capita per day water use by 2020.\n- What is considered efficient water-use?\nHome water use varies based on the number of occupants, habits, and the efficiency level of water-using fixtures installed. Home water use also fluctuates seasonally based on the size and type of irrigated landscape, with outdoor use accounting for approximately 50% of annual water use for single-family residences even though most irrigation occurs during the six months from May through October.\nIndoor water use can typically be met using no more than 50 gallons per person per day, with more efficient homes using as little as 25-30 gallons per person per day. For a family of four, average indoor use ranges from around 3,000 gallons to 6,000 gallons per month. Even if you aren‚Äôt sure about your usage per day, you can help us achieve our critical goal of reducing water use community-wide by 20%.\nWater for irrigating landscapes can more than double water use from May to October. The District offers many rebates for irrigation system improvements and for converting turf grass to low water use landscaping. Visit our website at www.nmwd.com/save-water for detailed information on all our conservation programs. Contact us at email@example.com or call 415-761-8944 before starting a project to make sure it meets requirements to be eligible for a rebate.\n- How can I figure out how much water I use and how much water I am saving?\nVisit https://nmwd.com/account/watersmart/ to access the WaterSmart portal. This portal can give you hourly and daily water use data along with more historical data for comparison purposes. The portal also allows you to set up leak and high use alerts via text, email or phone call.\n- How do I cut back my water use if I‚Äôm already efficient with my water use?\nThe request for a 20% reduction in water use is a collective, community-wide, target and not necessarily an individual target. The only time the 20% reduction would be examined on an individual customer basis is if you have overhead spray irrigation and are identified as violating one of the other prohibited water uses. If you were not meeting the 20% reduction at that time, the District would work cooperatively with you to make further adjustments.\n- How will the drought surcharge affect my water bill?\nThe drought surcharge will only affect those residential customers using above 300 gallons per day average in a billing period. For example, if the billing period is 60 days, you would not be assessed the drought surcharge for the first 18,000 gallons (60 days x 300 gallons per day). Only water use above that 300 gallons per day average will be billed the $1.00 per 1,000 gallons. The drought surcharge is applicable to all water use for non-residential customers.\n- What mandatory water use restrictions are in place?\nBelow is a summary of the water-use prohibitions approved for the Novato Service Area in 2021:\n- The washing of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots and other hard surfaced areas by direct hosing when runoff water directly flows to a gutter or storm drain.\n- The escape of water through breaks or leaks within the customers‚Äô plumbing or private distribution system for any substantial period of time within which such break or leak should reasonably have been discovered and corrected within 72 hours.\n- Irrigation in a manner or to an extent which allows excessive run-off of water or unreasonable over-spray of the areas being watered.\n- Washing cars, boats, trailers or other vehicles and machinery directly with a hose not equipped with a shutoff nozzle.\n- Water for non-recycling decorative water fountains.\n- Potable water for outdoor landscaping during or within 48 hours of measurable rainfall or water on ornamental turf in public street medians.\n- Drinking water other than on request in eating or dining establishments.\n- Water for the daily laundering of towels and linens in hotels and motels without offering guests the option of choosing not to have daily laundering.\nNon-Essential Water Use Prohibitions Effective July 1, 2021 through November 1, 2021:\n- Overhead sprinkler irrigation is prohibited unless the customer can maintain a 20% reduction from 2020 water use, irrigate between 7:00pm and 9:00am, and water only three days per week assigned by Monday, Wednesday and Friday for odd addresses and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday for even addresses. Drip irrigation, container and hand watering is exempt. Customers using less than 300 gallons per day are exempt from the 20% reduction but must adhere to the three days per week assignment.\n- Any use of potable water from a fire hydrant except for fighting fire, human consumption, essential construction needs or use in connection with animals.\n- Refilling a completely drained swimming pool and/or initial filling of any swimming pool for which application for a building permit was made after July 1, 2021.\n- Non-commercial washing of privately-owned motor vehicles, trailers and boats except from a bucket and except that a hose equipped with a shut off nozzle may be used for a quick rinse.\n- Use of potable water for dust control at construction sites or other locations.\n- Watering any portion of a golf course with potable or raw water except the tees and greens unless the customer can maintain a 25% reduction in water use as compared to 2020.\n- Is North Marin Water better prepared for drought today?\nYes. We are always working to manage our water supply effectively and efficiently. We are also looking at both short and long-term solutions to what is a statewide crisis. Here are some things we have done in the past to prepare:\n- An extensive expansion of recycled water to serve large landscape areas and car washes in partnership with Novato Sanitary District and Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District.\n- The District installed an Advanced Meter Information (AMI) system for all meters in the Novato Service Area. The deployment project began in March 2018 and over 21,000 meters were upgraded. The District commenced deployment of an AMI system to improve water use efficiency as well as meter reading efficiency, accuracy, and customer service. The project included meter upgrades for customers throughout NMWD‚Äôs Novato service territory. With the AMI system, digital meter data is sent securely via radio to NMWD headquarters for billing purposes. This technology provides early leak detection and enables customers to view water use information online, thereby gaining a better understanding of their water use patterns. We encourage you to ‚Äúsign-in‚Äù on the portal to get acquainted with the system and learn more about your water use. Customers will now have access to hourly water use data and are able to set up alerts for high use and leak events on the WaterSmart Portal.\n- A more comprehensive water conservation program was developed. We offer programs and incentives, including rebates on lawn replacements, toilet and clothes washer replacements, graywater and rainwater systems and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù irrigation controllers, pool covers, hot water recirculation systems, and water efficient landscape upgrades including drip conversions and mulch. Rebates were recently increased for this 2021 drought period. Visit https://nmwd.com/save-water/indoors/ or https://nmwd.com/save-water/outdoors/ for more information.\n- How do I report water waste or other violations to the water use prohibitions?\nIf water waste is occurring at a neighbor‚Äôs property, try to contact them first. If you are unable to talk with your neighbor or identify which property is responsible or wish to remain anonymous, you can report the issue to the District by emailing firstname.lastname@example.org or calling 415-761-8944. We will investigate the matter and follow up as needed.\n- Can I ‚Äútop off‚Äù my existing pool to maintain the water level?\nYes, you can maintain the water level of your existing pool. Only refilling drained pools and initially filling new pools is prohibited after July 1.\n- Am I required to cover my pool?\nNo, you are not required to cover your pool, however, it is recommended and North Marin Water District provides a rebate for pool covers. https://nmwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pool-Cover-2021-May-1.pdf\n- How many days a week am I allowed to irrigate my landscaping?\nOverhead spray irrigation for your lawn and/or plants is allowed three (3) days per week with odd numbered addresses assigned to Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and even numbered addresses assigned to Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Drip irrigation or hand or container watering is not limited on the number of days per week in Novato, however, we still encourage you to cut back as much as reasonably possible.\n- Can I water my vegetable garden or fruit trees?\nWater use prohibitions do not apply to plants grown to provide food that are watered by hand, drip irrigation or containers. Watering by hand is the most efficient use of water.\n- Can North Marin Water District use recycled water to help with the drought?\nNorth Marin Water District already has an extensive recycled water program that serves large landscape irrigation customers and various car washes in portions of the north, central, and southern Novato Service Area. We continue to explore ways of expanding our recycled water for additional uses and locations.\n- Is North Marin Water District considering building a desalination to address the current drought?\nThe District is exploring various regional solutions to expand water supply as part of a $0.6M Regional Water Supply Resilience Study funded by the District and other retail water contractors who purchase water from Sonoma County Water Agency. The Study will look at various feasible options including stormwater capture, groundwater storage and recovery and others. Desalination could also be evaluated however the previously mentioned water supply options are typically much more cost effective and not as energy intensive.\n- Why isn‚Äôt North Marin Water District dredging Stafford Lake for water storage?\nThe District performs sediment surveys in Stafford Dam every 10 years. A future dredging project will be needed someday but current sediment accumulation levels are having a minimal impact on overall storage capacity.\n- Is North Marin Water District allowing new connections during this drought?\nNorth Marin Water District has suspended new connections to the system as of July 1 until the water shortage period has ended, with some exceptions for those who have recycled water for landscaping or defer all landscape installation until after the water shortage has ended.\n- Is North Marin Water District asking residents to limit their water use to a certain amount?\nThe North Marin Water District service area wide goal is a 20% reduction in overall water use. We are not asking all customers to individually save 20%, unless they use overhead spray irrigation, however, water use will not be examined on an individual customer basis unless a customer has been identified as violating one of the water use prohibitions.\n- What is North Marin Water District doing to help customers save water?\nWe offer many programs and incentives to save water, including rebates for many indoor and outdoor water-using activities. Visit our website www.nmwd.com/save-water for detailed information. Email us at email@example.com or call 415-761-8944.\n- Make sure you have water-efficient fixtures such as toilets, showerheads, faucets and irrigation systems. We offer free hose shutoff nozzles, faucet aerators and showerheads to customers.\n- Remove your lawn and get a Cash for Grass rebate of up to $1 per square-foot of lawn removed.\n- Remove your lawn through our Lawn Be Gone Sheet Mulching Program.\n- Install a smart irrigation controller that automatically adjusts to the weather to deliver just the right amount of water and receive a rebate.\n- Check for leaks and fix them as soon as you find them. We offer free toilet leak detection dye tablets.\n- Replace your older washing machine with a high-efficiency model and apply for a rebate of up to $100.\n- Cover your pool with a new cover and get a rebate of up to $75.\n- Install a new hot water recirculating system and get a rebate of up to $75.\n- Replace your spray irrigation with a drip system, or mulch your existing planted areas and get a rebate of 50-75% the cost of the materials.\n- Replace your old toilets (pre 1993) and get a $125 rebate.\n- What are you doing about water wasters or violators to the water use prohibitions?\nWe intend to initially work with the customer to take corrective action. If a cooperative approach is not successful, we will issue written or verbal warnings for first time violations. A second or un-resolved first violation can result in a $250 fine and/or service disconnection, and any subsequent violations can result in a $500 fine and/or service disconnection.

By default the keyboard is unprotected. To enable this function, using the front panel navigational menu, go to Settings > Security > Front Panel, then press OK and ENABLE the Access Control function. Set the preferred 4 digit password and access timeout.\nOnce the keyboard lock function is enabled, every attempt to use it will require a password: ENTER PASSWORD:0***. Access will be denied upon false entry.\nHow to unlock the front panel keyboard? I have forgotten the password / I have enabled the function unintentionally.\nIf the ‚ÄúKeyboard unlock‚Äù function has been activated by mistake, try to unlock it using the default password 01234. In order to deactivate the code protection, once the front panel menu is unlocked follow the menu path Menu > Settings > Security > Front Panel > Access control and then select Disable.\nIf you do not manage to unlock the front panel with the default password, nevertheless whether it has been changed intentionally or not, the unit should be returned to its factory defaults in order for the password security to be disabled.\nI forgot the master password for the DEVA Device Manager Software, what should I do?\nIf due to any reason you have forgoten your Master Password, contact us at firstname.lastname@example.org for detailed instructions on the reset procedure.\nI have forgotten my password for the WEB Interface. What should I do?\nThe WEB Interface password could be viewed/changed via the front panel navigational menu. The menu path is Menu > Settings > Security > Remote Access.\nI have forgotten both ‚Äì the front panel and WEB Interface passwords. What should I do?\nIf due to any reason you have forgoten both passwords - the one for the front panel and the one for the WEB Interface, please contact us at email@example.com\nMy Logger/PI Campaign is not running. What might be the problem?\nWhen the campaign settings are applied, you will have to specify not only the PI/CALL or Frequency, but also the Acquisition time / Campaign's start time delay. In order for a Campaign to be commenced, the device should be inactive for the specified time. It is very important, during the campaign the front panel navigational menu, WEB interface or SNMP not to be used; otherwise the campaign will not be properly performed.\nPrior to the set-up procedure, you will have to note that the campaigns (PI and Logger) cannot be performed simultaneously. The PI campaign is with higher priority, thus in order for a Logger mode campaign to be performed you will have to make sure that the PI Campaign is disabled.\nHow can I switch between %/KHz (RDS/RBDS Mode)?\nThe mode could be changed via the front panel menu and via the WEB Interface.\nThe menu path when the WEB Interface is used is : Settings > Tuner > section ‚Äú RDS/RBDS Mode‚Äù.\nThe menu path when the change is made via the front panel menu is: Settings > Tuner > RDS Mode.\nI cannot receive any GPS information in the GPS menu of my Radio Explorer II, what could be the problem?\nSometimes the GPS receiver needs several minutes to initialize (update) its satellite table. That could be the reason why satellites are not indicated as soon as you have connected the antenna to your receiver. Also, select a suitable location for installation that allows routing of the antenna cable to the Radio Explorer II and also provides a clear view of the sky for a good satellite reception.\nPlease note that the GPS works at his best outside, not inside buildings. When you are in narrow streets, without clear view of the sky, good satellite reception will not be received. Also, check your GPS antenna cable, to make sure it hasn‚Äôt been damaged by closing a door.\nHow do I select the proper operation mode to be used during a campaign?\nDepending on the observation purposes, Radio Explorer II utilizes two modes of operation:\n- LOGGER MODE - used for on-field configuration and observation of one or multiple preselected frequencies (Up to 50);\n- PI/CALL CAMPAIGN MODE ‚Äì uses PI/CALL for preforming complete station surveys (Up to 10 stations can be chosen);\nI have imported a campaign in Google Earth - visible path and almost no points. What could be the problem?\nThis problem is related to Google Earth. For further information, please take a look at the picture below or read Google Earth User Guide, section Time Slider.\nGoogle Earth can visualize only a fraction of the entire time period. The points are there, but are not visualized (depicted) in Google Earth. When no points are selected the program will hide and reset the Time Slider.\nWe recommend you to animate the movement along the path or to extend the Time Slider at its full size as shown below.\nNOTE: The time slider feature is available only in Google Earth 5 and later.\nWhat are the units of the GPS Longitude and GPS Latitude shown in the campaign result file?\nDecimal degrees (¬∞) - Latitude and Longitude are how your site location is defined on the surface of the earth. Latitude is used to express how far north or south you are, relative to the equator. If you are on the equator your latitude is zero. If you are near the North Pole your latitude is nearly 90¬∞ north. If you are near the South Pole your latitude is almost 90¬∞ south.\nLongitude shows your location in an east-west direction, relative to the Greenwich meridian. Places to the east of Greenwich (such as Middle East, India and Japan) have longitude angles up to 180¬∞ east. Places to the west of Greenwich (such as the Atlantic and North and South America) have angles up to 180¬∞ west. For inputting to the satellite dish pointing calculator, longitude west figures need to be input as negative numbers.\nMy survey has too many points. How can I have a quick preview with fewer data points?\nRadio Explorer II stores data points at the highest possible rate to provide the highest possible level of details. The number of measurement points can be reduced while reviewing the survey via the DEVA Device Manager Software. In the Log viewer > GPS tab > Refine section mark the ‚ÄúEnable Refine‚Äù checkbox and adjust the \"Minimum Stack Distance\" option. If the distance between two points is less than the one that is set, these two points will be converted into one. Please note that this option will not only reduce the points but will also change the signal path formation.\nCan I get an RF field strength measurement along with the RF level measurement?\nYes, you can. In order for this to happen, an antenna calibration should be provided. Such calibration can be applied via the front panel, DEVA Device Manager Software and WEB Interface. Following is an explanation on how this setting can be applied via the WEB Interface:\n- Connect the device via the WEB interface;\n- Go to Settings > Tuner section;\n- Locate the Antenna calibration subsection;\n- Define the cable loss, frequencies and their corresponding factors. Up to 5 frequency/factor pairs can be assigned.\nHow do I start the campaign via the front panel navigational menu, i.e. Logger or PI Campaign?\nIn order to set up a campaign via the front panel menu, the following steps should be completed:\n- Enter the Main Menu > Settings;\n- Then select PI Campaign > PI Channel 1;\n- Specify name of the PI and for 'Active' - select Antenna 1;\n- Change the Acquisition time as per your preferences. We recommend setting it to 10 seconds;\n- Steps from 2 to 4 should be applied for each of the channels to be monitored. Once all PI Channels are set you can proceed to the last step;\n- Go to Settings > PI Campaign > PI Campaign Mode and as a parameter set 10 seconds. In order for a Campaign to be commenced the device should be inactive for the specified time.\nThe settings for Logger mode are analogous to PI Campaign. The menu path is Settings > Logger > ...\nPlease note that the campaigns (PI and Logger) cannot be performed simultaneously. The PI campaign is with higher priority, thus in order for a Logger mode campaign to be performed you will have to make sure that the PI campaign is disabled.\nQuick User Guide\nRadio Explorer II Demo Devices\nClick on the buttons with the selected Demo Devices below and take a closer look at the available features.\nUse the following credentials when necessary:\nUser: admin Password: pass\nPlease be patient, the device(s) may be busy at the moment.

{"question":"Working on Olympic infrastructure planning, I need to understand both historical Olympic infrastructure investments and modern environmental monitoring capabilities. What transportation infrastructure improvements did cities implement for Olympics, and how can satellite imaging track environmental changes from such developments?","answer":"Regarding Olympic infrastructure, cities have made significant transportation improvements - Salt Lake City expanded its airport, upgraded highways, and built a new light rail system for the 2002 Olympics. London expanded its railway system for 2012, which benefited commuters after the games. Baltimore-Washington's bid included plans for a $2.2 billion Red Line light rail project. As for satellite monitoring capabilities, Earth Observation (EO) technology can track environmental changes through various satellite systems. The combination of optical sensors (Sentinel-2), radar imaging (Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2), and LiDAR data from GEDI and ICESAT-2 missions allows for comprehensive monitoring of land use changes, biomass levels, and ecosystem services at different spatial and temporal scales. This technology is particularly valuable for understanding environmental impacts over time.","context":["Dan Knise is president and CEO of the Washington-Baltimore‚Ä¶ (Lloyd Fox, Baltimore Sun )\nA little more than a decade ago, a group of business executives and civic leaders envisioned a moment when the world's eyes would be riveted by events in the Baltimore-Washington area: the lighting of a cauldron followed by two weeks of elite athletic competition.\nThe group hoped to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to the region ‚Äî and with it, billions of dollars in revenue and tens of thousands of new jobs.\nBaltimore would be the scene for soccer, gymnastics, triathlon, cycling and field hockey. The waters near the Naval Academy would be used for the sailing competition. The hills of Patapsco Valley State Park would challenge mountain bikers. University of Maryland dorms would provide a temporary home for athletes.\nAnd, though the organizers had no way of knowing it then, they also might have given Michael Phelps home-field advantage in his final Olympics.\n\"The area had everything in the world to offer the International Olympic Committee,\" recalled John Moag Jr., former chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority and a leader of the Washington-Baltimore 2012 Regional Coalition. \"We all felt good about it.\"\nBut when the U.S. Olympic Committee picked its candidate in 2002, the region's bid lost to New York, which lost to London three years later, when the International Olympic Committee made its choice.\nThe rejection was not only a blow to local civic pride, but also an economic letdown.\n\"A lot of federal money is secured in the name of the Olympics,\" said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, an associate professor of tourism and sports management at George Washington University. \"We missed out on federal transportation and beautification dollars. The University of Maryland missed out on money to improve its dorms. In the private sector, hotels and restaurants missed out on hospitality dollars.\"\nDan Knise, president and CEO of the coalition, said projects that likely would have received an Olympic-sized financial boost included Baltimore's proposed $2.2 billion Red Line light rail, a new Baltimore arena and upgrades at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the field hockey site.\n\"I think there would have been a lot of new things,\" Knise said.\nMany cities have benefited from holding the Olympics. Once-dowdy East London is getting a makeover, with new pedestrian bridges and walkways. After the games, the media center will be converted into an office building and the athletes' village will become apartments and subsidized housing. An expanded railway system will be a boon to commuters.\nIn 2002, Salt Lake City greeted spectators with an expanded airport, upgraded highways and a new light rail system.\n\"The Olympics were good to the city and the region,\" said former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson. \"There's a sense of real joy and accomplishment. I don't think there's any question that it was good for civic pride, and that's going to have a lifetime impact.\"\nBut there can also be a downside.\nUntil Los Angeles showed the world how to turn a profit in 1984 by lining up scads of sponsors, holding the Olympics was often a red-ink affair. Denver walked away after securing the 1976 Winter Games when voters rejected a $5 million bond to pay for them. Montreal posted a loss of $1 billion on the 1976 Summer Games.\nWithout the U.S. Olympic Committee quietly forgiving as much as $50 million in debt, organizers of the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta could not have claimed that they broke even. A post-Olympics economic analysis by Georgia Tech University showed that during the Games, sales were off in Atlanta shops and restaurants, traditional tourism dropped, air travel was down ‚Äî and taxpayers shelled out millions.\nThat was not the expected scenario for the Baltimore-Washington region.\nA 2000 economic impact study conducted by Richard Clinch of the University of Baltimore and Stephen Fuller of George Mason University projected that the Olympics would cost $2.04 billion to build and run, with a return of $5.32 billion in total economic impact ‚Äî $6.72 billion in today's dollars. The lead-up to the Summer Games was expected to support the creation of nearly 70,000 jobs.\n\"But to make this work, we needed more of Maryland than just the Washington suburbs,\" Fuller recalled. \"We needed Baltimore. We needed all the hotel rooms, all the venues and all of the attractions. It brought together two economies that weren't normally thought of together. I think it was a good marriage.\"\nSo good, in fact, that a promotional flier at the time shouted: \"This is regionalism brought to life!\"\nThe Washington-Baltimore 2012 Regional Coalition invested three years and $9.5 million to craft a 600-page bid. Organizers lined up financial support from corporations such as Verizon, Legg Mason, Bank of America, Giant, Marriott International and the company then known as Mobil.\nIn the proposal, organizers projected selling 8.5 million tickets and attracting more than 5 million visitors.","- Satellite imagery will be used to map England‚Äôs forest biomass stocks\n- Using remotely sensed data and models to monitor the status of ecosystem services such habitat quality, recreation, timber production, biodiversity, scenic beauty, water supply and carbon storage\nThe UK Government has committed to achieving a net zero carbon balance by 2050 to mitigate climate change. Afforestation on an unprecedented scale is very likely to play a major role in achieving this goal. However, Defra‚Äôs 25-year plan has a number of other environmental targets it wants to achieve, for example no net biodiversity loss from any land use change intervention. To ensure that we fully understand the current state of forests in England and the range of ecosystem services that they provide to people, this studentship aims to map the amount of forest biomass in England from satellite imagery and to estimate a selection of ecosystem services. These services can be split into provisioning services which provide goods and materials such as food and clean water, regulating services that provide a healthy microclimate, remove carbon from the atmosphere and filter the air that we breathe, and cultural ecosystem services, e.g. the value of landscapes for recreation and education.\nMonitoring biodiversity and the status of ecosystem services over time is often limited by data availability. However, Earth Observation (EO), in combination with in-situ data, has the potential to fill this gap due to its capability to generate a variety of data at different spatial and temporal scales. EO has also been recognized as a fundamental approach to estimate essential climate variables (ECV) and essential biodiversity variables (EBV) such as land cover, biomass, habitat structure, etc. Information on the temporal dynamics of ES is of key importance to understand time lags, abrupt changes, threshold effects, and feedbacks in ecosystem service management (Rieb et al., 2017).\nPioneering research at the University of Leicester has experimented with ecosystem services models from the InVEST model suite and how they can be coupled to maps from Earth observation. Our research group has also developed an algorithm for mapping forest biomass from a combination of optical and radar satellite images. This studentship will use these existing tools and combine them in a novel way to provide a focused assessment of selected ecosystem services on forests in England, which is the geographic focus of this PhD. The main supervisor, Prof. Balzter, coordinates the Landscape Decisions programme funded by UK Research and Innovation and maintains close links with Defra and a range of other stakeholders.\n- How accurately can the forest carbon stocks in England be estimated using satellite imagery and forest inventory data?\n- How can remotely sensed forest biomass maps be used to estimate selected ecosystem services, e.g. timber production, carbon storage, biodiversity, habitat quality, and water supply?\nHostNational Centre for Earth Observation\n- Climate and Environmental Sustainability\n- Prof. Heiko Balzter, National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO), University of Leicester\n- Dr. Pedro Rodriguez-Veiga, National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO), University of Leicester\n- Dr. Fernando Espirito-Santo, School of Geography, Geology and the Environment, University of Leicester\nThe methods will include satellite remote sensing and ecosystem services models. Optical and radar images will be used to estimate forest aboveground biomass at different points in time following the approach described in Rodriguez-Veiga et al. (2020) (Figure 2). Unlike optical sensors, radar can take images through clouds and therefore provides weather-independent observations. Satellite images from the Sentinel-1 (C-band radar), Sentinel-2 (multispectral optical) and ALOS-2 (L-band radar) satellites will be used for the forest biomass mapping algorithm. Information on the forest canopy height from Spaceborne LiDAR footprints from the GEDI and ICESAT-2 missions will be used to train the model that relates the satellite images to forest biomass.\nThe satellite-derived forest biomass maps will be used to assess the status of ecosystem services in England at different times. Ancillary datasets will be used as input to the standard Integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-off (InVEST) models to map the supply of ecosystem services by different forest areas.\nTraining and skills\nThe National Centre for Earth Observation will provide access to its Researcher Forum, staff conferences/workshops and national-level training.\nThe student will be trained in satellite image analysis and ecosystem services modelling. The student will have access to the MSc modules ‚ÄúSatellite Data Analysis in Python‚Äù and ‚ÄúEarth Observation and Remote Sensing‚Äù, as well as other suitable modules that satisfy their training needs. Complementary individual training in using Google earth engine and machine learning and will be available from NCEO and the School of Geography, Geology and the Environment. Further training will take place ‚Äòon-the-job‚Äô as part of the research team in NCEO.\nPartners and collaboration\nPotential partners include (but not limited to) Natural England, Forest Research, and JNCC\nPlease visit the University of Leicester website for application guidance:\nLiterature review, refinement of research questions and work plan, liaison and consultation with project partners, installation of algorithms, training in satellite data processing in Python and InVEST.\nPreparation of training and validation database (GEDI, in-situ, and HR imagery).

{"question":"How do film advertisements in newspapers and modern business flyers compare in terms of their primary marketing objectives?","answer":"Film advertisements in newspapers primarily aim to instantly attract readers to movie theaters, using urgent messaging like 'You should hurry!' and emphasizing box office success and limited viewing windows to compel immediate action. Business flyers, on the other hand, focus on longer-term marketing objectives such as raising brand awareness, promoting products or services, increasing foot traffic to stores, growing social media following, and providing detailed business information. They serve as a bridge between conventional and digital marketing efforts through features like custom URLs and QR codes.","context":["So, as we‚Äôve established, film fliers are ephemeral. Unless they happened to end up in the hands of collectors, they are supposed to be discarded after being distributed in conjunction with a film‚Äôs release. However, there is more ephemeral media than just film fliers: film advertisements within newspapers, for example, when a film is brought to the public, a variety of promotional methods could be used. Newspaper advertising is one of the traditional methods to promote films among a broad range of audiences.\nNewspapers report up-to-date news and information. After reading through a paper, most often, we immediately discard it. The advertisements are a sub-content of the paper, but can be more significant, for example, especially when a full page is designated for it. The newspaper‚Äôs nature, immediacy of information makes film advertisements in it a lot different from the contents of regular film fliers.\nWith this in mind, we will look at some interesting newspaper film advertisements from the Makino Collection.\nNewspaper advertisements are different because they include not only film images, but also fresh eye-catching copy, which cannot be seen in typical film ephemera. Since newspapers are not meant to be preserved over time, the contents of newspaper advertisements need to be up-to-date, fresh and entertaining. The big difference, which is also the most entertaining thing about them, is that film advertisements will be flashy, appealing, and include funny slogans with weird wording, in contrast with the more polished look of film fliers, which usually features an elaborate design.\n‚ÄúWell-received! Horrendously popular! You should hurry!‚Äù (Goldfinger, 1965)\nThe mission of newspaper film advertisement is to instantly attract readers to movie theaters. Therefore, the small section of newspaper needs to be extremely appealing. Thus, the contents vividly reflect the box office success of a film, and will often announce a second-chance for viewer‚Äôs to see an extended film‚Äôs run.\n‚ÄúThe century‚Äôs masterpiece which were appreciated 650,000 viewers over 9 months will only be available until 9/20‚Äù (My Fair Lady, 1965)\n‚ÄúIf you have already watched it, you should feel the deep emotion again‚Äì‚Äù (My Fair Lady, 1965)\nAs a result, this promotional information in newspaper advertisements compels newspaper readers to go to movie theaters.\n‚ÄúIf you have not seen it, hurry!‚Äù (My Fair Lady, 1965)\nSince most films are generally released on Saturdays in Japan, the paper‚Äôs evening edition on Fridays is usually full of movie advertising. The advertising sections on Saturday and Sunday are full of eye-candy for film fans as well.\nWhat is the status of newspapers in Japan? To what extent can these film advertisements influence readers in Japan?\nNewspaper advertising is a true expression of a culture of one country, a life record; it is a precious record of economic evolution history and cultural history.\n(Êó•Êú¨Êñ∞ËÅûÂ∫ÉÂëäÂè≤ : ÈõªÈÄöÂâµÁ´ãÂõõÂçÅÂë®Âπ¥Á¥ÄÂøµ/Nihon shinbun k≈çkushi: Dentsu s≈çritsu yonjissh≈´nen kinen, 1940)\nFor people living in Japan, home newspaper subscription is an old tradition.\nThere are five main national newspapers in Japan: Asahi, Mainichi, Sankei, Yomiuri, and Nikkei. They are printed twice a day and in several local editions (The edition of Japanese newspapers that can be obtained in the U.S. is an international edition).\nThe influence of newspaper is proportionate to the subscription numbers. One of the national papers in Japan, the oldest paper, Yomiuri Shimbun, was founded in 1874. The Yomiuri reached 12.77 million (figure: Audit Bureau of Circulation- Japan) combining morning and evening editions for the first half 2014, and is credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world. In comparison, the top U.S. newspaper, the Wall Street Journal circulated 2.38 million copies in 2013 (Alliance for Audit Media); this number includes 0.9 million digital editions. Since the population in Japan is 126.9 million and the U.S.‚Äôs is 321.4 million (The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 2015 est.), you can infer how much a dairy newspaper influences Japan.\nIf you visit Japan and use public transportation during rush hour, you will witness a number of businesspersons reading newspapers on trains, buses, and on the subway during their commute. It is an ordinary scene in a Japanese morning.\nIn the 1960‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, newspapers in Japan developed dramatically. In the midst of the Japanese Post-War Economic Miracle, people sought and craved a better lifestyle. For this reason, newspapers soon became a major part of people‚Äôs daily life. The competition among national papers was brisk. The 1960‚Äôs was also called cinema‚Äôs golden era; the culture of film advertisement in newspapers came into full bloom as an effect of this era.\nThe Makino Collection includes a number of newspapers, including the film advertisements from the 1960‚Äôs in neat scrapbooks, the golden era of cinema in Japan and newspaper as a medium itself. They are extremely precious, and highly worth looking at. Not many people collect this very ephemeral object, since it requires time and effort to preserve them properly. Therefore, you will greatly appreciate this specific form of film advertising within the Makino Collection.","Technology has paved the way to many digital marketing strategies for advertisers to promote their business. However, many small businesses continue to benefit from conventional and inexpensive tools such as business flyers to advertise their goods as well. The key is to make a flyer that can influence a consumer‚Äôs perspective toward your company.\nTo ensure that your business flyer designs successfully serve their desired purpose, it‚Äôs important to conceptualize and strategize on a flyer design that will impact your target audience in the best way possible.\nA good business flyer should not only be easy on the eyes, but it must also deliver the necessary information about a company to its target audience. Listed below are the major elements that every business flyer should have:\n1. General Information: The front page of the marketing flyer must cover important business information for readers to grasp. This includes details about the products or services available, allowing customers to visualize how they may benefit from such offers in the best way possible.\n2. Graphics: A flyer without graphics is basically a book without pictures. Not everyone is too keen about a lengthy reading material, which is why you need to give the eyes something to amuse itself with for a good period of time. This includes images, illustrations, and other forms of visuals.\n3. Headline: A striking headline with the ability to turn heads will be enough to give your flyer the attention it needs to raise brand awareness. Headlines are usually kept short yet catchy to make it much easier for readers to remember. This is often placed at the front and center of the page to garner the most attention. You may also see invitation flyer designs.\n4. Content: Once you have captured the attention of prospects, the content of the flyer should explain what you‚Äôre capable of. It should also have a call to action, which its main purpose would be to promote a cause, raise foot traffic to your stores, or increase your following on social media.\n5. Location or Contact Information: The single most vital part of any flyer is to tell readers where or how they could find your business. The address of your main office, the duration of a sale, and the numbers they could use to reach you are just some of the things to include in your business flyer.\nAs a startup, you‚Äôre probably clueless with where to start. After all, the last thing you would want to do is to invest your time and money on a mediocre flyer design. But not to worry, this is a common problem that many beginners are forced to deal with.\nTo help you out, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to create an informative and attractive business flyer:\n1. Seek inspiration from existing designs: The Internet is a vast universe with thousands of creatives uploaded everyday. This gives you a wide selection of wonderful business flyer designs to take inspiration from. You can find many flyer creations crafted by some of the biggest names in the industry, allowing you to analyze the dos and don‚Äôts of a successful flyer more clearly.\n2. Draft your layout: It‚Äôs always best to start with a draft. That way, you can arrange the different elements around the layout through a strategic placement. This will also help you visualize what looks good and what doesn‚Äôt, offering you enough time to apply the necessary adjustments before finalizing and printing the flyer. You may also see event flyer examples.\n3. Insert the necessary information: As an essential element of your business flyer, remember to keep these details as clear and concise as possible. A business flyer typically contains a brief introduction of the company, their store or office locations, a short description of their product or service offers, as well as their contact number and email address.\n4. Proofread: Be sure to proofread your flyer before forwarding it to your company‚Äôs printing department. Any spelling errors or grammar mistakes can ruin the overall look and feel of your business flyer, so be sure to have these checked right away. You can have a friend or colleague proofread your file, as a fresh pair of eyes are sure to offer you an honest and unbiased opinion. You may also see travel flyer designs.\n5. Print out your flyer: Since you‚Äôre likely to distribute these flyers by the dozens, it‚Äôs best to have them produced by bulk as well. The more flyers you have printed, the less you‚Äôre asked to pay. Most printing agencies offer great discounts for bulk orders, making print flyers a cost-efficient option for your marketing needs.\nNow that we know how business flyers are created, let‚Äôs turn our attention toward the actual design of your flyer. To achieve a visually pleasing business flyer that also meets industry requirements, here are a few flyer design tips to take note of:\nWhile a business flyer can be printed in virtually any size, the following are some of the most common options produced by printing companies:\nBut if you‚Äôre looking for something a bit more suitable to your main purpose, a full-page flyer (8.5‚Ä≥ √ó 11‚Ä≥) is perfect for delivering product information on a single sheet which you can distribute at an industry conference or trade show. Half-page flyers (5.5‚Ä≥ √ó 8.5‚Ä≥) and square formats (6‚Ä≥ √ó 6‚Ä≥ or 8‚Ä≥ √ó 8‚Ä≥), on the other hand, function similarly to a promotional flyer, which can be distributed during sales and special events considering how they‚Äôre a lot easier to carry around.\nHere are a few commonly asked questions regarding business flyers:\nCreating a business flyer is pretty easy. You can use a widely used application like Microsoft Word to create a simple flyer design, or a vector editing application such as Adobe Illustrator for a more fresh and detailed look. The size and structure of these flyer designs can be adjusted within the app as well. Once you have finished crafting your design, you can have it printed for distribution or uploaded to your company website.\nA business flyer is a form of paper advertisement used to promote a company‚Äôs brand, products, or services. This is typically intended for wide distribution, where advertisers may post or hand out the flyer in public places to increase exposure and generate brand awareness. Just as with your other promotional efforts, a business flyer helps you target your audience by allowing them to recognize a pre-existing problem that is in need of a solution. It‚Äôs an inexpensive means of print advertising that continues to be one of the most cost-efficient options for many small to medium businesses. You may also see minimalist flyer design.\nWhile social media marketing has certainly made an impact in terms of promoting events and creating a buzz around them, it‚Äôs important to recognize the tried and tested techniques that have taken the marketing world by storm for many years. Fortunately with business flyers, you can now build a bridge between your conventional and digital efforts with the help of custom URLs and QR codes. These flyers can help you reach a wider audience from both your online and offline markets, helping you gain better exposure to potentially boost company sales.\nAnd there you have it! With these advertising flyer design templates and examples, you can craft the perfect business flyer for your company in no time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b3f4005-d538-47bc-8cec-bf7e263ef5a6>","<urn:uuid:f682c627-5ade-425e-bd05-3f9d5667eb97>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the current landscape of emerging space market opportunities compare with the practical challenges of space debris management in commercial spaceflight?","answer":"The emerging space market presents diverse opportunities across three segments: Earth‚ÜíSpace (infrastructure and services), Space‚ÜíSpace (in-space services), and Space‚ÜíEarth (satellite-based services). However, many markets are becoming saturated with competitors who haven't yet delivered products. The most promising opportunities lie in downstream services like tailored analytics or specific component manufacturing. Meanwhile, the management of space debris has become a practical challenge, as evidenced by recent incidents such as SpaceX debris discovered in Australian farmland. While scientists can track larger pieces of space debris, the increasing frequency of commercial space activities raises concerns about future debris management, with experts warning that the problem will worsen as space travel intensifies.","context":["Where is the Emerging Space Opportunity?\nBuzzwords such as New Space, Space 2.0, Emerging Space, applied to new, nimble, innovative, and atypical activities, encompass companies grouped together due to their approach. Fueled by the Silicon Valley-mindset and PR, the distinctions between these players and their investment can be a challenge to identify. Yet it is within these distinctions that lay the trends, directions, and ultimately the opportunities of emerging space activities.\nNSR‚Äôs The Emerging Space Market Opportunity found that the market falls into three broad segments:\n- Earth√†Space: Infrastructure & Services provided on Earth to facilitate use of Space (e.g. Launch, manufacturing)\n- Space√†Space: Services delivered in Space (e.g. Satellite servicing, space tourism)\n- Space√†Earth: Services delivered from Space assets for use on Earth (e.g. Communications satellites, Earth Observation analytics)\nWhere is the Funding?\nEarth√†Space activities encompass diverse enabling products and services at the beginning of the value chain. At nearly half of all emerging space companies founded, Earth√†Space is a robust market. Yet its share in total companies funded and amount of investment is weaker ‚Äì with 75% of investment attributable to Blue Origin and SpaceX alone. Only a third of companies were funded, compared to the almost half funded in the other two segments. This is not a black mark in itself: some companies remain in the R&D phase and do not yet have a workable prototype (often key for securing funding) while others have been able to successfully bootstrap growth and leverage government innovation grants and support, such as SBIRs/STTRs.\nIn the space industry at large, manufacturing, launch, and other ancillary space services often operate with low margins ‚Äì a characteristic more detrimental in investor eyes within Emerging Space due to the low-cost targets of potential customers. Earth√†Space is a complementary investment, as players across the segment are the building blocks for success of satellite operators and downstream service providers.\nSpace√†Space comprises the least developed and smallest piece of the Emerging Space pie across all metrics. Space√†Space activities remain largely unproven in commercial use, requiring significant R&D alongside customer development before reaching market. Wealthy founders and angel investors have been attracted by the novel ideas and potential impact of Space√†Space services, willing to invest despite the risk and long payback period. Yet funding is limited: aside from Virgin Galactic and Bigelow Aerospace, who represent two-thirds of all investment, funding has been won in small increment Seed and Phase A rounds. The average investment is half that of other segments. The segment overall underperforms in total investment, with only 12% of funding despite nearly a quarter of companies founded and funded.\nSpace√†Earth activities, dominated by satellite constellations and analytics services, have generated strong entrepreneur engagement and the most investor interest. Attracted by the potential of small satellite-based constellations to deliver global coverage with a high revisit and spurred on by the rise of connectivity dependence and Big Data, new aspiring operators are a fixture of Emerging Space. The services targeted are not only approachable to investors due to their similarity to today‚Äôs satellite-centric landscape, but present the large addressable markets, mid-term payback period, and potentially sizeable returns that investors seek. OneWeb, O3b, and Skybox/Terra Bella dominate total investment, but many other players have secured Phase A and Phase B funding. The Space√†Earth segment demonstrates the greatest percentage of funded companies and the highest average investment, as well as the most sizable exits to date.\nWhere is the Opportunity?\nThe challenge for budding entrepreneurs is that many emerging space markets are saturated with would-be competitors, even while those same competitors have yet to deliver on promises and bring a product to market. Across Earth Observation, communications, M2M/IoT, and AIS markets, as well as manufacturing, dedicated smallsat launch, and downlink services, the number of aspiring emerging space players exceeds what the market will support. Yet until any one company delivers compelling value and consolidates market share, the opportunity for better services to emerge remains. Novel applications provide a less competitive opportunity, but present added challenges in identifying and securing a customer base and distribution network.\nEmerging Space players depend on an ecosystem of companies. Despite saturation at many points in the value chain, new players able to identify downstream services such as tailored analytics or upstream niches like specific component manufacturing ‚Äì all pain points for integrators, launch providers, and operators ‚Äì may increase their chances of winning funding and advancing in development.\nThe Bottom Line\nActivity in the emerging space market is diverse, and the desire of entrepreneurs to deliver a novel and innovative value proposition spans many segments. Given the variety of services required to support Space√†Space and Space√†Earth endeavors, the Earth√†Space sector will continue to lead in number of companies in the near term. As the market matures and traditional players become more interested in emerging space capabilities, the potential for an exit via acquisition is increasing ‚Äì which should only reinforce investor interest and entrepreneurial aspirations across the emerging space market. Ultimately all Emerging Space segments present opportunities for new entrepreneurs and investors, if they can learn to avoid what have thus far been attractive ‚Äúme too‚Äù plays in already saturated applications.","Space debris that crashed in Australian farmland is likely from SpaceX, astrophysicist says\n- Space junk was found scattered across several fields in Australia last month.\n- The debris likely came from a SpaceX Crew-1 flight, an astrophysicist who examined the junk said.\nAustralian farmers mysteriously found space debris scattered across their fields last month. An astrophysicist who examined the junk now believes it was from a SpaceX flight.\nPeople near Dalgety, New South Wales, found three large pieces of debris, with the largest ‚Äî a 10-foot-tall triangular structure ‚Äî found planted firmly into the ground, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\nThe objects were scarred by scorch marks, consistent with reentry into the atmosphere, ABC reported.\nBrad Tucker, an astrophysicist who inspected the debris, said in a video they were likely fragments of the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon aircraft used during the Crew-1 mission in 2020. Some of the fragments had serial numbers, Tucker said.\nScientists had known that debris from the Dragon spacecraft debris could fall in the area around early July and the debris is a \"good match\" for the trunk's flight path on July 8, the astronomer Jonathan McDowell tweeted.\n\"Having gone out there and looked at the bits myself, there is not a doubt in my mind it is space junk,\" Tucker told Space.com.\n'I'm a farmer ... what am I going to say to NASA?'\nThe sheep farmer Mick Miners discovered the 10-foot-tall object in his field on July 25, he told ABC.

{"question":"What role did self-sufficiency and employee amenities play in both the Brooklyn Navy Yard's current development plans and the historic Sears complex's operations?","answer":"Both facilities approached self-sufficiency and employee amenities differently. The Sears complex operated as a comprehensive 'city within a city' by 1943, featuring its own fire department with volunteer firemen, a 200,000-gallon water tank, a private bank for employees, separate cafeterias for men and women, and extensive athletic facilities including tennis courts and a YMCA department to boost employee morale. In contrast, the Brooklyn Navy Yard's current development focuses on workplace design that responds to modern needs, including worker health and safety demands, lifestyle amenities, and communal interaction (the 'We Work' phenomenon). The Yard's development strategy emphasizes sustainable building practices, addressing climate change and aging infrastructure while creating safe, life-enhancing work experiences. Both approaches reflect their respective eras' understanding of workplace needs, with Sears focusing on practical self-containment and employee recreation, while the Navy Yard emphasizes environmental sustainability and modern workplace culture.","context":["Even before COVID-19 upended the national economy and shifted our work and travel patterns, significant forces of change were influencing four dimensions of urban work: the work itself, who does the work, the location of work, and the design of workspaces. Traditional manufacturing that once provided jobs in cities like New York has relocated to suburban and exurban settings, and offshore, or been eliminated through automation. Small scale urban manufacturers remain, and innovative industrial and office uses in the ‚ÄúTAMI‚Äù sectors (technology, advertising, media, and information), as well as biotechnology, healthcare, arts, and cultural creation, hold significant promise for the future of urban economies, like New York‚Äôs. This shift in the profile of urban business has had a profound impact on individuals as well as cities. New York currently faces a large and growing disparity in economic opportunity for different segments of its population. Fueled by the booming technology sector, college-educated, professionally-trained individuals are thriving here, while many immigrants and those who lack college degrees, especially individuals of color, struggle to get by with more limited educational and economic opportunities.\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard (‚Äúthe Yard‚Äù), is evolving to mitigate the loss of manufacturing jobs from New York City. The Yard is a nationally recognized model of a successful urban industrial site transformation. Initially established in 1801, the Yard served as America‚Äôs premier shipbuilding facility for 165 years until 1966 when the U.S. Navy decommissioned the site and sold it to the City of New York. At its peak during World War II, the Yard generated more than 70,000 jobs and served as the economic heart of Brooklyn. Since then, the maritime uses that once occupied the Yard have closed or relocated elsewhere.\nUnder the stewardship of the non-profit Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation (‚ÄúBNYDC‚Äù), the Yard has transitioned from its maritime origins to a modern industrial park that is a leader in business incubation and middle-class job creation. Today, the 300-acre site is home to a network of more than 450 businesses that generate 10,000 jobs for New York City. The Yard‚Äôs goal is to grow, generating an additional 10,000 jobs by 2030, with a future total of 30,000 jobs at the Yard.\nReal estate development plays a vital role in the Yard‚Äôs success. Partnering with developers, or developing on its own, the BNYDC has redeveloped or contracted for the private development of more than 40 buildings and 5 million square feet of workspace within the footprint of its 300-acre campus. Some of these projects, including New Lab and Steiner Studios represent state-of-the-art urban workplaces that set the standard for workplace design in their fields.\nToday, the Yard‚Äôs supply of leasable space is fully occupied. In order to create 10,000 more jobs by 2030, new space must be developed. To guide its future growth, the Yard has set out an ambitious master plan that calls for the addition of a total of 5.1 million square feet of workspace divided among four (4) separate sites within the campus. This master plan, developed with WXY Architects, will be the starting point for students‚Äô investigations into the Yard and its role as an economic driver for New York City.\nWith the onset of COVID-19 there is considerable uncertainty about the future of urban workplaces and the jobs they provide. Major companies like Facebook and Twitter have announced their intention to continue encouraging remote work, leaving landlords and developers wondering whether urban workplaces will be needed at all.\nIt is too early to tell how the pandemic and other market forces will impact modern urban work sectors, or how this will affect tenants‚Äô future rental decisions. We know, though, that the needs and desires of prospective employers and tenants are critical in the design of commercial buildings. If these are changing (and they are), then the buildings we design to house these tenants must change too. But how? Consider this‚Äîthe average American worker spends 90,000 hours or one-third of his/her lifetime at work. If we believe that work should enhance and support life, not punish us for being human, then the thoughtful design of our future workplaces is a crucial topic to consider.\nThe design of future workplaces will also have a significant impact on the health of our cities. According to the United Nations Environment Program, buildings and their construction together account for 36 percent of global energy use and 39 percent of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions annually. High-density commercial buildings are often the worst offenders. Therefore, the location and design of future commercial and industrial spaces can either exacerbate or mitigate the challenges that cities face as they struggle with climate change, aging infrastructure, growing populations, and increasing social and economic inequities.\nThe design of workspaces, both industrial and office, continues to evolve in response to many factors. These include rapidly changing technologies, worker health and safety demands (both regulatory and voluntary), and the desire for lifestyle amenities and communal interaction (the ‚ÄúWe Work‚Äù phenomenon). These spatial, cultural, technological, and systemic changes will continue to evolve post-COVID. The next generation of commercial developments must consider whether previous trends (such as open offices and lounge areas) will continue to be in demand. Beyond that, though, they must consider how design decisions can support the creation of safe, life-enhancing work experiences for all.\nThe type of workplaces we create will influence the types of jobs that are available in the future. While there is no looking back to the age of traditional urban manufacturing as the panacea it never was, new workplace development can contribute to a more equitable and greener society. Architects and developers have an important role in considering the environmental and employment impacts, as well as the educational and technological linkages that are inherent in the buildings they propose to create.\nThe site of the 2020 Bass Studio is identified in the Yard‚Äôs master plan as the Kent Avenue ‚ÄúA‚Äù site (the ‚ÄúSite‚Äù). This triangularly shaped parcel is situated on the East River, at the northern edge of the Yard. It contains approximately 220,000 square feet of land on which a 770,620 square foot mixed-use industrial and office building and publicly accessible waterfront open space are proposed.\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard‚Äôs overarching goal is ‚Äú‚Ä¶ to fuel New York City‚Äôs economic vitality by creating and preserving quality jobs, growing the City‚Äôs modern industrial sector and its businesses, and connecting the local community with the economic opportunity and resources of the Yard.‚Äù This objective frames the program and purpose of development of the Kent Avenue site; however, it does not address the complex and often competing physical challenges of the site and its surrounds‚Äîits location at the edge of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the surrounding neighborhood, and its location at the water‚Äôs edge along the East River, as well as requirements for access and circulation. It also does not address the seemingly contradictory demands of development in the Yard‚Äîto be mission-driven and subsidized, but economically feasible.\nThe 2020 Bass Studio will confront these topics and will culminate in the design of a project for a developer on the Kent Avenue site.\nThe studio will follow a process similar to that of an architectural and development project and will be organized into 3 related and overlapping phases:\n- Research, Analysis and Case Studies\n- Project Presentation\nThrough a series of research and analysis exercises, case studies, and panel discussions with experts, the first few weeks of the 2020 Bass Studio will immerse students in the many issues, both physical and economic, that frame development of the Site. Students will have the opportunity to discuss these issues not only with the leadership and master-planners of the Yard, but with local officials, city planners, and technical experts in the fields of urban design and sustainable building technology. Working in teams, students will research and present case studies of precedents and comparable projects, studying different types of urban workplaces and urban waterfront development.\nStudents will analyze and respond to the Brooklyn Navy Yard master plan and its proposed program for Kent ‚ÄúA.‚Äù Presenting possible alternatives, they will work toward reconciling the competing demands of the Yard‚Äôs mission, the site conditions and context, and a feasible economic outcome as they investigate how to create an optimal development program that responds to the site‚Äôs unique conditions, while still meeting the Yard‚Äôs objectives.\nBy midterm, each student will describe their individual project concept, supported by analysis, diagrams, and initial design drawings, and including a detailed space program, for review and feedback. Students will then focus on the detailed development of their design proposal, carrying it to a high level of architectural resolution, with desk crits and pin-ups providing individual and group opportunities for discussion and feedback.\nIn realizing an architectural project, representation and presentation of the design can have a significant impact, and developing a narrative and a presentation strategy can be seen as part of the design process. Especially given the constraints of remote presentation of the studio work, exploration of alternate forms of architectural study, representation and storytelling will be encouraged.\nThroughout the semester students will partner with Abby Hamlin (the developer) to develop their concepts and designs and then present them as part of a fictional ‚Äúopen ideas competition‚Äù at a final jury that will include jurors representing the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\nThe Bass Studio offers students the opportunity to interact with and learn from a developer. This year‚Äôs Bass Fellow, Abby Hamlin, is committed to be an active participant throughout the semester. She will moderate and guide panel discussions on real estate and planning topics relevant to design decision-making and will review work with the students while it is in progress, offering ideas about project feasibility and design efficiency. In this way, students in the 2020 Bass Studio will gain a direct understanding of development decision making as it would be carried out in the work environment.\n‚ÄúAs a nexus of technology, community, and the locus of our livelihood, the workplace is a topic of perpetual interest in architecture and interior design.‚Äù\n‚ÄîArchitect, May 2020\nFor all of us, work is a necessity. For some of us, it is also a privilege. Can those of us in the public and private sectors who create workplaces, do a better job of developing access to work opportunities for others? Certainly. Can those architects who design workplaces provoke ways to enhance the user‚Äôs work experience? Absolutely. Can everyone involved in the development of buildings contribute to new construction technologies that mitigate climate change? We must.\nThe Bass 2020 Studio will be a place for students to investigate their ideas about how to improve urban workplaces and generate urban jobs. Taken in the context of a worldwide pandemic, a societal call for greater economic equity and inclusion, and a rapidly changing urban business environment, your speculations and provocations for the Brooklyn Navy Yard can prompt real development ideas that lead to meaningful change.","Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex\nSears, Roebuck and Company Complex\nSears Merchandise Building Tower\n|Location||925 S. Homan Avenue, North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois|\n|Area||16 acres (6.5 ha)|\n|Built by||Thompson-Starrett Co.|\n|Architect||Nimmons & Fellows|\n|NRHP reference #||78001129|\n|Added to NRHP||June 2, 1978|\n|Designated NHL||June 2, 1978|\nThe Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex on the west side of Chicago, Illinois is where Sears, Roebuck conducted the bulk of its mail order operations between 1906 and 1993. It also served as the corporate headquarters until 1973, when the Sears Tower was completed. Of its original 40-acre (16 ha) complex, only three buildings now survive, and have been adaptively rehabilitated to other uses. The complex was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, at which time it still included the 3-million square foot mail order plant, the world's largest commercial building when it was completed. That building has been demolished, its site taken up by the Homan Square redevelopment project.\nThese core buildings occupy an area bounded on the north by West Arthington Street, the west by Central Park Avenue, the east by Spaulding Avenue, and the south by West Fillmore Street. The surviving buildings can be seen from Homan and West Arthington.\nSears, Roebuck was founded in 1893, and was originally headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Experiencing rapid growth, the retailer in 1895 moved its headquarters to a building on West Adams Street in Chicago, and again the following year to Fulton and Desplaines Streets. The company's rapid growth created problems with the fulfillment of orders, because it had to lease space all over the city to warehouse its products.\nIn 1904 the company purchased over 40 acres (16 ha) of land on Chicago's West Side, and embarked on one of the largest retail development projects to date. The centerpiece of the company-owned \"city within a city\" were its central administration building, a merchandise development house, and a mail order processing facility, along with a power plant to provide electricity and heat to the entire complex. Designed by Nimmons and Fellows, a local architectural firm, the complex was so large the company required city permission to build over some city streets.\nIn the 1920s extensive athletic facilities were added to the complex, as an encouragement for after-work socialization to keep employee morale high. Included were a clubhouse and tennis courts, and the Sears Department of the YMCA. Events included an annual track and field competitions, and company baseball teams.\nBy 1926, the first ground level parking lots replaced the athletic fields. This happened at the same time that a strategic shift from catalog sales to retail stores had started with easy auto travel making travel to a store more practical. By 1943 the complex had become a city within itself. Sears created their own services for effective use, much advanced beyond what was required at the time, including:\n- a company fire department, with volunteer firemen, and early use of fire sprinklers.\n- a 200,000-gallon water tank, water use and fire prevention purposes.\n- a newspaper publicity office.\n- a cafeteria ‚Äì originally men and women were separated, and multiple levels of service for all employee lunch and breakfast.\n- a private bank offering services for employees on site.\nThe company's growth continued through the 20th century, and by the 1960s it was the largest retailer in the world. Changing trends in retail sales and methods led to a decline, and the company's mail order business was scaled back in 1987, moving out of these premises. The corporate headquarters had been moved in 1973 to the Sears Tower, so the complex then stood vacant. Its closure of the complex presented the city with a redevelopment problem.\nIn 1992 a non-profit partnership organized by former Sears management began to redevelop the site, now dubbed Homan Square. The mail order merchandise building was demolished (except for its main tower), and the land it occupies has been redeveloped to include new residences, retail, and a community center. Homan Square is used as an example of the gradual turn around of North Lawndale. Included in this reconstruction effort is the massive rehabilitation of the former Sears Power House, into the Charles H. Shaw Technology and Learning Center‚Äîa LEED Platinum historic renovation designed by Farr Associates.\nThe elements that survive from the early period of the Sears complex development are organized around South Homan Avenue, between West Arthington Street and the railroad tracks to the south. The merchandise tower, the only surviving element of the 3-million-square-foot Merchandise Building, is to the west, and the Power House and Administration Building are to the east. Beyond those two, fronting on West Arthington and Spaulding Avenue, is the former Merchandise Laboratory.\nSears Merchandise Building Tower\n|Sears Merchandise Building Tower|\n|Location||925 South Homan Avenue, Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois 60624|\n|Roof||76 m (249 ft)|\n|Design and construction|\n|Architect||George G. Nimmons ‚Äì William K. Fellows|\nThe Sears Merchandise Building Tower is a fourteen-story structure, with a limestone base and brick walls. It is crowned by a Classical Revival top floor with round-arch windows and a modillioned cornice. It housed water tanks for firefighting on the upper levels, as well as offices and secretarial training facilities. It also housed the early broadcast facilities for WLS-AM. In 2015, it was refurbished and reopened to the public as the \"John D. and Alexandra C. Nichols Tower\". It now houses non-profit groups and offices, including a classroom on the 12th floor for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The Sears Roebuck plaque is still visible on top of the building.\nThe Sears, Roebuck and Company Administration Building is a broad five-story masonry building, occupying about 3/4 of the block facing West Arthington between South Homan and Spaulding. It has ornate Classical Revival detailing applied to an otherwise fairly typical Chicago School design.\nThe Power Station is a rectangular, nominally single-story, brick structure measuring 114 by 230 feet (35 m √ó 70 m). Its front facade is characterized by tall and large round-arch windows, with a stepped parapet above.\nMerchandise Development Laboratory\nThis building, which is an L-shaped structure six stories in height and finished in brick, housed the company's catalog printing operation from 1905 to 1926. It served for about forty years as its principal product testing laboratory.\n- Ocean's Twelve (2004) ‚Äì George Clooney and Matt Damon along with many other actors filmed a scene in the Power House.\n- Stranger than Fiction (2006) ‚Äì For this movie, Emma Thompson filmed a night scene in front of the tower.\n- \"NHL nomination for Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex\".

{"question":"Please tell me - IoT devices and secure routers have same memory capacity?","answer":"No, they have different memory capacities. IoT devices typically have limited memory, disk and processing capacity due to size, weight, and price constraints, with their software often stripped down to fit these limitations. In contrast, secure routers like the Turris Omnia come with substantial memory capabilities - for example, it features 2 GB RAM and a high-powered dual-core CPU at 1.6 GHz with PC-like performance, making it much more capable than typical IoT devices.","context":["If you‚Äôre interested in cybersecurity you‚Äôve probably read any number of reports in recent years about the often tenuous state of security in consumer devices.\nThat‚Äôs disappointing, but hardly surprising.\nComputing gear of this sort ‚Äì a market segment often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), because the devices are typically tiny and don‚Äôt look or feel like traditional computers ‚Äì is generally simple to use, and thanks to a highly competitive market is usually built down to a price, which is good news for consumers‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶but it doesn‚Äôt leave a whole lot of time or money for vendors to expend on security.\nIoT devices also typically have limited memory, disk and processing capacity, for reasons of size and weight as much as price, so their software is often stripped down to fit.\nThat can work out well, because the more features you leave out, the fewer places there are for bugs to lurk; but it can also end badly because what gets omitted often includes security checks that might otherwise have been included, or implemented more thoroughly.\nNevertheless, some vendors of low-cost devices are responsive to bug reports and publish security fixes promptly, which leads to another problem with the IoT ecosystem, namely that many consumers take a ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù attitude to these devices.\nSo even if your home router gets updated reguarly with security improvements, when was the last time you went and checked if your device actually has the latest firmware version installed?\nWell, if you have an ASUS RT-AC1900P home router ‚Äì a high-end, high-bandwidth home device ‚Äì then we recommend that you do an update check now.\nResearchers at Trustwave found security holes in this router‚Äôs firmware late in 2019, which ASUS duly patched, and those researchers have now gone public with a security advisory that details their findings.\nIronically, the bugs related to the router‚Äôs firmware update process, so the update actually patches the update system itself.\nTrustwave found two vulnerabilities, dubbed CVE-2020-15498 and CVE-2020-15499, that could have allowed crooks to pull off a double-barrelled attack:\n- A bogus firmware update wouldn‚Äôt have had any digital signature checking during download. In theory, crooks could advertise a fake update, or subvert a genuine one, and go undetected.\nThe first bug seems to have been a simple oversight ‚Äì perhaps code added for testing that was never removed, or an insecure option left over from years ago that was never revisited and reviewed.\nSimply put, the router ‚Äì which runs Linux and standard Linux tools, like many IoT devices ‚Äì used the well-known\nwget command utility to organise its downloads, and correctly used an HTTPS (secure) web link‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶but added the non-default command line option\n--no-check-certificate so that a download from a bogus site would not be detected.\nwget documentation explains, this option tells the software:\nDon‚Äôt check the server certificate against the available certificate authorities. Also don‚Äôt require the URL host name to match the common name presented by the certificate.\nThe second bug relied on what‚Äôs known as cross-site scripting.\nWhat to do?\nIf you own an affected ASUS model, check your firmware version.\nAccording to Trustwave, these bugs are fixed if your version is 184.108.40.206.385_20253 or later.\nIf you are a programmer, whether of IoT devices or anything else:\n- Don‚Äôt take cryptographic shortcuts. A job worth doing is worth doing well. If you have gone to the trouble of using HTTPS in the first place, don‚Äôt turn off certificate checking just to get round a temporary problem or to save time while coding.\n- Regularly review cryptographic code for outdated usage and settings. Even if you made an effort to get the cryptography right a few years ago, recommended settings and algorithm choices regularly get updated. As cryptographers like to say, ‚ÄúAttacks only ever get faster.‚Äù\n- Validate all your inputs. Always watch out for booby-trapped input, for example strings that are too long, or that contain disallowed characters. Don‚Äôt give attackers the chance to trigger buffer overflows or to inject rogue commands into what is supposed to be plain data.","Cybersecurity is a necessity for any modern home network. In order to achieve this effectively, you will need to make sure that you are using the most secure router possible, locking down your network to the best of your ability.\nYou will still want a router that performs well and is capable of everything you need, but you will also want to have the best security features like encryption, firewalls, and even parental controls.\nMalware and cybercrimes are on the rise, especially as more people are spending their days online. Here are the best routers for security on the market right now.\nFeatures That The Most Secure WiFi Router Should Have\nIn order to keep cybercriminals out of your network, you need to consider the WPA encryption you are getting from your router. The WPA2 is the most widely-used form of encryption on the market, but the newest form is the WPA3.\nRegardless, you never should opt for a router that has neither of these options. Encryption makes it hard for anyone to simply walk into your network and begin poking around, so look at WPA first.\nGuest Network Access\nEveryone needs WiFi, regardless of where they are at, including your friends or family that is over. The best thing that you can do for a visitor is to have a guest network setup on your router.\nThis way, an outsider cannot access your shared files or even the devices within your network, ensuring that they do not accidentally breach your security settings and allow in malware to your network.\nHaving a VPN or Virtual Privacy Network is also a great way to ensure your security online. A VPN works by hiding your IP address from websites that you might be visiting, so nothing can make its way back into your network.\nEven the web traffic is encrypted, so anything interfering it would not be able to work out what your actual destination was. Routers should come with a VPN and you need to make sure it is enabled.\nParental Controls & Time Access Restrictions\nFinally, when securing your router, make sure that the router has parental controls, which might include time restrictions. As children are needed to be more and more online, the need for this is continually greater.\nIt can prevent children from accessing dangerous content while also keeping cybercriminals away from them. Time limiting is another great feature, where the router can disable their device after a set amount of time.\n7 Most Secure Routers (2022)\n1. Netgear R7000\n2. Synology RT2600\n3. Turris Omnia\n4. Linksys EA7500\n5. Asus RT-AX88U\n6. Gryphon AC3000\n7. Linksys WRT 3200\n1. Netgear Nighthawk R7000 WiFi Router\nMost Secure Router (Editor's Choice)\nOur choice for the most secure router is the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. The R7000 has good speeds, reliable performance, and all of the security features you need.\nThe R7000 is a horizontal router made with three high-gain antennas that can be positioned in the direction that you need most. The design is large, so it will take up a lot of room on your shelf.\nThe router also uses Amazon Alexa voice controls of you have any Amazon devices in your home. Beyond the USB 3.0 port, you will get 4 x 1 Gigabit Ethernet ports.\nThe R7000‚Äôs security includes supporting WPA2 wireless security protocols, guest WiFi access, a firewall, a VPN, and DoS.\nThe Netgear Armor will protect your network from malware and viruses under a paid subscription. The router also connects to the OpenVPN Connect App, which allows you to have remote access to the network. It also has smart parental controls for more safety.\nThe performance for the R7000 is great. You can have up to 1800 square feet with dual-band up to 600 + 1300 Mbps. You can have up to 30 devices connected at one time with the R7000, which should work for most homes.\nThat means your TVs and gamin consoles as well as mobile devices. The router also features the ReadySHARE Vault that provides an automatic backup to your USB 3.0 port.\nThe R7000 has a 1 GHz dual-core processor as in addition to a Beamforming+ feature that adds more power to your antennas while extending the reach of your network. Another feature with this router is the dynamic QoS, so you can prioritize which devices should get the best speeds.\n2. Synology RT2600ac Secure Router\nThe runner up is the Synology RT2600ac router. The Synology RT2600ac is a great choice with excellent parental controls.\nThe Synology router has a typical standard router design, since it is black, sits horizontally, and has four antennas. It comes with five Ethernet ports, so you will be able to directly wire-in whatever devices that you need to.\nThe Synology router is built with a 1.7 GHz dual-core processor so it is ready to take on whatever job that you want to through at it. It also has Dual-WAN capabilities, which allow for load balancing and failover support.\nThe router also can act like a private cloud server with its advanced file management capabilities.

ASUS RT-AX88U AX6000 Router\nGamers sometimes need even more security than the average user. If you or anyone in your network is serious about gaming, we suggest the Asus RT-AX88U AX6000.\nThe AX6000 has a horizontal design with four high-gain antennas that can be moved to point in whatever direction that you like. The design is a little bit bulky and will take up a lot of space wherever it is placed, but it is worth it. It comes with 8 LAN ports as well to support even more devices.\nWhen it comes to security, the AX6000 uses Ai-Protection to keep malware and other viruses out of your system.

Gryphon AC3000 Mesh WiFi Router\nThis router is a little bit different than most of the routers that we have looked at here, in both design and abilities, making it a unique and impressive choice.\nThe Gryphon has a unique design since it is white and stands vertically, keeping the router cool, increasing its overall longevity. Since the antennas on this high performance router are all internal, there are no unsightly pieces sticking out of it, making it easier to blend in with your d√©cor\nThe set up for this router is simple and straight forward, including when you want add on new Gryphon routers to further extend the coverage. It does come with security features as well, including ESET malware detection, AI-Intrusion Detection, and content filtering. It also works with an app to help manage your settings.\nThe Gryphon is a powerful router that covers up to 3,000 square feet, but it also can easily act as a mesh system, where you can infinitely expand the network by simply adding on another Gryphon router. It does not need more than one Gryphon to reach 3,000 square feet in coverage, however, which should work with the average larger home network all by itself.\nThis is a tri-band router with a 2.4 GHz band and 2 5 GHz bands, which will keep traffic flowing steadily on your network, without interruptions. It also has 4x4 MU-MIMO technology, making it easier for more than one user to stream at the same time without interruption. Generally, it is a powerful, secure router with a long range and lots of capabilities.\n7. Linksys WRT A3200 WiFi Router\nBest secure router that is also open source is the Linksys WRT AC3200. This is a little different than some of the other routers, but still offers a lot of security features that will not disappoint you.\nThe Linksys WRT A3200 sits horizontally, but it also has legs that keep it elevated from the surface. This provides better ventilation, keeping the device cooler while increasing its longevity. It is also the Linksys blue and black color combination, which might be nice if you are tired of the regular black router casings.\nBecause this is an open source router, it provides advanced customization options in just about every way, from security features to customization. The level of security that you want from this router is really up to you. It does require more configuration, but if you take the time, it will be worth the effort.\nThe performance of the Linksys WRT A3200 is excellent.

It is dual-band with speeds up to 2.6 Gbps, with an operating temperature from 32 to 104 F (0 to 40 C), meaning the machine will not overheat easily and should be able to handle anything.\nWhen it comes to looking for the most secure router on the market, you will need to think about encryption, firewalls, parental controls, and even VPNs.\nThe best all-around router to meet this need is the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. This router has the security that you want with all of the performance needs the average home network has.\nEven if you want a higher performance router, like the Turris Omnia, you will still need to make sure that it has all of the security features that will keep your network safe and locked down. Whether basic or open source, your security should be your first consideration."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:808c822f-3dad-457c-9c32-361e0688f2c1>","<urn:uuid:662a6d89-b4d9-4ca9-8a11-0000cd07c343>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a traveler concerned about safety, could you compare the rabies risks and vaccination recommendations between African and Middle Eastern countries?","answer":"Both regions have significant rabies risks but with different contexts. In the Middle East, rabies is present in all countries and is transmitted through bites or licks on broken skin from infected animals. If not vaccinated, you need five injections starting within 24 hours of exposure. For Africa, rabies is particularly prevalent in countries with large stray dog populations. The vaccine is specifically recommended for travelers who may have close contact with animals in both regions. Pre-travel vaccination requires three injections over a month, though this doesn't provide complete immunity - it only buys more time to seek treatment.","context":["Prevention is the key to staying healthy while travelling in the Middle East. Infectious diseases can and do occur in the region but are usually associated with poor living conditions and poverty and can be avoided with a few precautions. The most common reason for travellers needing medical help is as a result of accidents ‚Äì cars are not always well maintained, seatbelts are rare and poorly lit roads are littered with potholes. Medical facilities can be excellent in large cities, but in remote areas may be more basic.\nChecking insurance quotes‚Ä¶\nBefore You Go\nA little planning before departure can save you a lot of trouble later. See your dentist before a long trip; carry a spare pair of contact lenses and glasses (and take your optical prescription); and carry a first-aid kit with you.\nIt‚Äôs tempting to leave it all to the last minute ‚Äì don‚Äôt! Many vaccines don‚Äôt ensure immunity until two weeks after treatment, so visit a doctor four to eight weeks before departure. Ask your doctor for an International Certificate of Vaccination (otherwise known as the yellow booklet), which will list all the vaccinations you‚Äôve received. This is mandatory for countries that require proof of yellow fever vaccination upon entry (and you'll need this if you're flying in from sub-Saharan Africa), but it‚Äôs a good idea to carry it wherever you travel.\nTravellers can register with the International Association for Medical Advice to Travellers (www.iamat.org). Its website can help travellers to find a doctor with recognised training. Those heading off to very remote areas might like to do a first-aid course (Red Cross and St John Ambulance can help).\nBring medications in their original, clearly labelled containers. A signed and dated letter from your physician describing your medical conditions and medications, including generic names, is also a good idea. If carrying syringes or needles, be sure to have a physician‚Äôs letter documenting their medical necessity.\nFind out in advance if your insurance plan will make payments directly to providers or reimburse you later for overseas health expenditures (in many Middle Eastern countries doctors expect payment in cash). It‚Äôs also worth making sure that your travel insurance will cover repatriation home or to better medical facilities elsewhere. Your insurance company may be able to locate the nearest source of medical help, or you can ask at your hotel. In an emergency, contact your embassy or consulate. Your travel insurance will not usually cover you for anything other than emergency dental treatment. Not all insurance covers emergency aeromedical evacuation home or to a hospital in a major city, which may be the only way to get medical attention for a serious emergency.\nFollowing is a list of other items you should consider packing in your medical kit.\n- acetaminophen/paracetamol (eg Tylenol) or aspirin\n- adhesive or paper tape\n- antibacterial ointment (eg Bactroban) for cuts and abrasions\n- antibiotics (if travelling off the beaten track)\n- antidiarrhoeal drugs (eg containing loperamide)\n- antihistamines (for hay fever and allergic reactions)\n- anti-inflammatory drugs (eg containing ibuprofen)\n- bandages, gauze, gauze rolls\n- insect repellent that contains DEET (for skin)\n- insect spray that contains permethrin (for clothing, tents and bed nets)\n- iodine tablets (for water purification)\n- oral-rehydration salts\n- pocket knife\n- scissors, safety pins, tweezers\n- steroid cream or cortisone (for allergic rashes)\n- syringes and sterile needles (if travelling to remote areas)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all travellers, regardless of the region they are travelling in, should be covered for diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella and polio, as well as hepatitis B. While making preparations to travel, take the opportunity to ensure that all of your routine vaccination cover is complete. The consequences of these diseases can be severe and outbreaks do occur in the Middle East.\nTravel Health Websites\nThere is a wealth of travel health advice on the internet. The World Health Organization publishes the helpful International Travel and Health, available free at www.who.int/ith. Other useful websites include MD Travel Health (www.redplanet.travel/mdtravelhealth), Travel Doctor (www.traveldoctor.co.uk) and Fit for Travel (www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk).\nOfficial government travel health websites:\nIn the Middle East\nAvailability & Cost of Healthcare\nThe health care systems in the Middle East are varied. Medical care can be excellent in Israel and Turkey, with well-trained doctors and nurses, but can be patchier elsewhere. Reciprocal health arrangements with countries rarely exist and you should be prepared to pay for all medical and dental treatment.\nMedical care is not always readily available outside major cities. Medicine, and even sterile dressings or intravenous fluids, may need to be bought from a local pharmacy. Nursing care may be limited or rudimentary as this is something families and friends are expected to provide.\nStandards of dental care are variable throughout the region, and there is an increased risk of hepatitis B and HIV transmission via poorly sterilised equipment.\nFor minor illnesses such as diarrhoea, pharmacists can often provide valuable advice and sell over-the-counter medication. They can also advise as to whether more specialised help is needed.\nDiphtheria is spread through close respiratory contact. It causes a high temperature and severe sore throat. Sometimes a membrane forms across the throat requiring a tracheotomy to prevent suffocation. Vaccination is recommended for those likely to be in close contact with the local population in infected areas. The vaccine is given as an injection alone, or with tetanus, and lasts 10 years.\nHepatitis A is spread through contaminated food (particularly shellfish) and water. It causes jaundice, and although it is rarely fatal, can cause prolonged lethargy and delayed recovery. Symptoms include dark urine, a yellow colour to the whites of the eyes, fever, and abdominal pain. Hepatitis A vaccine (Avaxim, VAQTA, Havrix) is given as an injection: a single dose will give protection for up to a year, while a booster 12 months later will provide a subsequent 10 years of protection.\nInfected blood, contaminated needles and sexual intercourse can all transmit hepatitis B. It can cause jaundice, and affects the liver, occasionally causing liver failure. All travellers should make this a routine vaccination. (Many countries now give hepatitis B vaccination as part of routine childhood vaccination.) A course will give protection for at least five years, and can be given over four weeks or six months.\nSpread through the bite of an infected sand fly, leishmaniasis can cause a slowly growing skin lump or ulcer. It may develop into a serious life-threatening fever usually accompanied by anaemia and weight loss. Sand fly bites should be avoided whenever possible. Infected dogs are also carriers. Leishmaniasis is present in Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey.\nThe prevalence of malaria varies throughout the Middle East. Many areas are considered to be malaria free, while others have seasonal risks. The risk of malaria is minimal in most cities; however, check with your doctor if you are considering travelling to any rural areas. It is important to take antimalarial tablets if the risk is significant. For up-to-date information about the risk of contracting malaria in a specific country, contact your local travel health clinic.\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is present throughout the Middle East and causes serious respiratory problems, with children and the elderly particularly at risk. MERS can be fatal in approximately one-third of cases. The illness can be passed from sick animals (particularly camels) to people ‚Äì always wash your hands thoroughly and immediately after being in contact with camels ‚Äì although it is not understood how the virus passes from one person to another. Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and (sometimes) pneumonia. Other possible symptoms include muscle pain, diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.\nGenerally spread through contaminated food and water, polio is present, though rare, throughout the Middle East. It is one of the vaccines given in childhood and should be boosted every 10 years, either orally (a drop on the tongue), or as an injection. Polio may be carried asymptomatically, although it can cause a transient fever and, in rare cases, potentially permanent muscle weakness or paralysis.\nSpread through bites or licks on broken skin from an infected animal, rabies (present in all countries of the Middle East) is fatal. Animal handlers should be vaccinated, as should those travelling to remote areas where a reliable source of postbite vaccine is not available within 24 hours. Three injections are needed over a month. If you have not been vaccinated you will need a course of five injections starting within 24 hours or as soon as possible after the injury. Vaccination does not provide you with immunity, it merely buys you more time to seek appropriate medical treatment.\nRift Valley Fever\nThis haemorrhagic fever, which is found in Egypt, is spread through blood or blood products, including those from infected animals. It causes a flu-like illness with fever, joint pains and occasionally more serious complications. Complete recovery is possible.\nOtherwise known as bilharzia, this is spread through the freshwater snail. It causes infection of the bowel and bladder, often with bleeding. It is caused by a fluke and is contracted through the skin from water contaminated with human urine or faeces. Paddling or swimming in suspect freshwater lakes or slow-running rivers should be avoided. There may be no symptoms. Possible symptoms include a transient fever and rash, and advanced cases of bilharzia may cause blood in the stool or in the urine. A blood test can detect antibodies if you have been exposed and treatment is then possible in specialist travel or infectious-disease clinics. Be especially careful in Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Syria.\nTuberculosis is spread through close respiratory contact and occasionally through infected milk or milk products. BCG vaccine is recommended for those likely to be mixing closely with the local population. It is more important for those visiting family or planning on a long stay, and those employed as teachers and health-care workers. TB can be asymptomatic, although symptoms can include coughing, weight loss or fever months or even years after exposure. An X-ray is the best way to confirm if you have TB. BCG gives a moderate degree of protection against TB. It causes a small permanent scar at the site of injection, and is usually only given in specialised chest clinics. As it‚Äôs a live vaccine it should not be given to pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals. The BCG vaccine is not available in all countries.\nTyphoid is spread through food or water that has been contaminated by infected human faeces. The first symptom is usually fever or a pink rash on the abdomen. Septicaemia (blood poisoning) may also occur. Typhoid vaccine (typhim Vi, typherix) will give protection for three years. In some countries, the oral vaccine Vivotif is also available.\nYellow fever vaccination is not required for any areas of the Middle East. However, the mosquito that spreads yellow fever has been known to be present in some parts of the region. It is important to consult your local travel health clinic as part of your predeparture plans for the latest details. Any travellers from a yellow fever endemic area (eg parts of sub-Saharan Africa) will need to show proof of vaccination against yellow fever before entry.\nHeat exhaustion occurs after heavy sweating and excessive fluid loss with inadequate replacement of fluids and salt. It is particularly common in hot climates when taking unaccustomed exercise before full acclimatisation. Symptoms include headache, dizziness and tiredness. Dehydration is already happening by the time you feel thirsty ‚Äì aim to drink sufficient water so that you produce pale, diluted urine. The treatment of heat exhaustion consists of fluid replacement with water or fruit juice or both, and cooling by cold water and fans. The treatment of the salt-loss component consists of taking in salty fluids (such as soup or broth), and adding a little more table salt to foods than usual.\nHeat stroke is much more serious. This occurs when the heat-regulating mechanism in the body breaks down. An excessive rise in body temperature leads to sweating ceasing, irrational and hyperactive behaviour, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. Rapid cooling by spraying the body with water and fanning is an ideal treatment. Emergency fluid and electrolyte replacement by intravenous drip is usually also required.\nInsect Bites & Stings\nMosquitoes may not carry malaria but can cause irritation and infected bites. Using DEET-based insect repellents will prevent bites. Mosquitoes also spread dengue fever.\nBees and wasps only cause real problems to those with a severe allergy (anaphylaxis). If you have a severe allergy to bee or wasp stings you should carry an adrenaline injection or similar.\nScorpions are frequently found in arid or dry climates. They can cause a painful sting, which is rarely life threatening.\nBed bugs are often found in hostels and cheap hotels. They lead to very itchy lumpy bites. Spraying the mattress with an appropriate insect killer will do a good job of getting rid of them.\nScabies are also frequently found in cheap accommodation. These tiny mites live in the skin, particularly between the fingers. They cause an intensely itchy rash. Scabies is easily treated with lotion available from pharmacies.\nDo not walk barefoot or stick your hand into holes or cracks. Half of those bitten by venomous snakes are not actually injected with poison (envenomed). If bitten by a snake, do not panic. Immobilise the bitten limb with a splint (eg a stick) and apply a bandage over the site using firm pressure, similar to a bandage over a sprain. Do not apply a tourniquet, or cut or suck the bite. Get the victim to medical help as soon as possible so that antivenene can be given if necessary.\nTo prevent diarrhoea, avoid tap water unless it has been boiled, filtered or chemically disinfected (with iodine tablets). Eat only fresh fruits or vegetables if cooked or if you have peeled them yourself, and avoid dairy products that may contain unpasteurised milk. Buffet meals are risky, as food should be piping hot; meals freshly cooked in front of you in a busy restaurant are more likely to be safe.\nIf you develop diarrhoea, be sure to drink plenty of fluids, preferably an oral rehydration solution containing salt and sugar. A few loose stools don‚Äôt require treatment but, if you start having more than four or five stools a day, you should start taking an antibiotic (usually a quinolone drug) and an antidiarrhoeal agent (such as loperamide). If diarrhoea is bloody, persists for more than 72 hours, or is accompanied by fever, shaking chills or severe abdominal pain you should seek medical attention.\nMany locals don‚Äôt drink the tap water and we recommend that you follow their lead. If you do decide to risk the local water, the safest places to do so are in Israel and Turkey. Don‚Äôt even think of drinking from the tap in Egypt, Iran, the Palestinian Territories or Lebanon. Cheap bottled water is readily available throughout the region.\nTravelling with Children\nAll travellers with children should know how to treat minor ailments and when to seek medical treatment. Make sure children are up to date with the routine vaccinations, and discuss possible travel vaccinations well before departure as some are not suitable for children aged under one year old.\nIn hot, moist climates any wound or break in the skin may lead to infection. The area should be cleaned and then kept dry and clean. Remember to avoid potentially contaminated food and water. If your child is vomiting or experiencing diarrhoea, lost fluid and salts must be replaced. It may be helpful to take rehydration powders for reconstituting with boiled water. Ask your doctor about this.\nChildren should be encouraged to avoid dogs or other mammals because of the risk of rabies and other diseases. Any bite, scratch or lick from a warm blooded, furry animal should immediately be thoroughly cleaned. If there is any possibility that the animal is infected with rabies, immediate medical assistance should be sought.\nEmotional stress, exhaustion and travelling through different time zones can all contribute to an upset in the menstrual pattern. If using oral contraceptives, remember some antibiotics, diarrhoea and vomiting can stop the pill from working and lead to the risk of pregnancy ‚Äì it's safest to take other forms of contraception with you.\nEmergency contraception is most effective if taken within 24 hours after unprotected sex. The International Planned Parent Federation (www.ippf.org) can advise about the availability of contraception in different countries.\nTampons and sanitary towels are not always available outside of major cities in the Middle East.\nTravelling during pregnancy is usually possible, but there are important things to consider. Have a medical check-up before embarking on your trip. The most risky times for travel are during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, when miscarriage is most likely, and after 30 weeks, when complications such as high blood pressure and premature delivery can occur. Most airlines will not accept a traveller after 28 to 32 weeks of pregnancy, and long-haul flights in the later stages can be very uncomfortable. Antenatal facilities vary greatly between countries in the Middle East, and you should think carefully before travelling to a country with poor medical facilities or where there are major cultural and language differences compared with home. Taking written records of the pregnancy, including details of your blood group, is likely to be helpful if you need medical attention while away. Ensure your insurance policy covers pregnancy, delivery and postnatal care, but remember insurance policies are only as good as the facilities available.","What Vaccines Do You Need to Travel to Africa?\nIf you are planning a trip to Africa, it is crucial to take necessary precautions to ensure your health and safety.

Explicit data refers to information directly confirmed by the lead, such as information shared in demo request forms or provided to the sales team over the phone. Lead scoring systems typically use a combination of both implicit and explicit data, with each activity or attribute weighted according to its importance in calculating the final score.","context":["When inbound marketing is implemented, it‚Äôs common to focus primarily on bringing in an abundance of leads. When you see those numbers climbing, you get the signal that your strategy and campaigns are working.\nBut what if only a very small percentage of those leads are actually converting? This is a frustrating problem every marketer and sales team has faced. In some cases, the leads are simply not a fit. In others, hot leads are missed when sales teams are struggling to prioritize the sea of leads. This is where lead scoring comes in.\nLead scoring definition\nLead scoring is the process of assigning each lead generated with a numerical score or value that serves as an indication of the lead quality. Scores are based on multiple attributes including geographic, firmographic or technographic information, activity on your website or ads, and engagement with email, SMS or capture campaigns.\nThe exact attributes and filters you choose will depend on your business model and ideal customer profile (ICP), but the data points generally fall into two distinct categories:\nImplicit data - behavioral data. For example, viewing a pricing or feature page on your website or activities during a free trial.\nExplicit data - data confirmed by your lead. For example, information shared in demo request form completes or on the phone to your sales team.\nOften your score will include a combination of both implicit and explicit data. Each activity or attribute will be weighted according to importance, and the algorithm will calculate a single-number score.\nMost lead scoring software, including Ortto‚Äôs scoring tool, will also allow you to set a time decay model to ensure recency. In Ortto, this time decay model is set as a half-life ‚Äî i.e. the time in which the lead will be half as valuable as it was on the day of the lead‚Äôs last interaction. Your half-life will be set by you, usually according to the sales cycle for your business, and will only be applied to behavioral or activty-based attributes.\nWhy is lead scoring important?\nThe obvious answer here is that it prioritizes leads for your sales team, allowing them to focus on the low-hanging fruit, getting qualified leads across the line before they move on.\nLead scoring can help your marketing team focus their efforts, too. For example, when lead scores are in place your marketing team can measure the impact of their campaigns by tracking not just the volume of leads, but the volume of high-quality leads. This will quickly show them where advertising dollars are being wasted or the team‚Äôs time could be better spent.\nIn addition, lead scoring can help align sales and marketing teams by ensuring that the leads marketing passes to sales are qualified. Sales and marketing misalignment is a common problem and can cause decay in the relationship between the two departments. With a lead scoring model in place that both parties agree on, this misalignment can be resolved.\nA strong lead scoring model can also have a major business impact including increased revenue, decreased time to sale, and even a higher revenue per employee. When leads are highly qualified, every team from marketing to sales, customer support to product, will be clearer on who the best customer is and what they‚Äôre looking for.\nShould you have one or more lead scores?\nIn Ortto, users can create multiple lead-scoring models with ease and track them all in real time against Person and Organization profiles. While on the surface this may seem like it‚Äôs overcomplicating the issue, it can be incredibly helpful when you‚Äôre analyzing data and drawing insights.\nHere are a few examples where having more than one lead score could benefit your business:\nYou want to assess fit and intent\nFit and intent are two of the most common:\nProduct fit / Buyer persona fit (how closely does this lead match your buyer persona?)\nLead intent (does this lead show signs of intent including pricing page views, offer downloads or demo request form completes?)\nWith these two scores in place, your sales team could prioritize the leads who are both a product fit and demonstrate a high level of intent. When they move on to those leads showing a high-level intent but lower product fit, they can focus on making a case for a strong product fit (assuming there is one) and can nudge those buyers showing a strong product fit but lower intent across the line with urgency campaigns.\nYou have multiple buyer personas\nMany businesses have multiple buyer personas and a single lead-scoring model simply won‚Äôt cover them all. For example, an Edutech business may have both teachers and parents as customers, with different content and campaigns for each audience, or even different sales and marketing departments for each. In this case, having at least two lead scoring models is essential to accurately weigh up the impact of marketing activity and route leads to the right place.\nIn another example, you may have three tiers of buyers involved in the process. Buyers, influencers, and buyer/users. With multiple scoring options in place, you could score based on specific attributes in each of these categories.\nYou want a more granular understanding of marketing performance\nSetting up multiple lead-scoring models can help you get a more granular understanding of how different campaigns, channels, and messages are performing. For example, if you have a lead magnet like an ebook and you‚Äôre running lead capture ads on social media, you may discover that this campaign brings in leads who are a strong product fit but don‚Äôt show much intent.\nWith this information, you can start to assess how you could tweak your campaigns, nurture journeys, or sales strategies to focus on intent.\nYou are focused on upselling\nPerhaps your business offers a suite of products and you‚Äôve recently announced a new offering, so your sales team has switched their focus to upselling. In this case, creating a lead scoring model for existing customers who have a high likelihood to expand will be essential to your success.\nYou‚Äôre just getting started\nWhen you‚Äôre just starting out with lead scoring or refreshing your strategy, it can be helpful to test a few different models before determining which is most effective for predicting conversion.\nHow to create your lead scoring model\nIf you‚Äôre generating leads and converting even a fraction of them, you‚Äôll be able to start identifying the right attributes for your lead-scoring model. Follow these steps to create your lead scoring model.\n1. Calculate your conversion rates\nStart by calculating your overall conversion rate across all leads. You will want to use this as a baseline or benchmark as you start to identify your top-performing leads and the attributes that indicate a lead is of higher quality.\n2. Spot patterns between high-quality leads\nLook at your high-value, converted customers and start to identify the attributes they have in common. For example, you may notice that the vast majority of your highest-value customers are in a specific industry or have responded to content, webinars, and other marketing activities about a specific product feature or benefit.\nThese insights are best developed with both quantitative and qualitative information. Speak to your sales and success teams, and perform customer interviews to answer the following questions:\nWhat do the leads who convert have in common?\nIs there a specific type of lead that your sales team reports as being the quickest to convert?\nWhich campaigns or messages are the most likely to lead to conversions?\nWhat common attributes or activities exist between your most self-sufficient customers?\nAre there any common attributes between customers who have expanded?\n3. Calculate the weighting of each attribute and activity\nOnce you have identified attributes and activities, compare the conversion rate of each to identify point values. For example, if the customers who requested a demo have a 25% close rate and the customers who attended a webinar have a 5% close rate, you will know that the activity ‚ÄòRequested a demo‚Äô should be 5x higher than the activity ‚ÄòAttended webinar.‚Äô Learn more about how to set this up in Ortto here.\n4. Identify a half-life\nYour half-life will be the point at which the lead becomes half as valuable. To identify this, calculate an overall time to conversion or average buying cycle and divide it by two. This will give you a half-life that can be used against each of the Activities in your scores.\n5. Measure success\nIn the early stages, you will want to ensure you are tracking how many of your qualified leads actually convert, especially if you have more than one lead-scoring model in place. Sales and marketing should keep close to the numbers and tweak attributes, activities, and weights according to the conversion rate on each lead type.\nLead scoring is a critical component to measuring success, prioritizing sales teams' time, and understanding your customer‚Äôs journey. In Ortto, you can easily set up multiple lead scoring models to ensure your sales and marketing teams are able to prioritize, track progress, and work towards a meaningful goal."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1fa07ddc-3407-440e-bfe1-8972cdc9b999>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm conducting research on the Great Plains ecosystem. Could you explain how both creative writers and scientists have documented the relationship between human displacement and environmental changes in this region?","answer":"Both literary and scientific perspectives reveal deep connections between human displacement and environmental changes in the Great Plains. Literary accounts describe the region as a place of displacement, where newcomers must confront an unfamiliar landscape that can feel unnerving and alienating, as reflected in responses to Nebraska's motto 'Honestly, it's not for everyone.' This sense of displacement is paralleled by environmental displacement, as 42% of the Great Plains has been converted to cropland, fundamentally altering the region's ecology. This conversion has significantly reduced the area's natural carbon sequestration capabilities, with cropland soils showing 30-40% less soil organic carbon compared to native vegetation. The transformation affects both human and ecological systems - while some struggle with cultural adaptation to the plains landscape, the ecosystem simultaneously loses its natural capacity for carbon storage and the beneficial effects of traditional wildlife patterns, particularly those of the bison, which were crucial for building soil, maintaining biological diversity, and enabling deep plant root systems essential for carbon sequestration.","context":["Kwame Dawes is not a poet of the American Great Plains, though the landscape and its seasons serve as the space for the poets latest room for meditation. Unlike his colleague at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Ted Kooser, Dawes is a transplant to the American Midwest. In his latest poetry collection, Nebraska (University of Nebraska Press, 2019), Dawes‚Äôs obsession is fixated on ideas of place and the feeling of displacement this landscape so foreign to his own has conjured.\nIn ‚ÄúThe Chronicler of Sorrows‚Äù he writes, ‚ÄúWere I better at this, I would study almanacs, / chart the seasons, visit Ted Kooser on his farm / in midwinter, without invitation.‚Äù With few exceptions, when Dawes writes about Nebraska, the state seems to be in a permanent winter, which a reader can certainly imagine as being a significant trope representing the state‚Äôs recent history of flooding due to excessive rain. Just like much of the world outside of Nebraska, the state, too, is experiencing a climate crisis that echoes throughout the backdrop of these poems, creating a sense of never-ceasing gloom for the land and its people, which is inescapable from the poet‚Äôs perception. Such a cycle of seasons is rich with opportunity for reflection amid expansive whiteness, a type of washing that can be overwhelming at times, scattered across the seemingly never-ending terrain. Winter is a time where the poet must lament his exile from home.\nThis collection‚Äôs epigraph is taken from the recently adopted Nebraska state slogan. In 2018, the new state motto was unveiled‚Äî‚ÄúHonestly, it‚Äôs not for everyone.‚Äù In ‚ÄúThe Enemy of Memory,‚Äù Dawes responds directly to the motto, writing that this is ‚Äúonly funny if you are not an alien arriving for / the first time / in midsummer, shocked by the long day, the blank inertia of the faces ‚Äì not/for everyone.‚Äù For the poet, to be an outsider, an immigrant, a person of color in this land with a slogan like this can be unnerving, though fear is not wholly a response to be avoided. This is to say that Nebraska, the state, seems to be a quant, polite place that at times lulls the excitement away from life.\nIn the middle of one of the earlier poems, ‚ÄúAdvent,‚Äù Dawes writes:\nHere in Nebraska I have learned the art\nof restraint ‚Äì hoarding lamentations and complaints;\nhow to hold my tongue until it is clear\nthat those around me have unlearned\nthe rituals of compassion; they cannot see\nthe despair in my eyes.\nHere, and throughout the collection, we come to understand Nebraska as a battle land for the poet, sometimes in terms of the physical and at others, the spiritual. In a poem like ‚ÄúAdvent,‚Äù the poet has to continue fighting against a place that seems holy in its own right, bordering on sacrilege at a church that chooses to abstain from playing Christmas music in favor of ‚Äúthe radio songs‚Äìgood, clean Jesus / of Chick-fil-A and Texas charm.‚Äù Or, like in the poem ‚ÄúTransplant,‚Äù where Dawes likens the open landscape of the Great Plains to the Garden of Eden, ‚ÄúIt grows dark quickly here, / and God no longer strolls/ the gardens‚Ä¶‚Äù\nIn the first poem of the collection, ‚ÄúHow I Became an Apostle,‚Äù Dawes begins:\nNow that I have my thorn in the flesh,\nI can write epistles, holy writs. It‚Äôs winter.\nI limp out just after the delicate chaos\nof flurries covers the driveway and I shovel.\nThis is a ritual of sin: after clearing a long\npath, behind me the pox of snow returns.\nThough this new place is a fixture in the life of these poems and the poet, it is still imperative to Dawes that he have the opportunity to look back to when home meant something very different for him. When he writes in ‚ÄúLonging for the Hall of the Dead‚Äù that ‚Äúremembering can be an incantation / for light,‚Äù it is because memory and imagination take up an all-consuming passion that soothes even in the midst of crisis or displacement. In ‚ÄúThe Immigrant Contemplates Death,‚Äù Dawes thinks back to Accra and to Jamaica, to soils he knows so well and so soft. Soils for burial, because an intimacy of that nature, with the land, seems more freeing than the current landscape of cold, unflinching solidity. It seems that the poet‚Äôs inability to imagine in this landscape is the fear that occupies much of the his writing. In ‚ÄúThe Midwestern Sky,‚Äù Dawes writes that he feels like ‚ÄúI am an alien / in this wide-open country‚Äù then later:\nIn time, I fear, I too,\nwill turn this questioning into silence,\nand I will welcome death as one\nwelcomes the winds from the west,\ndeep in winter‚Äìwith resignation,\nand with nothing of the pulsing\ndelight that fear can fill our hearts with.\nStill, beauty remains in this expanse, as the poet contemplates the wealth of opportunity that seems innate‚Äînow, as well as when the plains people first saw the land, concluding in ‚ÄúPrairie‚Äù that the wide-ranging opportunity must be home to imagination and continual new beginnings. This is where Nebraska meets the poet most intimately, as a place of riches and with a history of new beginnings.","‚ÄúThe Incredible Shrinking Bison‚Äù  discussed how the increase of CO2 emissions has contributed to the rise of the Great Plains‚Äô average temperature, and how the resulting warming trend has affected the bison. The bison, on the other hand, as a key species to the survival of the plains, can also have an indirect, mitigating effect on the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.\nThe predominate conversation around atmospheric CO2 has centered on the elimination of CO2 production. There is, however, another conversation underway‚Äîone involving the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide is known as carbon sequestration. It is one method of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and consists of two types: geologic and biologic. Geologic carbon sequestration involves the storing of carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations. The CO2 is usually pressurized until it becomes a liquid, and then it is injected into porous rock formations in geologic basins .\nBiologic carbon sequestration refers to storage of atmospheric carbon in vegetation, soils, woody products, and aquatic environments. For example, by encouraging the growth of plants‚Äîparticularly larger plants like trees‚Äîadvocates of biologic sequestration hope to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Within biologic carbon sequestration there are several means by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere. These include peatland, wetland, forestry, agriculture, carbon farming, deep soil, and ocean-related. But of all the terrestrial (as opposed to aquatic) methods, the forests receive the lion‚Äôs share of the world‚Äôs attention. Forgotten are the grasslands which also harbor much of the wetlands. For North America the grasslands of the Great Plains and prairies, which occupy approximately one-third of the continent, are critical to carbon sequestration. And key to the grasslands‚Äô vitality is the North American Bison .\nGrasslands quickly process carbon from the atmosphere and store this carbon in the root structures, which extend 8 to 15 feet into the ground, which can store 22.5 million tons of carbon. These roots can hold the carbon for decades, and process 1.7 million tons of carbon per acre to the soil annually. This storage accumulates over time and moves carbon from the atmosphere to the ground continuously creating massive carbon deposits over the course of centuries. Prairies have the ability to store as much carbon below the ground as forests can store above the ground. When carbon is stored below ground it remains locked there and unable to enter the atmosphere. Compared to forests, grasslands are more reliable. In times of drought and forest fires, the carbon stored in the wood and leaves returns to the atmosphere. During a grass fire, however, carbon is not released since it is stored in the roots underground .\nThough the Great Plains and prairies occupy a vast swath of the North American continent, this does not translate into a great CO2 scrubber. The conversion of this ecosystem into cropland has significantly reduced the ability of this region to sequester carbon . Compared to native or natural vegetation, cropland soils are depleted in soil organic carbon (SOC). When soil is converted from its native state the SOC content in the soil is reduced by approximately 30 to 40% . Further, the crops replacing the native grasses are annuals with comparatively shallow root structures which are less effective in storing carbon and holding soil. With less carbon stored and moved to soil, and increased possibility of soil loss, the effectiveness of the plains and prairies in atmospheric CO2 removal is significantly decreased.\nShort of returning the croplands back to the natural state of the region, there are agricultural methods aimed at sequestering atmospheric carbon into the soil and in crop roots, wood and leaves. These methods are collectively referred to as carbon farming. Besides removing CO2 from the atmosphere, increasing the soil‚Äôs carbon content‚Äîwhether by reverting to the natural condition, or by carbon farming‚Äîaids plant growth, increases soil organic matter which improves agricultural yield, improves soil water retention capacity and reduces fertilizer use which is a source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) .\nCarbon farming or recovering the native perennials, however, is not the complete answer. The ecosystems of the plains and prairies were dependent on the large herds of bison moving over the grasslands. The grazing, trampling and recovery patterns associated with the bison were key in building soil, maintaining biological diversity and deepening plant roots, which are crucial elements in permanent carbon sequestration . The bison not only provided nutrients for plant life, but tilled the soil with their hooves, working up and trampling dung into the soil, enabling plant-life to take hold, flourish and consequently become a significant carbon sink.\nThough sequestration, as used here, is a technical term, the concept is quite familiar. When we hear the word ‚Äúsequester,‚Äù the common association is with juries as in jury trials. When a jury is sequestered, it is removed and kept apart from contact with the public. The purpose is to ensure undue influence on, or tampering with, the deliberations of the jury, and ensure a just verdict. As the jurors file out of the courtroom at the end of the defense‚Äôs and prosecution‚Äôs final presentations, if the judge has ordered they be sequestered, we see the tangible form of a removal to protect the integrity of the trial by jury justice system considered critical to our legal well-being. The notion of using an act of removal in the protection of our well-being is only part of the meaning of sequestration. What is being removed and where it is being kept are equally important. Originally, ‚Äúto sequester‚Äù meant ‚Äú‚Ä¶to put in the hands of a trustee‚Ä¶‚Äù . In regard to carbon sequestration the trustee is the earth itself, or more specifically, in the context of the bison and the grasslands of North America, it is the Great Plains ecosystem. When we think of ecosystems, we tend to think of the land, the flora and the fauna. Often missing in our consideration is the air above. The bison‚Äîa keystone species in regard to the flora and fauna and the land‚Äîis a crucial element of the trustee, instrumental in the process of CO2 removal and the mitigation of the warming trend plaguing the Great Plains.\n Schuette, Keith. ‚ÄúThe Incredible Shrinking Bison.‚Äù November 17, 2020.Bison Witness.

{"question":"How does exposure to nature affect violent behavior in cities?","answer":"Contact with nature has been shown to reduce aggressive and violent behavior in cities. Environmental conditions like crowding, noise, and high temperatures can lead to inattentive, irritable, and impulsive behaviors associated with violence. Research has demonstrated that access to green settings helps reduce these negative behaviors and decreases the incidence of aggression and violence in urban areas.","context":["We are missing an important value of the urban forest, intangible social services\nAs managers and stewards of the state‚Äôs urban forests we often not acknowledging the important social values. We have a responsibility to not only provide technical assistance in the conservation and restoration of the urban forest, but to better represent and promote all of its values. During the past decade we have made significant progress in using a variety of models to document the role that our urban forests play in providing clean air and water, reducing stormwater flows, reducing energy demand and sequestering and storing green house gases. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests that we are missing this equally important set of values (Vejre et al. 2010).\nThere is a deep and abiding connection between people and plants. It can be traced back to the earliest periods of human existence. Today‚Äôs sprawling metropolitan areas can leave residents detached from nature. This can lead to feelings of stress and alienation, both of which are pervasive in our contemporary urban society.\nWhat the research says might surprise you\nFor instance, work and study often require long periods of directed attention that lead to fatigue. Fatigue can result in feelings of anxiety, irritability and an inability to concentrate. Rachel and Stephen Kaplan have conducted research on the restorative properties of encounters with nature in urban areas. They found that such interaction counteracts these symptoms of fatigue. They also conducted a survey of office workers with and without a view of a natural setting from their office window to determine rates of illness and worker satisfaction. Those workers without the nature view reported 23% more illness. Workers with the nature view indicated higher levels of job satisfaction, were less frustrated, more patient, and felt more enthusiastic (Kaplan 1989).\nThe physical environment has a well-documented impact on human aggression. Crowding, noise and high temperatures all contribute to levels of violent behavior. Some researchers believe that these environmental conditions lead to inattentive, irritable and impulsive behaviors that are all associated with violence. Contact with nature has been demonstrated to reduce the level of these behaviors and the incidence of aggression and violence in cities (Kuo and Sullivan, 2001). These same researchers found that green settings relieve the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children. Children were shown to more successfully refresh their ability to pay attention by playing outdoors in green spaces.\nWhere to find more information\nIn light of these studies, and others far to numerous to summarize here, the USDA Forest Service ‚Äì Urban and Community Forestry Program in partnership with the University of Washington have developed a web site, Green Cities: Good Health, which provides an overview of the scientific evidence of human health and well-being benefits provided by urban forestry and urban greening. The web site provides access to the nearly 40 years of research documenting how the experience of nature is profoundly important to human functioning, health and well-being.\nWhile civic leaders may intuitively accept that urban nature is important for public health, this web site presents supporting scientific evidence, confirming intuitions and expanding our knowledge. This science-based evidence can have a significant impact on public policy decisions regarding urban forestry, just as the science-based evidence that urban forest play a direct role in urban air and water management has had over the past decade. Given the consistent expansion of metropolitan areas in our state every bit of nearby nature has the potential to benefit hundreds to thousands of people daily. When we speak of ‚Äògreen infrastructure‚Äô and its backbone ‚Äì the urban forest ‚Äì we should no longer be limiting our conversation to the bio-physical values but also to the social and physiological benefits that they provide to the vast majority of people living in our nation today.\nGreen Cities: Good Health University of Washington/U.S. Forest Service\nKaplan, R., & Kaplan, S.

{"question":"What innovative solution has Bio-bean developed for used coffee grounds in London? ‚ôªÔ∏è","answer":"Bio-bean has opened a 20,000-square-foot factory in north London capable of processing 50,000 metric tons of used coffee grounds per year, turning them into biodiesel, barbecue coals and biomass pellets. This represents about one-tenth of the waste grounds from all coffee consumed in the U.K.","context":["Global coffee production creates in excess of 23 million tons of waste per year, according to sustainability researcher Gunter Pauli, from the pulp of fresh coffee cherries through the packaging that brings the roasted beans to your favorite barista. At the consumer end of the supply chain, used coffee grounds are the most visible example of this waste, the bit we dump in the bin after making each fresh brew.\nMost coffee lovers don‚Äôt give much thought to their spent grounds, but these black, sodden remains of pulverized coffee seeds have inspired the freshly caffeinated imaginations of scientists, entrepreneurs and social innovators from Melbourne to London to Seoul, sprouting into ideas of real consequence for the coffee industry.\nSustainability and the Economy\nAcross the world, companies, researchers and engaged consumers are pioneering the next era of environmental sustainability. Enabled by policy changes and innovative technologies, a new paradigm known as the circular economy is emerging, one that holds the promise of reshaping the global economy and transforming our relationship with the natural world ‚Äî the coffee tree very much included. The aim of the circular economy is to close the loop of our industrial system, reducing resource consumption and environmental pollution by transforming waste into input material for the next stage of production.\n‚ÄúSustainability has evolved significantly from the late 1990s to now,‚Äù says Nina Goodrich, executive director of GreenBlue, a nonprofit based in Charlottesville, Virginia, dedicated to the sustainable use of materials. ‚ÄúThe most difficult aspect of sustainability has been integrating this into your business strategy, and the circular economy provides a better framework to help companies do that.‚Äù\nThe circular economy traces its origins back to the 1970s, but it is only in the past few years that the concept has taken off, driven in large part by the work of the U.K.-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation. As Goodrich explains it, a circular economy is based on the recognition that ‚Äúwe have to move away from what folks call our linear economy of take-make-waste and envision a next life for what currently is our waste. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about how we build and make things so that one person‚Äôs waste becomes another person‚Äôs input materials.‚Äù\nOver the past several decades, nongovernmental organizations have gradually succeeded in persuading businesses to adopt a variety of sustainable practices that ultimately transformed the specialty coffee industry. In 2012, for example, 40 percent of global coffee production was produced in compliance with a voluntary sustainability standard, up from 15 percent in 2008, according to the State of Sustainability Initiatives, an organization that reports on global sustainability projects.\nAt the same time, the way for-profit businesses view sustainability has shifted. What began as a somewhat radical concept has evolved into a set of pragmatic managerial practices aligned with corporate objectives, something businesses of all sizes have, for the most part, embraced.\nTransitioning to a circular economy will be a bigger challenge, but just as the global specialty coffee sector pioneered the adoption of sustainable production practices, it now stands poised to lead the food sector in closing the loop of production to reduce resource costs and environmental damage. This concern for the environmental impact of coffee production isn‚Äôt just altruism or public spirit. Climate change and accompanying public concern present a real threat to the viability of the coffee industry, and consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the coffee they consume.\nClearly these challenges are multi-faceted and won‚Äôt be resolved by any single movement, no matter how expansive, but adopting a circular economic business model, and thus reducing waste and alleviating the environmental impacts of non-sustainably sourced input materials, could make a significant impact. Fortunately, scientists, entrepreneurs and coffee lovers around the world are creating innovative ways to move the industry forward.\nReduce, Reuse, Recycle\nShane Genziuk is founder of Ground to Ground, a social enterprise based in Melbourne, Australia, that educates coffee lovers about the myriad wonders of used coffee grounds and connects them to cafes that bag used grounds for easy pickup. He estimates he‚Äôs signed up nearly 1,000 cafes, working in partnership with a liates in London and Austin, Texas.\nGenziuk ‚Äî who has a full-time job and a young family, and is completing a Ph.D. in business administration ‚Äî runs Ground to Ground on passion and copious levels of caffeine. He is acutely aware of the waste that goes into making his favorite drink, and he wants to make a difference by leading a movement for social change. When you educate consumers about the environmental impact of coffee production, he says, they typically recognize their own contributions to the global problem and, in turn, are motivated to become part of the solution.\nGround to Ground is, at its heart, an effort to encourage greater recycling and reduce waste. Genziuk distributes educational material on his website and in person to cafes on the numerous and diverse uses for coffee grounds, such as compost, de-icing material, hair dye and skin exfoliator, among others. Participating cafes agree to bag used grounds and offer them to customers free of charge, helping to divert organic waste from the land fill while sparking greater awareness about sustainability and the impact of individual consumption on the environment.\nMoving Beyond Recycling\nAccording to Zhu Dajian, director of the Institute of Governance for Sustainable Development at Tongji University in Shanghai, initiatives like Ground to Ground are important, but insufficient as a response to global environmental challenges. What sets the circular economy apart is the imperative not just to reduce impact, but to create new value while doing so. Only in this way can the shift away from the linear economy be realized.\nDajian helped to create a circular economy strategy for the Chinese central government, which is struggling to manage the environmental damage produced by its rapid industrialization. The circular economy, he says, is ‚Äúa new economic model that will reduce environmental impact and at the same time provide new jobs.‚Äù\nOne of the key ideas of the circular economy draws its inspiration from industrial ecology, which studies the flow of material and energy through industrial systems in a manner analogous to the natural ecosystem. Just as nature wastes nothing, recycling nutrients in a closed loop, so proponents of the circular economy aim to make use of all waste as input for further value creation, doing away with the idea of unwanted byproducts.\nIn recent years, there has been a surge of companies using coffee waste ‚Äî both used grounds and discarded coffee cherry pulp ‚Äî to create new products, including paper, our, 3D printer lament, charcoal, textiles and numerous others. One of the most widely touted examples is Bio-bean, a London firm that has attracted considerable media and investor attention for its plan to collect waste coffee grounds from the city‚Äôs cafes and convert them into biofuels. The concept is based on research from the University of Nevada, which analyzed used grounds for oil content and found they contained on average about 10 to 15 percent oil by weight.\nBio-bean is the first company in the world to industrialize this process, and recently opened a 20,000-square-foot factory in north London capable of processing 50,000 metric tons (about 55,000 tons) of used coffee grounds per year ‚Äî about one-tenth the waste grounds from all the coffee consumed in the U.K. The factory is designed to turn waste coffee into biodiesel, barbecue coals and biomass pellets. The company is even exploring the possibility of selling these pellets back to coffee shops to be used to roast coffee or boil water, which would create a true circular economy, with waste becoming the input power for the production activities that created it.\nBiofuel produced from used coffee grounds is referred to as ‚Äúsecond generation,‚Äù meaning it isn‚Äôt made from crops that could otherwise be used as food. In a world of food scarcity, where the production of fuel from corn and sugar cane has led to skyrocketing food prices for the world‚Äôs poorest, second generation biofuels are particularly promising.\nThe Challenges of Waste Collection\nBio-bean recently partnered with Network Rail, which owns and manages the U.K.‚Äôs railway network, to collect the coffee waste generated by its six biggest stations. These sorts of partnerships will be crucial as companies strive to create products from used coffee grounds, because unlike other agricultural commodities, where processing and waste production takes place in a central location, coffee grounds are used and disposed of in thousands of locations dispersed across a wide area.\nGenziuk says this has been one of the largest barriers to his own enterprise, and he‚Äôs not sure the economics can be resolved. For him, that‚Äôs not necessarily a deal-breaker.\n‚ÄúMaybe the idea isn‚Äôt to get rich out of it,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just to do the right thing by society.‚Äù\nOf course, the circular economy isn‚Äôt being promoted by organizations such as the World Economic Forum strictly because of its potential to do right by society; it is also a massive economic opportunity. A 2014 report by the global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company suggested the adoption of circular economic principles could lead to savings in materials costs exceeding $1 trillion a year by 2025.\nFor its part, bio-bean is doing its best to prove Genziuk wrong. In addition to partnering with Network Rail, the company has partnered with recycling company First Mile to run a coffee ground collection service, sending a van to pick up grounds from cafes in central London. The cafes give bio-bean the grounds free of charge, as they would otherwise have to pay disposal fees (which are based on weight) to have the grounds carted to land fills. To date, around 100 London cafes have signed up to have their coffee waste collected, saving them money and providing bio-bean with free input material for its production process.\nWhether or not this sort of collection method is scalable remains to be seen. London is one of the most densely populated cities in the developed world, making this method of collection relatively economical. With coffee being produced in thousands of different pots and machines throughout a city, the dream of putting all coffee waste to good use still faces enormous obstacles.\nChanging public policy could help. Genziuk notes that cafes in Melbourne pay for waste collection by the bin rather than by weight.\n‚ÄúIf they throw out 100 kilos, they pay the same as if they throw out 5 kilos,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn the U.K. it‚Äôs different. They pay by weight, and that influences behavior. Our system is geared up for volume of waste, and there‚Äôs no disincentive for generating waste, so they tend to have wasteful practices.‚Äù\nDajian agrees that governments can play a role in changing economic behavior and encouraging the adoption of circular economic practices.\n‚ÄúIf raw materials are cheaper than secondary materials, I think it‚Äôs not possible to make the linear economy into a closed loop,‚Äù he says. He advocates a tax on raw materials and subsidies for pilot projects and businesses that are putting circular economic models into practice and looking to scale.\nCoffee Grounds and Greenhouse Gasses\nBio-bean‚Äôs innovation has been to extract the value from the leftover oil and combustible material in used coffee grounds. Meanwhile, researchers in South Korea have found value in the absorbency that allows grounds to retain oil in the first place. In a recent paper in the scientific journal Nanotechnology, Christian Kemp and his fellow researchers at South Korea‚Äôs Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology show that heating, or activating, used coffee grounds using potassium hydroxide (i.e., lye) creates a new material with high surface area and the ability to store large amounts of methane.\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas, 84 times more potent as a warming agent than carbon dioxide. When returned to room temperature, the material created from the used grounds is stable and retains methane, meaning it could be used for long-term storage of greenhouse gases produced in industrial processes.\nKemp is a South African physical chemist with a focus in material science. His primary interest is in environmentally friendly materials with catalytic or gas absorption properties. Scientists around the world in this field are using sophisticated production methods to create high-tech materials that can absorb and store the gases responsible for heating our atmosphere ‚Äî including carbon dioxide and methane. These novel compounds have demonstrated breakthroughs in storing gas, but the starting materials are enormously expensive, which could limit their widespread adoption.\nKemp was working on one such project when he was forced to rethink his approach. Unsure of how to move forward, he did what many of us do: He sat down for a cup of coffee with his colleagues. The coffee worked its magic, and the scientists landed on the idea to try using the coffee grounds as their input material.\nThey combined the grounds (Kirkland brand, 100 percent Colombian coffee, dark roast, fine ground) with lye, then activated the mixture at 800 degrees C (1,472 degrees F) for an hour in a furnace. Turns out, that‚Äôs all it takes to make coffee capable of capturing the gas. The process is simple, Kemp says, and the cost for input material is next to nothing.\nResearchers have used other organic materials, including corn cobs and cocoa husks, to do something similar, but, Kemp says, ‚Äúcoffee is just so good at absorbing the moisture and absorbing the lye that the process was easier to do compared with other materials.‚Äù\nKemp also sees the material as a potential medium for storing methane in natural-gas-powered vehicles, which produce far fewer greenhouse gases than traditional vehicles. In cars currently running on natural gas, the gas is contained in a large metal tank in the trunk, a dangerous and heavy storage system. This limits the appeal, at least in the United States, for buses and heavy trucks.\nThe activated coffee material has the potential to remove these limitations. Because it stores methane at such low pressure, it doesn‚Äôt need to be shaped into a conventional round metal tube to prevent the gas from exploding. It can be molded into any shape desired, even eliminating the need for a gas tank.\n‚ÄúWe can build the gas storage into the contours of the car,‚Äù says Kemp. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs malleable, it doesn‚Äôt need to fit to strict dimensions.‚Äù\nThe findings already have attracted attention from companies interested in the potential application in lithium ion batteries, the technology that powers laptops and smartphones. Just as the nano-scale pores in the activated coffee grounds capture methane atoms, the material also can be used to capture lithium ions.\nFor Kemp, it‚Äôs all in keeping with his ‚Äúone Earth‚Äù philosophy.\n‚ÄúWe only have one Earth,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúso we should at least try our best to recycle what we have, and use it in an appropriate manner and not just waste as much as possible.‚Äù\nWhen it comes to coffee, Dajian notes that only a small fraction of the material used and produced by the industry ends up in the cup; the remainder, from the skin of the coffee cherry at origin to the grounds left after brewing, ends up as waste. Reducing this massive output of waste, and ultimately achieving a true circular economy, will take decades of work and the efforts of many ‚Äî from entrepreneurs and scientists to coffee roasters and coffee lovers ‚Äî but the tide does seem to be turning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7ea21c07-5f07-463a-9504-ecba9089bc4f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How often should sunscreen be reapplied for proper protection?","answer":"According to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Dermatology, sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours, or after swimming and toweling off, to maintain sufficient coverage. While marketing claims might suggest one morning application is enough for all-day protection, this is not correct for maintaining proper sun protection.","context":["Memorial Day, the unofficial start of summer for most of the United States, is just around the corner. It‚Äôs time to start planning how to fill the longer days and warmer nights. No matter what you choose to do, here are some ideas for making sure your summer is as fun and safe as it can be.\n1. Stay Hydrated\nDehydration can be fatal, but before that happens, it can make for a really unpleasant afternoon. As your body tries to cope, you may start to feel sluggish or tired, get a headache, or feel lightheaded to go along with feeling thirsty and getting dry mouth. Dehydration and sunburn go hand-in-hand, one making the other worse, which makes it all the more important to nip the problem in the bud.\nSports drinks and pediatric rehydration options are designed to rebalance a system when a large amount of fluid has been lost, not to prevent dehydration in the first place. These things are better than going thirsty, but if you‚Äôre serious about feeling your best, there is only one thing for it: Water!\n2. Wear Sunscreen and Reapply It During the Day\nSunscreen marketing would have you believe that their products are so sweat-proof and waterproof that putting it on once in the morning is all you need for all-day protection. However, both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Dermatology recommend reapplying sunscreen every two hours, or after swimming and toweling off, to maintain a sufficient level of coverage.\nAerosol sunscreens have gotten more popular in recent years, and they‚Äôre certainly convenient, but they can leave gaps in coverage while leaving a residue on surrounding surfaces with their excess spray. Traditional sunscreen works just as well, leaves fewer gaps when properly applied, and limits the amount of pollution in your surrounding spaces.\n3. Never Lose Track of Your Family\nIf you‚Äôre bringing the whole family to a fair, water park, or amusement park, it‚Äôs often tricky to keep everyone together; add a friend or two and the difficulty can ramp up quickly, leaving you in the unenviable position of shepherd instead of having fun with the rest of your family. The good news is that there are an increasing number of monitoring devices available, which can help you keep track of everyone in your party even if you temporarily lose sight of them.\nFor kids, HereO looks like a normal watch, but connects to an app on iOS and Android phones to let you know where the wearers are. Tinitell even adds the option of calling your child to check up on them without the risk of them pulling out their phone on a roller coaster and losing it.\n4. Be extra safe around the water\nAt Life Floor, we spend every day thinking about how to make people safer when they‚Äôre in wet areas; we‚Äôre deeply proud that our slip-resistant, impact-absorbing tiles have virtually eliminated slip-and-fall injuries at some water parks. But water safety begins long before kids are close enough to the water to slip in.\nOrganizations like the World‚Äôs Largest Swimming Lesson are great resources for finding out which facilities in your area are committed to water safety and giving kids a skill they‚Äôll use for the rest of their lives.\n5. Wear a Helmet\nLong summer bike rides are a great way to get active and explore different parts of your area. Whether you‚Äôre mountain biking trails to get away from it all or just tooling around the neighborhood, there‚Äôs no age at which you should stop wearing a helmet.\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the time as the sun is going down (from 6-9pm) is the most dangerous time to be out on a bike. By observing traffic laws and having the proper safety gear, you can mitigate a lot of that risk and simply enjoy your time spent outside."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c9609141-7d0b-49eb-b4cb-b69b206df494>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the key technical aspects of the Pure Pursuit controller, and how has it been implemented in student racing applications?","answer":"The Pure Pursuit controller is a path tracking algorithm that computes angular velocity commands to guide a robot along a path. It works by having the robot chase a look-ahead point, with the LookAheadDistance property being crucial for tuning performance. A small look-ahead distance enables quick path recovery but may cause oscillations, while a larger distance reduces oscillations but can result in larger curvatures at corners. The controller has been implemented in student racing applications, particularly in Formula Student Driverless competitions, where vehicles need to simultaneously plan and track paths in the first lap and then track optimized paths at higher speeds in subsequent laps, requiring high tracking accuracy.","context":["Pure Pursuit Controller\nPure pursuit is a path tracking algorithm. It computes the angular velocity command that moves\nthe robot from its current position to reach some look-ahead point in front of the robot.\nThe linear velocity is assumed constant, hence you can change the linear velocity of the\nrobot at any point. The algorithm then moves the look-ahead point on the path based on the\ncurrent position of the robot until the last point of the path. You can think of this as the\nrobot constantly chasing a point in front of it. The property\nLookAheadDistance decides how far the look-ahead point is\nis not a traditional controller, but acts as a tracking algorithm for path following\npurposes. Your controller is unique to a specified a list of waypoints. The desired linear\nand maximum angular velocities can be specified. These properties are determined based on\nthe vehicle specifications. Given the pose (position and orientation) of the vehicle as an\ninput, the object can be used to calculate the linear and angular velocities commands for\nthe robot. How the robot uses these commands is dependent on the system you are using, so\nconsider how robots can execute a motion given these commands. The final important property\nLookAheadDistance, which tells the robot how far along on the path\nto track towards. This property is explained in more detail in a section below.\nReference Coordinate System\nIt is important to understand the reference coordinate frame used by the pure pursuit\nalgorithm for its inputs and outputs. The figure below shows the reference coordinate\nsystem. The input waypoints are\n[x y] coordinates, which are used to\ncompute the robot velocity commands. The pose of the robot is composed of an\nxy-position and angle in the form\n[x y theta].\nThe positive x and y directions are in the right\nand up directions respectively (blue in figure). The theta value is\nthe angular orientation of the robot measured counterclockwise in radians from the\nx-axis (robot currently at\nLook Ahead Distance\nLookAheadDistance property is the main tuning property for the\ncontroller. The look ahead distance is how far along the path the robot should look from\nthe current location to compute the angular velocity commands. The figure below shows\nthe robot and the look-ahead point. As displayed in this image, note that the actual\npath does not match the direct line between waypoints.\nThe effect of changing this parameter can change how your robot\ntracks the path and there are two major goals: regaining the path\nand maintaining the path. In order to quickly regain the path between\nwaypoints, a small\nLookAheadDistance will cause\nyour robot to move quickly towards the path. However, as can be seen\nin the figure below, the robot overshoots the path and oscillates\nalong the desired path. In order to reduce the oscillations along\nthe path, a larger look ahead distance can be chosen, however, it\nmight result in larger curvatures near the corners.\nLookAheadDistance property should be\ntuned for your application and robot system. Different linear and\nangular velocities will affect this response as well and should be\nconsidered for the path following controller.\nThere are a few limitations to note about this pure pursuit algorithm:\nAs shown above, the controller cannot exactly follow direct paths between waypoints. Parameters must be tuned to optimize the performance and to converge to the path over time.\nThis pure pursuit algorithm does not stabilize the robot at a point. In your application, a distance threshold for a goal location should be applied to stop the robot near the desired goal.\n Coulter, R. Implementation of the Pure Pursuit Path Tracking Algorithm.

Winning student teams share their knowledge and the MathWorks student programs team shares best practices and workflows using MATLAB and Simulink.\nHi, everyone! In this blog, we will see how trajectory tracking controllers can be implemented in MATLAB and Simulink to make the vehicle follow a pre-defined path. Before we get started, a big thank you to my amazing colleagues, David Barnes, Munish Raj, and Roshan Hingnekar for their efforts to build the content of this blog.\nAs a part of the Student Programs team at MathWorks, we regularly interact with students. During a few of these interactions, students suggested that similar to other Racing Lounge videos, we should build some content on how to simulate bicycle models for path tracking applications. They also mentioned that it can be further utilized for lap time simulation models in Simulink. So inspired by the students and two of our powerful toolboxes, Vehicle dynamics blockset, and Automated Driving Toolbox, we decided to come up with a series of videos to demonstrate the workflow that can be easily implemented.\nThat was the motivation that students gave us. Now, let‚Äôs check out the technical motivation!\nTrajectory tracking is one of the essential parts of autonomous driving where the goal of the vehicle is to control the lateral and longitudinal motion to follow a pre-defined path. For example, in the Formula Student Driverless competitions, the vehicle needs to simultaneously plan and track the path in the first lap. Further, in the subsequent laps, the vehicle tracks the optimized path at a much higher speed. Hence, the tracking accuracy of the controllers needs to be high to avoid major deviation from the path.\nCurrently, there are multiple control strategies to address the trajectory tracking problem. However, in this blog, we will focus on the following three trajectory tracking controllers:\nPure pursuit controller\nModel predictive controller (MPC)\nTo summarize the upcoming sections, we will first generate a reference trajectory. Then, we will build a vehicle model. Finally, we will show how easily we can implement the above three control strategies to control the longitudinal and lateral motion of the vehicle.\nYou can skip this step if you already have recorded vehicle pose data. However, If you want to generate a reference trajectory, you can use the Driving Scenario Designer app. The app enables you to design synthetic driving scenarios for testing your autonomous driving systems. In this case, we have utilized a section of the US Highway scene present in the prebuilt scenarios. Then, we have specified a vehicle and its trajectory and have exported the trajectory data to a MAT-file.\nThe accuracy of the trajectory tracking problem depends upon the vehicle dynamics model. Based on the fidelity of the vehicle dynamics model, you can decide which controller is best suited for different driving conditions. Vehicle dynamics blockset provides a range of vehicle body blocks to implement vehicle models to calculate vehicle motion. In the model, we have used the vehicle body 3DOF dual track block where the tire forces are obtained from the combined slip wheel 2DOF block. Further, vectorized tire subsystem accepts the inputs from a simplified powertrain subsystem.\nNow, in the subsequent sections, we have used the same vehicle dynamics model for all the controller models and these controllers will aim to generate the required steering angle, acceleration, and deceleration commands.\nTo start with a basic longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics model, please check out this video tutorial:\nPure Pursuit Controller\nAs the first choice for implementing control strategies, we went ahead with the pure pursuit controller. In simple terms, it‚Äôs a path tracking algorithm that calculates the trajectory curvature to move the vehicle from one point to another. As per the formulation, you can compute the vehicle wheel steering angle to follow the reference trajectory.\nAs can be seen in the steering angle formulation, one of the variables is the lookahead distance. In general, it is how far along the path the vehicle should look from the current location to compute the angular velocity commands. It is one of the important tuning factors in ensuring the controller‚Äôs tracking accuracy. A small lookahead distance can lead to an oscillatory path and accurate tracking whereas large lookahead distance results in a less oscillatory path, however, it might result in poor tracking.\nNow that we have provided a brief introduction to the pure pursuit controller, the image below shows its implementation in Simulink.\nFor the implementation, we have used the Pure Pursuit block that calculates the target direction angle based on two input ports, the pose, and the reference trajectory. In the block, you can tune the controller by setting the lookahead distance. Further, based on the above formula, the required wheel steering angle is obtained allowing the vehicle to follow the trajectory as shown in the figure below.\nReference video tutorial:\nMoving to our next controller, the Stanley controller was implemented in the DARPA Grand Challenge by the Stanford Racing Team. It is a nonlinear control law to minimize the cross-track error and the heading angle of the front wheel relative to the reference path. It computes the steering angle command that adjusts a vehicle‚Äôs current pose to match a reference pose.\nTo model the controller in Simulink, we have used the Lateral Controller Stanley block. The block computes the steering angle based on the above formula. What is interesting is that you can select the type of vehicle model using the controller settings. For example, for low-speed tracking such as parking lots you can use the kinematic bicycle model, and for high-speed tracking such as race cars it is preferable to use the dynamic bicycle model. Further, you can adjust the position, yaw rate, and steering gains to improve the accuracy of the controller.\nLike the pure pursuit controller model, we have built the vehicle path tracking model using the Stanley controller. The vehicle model and the reference trajectory are kept the same. On simulating the model it is evident that in a higher-speed environment the vehicle is successfully tracking the desired trajectory achieving a maximum velocity of 30 m/s.\nReference video tutorial:\nModel Predictive Controller (MPC)\nFinally, let us check out the implementation of MPC for path tracking applications in Simulink. In short, MPC solves an online optimization algorithm to find the optimal control action that drives the predicted output to the reference. It can handle multi-input multi-output systems that may have interactions between their inputs and outputs. It can also handle input and output constraints. However, the downside is that it is computationally expensive.\nPlease note we won‚Äôt go much in detail in this section as we already have an amazing MATLAB Tech Talk video series titled, Understanding Model Predictive Control. You can watch the videos to learn how MPC works and will also discover the benefits of this multivariable control technique.\nTo implement the MPC controller, initially, we started with the generic MPC Controller block. However, the Path Following Control System block is a better alternative for following a trajectory. In general, the block is meant to keep the ego vehicle traveling along the center of a straight or curved road while tracking a set velocity and maintaining a safe distance from a lead vehicle. However, we have implemented it to follow a trajectory by setting the set velocity to the reference velocity of the vehicle and by distance based curvature to the curvature port. Further, as the output of the block is longitudinal acceleration, we connected a pedal map to obtain the required acceleration and deceleration commands.\nFinally, after selecting the appropriate design parameters such as prediction horizon, control horizon, etc., we simulated the model and can see the vehicle tracking the path perfectly.\nReference video tutorial:\nTime to build your own model\nThe blog does not cover all the technical details of the above controllers but rather provides an overview of implementing these controllers in MATLAB and Simulink. We hope we provided enough background and resources to get you started with the trajectory tracking models. So now it is your turn to use these resources as a reference to drive a car on a more challenging track."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:52ec0376-f1fb-4268-bcb3-2f155da74f03>","<urn:uuid:924315af-406f-482b-b913-925307090d39>"],"error":null}

However, the perfect cut, the perfect seasoning and the perfect temperature can be hard to replicate at home. So how exactly do the chefs turn out steaks that are so tender and delicious? The Daily Meal has gathered these expert tricks that make those steaks so good, with a few tips you can use right in your own kitchen.\nTop steakhouses don‚Äôt just grab any steak they see at the store ‚Äî they work with butchers and, in some cases, head out to the packing house to inspect the meat themselves before selecting it for the restaurant. They‚Äôll look for things like marbling, color and fat distribution. Check with your local shop to see if they offer butchering as one of their special grocery store amenities.\nYelp/ Kathy H.\nMany steakhouses use USDA prime steaks ‚Äî but what does that mean? To achieve that ranking, the steak needs to have the highest level of marbling, or intramuscular fat, and be from young cows. You might not be able to find USDA prime beef at your local supermarket, but some high-end stores and butcher shops would be a good place to check.\nChef Michael Senich of LongHorn Steakhouse says that while frozen steaks may be cheaper and last longer, you sacrifice the quality of the beef. Freezing a steak can lead to ice crystals or freezer burn, and improper thawing can make it hard to cook a steak to the desired temperature. For best results, he says to always go with fresh steak. Frozen produce, on the other hand, can be just as good as fresh.\nAt LongHorn Steakhouse, Senich says all grillmasters start with a clean grill so a quality cut of steak won‚Äôt stick to it. To clean your grill at home, first, scrape the grill grates with a brush. Then, dip a hand towel in canola oil with a pair of tongs and run it along the grates as the grill is warming up. For more on this specific method of cooking, here are tips on how to grill the perfect steak every time.\nFernando Garcia, director of culinary operations for Black Angus Steakhouse, says to pull steaks from the fridge and let them rest at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes prior to cooking. Letting meat come to room temperature before cooking is just one of the best tips and tricks for cooking steak, chicken and other meats correctly.\nSome steakhouses serve ‚Äúwet-aged‚Äù beef, which is essentially steak that‚Äôs been stored in an airtight, vacuum-sealed plastic bag for a few days or even up to six weeks. While wet-aged beef is more tender than beef that hasn‚Äôt been aged at all, it‚Äôs a lot less robustly flavored than its more upscale counterpart, dry-aged beef.\nMany great steakhouses dry-age their beef for anywhere from two to three weeks, and sometimes much longer. In order to dry-age beef, whole primal cuts (large pieces of meat carved out at butchering) are stored in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room and carefully monitored. When ready to serve, the layer of mold that has formed on the meat's surface is removed before it‚Äôs cut into steaks, and the end result has a more robust, earthy flavor that steakhouse fans know and love.\nSteaks at high-end steakhouses are usually well over an inch thick, sometimes approaching 2 inches. Not only is a super-thick steak a lot more impressive-looking on the plate than a half-inch one, but the thickness also gives the broiler a lot more time to go to work on caramelizing the outer crust. If it were a thin steak in that broiler, the center could be overcooked before a nice crust had time to develop.\nBlack Angus‚Äô Garcia suggests adding your favorite spices to a mix of salt and pepper to season before cooking. Garlic and onion powders are great savory flavors in the rub, he says. And while you‚Äôre in your spice drawer, channel your inner Marie Kondo and clean out any expired or duplicate spices.\nFor maximum flavor, Shula‚Äôs corporate chef and culinary director Demetrio Zavala first seasons steak with salt and pepper. He then waits for a pan to preheat over medium heat and, once it smokes lightly, he adds a teaspoon of canola oil and places the steak inside. He allows the steak to cook for two minutes on each side to reach medium-rare. Then, he adds butter, fresh thyme and whole garlic cloves to the pan. Spoon the butter from the pan over the steak. This is called basting, which adds moisture and flavor to the surface of the meat, Zavala says. If peeling garlic is a pain for you, here are easy hacks from restaurant chefs.\nYelp/ Go B.\nYou know that sizzling effect that Ruth‚Äôs Chris is famous for? That‚Äôs the result of adding a big dollop of butter to the pan right before the steak is served. Steakhouses use all sorts of techniques to make sure their steaks are juicy and flavorful, but many steakhouses aren‚Äôt afraid to use a whole lot of butter.\nYelp/ Little Alley Steak\nThat deep, dark, caramelized crust on steaks from great steakhouses? You can thank an infrared broiler for that. While some steakhouses still grill or griddle their steaks, many including Bobby Van‚Äôs, The Palm Restaurants and Morton‚Äôs use infrared broilers, which superheat large surfaces to an even temperature. Some steakhouses depend on these broilers to cook their steaks, and while they can be difficult to master, the end result is a steak with a nice crust.\nIf you were to attempt to cook a steak at home with the same amount of heat that steakhouses use, you‚Äôd end up with a very smoky kitchen and maybe even a fire on your hands. Those infrared broilers can reach temperatures of over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and can cook a 2-inch-thick steak in a matter of minutes. Even the ovens that the steaks are finished in often reach temperatures of more than 500 degrees. ‚ÄúWe use commercial-grade broilers that cook proteins at very high temperatures,‚Äù David Holben, executive chef of Del Frisco‚Äôs Double Eagle Steakhouse, told The Daily Meal. ‚ÄúThe home kitchen equipment used only performs to a certain level, which has a ceiling on its output of BTUs, or heating capacity.‚Äù\nAccording to LongHorn Steakhouse's Senich, to cook the meat evenly on both sides of a steak, grillmasters flip it every three to four minutes.\nHumans aren‚Äôt the only ones who need rest. Senich says the biggest mistake that at-home grillers make is cutting into the steak too early, which allows the moisture to drip out. Before taking the finished product out to the dining room, LongHorn Steakhouse lets every steak sit for one to two minutes to make sure it stays juicy when the diner cuts into it.\nAccording to Bridget Wasser, executive director of meat science, culinary and supply chain at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, tender steaks like strip, rib-eye and T-bone can be cooked with dry-heat methods including grilling and broiling. The best way to cook less tender steaks like flank, skirt, round and chuck is by using moist-heat cooking methods like braising or slow-cooking to elevate tenderness. Or, they can be cooked with dry-heat methods, like grilling, if tenderizing marinades are applied prior to cooking.\nFor less tender steaks like flank, skirt or round, Wasser suggests a tenderizing marinade that contains acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, flavored vinegar or even Dr. Pepper as well as natural enzymes like ginger or pineapple. Allow a fourth- to a half-cup of marinade for every pound of beef and marinate for six to 12 hours in the refrigerator ‚Äî never at room temperature. Dry rubs and marinades work best when cooking beef on a grill, Wasser says. Avoid pastes or marinades with high sugar content to minimize burning.\nWasser says to consider buying larger roasts from your grocery store or butcher and trimming them into steaks to save more money and get the exact thickness you want. Ribeye, strip loin and tenderloin are easiest to cut into steaks at home, she says. Pull the roast directly from the fridge to cut into steaks, as beef is easier to slice when it‚Äôs cold. And make sure to cut steaks to uniform thickness so they cook evenly.\nBefore cooking, pat steaks dry with paper towels for better browning, Wasser suggests. This elevates the natural, great flavor of beef.\nWhen flipping steaks, use tongs instead of forks, Wasser says. Using a fork will pierce the beef and result in a loss of flavorful juices.\nTemperature is the best indicator of doneness, Wasser says. Insert an instant-read thermometer horizontally from the side so it penetrates the thickest part of the steak, not touching bone or fat. Resist cutting into steaks to check for doneness while cooking. You‚Äôll lose juices and risk drying out the beef. Keep in mind that the temperature of the steak will continue to rise for a few minutes after cooking.\nTo check the doneness of your steak without a meat thermometer, Vanderlei Melchior, ga√∫cho chef and area manager at Fogo De Ch√£o, says to open the palm of one hand and touch the fleshy area between your thumb and base of your palm on the other. That‚Äôs what raw meat feels like. For well done, press your thumb to your pinky and touch the same area with the opposite index finger. Repeat with your thumb and middle finger for medium-rare and your thumb and index finger for rare to know the feel you‚Äôre looking for in your steak.\nIf you‚Äôre slicing a steak before serving it, cut across the grain for optimal tenderness. Slicing across the grain means slicing perpendicular to the direction of the fibers, which makes the meat more tender and easier to chew, Wasser says. Also, when slicing less tender cuts across the grain, slice thinly to further elevate tenderness.\nWell-marbled steaks contain a lot of fat, and with the addition of butter and other cooking oils, the calorie count of a steakhouse dinner could be high. For example, a 12-ounce slow-roasted prime rib from Outback Steakhouse has 1,050 calories and has 86 grams of fat, and that‚Äôs without any sides. Even if you order something like couscous, some better-for-you restaurant sides aren‚Äôt as healthy as you think.\nYou can elevate your steaks at home with the proper wine pairings. According to Kendall-Jackson vineyard and winery, filet mignon goes best with pinot noir, New York strip goes best with cabernet sauvignon, rib-eye goes best with zinfandel, porterhouse goes best with syrah, and skirt and flank go best with merlot and sauvignon blanc, depending on the final preparation and accompaniments.\nYelp/ Dean C.\nA perfect steak can be delicious on its own, but the pros know that a steakhouse meal is incomplete without a side or two. Creamed spinach, a big baked potato, onion rings, creamed corn and macaroni and cheese are up there with the most iconic sides. Sides should definitely accompany your meal if you‚Äôre looking to have a perfect steakhouse experience at home. If you own a grill, there are so many things you can make beyond steak with these easy grilling recipes for steak, chicken, pizza and more.\nMore from The Daily Meal:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b5a56890-2875-4e0a-8ef7-c214cccec5b0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key properties good origami paper should have, and why is Tant considered one of the favorite papers for animal folds?","answer":"Good origami paper should be non-glossy to reduce eye fatigue and make dents less noticeable. It should ideally have different colors on both sides, be of appropriate thickness for the sheet size and model complexity, and have a long-fiber structure with high sizing and calendering for elasticity and durability. The paper should easily bend, fold, remember creases, and rotate 180¬∞. As for Tant paper, it is considered one of the favorite papers for animal folds due to its highly suitable texture. It allows for easy shaping using a thin wooden role or paintbrush tip without requiring special treatment, though care must be taken as it might rip at the edges.","context":["by Ilan Garibi and Gadi Vishne and Eyal Reuveni\nIt took some time, but we knew - we must do something special for our 10th paper review!\nOur reviews are all about getting to know different paper types and with hands-on experience reviewing their strengths and best areas for use. But we - Ilan and Gadi - are only two folders, so our reviews summarize only our point of view. And we know there are better folders than us out there. So we decided to approach a great folder, one of the best, and ask for his opinion on each of the papers we reviewed so far.\nWe wanted to set only minimal restrictions, namely that the papers were to be reviewed by folding the same model from the different paper types. The folder was free to choose which model he'd review the papers with. He could also pick a suitable paper size for each paper type, and paint and treat it as he thought fit. Then he was to conclude what he thought of each paper.\nHaving this idea, we started our search for a master folder, one with enough patience to fold the same model ten times. Luckily, we did not have to look far. We found the right candidate in our home country, in Israel.\nLet us introduce Eyal Reuveni, an Israeli folder. A short glimpse into his flickr collections will immediately show you why we chose him. He is one of the best technical folders in the world. He has folded numerous complex models, often several copies - be it from diagrams or CP. Great creators share their diagrams with him before publication to hear his opinion and to fix problems he finds.\nEyal started to fold at the tender age of ten, discovering origami with Robert Harbin's books. For many years he folded animals and insects from Montroll and Lang books. Later on, being exposed to many new creators through the internet, he fell deeper and deeper into the world of paper and complex origami. Looking for challenges, he started to decipher crease patterns in order to fold the most complicated models.\n\"I am attracted to the highly realistic models, with all the tiny details\", he says. Today he lives in Shoham, Israel, in a house packed with thousands of models. Although he did create a few models, he prefers to focus on folding other people's models, the more complex - the better. His most admired creators are Satoshi Kamiya and Hideo Komatsu from Japan.\nHe also teaches origami, techniques and paper treatments.\nEyal got highly devoted to the task of reviewing the papers we had already rated, and finished all lions in less than a week.\n100gsm, 45√ó45cm, original color of golden brown\nDespite the thickness of this paper, it is the best paper for the lion, as well as most of Komatsu's models in general. Some steps were quite difficult to fold, but for that reason I chose this size of paper. The texture of this particular paper is wonderful, and the paper enabled me to shape it perfectly, without using wet folding, MC or any other treatment.\n78gsm, 35√ó35cm, original brown color\nThis is one of my favourite papers and it is very good for animal folds, as the texture is highly suitable for that. Because of that, folding the lion with Tant was much more fun than most papers. Still, it is necessary to be very careful, since it might rip in the edges. I had to unfold the model partially before completing the base of the lion, in order to make some tricky sinks, and layers‚Äô wrapping, steps that later on form the back legs and the mane. Shaping the finished model was easily done using a thin wooden role or the tip of a painter's paintbrush, and, like with Elephant Hide, without any special treatment to the paper.\n50gsm, 35√ó35cm, silver foil and white side colored\nI do not like folding with this paper. It is best to use it when glued to another paper (tissue, mostly). It was very challenging to fold the lion with Japanese Foil, since it wears down easily, and it is very difficult to reverse the creases. I painted the white side using acrylic water-based paint by ‚ÄúFolk Art‚Äù to change the white to copper color. It is necessary to fold very carefully and perfectly if you want to avoid the metallic foil side to be seen in the final model. The advantage is how easy it can be shaped, and how it holds this shape. The finished lion is very delicate and light.\n80gsm, 42√ó42cm, original color of white\nI hardly ever fold from copy paper, besides test folding crease patterns. Luckily, this particular paper has a better quality than the usual copy paper. It was a bit challenging to make sinks and un-sinks without tearing the paper, but I managed to do it. Like Tant, it was necessary to unfold the paper partially to go through the rough stages of forming the inside layers of the back legs and creating the mane. Last touches of finishing were easy to make using my fingers to shape the mane. (IG: this is indeed a premium copy paper from Hadera Paper Mill).\n40gsm, 35√ó35cm, original color of blue, colored\nThis is my first time folding from this expensive, high quality paper. I think it is best for folding insects and super complex models, and not for animals such as this lion. In order to make the paper easier to work with, and to enhance the texture, I applied water-based acrylic varnish. The paper is very strong and doesn‚Äôt rip easily. Still, it is not easy to fold a 3D animal from it. I had to partially unfold some steps in order to make close sinks doable. Shaping the lion was easy and the final model looks very nice (although a brown color would be more suitable). (IG: Origamido¬Æ was not meant to be used this way. Name your model and the manufacturer will prepare the right paper for you. Here we had to use what we had, a blue thin paper).\n120gsm, 42√ó42cm, original orange color\nI really like folding from this paper, in spite of its thickness (120 grams!!). Folding such a complex model was no easy task: The paper tends to tear when there are too many layers, so I unfolded parts of the model more than other papers in order to fold the back legs and the mane properly. I worked slowly, so I managed to fold it perfectly. Shaping was very easy since the paper tends to hold the shape very well, and the result is very nice. The finished lion looks and feel like a statue, and the shiny texture enhance the details.\n50gsm, 32√ó32cm, original yellow color\nThis paper has a wonderful texture, but it is not an easy task to fold and shape it. I used water-based varnish to enhance the texture and to strengthen the paper a bit, and it was still no easy task. Changing creases form mountains to valleys and vice versa is hard, and the paper tends to rip in the middle (between the ‚Äúbumps‚Äù). Despite all these problems, the final lion looks amazing, although a bit weak and delicate, and the texture gives it a more realistic look.\n50gsm, 30√ó30cm, colored with metallic brown\nUsually, I use this specific thin kraft paper mainly for complex insects, and not for animals. In order to get better color, and make the paper more comfortable for shaping and folding, I painted both sides with acrylic water-based paint, by ‚ÄúFolk Art‚Äù. Kraft paper is usually a great paper to fold from - it is very strong and doesn‚Äôt rip easily. Since this particular brand is so thin, I used a smaller square, which resulted with a well standing lion, without the legs spreading aside. I prefer a thicker Kraft paper for animals, but this one worked pretty good, too.\n35gsm, 30√ó30cm, gold colored both sides\nThis was, for me, the worst paper to work with, folding this complex lion. I usually use this paper only for color change models, when attaching it to other, usually handmade, papers. I had to paint both sides (gold this time), but the paper does not take paint well, so I had to repeat it several times. The paper is very weak, and feels like tissue paper. It is very difficult to make sinks or any tricky steps, and not easy to shape it nicely. The added layers of color made it a bit easier to shape. Still, the wrinkled texture of the paper might be good for a furry animal model.\n50gsm, 30√ó30cm, original copper color\nI really like folding with this paper. I used the copper - light brown paper, highly suitable for the lion. The metallic side left sparkling marks on my fingers while folding, but still this side enables me to hold the shape well. White marks appear on the light brown side while folding,, which reminds folding from greaseproof paper or baking sheet. The edges might rip if not folded very carefully. This paper is better for color change models than for one color models. It was very easy to shape the lion from this paper since it holds the shape very well.\nThere is no final verdict here. As I said before, there is no bad paper; it is just the wrong model. Choosing the right size, as well as the right treatment any paper can lead to awesome results! In contrast to our opinion, Onion Skin Paper scored low with Eyal. We all agreed on the great quality of Elephant Hide, as well as Tant and Nicolas Terry's Tissue Foil paper.\nBottom line: our deepest thanks to Eyal, a master folder!","The folds on the surface of the paper are like secret letters that were formed simultaneously with the world. However, understanding what literally lies on the surface is sometimes more difficult than unraveling the depths of space.\nMost likely, before the invention of paper, figures were also able to be folded, for example, from the bark or leaves of plants, and today foil and glued fabric can successfully replace it. But the art of origami could not arise outside the culture of space, without writing and mathematics, without the general development of intellectual life. This is where the value of paper is undeniable.\nWHEN THERE WAS NO PAPER\nTo appreciate the place that a modest paper sheet occupies in human culture, it is enough to imagine a fantastic scenario: a new virus destroys all paper stocks on Earth. Documents, paper money, maps and schedules, telephone books disappear overnight. Archives and libraries are burning‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt it a terrible prospect.\nFortunately, paper is somewhat more reliable than electronic media. Deficiency does not threaten her either. However, there was a time when there was no paper at all. It was replaced by bamboo and wooden planks, birch bark, wax and clay for cuneiform writing. One can imagine the contents of a diary the size of a woodpile or a whole cartload of crockery. Flattening and compression of storage media has always been valued. Therefore, the appearance of paper and the possession of the secret of its production at one time determined the history of peoples and cultures in the same way as the discovery of atomic energy and cybernetics in the 20th century.\nDEVELOPING OF PAPER\nModern archaeological finds indicate that the first ‚Äúprimitive paper‚Äù appeared almost two centuries before our era. The idea of making paper could have been suggested by thin felt produced in Central Asia. Woolen fibers are randomly intertwined in felt, and plant fibers are twisted in paper, forming a uniform surface. The raw materials for paper were dilapidated fabrics, old fishing nets, ropes and silkworm cocoon waste. They were soaked and rubbed to form a uniform slurry, which was cast on a flat and smooth stone, and pressed down with another stone from above.\nThe first mention of ‚Äúreal‚Äù paper was left by the Chinese court dignitary and inventor Cai Lun in 105 AD. He suggested crushing plant fibers together with rags in a stone mortar, and filtering the liquid fibrous mass diluted with water using a sieve. The main raw materials for paper production in China were hemp, bamboo and mulberry (paper) tree bast. Crushed, pounded and evenly distributed on a sieve, the suspension was thrown back onto smooth boards, which were then tied into piles and placed under oppression. Aligned and dried sheets were separated and finally dried.\nThe exact recipe for making paper was kept secret. Only in 610 AD. according to the ‚ÄúJapanese Chronicles‚Äù (Nihongi), the Buddhist monk Dan Ho taught this technology to Japanese masters. Soon, Japanese paper surpassed Chinese designs in quality. For the manufacture of paper in Japan, first hemp was used, then the bast of the paper tree ‚Äì ‚Äúkozo‚Äù (Broussonetia kazinoki), as well as wild shrubs ‚Äúgambi‚Äù (from the fragrant daphne family) and ‚Äúmitsumata‚Äù (Edgeworthia papyrifera). Having reached high strength, paper was first used exclusively in sacred rituals (boxes ‚Äúsanbo‚Äù and envelopes ‚Äúcarry‚Äù), and then for the manufacture of fans, screens, umbrellas, clothes, windows and doors. To this day, Japan has preserved the technology of hand-made paper ‚Äúwashi‚Äù (ÂíåÁ¥ô). Traditional grades of Japanese paper are distinguished by their special durability and a variety of shades of color, ornaments, embossing and inclusions.\nIn 751, captive Chinese paper makers betrayed their secret to the Arab Caliph. Samarkand became the new center of paper production. From here it moved to Asia Minor and North Africa, in 1150 it came to Spain, in which the Japanese primacy of the invention of origami is now being strongly contested. Later, the paper recipe came to Italy, to Central and Northern Europe. History has preserved the name of one of the first European paper makers, the Nuremberg merchant Ulman Stromer, who opened a paper mill in 1389. Independent production of paper and book printing contributed to the development of the culture of the European Renaissance.\nUnlike Chinese technology, rags were used in European production. After washing and fermentation, it was crushed in paper mills. A wooden frame with a bronze mesh was immersed in the liquid mass. The fibers stuck together in a thin layer and were freed from water. Thin paper layers were placed between pieces of cloth or felt plates, pressed on a screw press, dried, glued, dried again and smoothed. In 1670, the Dutch invented a grinding apparatus ‚Äì a roll, thanks to which the production of paper pulp was accelerated. In the 19th century, the composition of paper changed thanks to the French physicist Ren√© Antoine R√©aumur (1683-1757), who discovered in 1719 that wasps obtain a material similar to paper from plant fibers. In 1845 the Saxon weaver Friedrich Gottlob Keller (1816-1895) filed a patent for a wood abrasion device.\nNow 90% of the world‚Äôs pulp is produced by the sulphate process, using alkali, mostly from softwood. The fibers are freed from lignin, which gives the wood strength and a brownish tint. In addition to cellulose, paper contains wood pulp, waste paper, rags, glue, kaolin, chalk, talc, titanium dioxide, hydrophobic substances and other fillers that improve the printing properties of paper, make it smooth and durable.\nIn 1799 Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Robert (1761-1828) patented a steam-powered paper machine. Over two centuries of machine improvement, the roll width has increased from 0.64 to 9 meters, and the speed of paper web production has increased from 10 to 2000 meters per minute. Contrary to forecasts of a reduction in paper production due to the development of electronic storage media, its consumption in developed countries has doubled in the 10 years after the start of the computer boom. About 330 million tons of paper and cardboard are produced annually in the world, which is an average of 50 kg per inhabitant of the planet.\nAs a result of all these changes, not all modern paper, even if it says ‚Äúfor origami‚Äù, is really suitable for folding.\nOf all the variety of varieties, origami paper should differ not so much in the decorative and printing beauty of texture, color and ornament, but in its design and technical properties. The paper should not be glossy, as the gloss increases eye fatigue and makes occasional dents more noticeable, ruining the overall impression of the finished figure. It is desirable that the sheet has a different color on both sides, or at least it is painted on only one side, leaving the reverse side white. Otherwise, reading traditional charts, in which the polar sides of the sheet are indicated in different colors, will become more difficult with each new step. This is especially important for beginner origamists, as well as for preliminary sketch folding. The thickness of the paper should be appropriate for the size of the sheet and the complexity of the figure, and the surface of the sheet should easily bend, fold, remember the crease, and rotate 180¬∞. For example, for a sheet measuring 20√ó20 cm, the thickness of the paper is usually 60‚Äì80 g/m¬≤, for microscopic figures, a miniature and extremely thin sheet is needed, and for giant sculptures, strong cardboard and additional reinforcement with metal inserts are required. A more labor-intensive figure contains more folds, the sheet is compressed more densely, and therefore the paper must be thinner or wider than that of a simple figure.\nOrigami paper should have a long-fiber structure, high sizing and calendering (compacting), so that it becomes elastic and durable. Its reliability can be checked using a special test. For this, a narrow paper tape is cut, about two centimeters wide. Grasping the edges and slightly pulling the strip, you should twist it like turning the handle from a spinning reel and at the same time count the number of revolutions before breaking. Strong paper can withstand more than 50 rotations, while weak paper tears after 10 rotations or less. After tearing the sheet, fluffy edges indicate the presence of long fibers that reinforce the structure of the paper.\nIn addition to the strength of origami paper, it is required to maintain its shape, as if it were folded from foil. To check this quality, it is necessary, having carefully smoothed out the fold, check the angle of the folded edge. Good paper can be called if the folded edge remains almost in the same plane with the main sheet. In the opposite case, loose or rather ‚Äúplump‚Äù, insufficiently compacted paper will begin to spring, and the figure will fall apart into a shapeless lump. For especially complex models, handmade paper is sometimes made, ‚Äúsandwiches‚Äù are made from sheets of paper glued with foil. To avoid breaks in the places of multi-layered folds, the surface of the paper is slightly moistened.\nFor origami, some types of wrapping paper, bookbinding varieties of designer collections, and even money are used. Banknotes experience daily loads and can be considered the standard of strength. To do this, they include cotton and linen fibers. A lot of figures have been invented that are specially made up of paper money from different countries, and words, numbers, drawings and textures are usually used for additional decorative expressiveness.\nPaper is irreplaceable. It may seem that the variety of modern materials assigns it a secondary role. In fact, its uniqueness lies not so much in its cheapness and availability, but in a special design property ‚Äì a combination of high strength with simultaneous flexibility of a non-woven material pressed from the finest fibers, which, regardless of their origin, are elastic like a web. In addition to cellulose, synthetic fibers are also used for paper production, which, reproducing the texture and properties of their natural predecessor, gives paper considerable strength and moisture resistance. Since the 1960s, synthetic paper has been produced on conventional paper machines from polyethylene or polypropylene. In principle, paper can be made from mineral fibers, metal and glass wool, carbon nanotubes. Fire retardant paper is produced. Such paper complies with fire safety rules and is used to create openwork shades, in the design of advertising exhibition stands and modern interiors, complementing them with folded shapes.\nYou may notice that the folding methods must be different depending on the type of paper. But why? What is the folding mechanism? Unlike fabric, plastic, and metal, paper has little to no stretch and remains relatively flat and flat. In the place where the fold line lies, the fibers are even more compressed and compacted. ‚ÄúWrinkling‚Äù forms the difference in pressure on the outer and reverse side of the sheet. The adhesive is partially destroyed and the fibers are released. Along the fold line, the sheet becomes softer and, as it were, ‚Äúremembers‚Äù the fold, repeating the movement in the same place like a piano loop.\nAnother reason for the appearance of a fold is associated with the destruction of not the glue, but the fibers themselves. In a flat sheet, the fibers are located in different directions, and when broken, some of the fibers located across the fold line are torn, while the fibers directed along the fold are twisted like a spring, remaining intact.\nThere is a third, most common cause of the fold. A paper sheet, in addition to fibers, glue and various dense additives, contains air. In other words, the thickness of the sheet depends primarily on the fibers that reinforce the sheet, located not in a plane, but at an angle and across the paper plate. When a fold is pressed through, the layer of paper along it becomes thinner due to the fibers, which flatten.\nSome types of polymers have a similar property. In the place of the crease, the polymer sheet becomes thinner and, due to the elasticity of the material, reproduces the crease during the next bending. Creasing can be used to improve the accuracy of folding paper, cardboard, glued fabric, plastic or metal. To do this, at the site of the future fold, a sheet is compacted with a roller or a blunt knife, similar to a groove. Folding the creased sheet requires much less effort and care.\nMachine creasing is widely used in printing and cardboard production. Adjacent edges forming a stiffening rib, as in a metal corner, give the folded sheet additional stability, due to which the boxes withstand heavy loads and prevent damage to the packaged goods. The structural properties of paper are often replicated in stronger materials and compounds, and paper remains indispensable for modeling kinetic forms in architecture, design, and industrial technology.\nSumming up, it can be noted that the experience of folding paper into a wide variety of forms taught our scientists and designers, designers and other engineers a lot.\nAnd, of course, paper is still the best material for translating the human imagination into figures of the amazing art of origami folding."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a72d8292-0a95-49c3-bdb2-378c5bd7dcbc>","<urn:uuid:9e2a7bdb-8498-47aa-a22e-6135097ab4fc>"],"error":null}

Between the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico and La Nina in the Pacific, which one has a bigger impact on water circulation patterns?","answer":"The Loop Current and La Nina have different but significant impacts on water circulation.

Some of the major marginal seas include the Arabian Sea, Baltic Sea, Bay of Bengal, Bering Sea, Beaufort Sea, Black Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Ross Sea, Weddell Sea, and all four of the Siberian Seas (Barents, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian).\nMarginal seas are similar to open oceans with respect to being created by large-scale geological processes, exhibiting biodiversity , and possessing layered water circulation patterns. The degree of water circulation between marginal seas and open oceans varies with respect to location. The primary differences between marginal seas and open oceans are associated with depth and proximity to landmasses. Marginal seas, which are generally shallower than open oceans, are more influenced by human activities, river runoff, climate, and water circulation.\nHumans utilize nearshore environments, including coastal waters and marginal seas, for food and fuel resources, as well as for various purposes related to scientific, industrial, and recreational activities. The greatest human impact on marginal seas is related to the fisheries industry. Ninety percent of the world's fisheries exist within coastal waters that are located less than 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the shoreline. Other human activities that have adversely affected marginal seas include industrial enterprises such as sewage disposal, dredge disposal, offshore oil drilling, and accidental releases of pollutants, including petroleum products, radioactive waste, detergents, and plastics.\nCoastal waters and marginal seas are more susceptible to pollution than open ocean regions because of the high concentration of human activities near coastlines and rivers. Pollutants from the nearby landmasses are introduced into marginal seas in concentrations that are thousands of times greater than in open oceans. Pollutants enter marginal seas by way of water discharge and airborne deposition.\nBiological growth of marine organisms in marginal seas can be either stimulated or inhibited depending on the nature and concentration of the particular\nBiomass is comprised of plants, herbivores (plant-eaters), carnivores (animaleaters), and omnivores. Marine biomass production originates with primary productivity, which in turn is affected by the availability of sunlight, carbon dioxide, nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates, and trace elements.\nMarginal seas generally exhibit intermediate levels of primary production, with the highest rates found in coastal upwelling regions and the lowest primary production occurring in open ocean regions. Hence, the highest biomass production rates occur in coastal upwelling zones, the lowest in open oceans regions, and intermediate rates in marginal seas.\nRegional variations in primary productivity primarily occur as a result of water column chemistry (e.g., nutrient and trace elements concentrations) and dominant physical processes. For nearshore regions such as coastal waters and marginal seas, the dominant physical processes influencing primary productivity are river runoff, water column mixing, and turbidity . River runoff and water column mixing introduce dissolved nutrients, trace elements, and suspended particles into the photic (light) zones of nearshore regions. Although the addition of dissolved nutrients and trace elements to coastal waters and marginal seas serves to increase primary production, the addition of suspended particles increases water turbidity, which results in reduced sunlight penetration and decreased primary productivity.\nWater circulation patterns in marginal seas depend largely on bathymetry , fresh-water input (e.g., river runoff and precipitation) and evaporation. If river runoff and precipitation exceed evaporation, as is the case in the Black and Baltic Seas, the excess fresh water will tend to flow seaward near the sea surface, diluting the marginal sea. If evaporation exceeds river runoff and precipitation, as in the Mediterranean Sea, the marginal sea water becomes saltier, then sinks and flows towards the less salty openocean region.\nWithin marginal seas, these general water circulation patterns are often modified by the local bathymetry, which in some instances serves to restrict water flow. The water circulation patterns of four major marginal seas are described below.\nThe Black Sea and Baltic Sea basins, which exhibit maximum depths of approximately 400 meters (1,312 feet) and 2,200 meters (7,216 feet), respectively, both possess sills that restrict subsurfacewater circulation. While the surface waters of the Black and Baltic Seas are able to flow over the sills and introduce lower salinity water into the open ocean, the flow of the saltier subsurface waters is blocked by these bathymetric features. This type of subsurface-water restriction often leads to stagnation, which may eventually result in local oxygen depletion. In the Black Sea, this oxygen depletion process has led to subsurface anaerobic conditions and significant decrease in biomass with depth. Due to the shallowness of the Baltic Sea, anaerobic conditions only exist in the deepest areas, where stagnation occurs.\nThe Mediterranean Sea, which is divided by a 400meter (1300-foot) sill into two subbasins, is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Gibraltar, to the Black Sea via the Bosporus Strait, and to the Red Sea via the manmade Suez Canal. Atlantic Ocean water enters this marginal sea through the Straits of Gibraltar as a surface flow. This ocean water replaces a fraction of the water that evaporates in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.\nUpon arrival to the northern coast of the eastern basin, a portion of the Atlantic Ocean water is cooled (13¬∞C or 56¬∞F) and made saltier by evaporation, which results in its sinking in the Adriatic Sea. During the winter as the remaining Atlantic Ocean water continues to flow towards Cyprus, it sinks to a depth ranging from 200 to 600 meters (656 to 1,968 feet), where it forms the Mediterranean Intermediate Water. This water mass then flows along the North African coast into the North Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Gibraltar. Because of its density, upon introduction into the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Intermediate Water sinks to approximately 1,000 meters (3,280 feet), where it mixes with Atlantic Ocean water. This mixing process results in the formation of the Mediterranean water mass.\nThe circulation between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean is typical of closed, restricted basins in which evaporation exceeds precipitation. As such this type of circulation pattern is often referred to as Mediterranean circulation, which is opposite of estuarine circulation.\nCompared to the Black, Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, the Gulf of Mexico is a much less complex marginal sea. The Gulf of Mexico possesses an extensive, broad continental shelf and a maximum water depth of approximately 3,600 meters (11,808 feet). The Gulf of Mexico is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Florida and the Caribbean Sea via the Yucat√°n Strait.\nSurface water in the Gulf of Mexico is as shallow as 90 meters (295 feet) in the winter and 125 meters (410 feet) during the summer. Surface salinities values for this marginal sea generally range between 36.0 and 36.3. In the northern Gulf of Mexico region, Mississippi River runoff influences surface waters as far as 150 meters away from the shore, resulting in salinities as low as 25. Gulf of Mexico surface-water temperatures range from 18¬∞C to 21¬∞C (64¬∞F to 70¬∞F) in the north and 24¬∞C to 27¬∞C (75¬∞F to 81¬∞F) in the south.\nA unique feature of the Gulf of Mexico's surface circulation pattern is the Loop Current, which results from the Caribbean Current entering the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucat√°n Strait and upon arrival, turning in a clockwise direction and \"looping\" around a warm \"dome\" of Gulf of Mexico surface water.\nSEE ALSO Algal Blooms, Harmful ; Algal Blooms in the Ocean ; Bays, Gulfs, AND Straits ; Beaches ; Coastal Ocean ; Coastal Waters Management ; Fisheries, Marine ; Human Health and the Ocean ; Light Transmission in the Ocean ; Ocean Basins ; Ocean Currents ; Ocean Mixing ; ; Pollution of the Ocean by Sewage .\nAshanti Johnson Pyrtle\nPickard, George L. and William J.

If you use the original Had03 FTP_BERT physics you get actually a lower 27Al(p,pn)26Al cross section: 408*361/5201=28.31 mb, but this is about the half of the exp. one (around 55 mb from the plot), i.e 50% relative error\nOn the other hand, as you pointed out, QGS_BIC produces 408*943/5151=74.69 mb, which means a relative error of 36%, not optimal, of course, but better than the former.\nThe origin of the differences lies on the different preequilirium models used in both physics lists, and coud be expected. In fact, at this incident energy the cascade model will deliver straightaway the (p+27Al) excited system to the preeequilibrium model There are two different exciton model versions in BERT and BIC, therefore here you have the origin of the discrepancies between them.\nAs for the discrepancies with respect to exp. data, this has been explained several times in several threads in the past, and also could be expected at these incident energies (around and below 100 MeV) . Simple statistical models are included in Geant4 to describe this reaction stage (the situation is similar for other MC codes: MCNP uses also exciton model and as far as I know, FLUKA and maybe PHITS use Bolzmann master equation transport model for preequlibrium, in any case simple models), which, apart of their simplicity for computational reasons, excludes a quantum mechanical treatment of the direct reaction channels (i.e., no compound system is considered and the memory of entrance channel is dominant). I'm afraid that if you need a better description of the 26Al yield at this energies you must either include by yoursel a better prescription in Geant4 (difficult, but I'd be extremely glad of that) or resort to codes for nuclear data evaluation, which use much more sofisticated nuclear models (usually several options). I suggest you to have a look to Empire (Mike Hermann et al) and/or TALYS (Arjan Koning et al) predictions for your work.\nFinally, let me add, once again, that preequilirium statistical models (as exciton) are meant as backend stages after intranuclear cascade has taken place, in which situation they use to perform passably well. When they are used as \"doorway\" models (below 100 MeV), the situation usually isn't that good.\nJose Manuel On Fri, 21 Aug 2015 21:05:57 GMT, Daren Sawkey wrote: > > chose the G4HadronPhysicsQGSP_BIC_HP > > I'll mention that if you use G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_HP instead > (default in Hadr03) there is better agreement to the experiment.

In PCOS, hirsutism involves excessive hair growth including areas where women do not typically get hair. In Cushing syndrome, women specifically experience thicker or more visible body and facial hair. Both conditions are related to hormonal imbalances, though the underlying mechanisms differ - PCOS is characterized by insulin resistance and hormonal shifts, while Cushing syndrome is caused by high cortisol levels.","context":["Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS): Infertility, Symptoms, Treatment\n7 minute read\nPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS, is a silent disorder and one of the most common hormone-based conditions women face. Not only can PCOS have a strong emotional effect over women, but it is also linked to infertility.\nThere are a host of unpleasant symptoms and physical problems associated with PCOS that many do not know about. Understanding the condition is the first step in protecting your health.\nWhat Is PCOS?\nPCOS is characterized by insulin resistance and a shift in hormonal balance. It is the leading form of hormonal disruption faced by women and yet there is still much about the condition that is unknown.\nAs the name suggests, polycystic ovarian syndrome causes enlarged ovaries with small cysts forming on the outer edges, causing irregularities in the menstrual cycle and other serious problems in the reproductive system.\nAwareness of PCOS has gradually increased in recent years in response to increased incidence. Despite being relatively under-diagnosed, the condition is serious and a majority of cases led to infertility. There is also increased risk for other health problems such as:\n‚ô¶ Type-2 diabetes\n‚ô¶ Endometrial cancer\n‚ô¶ Mood disorders\n‚ô¶ High blood pressure\n‚ô¶ Metabolic syndrome\n‚ô¶ Heart disease\nMany women are misdiagnosed based on the symptoms they present with, leaving them with no idea what the cause is. The strong connection to infertility makes misdiagnosis a big deal and stresses the importance of knowing the condition better.\nPCOS can develop for a number of reasons with various symptoms, making any diagnosis is tricky. What is known is that insulin resistance does have a starring role.\nFor those already diagnosed with insulin resistance, hyper awareness for PCOS should be a must. Insulin resistance is easier to diagnose. Once aware of this condition, you can be alert to any of the symptoms associated with PCOS.\nUntreated insulin resistance can lead to a host of health problems outside of PCOS, so it is always best to treat it upon discovery.\nThe symptoms of PCOS vary across women, but there are a few signs to watch for that give a strong indication PCOS are present.\n‚ô¶ Partial or total infertility\n‚ô¶ Irregular periods\n‚ô¶ Hirsutism (excessive hair growth, including areas where women do not typically get hair)\n‚ô¶ Mood changes\n‚ô¶ Low sex drive\n‚ô¶ Weight gain or trouble losing weight\n‚ô¶ Insulin resistance\n‚ô¶ Natural Remedies for PCOS\nThere is no known cure at this time, but there are a number of ways to help reduce symptom discomfort without medications. Dietary changes play a big part in treating PCOS, but there are also important lifestyle changes you can make too.\nFollowing a ketogenic diet has been found to work best for women with PCOS. A reduction in carbohydrate intake and an increase in healthy fats is the basis of this diet.\nKetosis is the process by which your liver produces ketones for you to utilize as energy rather than the traditional source of glucose. As a result your body burns fat more efficiently, which helps with the obesity commonly associated with PCOS.\nThe reduction in carbohydrate intake also improves insulin sensitivity, another common factor seen alongside PCOS. Incorporating an anti-inflammatory diet into this mix also has been shown to help.\nAvoiding foods that trigger inflammation, such as alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, sugars, and processed foods, reduces many of the metabolic symptoms associated with PCOS.\nGetting regular physical activity is great for overall health, but it plays a critical role in treating PCOS. Physical activity can alter hormones and women in particular are more susceptible to hormone changes with exercise.\nGetting the right amount of activity can help weight loss and improve fertility markers, insulin resistance, and reduce inflammation. You need to be careful not to overdo it, however, as this can contribute to PCOS by way of extreme hormone changes.\nSleep is essential for cell regeneration, hormone production, and weight management. Women with PCOS are more likely to have sleep disturbances, which increases their risk for insulin resistance and hormonal imbalance.\nIt is important for women with PCOS to get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. If you are having trouble, start a sleep schedule before bedtime. Do not eat for at least two hours before bed and turn off all electronics. If you can dim the lights around you and try a hot, relaxing bath. Practice good sleep hygiene.\nWatch for Endocrine Disruptors\nThese are chemicals that interfere with the production, release, and transport of hormones. PCOS makes women very sensitive to these chemicals, so it is best to know what they are and avoid them.\nThe most common ones you are likely to be exposed to are pesticides, BPA, dioxins, DBP, and Bisphenol A.\nWhether you get a supplement or soak up more of the sun each day, vitamin D is your friend when it comes to PCOS. Deficiency in vitamin D has been linked to PCOS, although it has not been determined to be a direct cause.\nVitamin D helps to improve insulin sensitivity, supports weight loss, can help to regulate periods, and slow the growth of ovarian cysts. Other beneficial supplements to try include magnesium, zinc, calcium, folic acid, and omega-3s, such as those found in krill oil supplements.\nThe Bottom Line\nPCOS is a prevalent disorder affecting thousands of women each year. As a major cause for infertility today, attention has turned to finding ways to identify and treat this condition sooner rather than later.\nWhile medications are available to help, you can treat PCOS naturally with a diet makeover, a few healthy lifestyle changes, and some supplemental support. There are solutions out there, so do not let PCOS control you or your future.","Cushing syndrome occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time. The most common cause of Cushing syndrome, sometimes called hypercortisolism, is the use of oral corticosteroid medication. The condition can also occur when your body makes too much cortisol.\nToo much cortisol can produce some of the hallmark signs of Cushing syndrome ‚Äî a fatty hump between your shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on your skin. Cushing syndrome can also result in high blood pressure, bone loss and, on occasion, diabetes.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome can return your body's cortisol production to normal and noticeably improve your symptoms. The earlier treatment begins, the better your chances for recovery.\nThe signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome vary.\nCommon signs and symptoms involve progressive obesity and skin changes, such as:\n- Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits, particularly around the midsection and upper back, in the face (moon face), and between the shoulders (buffalo hump)\n- Pink or purple stretch marks (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms\n- Thinning, fragile skin that bruises easily\n- Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections\nWomen with Cushing syndrome may experience:\n- Thicker or more visible body and facial hair (hirsutism)\n- Irregular or absent menstrual periods\nMen with Cushing syndrome may experience:\n- Decreased libido\n- Decreased fertility\n- Erectile dysfunction\nOther signs and symptoms include:\n- Muscle weakness\n- Depression, anxiety and irritability\n- Loss of emotional control\n- Cognitive difficulties\n- New or worsened high blood pressure\n- Glucose intolerance that may lead to diabetes\n- Bone loss, leading to fractures over time\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you're taking corticosteroid medications to treat a condition, such as asthma, arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, and experience signs and symptoms that may indicate Cushing syndrome, see your doctor for an evaluation. Even if you're not using these drugs and you have symptoms that suggest the possible presence of Cushing syndrome, contact your doctor.\nCushing syndrome results from excess levels of the hormone cortisol in your body. Your endocrine system consists of glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout your body. These glands include the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovaries (in females) and testicles (in men).\nYour adrenal glands produce a number of hormones, including cortisol. Cortisol plays a variety of roles in your body. For example, cortisol helps regulate your blood pressure and keeps your cardiovascular system functioning normally. It also helps your body respond to stress and regulates the way you convert (metabolize) proteins, carbohydrates and fats in your diet into usable energy. However, when the level of cortisol is too high in your body, you may develop Cushing syndrome.\nThe role of corticosteroids\nCushing syndrome can develop from a cause that originates outside of your body (exogenous Cushing syndrome). Taking corticosteroid medications in high doses over an extended period of time may result in Cushing syndrome. These medications, such as prednisone, have the same effects as does the cortisol produced by your body.\nYour doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma, or to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted organ. Because the doses required to treat these conditions are often higher than the amount of cortisol your body normally needs each day, the effects of excess cortisol can occur.\nPeople can also develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids ‚Äî for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain. While certain inhaled steroid medicines (taken for asthma) and steroid skin creams (used for skin disorders such as eczema) are in the same general category of drugs, they're less likely to cause Cushing syndrome, but may in some individuals especially if taken in high doses.\nYour body's own overproduction\nThe condition may also be due to your body's own overproduction of cortisol (endogenous Cushing syndrome). This may occur from excess production by one or both adrenal glands, or overproduction of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which normally regulates cortisol production. In these cases, Cushing syndrome may be related to:\n- A pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma). A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, secretes an excess amount of ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol. When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease. It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n- An ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor. Rarely, when a tumor develops in an organ that normally does not produce ACTH, the tumor will begin to secrete this hormone in excess, resulting in Cushing syndrome. These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.\n- A primary adrenal gland disease. In some people, the cause of Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol secretion that doesn't depend on stimulation from ACTH and is associated with disorders of the adrenal glands. The most common of these disorders is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma. Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinomas) are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well. Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome.\n- Familial Cushing syndrome. Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.\nIf you don't receive prompt treatment for Cushing syndrome, other complications may occur, such as:\n- Bone loss (osteoporosis), which can result in unusual bone fractures, such as rib fractures and fractures of the bones in the feet\n- High blood pressure (hypertension)\n- Frequent or unusual infections\n- Loss of muscle mass and strength\nWhen the cause of Cushing syndrome is a pituitary tumor (Cushing disease), it can sometimes lead to other problems, such as interfering with the production of other hormones controlled by the pituitary.\nYou're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in endocrine (hormonal) disorders.\nIt's a good idea to prepare for your appointment so that you can make the most of your time with your doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor.\nWhat you can do\n- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance to prepare for diagnostic tests.\n- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment. For example, if you've had headaches more frequently or if you've been feeling down or more tired than usual, this is important information to share with your doctor. Also tell your doctor about changes in your physical appearance, such as weight gain, new acne or increased body hair.\n- Write down key personal information, including any changes in your personal relationships and in your sex life. Let your doctor know if the people closest to you have noticed that you seem irritable or that you seem to have more mood swings than in the past. It may help to take along a photo of yourself that shows any changes in your physical appearance since you've started experiencing symptoms.\n- Make a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins, creams or supplements, that you're currently taking or have used in the past. Include on your list the specific name, dose and dates of any steroid medications you've taken in the past, such as cortisone injections.\n- Take a family member or friend along, if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to soak up all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.\n- Write down questions to ask your doctor.\nYour time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For Cushing syndrome, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n- What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\n- Are there other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\n- What kinds of diagnostic tests do I need? How are these tests performed?\n- What are my treatment options?\n- Will my physical signs and symptoms improve with treatment? Will I see a difference in my appearance as well as in the way I feel?\n- Will treatment help make me feel more emotionally stable?\n- What long-term impact could each treatment option have? Will there be an impact on my ability to have children?\n- How will you follow my response to treatment over time?\n- Are there any alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\n- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n- Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?\n- Should I see a specialist?\n- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?\n- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:\n- When did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\n- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional? Have they gotten worse over time?\n- Have you noticed any changes in your sexual performance or your interest in sex?\n- For women, has your menstrual cycle changed or have you stopped having your period?\n- Have you gained weight? On what part of your body?\n- Have you had difficulty controlling your emotions?\n- Have you noticed that you bruise more easily, or that wounds and infections take longer to heal than in the past?\n- Do you have weakness in your muscles, such as difficulty getting out of the tub or walking stairs?\n- Have you developed new acne or more body or facial hair?\n- Have you been taking a corticosteroid medication? For how long?\n- What, if anything, seems to either improve or worsen your symptoms?\nDiagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You may not have any firm answers about your condition until you've had a series of medical appointments.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome are designed to lower the high level of cortisol in your body. The best treatment for you depends on the cause of the syndrome. Treatment options include:\nReducing corticosteroid use. If the cause of Cushing syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing signs and symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still adequately managing your asthma, arthritis or other condition. For many of these medical problems, your doctor can prescribe noncorticosteroid drugs, which will allow him or her to reduce the dosage or eliminate the use of corticosteroids altogether.\nDon't reduce the dose of corticosteroid drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your doctor's supervision. Abruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to deficient cortisol levels. Slowly tapering off corticosteroid drugs allows your body to resume normal cortisol production.\nSurgery. If the cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor, your doctor may recommend complete surgical removal. Pituitary tumors are typically removed by a neurosurgeon, who may perform the procedure through your nose. If a tumor is present in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or in some cases by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually experience a return of normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. However, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never experience a resumption of normal adrenal function; they then need lifelong replacement therapy.\n- Radiation therapy. If the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy to be used in conjunction with the operation. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery. Radiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period or by a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife surgery). In the latter procedure, administered as a single treatment, a large dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\nMedications. Medications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications may also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome. Doctors recommend drug therapy before surgery to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medications to control excessive production of cortisol include ketoconazole (Nizoral), mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone). The Food and Drug Administration has also approved the use of mifepristone (Korlym) for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause other hormones produced by the pituitary or adrenal gland to become deficient and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol. However, your ACTH levels will remain high, possibly causing excess pigmentation of your skin.\nThe length of your recovery from Cushing syndrome will depend on the severity and cause of your condition. Remember to be patient. You didn't develop Cushing syndrome overnight, and your symptoms won't disappear overnight either. In the meantime, these tips may help you on your journey back to health.\n- Increase activities slowly. You may be in such a hurry to get your old self back that you push yourself too hard too fast, but your weakened muscles need a slower approach. Work up to a reasonable level of exercise or activity that feels comfortable without overdoing it. You'll improve little by little, and your persistence will be rewarded.\n- Eat sensibly. Nutritious, wholesome foods provide a good source of fuel for your recovering body and can help you lose the extra pounds that you gained from Cushing syndrome. Make sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D. Taken together, they help your body absorb calcium, which can help strengthen your bones, counteracting the bone density loss that often occurs with Cushing syndrome.\n- Monitor your mental health. Depression can be a side effect of Cushing syndrome, but it can also persist or develop after treatment begins. Don't ignore your depression or wait it out. Seek help promptly from your doctor or a therapist if you're depressed, overwhelmed or having difficulty coping during your recovery.\n- Gently soothe aches and pains. Hot baths, massages and low-impact exercises, such as water aerobics and tai chi, can help alleviate some of the muscle and joint pain that accompanies Cushing syndrome recovery.\n- Exercise your brain. If you're recovering from any cognitive difficulties as a result of Cushing syndrome, mental exercises, such as math problems and crossword puzzles, may improve your brain function.\nSupport groups can be valuable in dealing with Cushing syndrome and recovery. They bring you together with other people who are coping with the same kinds of challenges, along with their families and friends, and offer a setting in which you can share common problems.\nAsk your doctor about support groups in your community. Your local health department, public library and telephone book as well as the Internet also may be good sources to find a support group in your area.\nMar. 28, 2013\n- Stratakis CA.

{"question":"What makes cellulosic ethanol production expensive currently, and how do renewable energy cost assessments handle such technological uncertainties?","answer":"Cellulosic ethanol production is currently expensive primarily due to the high cost per gallon of converting tough plant fibers into fermentable sugars, despite using cheap and plentiful feedstocks like crop residues, grasses, and woodchips. The process traditionally requires energy-intensive heating for thermolysis. Regarding cost assessments, the ATB handles technological uncertainties through multiple projection methods. These include engineering-based models for potential technology innovations, learning curves combined with macroeconomic assumptions for adoption rates, and expert elicitation for probability levels of different cost outcomes. The ATB acknowledges that all methods have strengths and weaknesses, and typically provides a range of projections (High, Mid, and Low) to account for these uncertainties.","context":["A Method to Cut Biofuel Costs\nCellulosic ethanol, which is produced from the inedible fibers in plant and crop residues, fast-growing grasses and woodchips, has often been hailed as the holy grail of biofuels. It‚Äôs made from low-cost and plentiful feedstocks; it has the potential to be widely produced yet doesn‚Äôt pit food against fuel, as accused in corn-based ethanol production; and it has a smaller carbon footprint than either petroleum or ethanol from corn.\nThere‚Äôs just one catch: cost. While the feedstocks are cheap, the process of turning them into useful chemicals and fuels isn‚Äôt. With a high cost per gallon to convert the tough plant fibers into fermentable sugars, large-scale production has so far proved too pricey to be competitive in the marketplace. That outlook might soon change, however, thanks to a discovery by scientists at Ames Laboratory that could remove one of the biggest cost barriers to commercialization.\nJavier Vela, an Ames chemist, has found a way to make photocatalyst nanoparticles that are more stable and require only sunlight to carry out the key fiber-to-sugar conversion‚Äî developments that could reduce costs of catalyst replacement while eliminating the need for expensive external energy inputs.\n‚ÄúThe main way people covert biomass into fuels or chemicals is by thermolysis or heating,‚Äù said Vela, who is also an assistant professor of chemistry at Iowa State University. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very energy-intensive, as you start by wasting a lot of energy just to break all these big plant cell molecules apart. If you can get rid of that heating step, you‚Äôre already making the process more efficient.‚Äù\nWith Vela‚Äôs new solar energy-harvesting photocatalyst, the heating step may no longer be needed. He‚Äôs discovered a way to use nanoparticles made from naturally strong light absorbers. He and graduate student Purnima Ruberu created a photocatalyst capable of absorbing even more light‚Äîimportantly, in the desired red to near-infra-red spectrum for solar energy‚Äîand powering a chemical reaction based only on the sun‚Äôs energy.\n‚ÄúFor the most part, these sunlight photochemical reactions with biomass substrates have not really been explored,‚Äù Vela said. ‚ÄúBut if you think about it, the best photocatalyst is actually nature‚Äîso, leaves and photosynthesis.‚Äù\nIn an effort to more closely mimic how plants create energy through photosynthesis, where chloroplasts in plant cells use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into sugars that feed them, Vela is working with colleagues at Ames Lab on encapsulating these light-harvesting rods inside transparent porous supports.\nThese supports contain the rods while still allowing light infiltration and exchange with the outside medium. And because they are largely insoluble, they can be more easily collected and reused.\n‚ÄúThe porous supports are the synthetic equivalent of a chloroplast,‚Äù Vela said. ‚ÄúBy putting our photocatalyst in them, we hope to control how fast those reactions occur‚Äîso that instead of getting two or 10 percent energy conversion, we get 100 percent conversion.‚Äù\nAs with many important discoveries, Vela‚Äôs happened by accident. He originally wanted to create a rod-shaped photocatalyst made of just cadmium and selenium‚Äîelements that together absorb light strongly in the preferred region of the solar spectrum. But due to certain properties of those elements, the process of making rods frequently produced other shapes not as conducive for solar energy harvesting.\nHe had recently learned, however, about a simple and reproducible process of making rods from cadmium mixed with sulfur. While those elements have a bluer band gap, Vela surmised that following the procedure for making cadmium-sulfur nanorods, but adding small amounts of selenium, would achieve the desired shape, while skewing the final mixture into a redder band gap range.\nHe was right about the redder band gap, but the resulting shape‚Äîdrumstick-like particles with thick ‚Äúheads‚Äù and narrow ‚Äútails‚Äù‚Äîseemed to run counter to the laws of chemistry.\n‚ÄúUsually when you mix two or more semiconducting materials together, the optical properties tend to be an average of the pure materials,‚Äù Vela said. ‚ÄúThe shape we got just didn‚Äôt make sense. According to solid-state chemistry, you should be able to make a solid solution of, in this case cadmium-sulfide and cadmium-selenide, where you have a homogenous distribution of sulfur and selenium across the rod structure. Instead what we got was a head region very rich in selenium and another area that‚Äôs very thin and rich in sulfur. We didn‚Äôt understand at first why there was that segregation of materials.‚Äù\nFurther investigation revealed a simple explanation: The sulfur and selenium precursors Vela used had mismatched reactivities, which caused them to form at different times resulting in the drumstick shape. While he didn‚Äôt unearth some new law of nature, stumbling on a way to segregate elements in a solid-state mixture proved key to discovering how to make the cadmium-sulfur-selenium photocatalyst more stable across multiple uses.\n‚ÄúIn our photocatalyst design, we need a second particle‚Äîa metal island, or co-catalyst,‚Äù Vela said. ‚ÄúOnce you form that electron-hole pair, you need to separate those charges, and it‚Äôs the metal island that does that. We never would have been able to figure out how to do that without having made those drumstick structures with two different poles.‚Äù\nThis metal island is what bestows enhanced longevity on Vela‚Äôs photocatalyst. The ones lacking the metal island completely dissolved after eight days, while he said that those with it remained active. Currently, the enhanced photocatalysts survive about two weeks, a considerable boost in recyclability. Extending that durability even more is merely a matter of optimizing, he said, not functionality.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve shown that the photocatalyst works‚Äîthat the reaction really works, at room temperature, driven just by sunlight,‚Äù Vela said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it can be optimized.‚Äù\nCurrently, Vela and colleagues are working to perfect the method for encapsulating the rods within porous networks and he‚Äôs optimistic about where the work is heading, and what it could mean fo","The ATB represents the cost and performance of typical electricity generation plants in the United States. The ATB represents renewable electricity generation plants either by (1) reflecting the entire geographic range of resource with a few points averaging similar characteristics or (2) providing examples to demonstrate a range associated with resource potential.\nFoundational to this averaging approach, NREL uses high-resolution, location-specific resource data to represent site-specific capital investment and estimated annual energy production for all potential renewable energy plants in the United States.\nFor each renewable technology, the ATB includes:\nFor fossil and nuclear generation plants, the ATB:\nFor biopower plants, the ATB:\nNote: Capacity expansion models (including the ReEDS model used by NREL) calculate the optimized capacity factor for each conventionally fueled plant. The default capacity factors listed in the ATB data spreadsheet are meant to be representative‚Äînot to reflect exactly what values were used in the modeling.\nBase year (2015) costs in the ATB are from the following sources:\n|Land-based wind power plants||Bottom-up modeling (Mon√© et al. 2017), compared to wind market data reports, methodology updated from Wind Vision (DOE 2015)|\n|Offshore wind power plants||Bottom-up modeling (Beiter et al. 2016), compared to wind market data reports|\n|Utility, residential, and commercial PV plants||Market data reports (2015) supplemented with bottom-up cost modeling from Fu et al.

This framework provides comparisons of cost projections with published literature to illustrate potential differences in perspective. In general, ATB projections are within the bounds of perspectives represented in the literature.\nIn the ATB, projections are developed independently for each technology using different methods, but the initial starting point for each is compared with market data (where it is available) to provide a consistent baseline methodology. Common plant envelope definitions are based on EIA (2016a) and contribute to the consistent baseline.\nDeveloping cost and performance projections for electricity generation technologies is very difficult. Methods that rely on engineering-based models are likely to provide insight into potential technology innovations that yield a lower cost of energy. Methods that rely on learning curves in combination with high-level macroeconomic assumptions are likely to provide insight into potential rates of adoption of technology innovations. Methods that include expert elicitation may result in associated probability levels for different future cost outcomes. All methods have strengths and weaknesses in serving the varied interests that seek these types of projections. Approaches that combine methods are likely to provide the greatest transparency and widest application for technology innovation purposes as well as macroeconomic purposes. However, high levels of uncertainty are associated with each method. Providing a range of projections (e.g., High, Mid and Low) produces scenario modeling results that represent a range of possible outcomes.\nThe following table lists the method behind the ATB cost projections for each renewable energy technology.\n|Technology||Methods||Source||ATB Mid and Low||Notes|\n|Wind (land and offshore)||Expert elicitation||Wiser et al. 2016||Mid: 50% probability scenario\nLow: 10% probability scenario\n|Scenarios reflect relative difference between Mid and Low associated with probability; include LCOE component projections (e.g., CAPEX and capacity factor)|\n|Solar PV (utility and distributed)||Literature survey (CAPEX), single pathway (O&M)||Internal NREL analysis (Feldman)||Mid: Based on median of literature sample\nLow: Based on lower bound of literature sample\n|Long term: forecasts published in last three years\nShort term: forecasts published in last six months\n|CSP (10 hours thermal storage)||Single pathway, learning, literature survey||Internal NREL analysis (Kurup) and On the Path to SunShot||Mid: Based on median of literature sample\nLow: SunShot target achieved in 2035\n|Low projection informed by bottom-up analysis combined with learning rates; Mid projection based on literature sample|\n|Hydropower (NPD, NSD)||Multiple pathway, expert input, learning||Hydropower Vision (DOE 2016)||Mid: Hydropower Vision (DOE 2016) Reference scenario\nLow: Hydropower Vision (DOE 2016) Advanced Technology scenario\n|Projections informed by industry expertise, identifiable potential future technology and process advancements, EIA minimum learning|\n|Geothermal||Minimum learning||EIA NEMS||Mid: -5% CAPEX by 2035\nLow: -10% CAPEX by 2035\n|Geothermal Vision Study will result in detailed analysis for future ATB editions|\nThe methods identified in the table above are defined as follows:\nBeiter, Philipp, Walter Musial, Aaron Smith, Levi Kilcher, Rick Damiani, Michael Maness, Senu Sirnivas, Tyler Stehly, Vahan Gevorgian, Meghan Mooney, and George Scott. 2016.

{"question":"How do Kurask and Killerwatt creatures differ in their social behaviors and combat mechanics, and what specific equipment requirements are needed to effectively battle each of them?","answer":"Kurasks have a complex social structure with their own language and rites of passage. They live in isolation from other races, only interacting when hunting, and perform a coming-of-age ritual called Kurisk at age 80. They must be killed using specific weapons like leaf-bladed weapons, broad arrows, or Slayer Dart spell. In contrast, Killerwatts are electrical creatures that inhabit clouds and require insulated boots to even approach them. They use both ranged and melee attacks, with their ranged attacks being particularly dangerous. Killerwatts become aggressive immediately when attacked, similar to aviantese, and are best fought using crush weapons while wearing melee armor. They cannot be fought using a Dwarf multicannon, and their combat mechanics require specific tactical approaches like triggering their melee attacks instead of their more dangerous ranged attacks.","context":["|Release||26 January 2005 (Update)|\n|Large, heavy, with sharp things attached to its head.|\n|Equipment XP (2H/MH & Armour/OH)|\n|19 / 13 / 6|\n4 ticks (2.4s)\nKurask are large, green, armoured monsters that can be found in the second to last chamber of the Fremennik Slayer Dungeon and on the lower level of the Pollnivneach Slayer Dungeon. They require 70 Slayer to kill. Kurasks, like turoths, must be killed with certain weapons (listed below).\nItems to bringEdit\nKurasks must be killed with one of these weapons:\n- Magic: Slayer Dart spell used with either:\n- Ranged: A fitting ranged weapon with any of the following ammunition:\nBiology and natureEdit\nKurask are somewhat similar to gorillas, although they share some traits with other animals such as their large horns which are similar to a bull's. They are grey to pale green in colour and have rows of hooked horns protruding from their back. They have three stomachs, the third of which has a special stomach lining that prevents food from being digested. Within the stomach a ceremonial fruit is stored for the duration of the kurask's life. Their lifespan is of an unknown length, but surpasses that of humans. They ideally come of age at 80 years. There is also evidence that they can breathe underwater.\nIt was revealed in issue 23 of Postbag from the Hedge that kurask are somewhat intelligent, and have their own rites of passage and language. Kurask society dictates that individuals should not come in contact with other races unless they are hunting. Those that disobey this are generally shunned or even banished.\nAt age 80 kurask partake in a coming-of-age ritual called Kurisk. This generally kills one-third of those that attempt it. The kurask are sent \"over a plain\" and then \"under the sea\" to retrieve a fruit from the human lands (this is thought to mean through northern Kandarin, under the Southern Sea, and onto Karamja). Those that return are treated as adults.\n|‚Äú|| To become a kuraski, at the age of 80, a kura must leave the cave and complete the rite of Kurisk [...] a kura must then pluck a fruit from a tree and bring it back to Kuriskia.\nThen they become kuraski and the fruit is ingested whole, held in a third stomach until death and preserved by our stomach lining. You did not, by any chance, eat it, did you?\nSince the discovery of the Slayer Dungeon beneath the Kharidian settlement Pollnivneach, kurask society's origins and schisms have been called into greater question. The nature of the Pollnivneach Slayer Dungeon is still largely unknown, although its workings are obviously artificial; it possesses constructed portals to the Fremennik caves, amongst other slayer-related locations. It is unknown whether kurask originated in the Kharidian Desert or Fremennik Province, if either.\nThe idea of living in solitude and isolation that governs kurask society is very similar in nature to that of the scabarite race which follows Scabaras's ideologies. If the kurask race originated in the Kharidian Desert, it is possible that they were influenced by the scabarites, who were very active (although at the time probably all humans) during the Third Age, roughly when the dungeon is believed to have been created and active.\nKurask possess a basic language. Little is known of it, and only a few words have been translated; most by Skuhavi, a kurask banished for his interest in humans. Below is a list of known words in the kurask language.\n- Skutask - Interest.\n- Shallask - Alas, or an expression of anger/regret.\n- Skarooom - Dooom!\n- Kuraski - A kurask that has completed Kurisk, an adult. Must be at least 80 years old.\n- Kura - A child, or one who has not completed Kurisk.\n- Kurisk - Rite performed by Kura. Named after a legendary kurask hero that first performed the travel to Karamja.\n- Kuriskia - A kurask city.\n- Fremennik Slayer Dungeon (near fairy ring code AJR; a ring of slaying has a teleport to the dungeon).\n- Pollnivneach Slayer Dungeon (a ring of slaying has a teleport close to the dungeon).\nStrengths and weaknessesEdit\nPlayers must use a leaf-bladed weapon, broad arrows, broad-tipped bolts, royal bolts, ascension bolts, or the Slayer Dart spell when fighting these. Using any other weapon is completely ineffective. The dwarf multicannon does not work, and the deflect curses will reflect damage although not much. (familiars do work)\nAfter the Evolution of Combat, the best way to kill these is with the Slayer Dart. It is possible to kill them in 2 or 3 hits with this method.\n|Represents a 90% confidence range based on a sample of 28,243 kills.|\n1 charm is dropped at a time.\n|Unfinished broad bolts||50||Common||850|\n|Off-hand rune longsword||1||Uncommon||17,735|\n|Off-hand leaf-bladed sword||1||Very rare||39,189|\n|Leaf-bladed sword||1||Very rare[notes 1]||39,545|\n|Kurask boots||1||Rare[notes 2]||12,499|\n|Light mystic robe top||1||Uncommon||23,888|\n|White berries||2 (noted)||Common||4,402|\n|Limpwurt root||2 (noted)||Common||4,562|\n|Grimy dwarf weed||1||Uncommon||2,537|\n|Poison ivy seed||1||Uncommon||190|\n|Morchella mushroom spore||4||Uncommon||1,104|\n|Dwarf weed seed||1||Rare||671|\n|Torstol seed||1||Very rare||1,470|\n- ^ Estimated at 1/554 using gathered Adventurer's Log data as of 18 September 2012.\n- ^ Drop chance is increased if the player is on a slayer assignment for Kurask.\n|Anagogic ort||20; 40||Uncommon||Not sold|\n|Spirit sapphire||1||Rare||Not sold|\n|Spirit emerald||1||Rare||Not sold|\n|Spirit ruby||1||Rare||Not sold|\n|Clue scroll (hard)||1||Rare||Not sold|\n|Kurask head||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Long bone||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Curved bone||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Starved ancient effigy||1||Very rare||Not sold|\nRare drop table dropsEdit\n- This monster has access to the rare drop table.\nLuck-enhancing items such as a ring of wealth or luck of the dwarves are not required to access the table.\n|Show/hide rare drop table|\n|Uncut diamond||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Rare||174,915‚Äì213,785|\n|Loop half of a key||1||Common||17,782|\n|Tooth half of a key||1||Common||22,737|\n|Uncut dragonstone||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Rare||553,140‚Äì676,060|\n|Rune platebody||15‚Äì25 (noted)||Rare||563,475‚Äì939,125|\n|Shield left half||1||Rare||65,257|\n|Onyx bolts||135‚Äì165||Very rare||1,069,200‚Äì1,306,800|\n|Water talisman||65‚Äì82 (noted)||Rare||483,145‚Äì609,506|\n|Earth talisman||65‚Äì82 (noted)||Rare||131,950‚Äì166,460|\n|Fire talisman||25‚Äì35 (noted)||Rare||50,825‚Äì71,155|\n|Raw lobster||135‚Äì165 (noted)||Common||45,225‚Äì55,275|\n|Raw shark||225‚Äì275 (noted)||Uncommon||353,700‚Äì432,300|\n|Big bones||72‚Äì90 (noted)||Uncommon||18,432‚Äì23,040|\n|Dragon bones||180‚Äì220 (noted)||Rare||319,140‚Äì390,060|\n|Gold ore||90‚Äì110 (noted)||Common||15,390‚Äì18,810|\n|Adamantite ore||180‚Äì220 (noted)||Uncommon||211,680‚Äì258,720|\n|Adamant bar||14‚Äì16 (noted)||Common||49,546‚Äì56,624|\n|Adamant bar||135‚Äì165 (noted)||Rare||477,765‚Äì583,935|\n|Runite ore||90‚Äì110 (noted)||Rare||958,860‚Äì1,171,940|\n|Rune bar||3 (noted)||Common||41,532|\n|Rune bar||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Rare||622,980‚Äì761,420|\n|Grimy torstol||90‚Äì110 (noted)||Uncommon||380,610‚Äì465,190|\n|Grimy snapdragon||90‚Äì110 (noted)||Uncommon||238,680‚Äì291,720|\n|Super restore (4)||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Uncommon||243,045‚Äì297,055|\n|Prayer potion (4)||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Uncommon||167,175‚Äì204,325|\n|Dwarf weed seed||14‚Äì16||Uncommon||9,394‚Äì10,736|\n|Palm tree seed||10||Rare||1,750,790|\n|Molten glass||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Common||14,310‚Äì17,490|\n|Soft clay||450‚Äì550 (noted)||Uncommon||220,950‚Äì270,050|\n|Yew logs||675‚Äì825 (noted)||Rare||131,625‚Äì160,875|\n|Teak plank||45‚Äì55 (noted)||Uncommon||43,650‚Äì53,350|\n|Mahogany plank||270‚Äì330 (noted)||Rare||485,190‚Äì593,010|\n|Vecna skull||1||Very rare||254,248|\n|Hazelmere's signet ring||1||Very rare||1,885,212,297|\n|Brawling gloves (Melee)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Magic)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Ranged)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Agility)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Cooking)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (FM)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Fishing)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Hunter)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Mining)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Prayer)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Smithing)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (Thieving)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Brawling gloves (WC)||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Crystal triskelion fragment 1||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Crystal triskelion fragment 2||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n|Crystal triskelion fragment 3||1||Very rare||Not sold|\n- Universal drops are dropped by nearly every monster outside of Daemonheim.\n- These drops are dropped alongside main drops.\n|Key token||1||Rare||Not sold|\n- Prior to the release of the Order of Ascension, it was possible to kill Kurasks (and Turoth) using any spell, as long as a Slayer staff or staff of light was equipped.

Wear insulated boots to enter the Killerwatt plane; if you are not wearing insulated boots before you enter the portal, Professor Oddenstein will warn you. If you enter without them or take them off after you are inside, you will get hit for up to ~1500 life points by the thunderclouds inside the area.\nKillerwatts initially appear as passive spheres of electricity, but when they are attacked they become aggressive immediately, growing arms and a tail. Like aviantese, they will retaliate as soon as the attack option is selected, regardless of whether the player has landed a hit on them.\nKillerwatt drops include common fire and Nature runes, and the occasional air or fire battlestaff drop. At around 50 Defence, food isn't required with good armour as they do not hit often. Players with level 55 Magic can use the fire and nature rune drops to turn the other drops into coins. Killerwatts also drop ashes; players can bring urns for Prayer experience.\nWarning: Killerwatts are much more dangerous than their combat level suggests; both their ranged and melee attacks are as fast as dual wielded \"fastest\" weapons, and their ranged attacks are exceptionally accurate. Instead of relying on protection prayers, it is better to bring food and use your prayer for attack boosts. Players cannot use the Dwarf multicannon in the Killerwatt plane.\nDuring the Enlightened Journey quest, it was revealed by the balloon travelling screen that killerwatts inhabit clouds. However, players cannot engage them in battle here.\nStrengths and weaknessesEdit\nKillerwatts use both ranged and melee, and can hit very rapidly. Their ranged attack are quite dangerous but their melee attacks are much milder.\nTheir weakness is crush, therefore it is advised to bring a crush weapon such as a warhammer or mace. Wear melee armor to defend against the ranged attack; a full set of Void Knight equipment is also a good option, with its accuracy and damage bonuses.\nBefore the evolution of combat, slayers who didn't want to spend the money to consistently use prayer or make multiple trips would often change, skip or remove this monster. However, good tactics and the evolution of combat make these monsters relatively easy to kill.\nKillerwatts attack in a manner similar to aviantese; when they are attacked regardless of whether the player can hit them, they will immediately become aggressive. This can be taken advantage of, however, as if the killerwatt lands the first strike, it will only use its weaker melee attacks. To make this happen, select a killerwatt at a distance. You must not be standing in your target's area (you can see that the clouds form small separate territories once you know what to look for). Once the killerwatt becomes aggressive, immediately click the ground near you to avoid running towards it. Your target is now considered the \"attacker\" and will track you while you approach. When you get near, it will attack with melee.\nThere are two potentially serious mistakes you can make; you can select a target that is too close, and find yourself under heavy ranged fire. You can also accidentally click on another killerwatt while approaching your target, and be under unexpected ranged damage from the second killerwatt. For low level fighters, damage will be immediate and serious. Fortunately, the portal remains open at all times - if you find yourself under fire, run for the portal and exit the plane, reenter and try again. Because approaching your selected target is crucial, you might want to move in a spiral toward your selected target to avoid clicking its area until you are in melee combat. If you are having trouble managing your fights, disable 'run' and give yourself more time to plan.\nItem Quantity Rarity GE Market Price Impious ashes 1 Always 149\nItem Quantity Rarity GE Market Price Air battlestaff 1 Uncommon 8,236 Fire battlestaff 1 Uncommon 8,570 Staff of air 1 Uncommon 618 Staff of fire 1 Uncommon 671 Mystic fire staff 1 Uncommon 25,294\n- Represents 90% confidence range, based on a sample of 21,851 kills.\n1 charm is dropped at a time.\n- Please add to the log (only if 50 or more creatures killed).\nItem Quantity Rarity GE Market Price Grimy guam 1 Common 741 Grimy marrentill 1 Common 72 Grimy tarromin 1 Common 36 Grimy harralander 1 Common 183 Grimy ranarr 1 Uncommon 3,235 Grimy irit 1 Uncommon 2,685 Grimy avantoe 1 Uncommon 4,633 Grimy kwuarm 1 Uncommon 4,476 Grimy cadantine 1 Uncommon 1,695 Grimy lantadyme 1 Rare 10,139 Grimy dwarf weed 1 Rare 12,534\nItem Quantity Rarity GE Market Price Air rune 5‚Äì17 Common 120‚Äì408 Fire rune 18‚Äì45 Common 900‚Äì2,250 Chaos rune 4 Uncommon 164 Nature rune 4‚Äì37 Common 1,216‚Äì11,248 Steam rune 2 Uncommon 76 Death rune 2 Uncommon 338\nItem Quantity Rarity GE Market Price Coins 11‚Äì200 Common Not sold Cannonball 3 Uncommon 1,374 Fire orb 2 Uncommon 4,270 Soda ash 4 Uncommon 2,504 Spirit sapphire 1 Rare Not sold Spirit emerald 1 Rare Not sold Spirit ruby 1 Rare Not sold Starved ancient effigy 1 Very rare Not sold\nRare drop table dropsEdit\n- This monster has access to the rare drop table.\nThe ring of wealth is not required to access the table.\nShow/hide rare drop table Item Quantity Rarity GE Market Price Coins 250 ‚Äì 450;

{"question":"Which field artillery unit saw more direct combat action in the Pacific - the 152nd Field Artillery Battalion or the 98th Field Artillery Battalion? Break it down by their major engagements.","answer":"The 152nd Field Artillery Battalion saw significantly more combat action in the Pacific. The 152nd participated in multiple major engagements including the 81-day battle for New Georgia Island (killing 4,000 enemy troops), the 30-day defense of the Driniumor River Line against 30,000 Japanese troops in New Guinea, and extensive combat operations in Luzon where they supported attacks on Fort Stotsenberg, the Zambales Mountains, and Ipo Dam. In contrast, the 98th Field Artillery Battalion saw no combat action during their time in the Pacific.

The\nnew 152nd was the habitually-supporting artillery for the 103rd Regimental Combat Team, also originally from Maine.\nThe Division departed Camp Shelby for their Port of Embarkation, Fort Ord, California, arrving on September 10, 1942.\nreached the Lingayen Plains and given a brief rest before resuming the attack. On February 27th, the 43rd attacked the Fort Stotsenberg\nArea of Luzon, eliminated pockets of resistance in the Zambales Mountains, and then moved southward to crush the Shimbu Line in the\nAntipolo-New Bosoboso Sector east of Manila. The Division next spearheaded the assault on Ipo Dam, the main source of water for\nManila, and blasted the Shinsu Fortress surrounding the dam, securing the area on May 19th.\nThe 43rd continued to mop up enemy remnants until the Japanese surrender. In September the Division embarked for occupation duty\nnorth of Tokyo and returned home the following month.\nThe battles won and the three campaigns fought by the men of the Winged Victory Division had exacted their toll, costing over 6,026\ncombat casualties in killed and wounded. The men of the 43rd adopted the Division motto while on Luzon in honor of their Commanding\nOfficer, Major General Leonard Wing, the only National Guard officer in WW II to be promoted to command an active combat Division.\nHistory of the 43rd Infantry Division Artillery 1941-1945 by Harold R.

Col. Henry Mucci|\nThe 6th Ranger Battalion was a United States Army Ranger Battalion which saw action in the Pacific during World War II. The battalion is best known for its role in the Raid at Cabanatuan in the Philippines in January 1945.\n98th Field Artillery Battalion\nThe 6th Rangers history begins with a mule-drawn pack artillery unit, the 98th Field Artillery Battalion. The 98th Field Artillery was formed at Camp Carson, Colorado in 1942 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James M. Callicutt. In December 1942, the battalion embarked for Brisbane, Australia, but due to Australian animal importation laws, the battalion was redirected to New Guinea, arriving at Port Moresby on 17 February 1943.\nThe Battalion spent the next 12 months in training, but saw no combat. In February 1943, US Sixth Army decided that the battalion was obsolete, and removed the unit's 800 mules, as well as its commander, who was transferred to the 1st Cavalry Division. The battalion's new commander was Lieutenant Colonel Henry A. Mucci. The mules and some of the artillerymen and mule skinners were transferred to the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) in Burma,\nMucci had led a training camp in Hawaii which used Ranger training techniques. He announced that the battalion was being converted from field artillery to Rangers, and downsized from 1,000 men to only 500. Some of the artillery officers were transferred out and replaced by infantry and engineer officers.\nThe task of conversion and training took over a year, but by July 1944 it was completed. The battalion was transferred to Finschhafen, New Guinea, where it was reorganized as a Ranger battalion and redesignated as the 6th Ranger Battalion.\nThe 6th Rangers were to lead the invasion of the Philippines. The battalion left Finschhafen for Leyte in the Philippines on 10 October 1944. It was to secure the islands of Dinagat, Homonhon and Suluan, located in the entrance to the Leyte Gulf. These islands had the potential to disrupt Sixth Army's landing operations if they remained in Japanese hands. After initial delays due to bad weather, the operation went ahead on 18 October, and was a success. The 6th Rangers on Dinagat raised the first American flag on Philippine soil as part of General Douglas MacArthur's 'Return to the Philippines'.\nAfter the success of this mission, the invasion of Leyte got underway on 20 October 1944. The 6th Rangers were moved to Tacloban on Leyte, where they were mostly used for patrolling actions. Late in the year, the order came through for the battalion to prepare to take part in the landings in Lingayen Gulf, which were to form the invasion of Luzon. On 1 January 1945, the Rangers were transported by sea from Tacloban to Lingayen Gulf, and were landed on Lingayen Gulf Beach on 10 January 1945. Elements of the battalion were sent to Santiago Island to secure the entrance to the Gulf and prevent the enemy outflanking the landing area.\nSixth Army Intelligence indicated that the Japanese were holding a large number of American POWs in Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila. An incident at a camp on Palawan led intelligence to believe that the POWs would be executed as the Imperial Japanese Army retreated. General Walter Krueger, Sixth Army commander, ordered 6th Rangers to \"bring the prisoners out alive\".\nC Company, under Capt. Robert Prince, reinforced with a platoon from F Company and accompanied by Lt. Col. Mucci, was to undertake the mission. Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas accompanied the 6th Ranger force, and provided reconnaissance and flank protection. The attack went ahead at dusk on 30 January. During the battle, the Rangers rescued 511 POWs and killed or wounded 523 enemy troops. Two Rangers were killed and two prisoners died during the evacuation, and 21 Filipino guerrillas were wounded. Both Mucci and Prince received the Distinguished Service Cross, all other officers involved in the raid the Silver Star and all enlisted men the Bronze Star. The operation is still considered one of the most successful rescue operations in US military history.\nAfter the raid\nFor the remainder of the Luzon campaign, the 6th Rangers performed a variety of small-scale missions, including long-range reconnaissance patrols, mopping up bypassed pockets of Japanese resistance, and serving as a headquarters guard for the Sixth Army. On 23 June, they seized an airfield near the town of Aparri to prepare for the arrival of Task Force Gypsy, comprising 11th Airborne Division paratroopers and glider troops. The Rangers then pushed south and linked up with the 37th Infantry Division, concluding their last major operation of the war.\nAfter the war, the 6th Ranger Battalion was sent to Japan for occupation duties. The battalion was deactivated on 30 December 1945, and its members sent home or assigned to other units.\n- \"U.S. Army Rangers History & Heritage\". U.S. Army.

{"question":"What are the productivity benefits of Smart Lists in iOS reminders, and what privacy concerns should users be aware of when using tracking apps?","answer":"Smart Lists in iOS 15's Reminders app enhance productivity by allowing users to customize and filter reminders based on location, date, time, priority, and flags. Users can create lists for specific scenarios like tasks due on certain dates, shared with others, or high-priority items. However, when using tracking apps, there are significant privacy concerns to consider. The data collected is not protected under HIPAA regulations, making it vulnerable to being shared with or sold to third parties like data brokers or law enforcement. Additionally, personal information could be intercepted through Bluetooth connections, and default social and location settings may need to be adjusted to ensure proper privacy protection.","context":["Apple is soon going to release the next iteration of its mobile operating system ‚Äì iOS 15 that‚Äôs bringing refinements to Notifications, Weather, Safari, Find My, Spotlight, Photos, and FaceTime. One of the native apps that are getting some new features is the stock Reminders app as it now gets the ability to create ‚ÄúSmart Lists‚Äù so that you can group reminders inside different categories. In this post, we‚Äôll explain what Smart Lists inside Reminders are all about and how you may use them on iOS 15.\nWhat are Smart Lists?\nThe Reminders app on iOS already lets you divide your actions like work, bills, chores, and more into different lists or groups. With Smart Lists, users can customize these lists to show up based on a specific condition that you‚Äôve set for your reminders. You can choose to add conditions based on location, date, time, priority, and flag so that you‚Äôre only shown those reminders that you need to fulfill when you are required to.\nPrior to this, Apple allows users to categorize their reminders into pre-defined lists ‚Äì Today, Scheduled, All, Flagged, and Assigned to me.\nSmart Lists thus lets you prioritize your reminders based on your present conditions and you can customize it to show reminders for when you‚Äôre at home, for when the weekend comes, for a particular period of a day, or for when you‚Äôve selected a priority or flag filter. Each of these filters will offer even more customizability and you can assign multiple conditions to group your reminders into.\nTo give you an example, you can create smart lists to add reminders and tasks that are:\n- Due on a certain date/time like next month, tomorrow\n- Completed on a certain date/time like last week, two months ago\n- Shared with others you know\n- Postponed several times in the past\n- Contain specific words and tags\n- Set the highest in terms of priority\n- Estimated to be complete within an hour, day, or so on\nYou can customize your lists by combining two or more of the aforementioned conditions for greater control over how to view them.\nThe new Smart Lists feature is basically an extension of Tags that are new on iOS 15. Although Tags have existed inside task-management apps over the years, this is the first time Apple has incorporated them in one of their apps. Tags allow you to manage your reminders and tasks with user-defined tags across all Apple devices.\nWhen you create tags, they‚Äôll appear inside the ‚ÄòAll Tags‚Äô tab under ‚ÄòTags‚Äô along with all the other tags you‚Äôve created in the app. You can also view the newly created tags under the ‚ÄòMy Lists‚Äô section inside Reminders. This is where Smart Lists comes in as the Tags you create can be directly turned into a Smart List. Users can create a Smart List that has been customized with conditions based on tags, location, date, time, priority, and flag.\nHow to Get Smart Lists on iOS\nSmart Lists is an option available on iOS 15, which is currently in beta. If you‚Äôve enrolled in the iOS beta program, you can use the new feature inside Reminders directly or you can wait till Apple releases the stable build of iOS 15 for everyone worldwide.\nEven if you‚Äôre running iOS 15, the Smart Lists option won‚Äôt be enabled inside your iPhone by default. Instead, you‚Äôd need to enable it inside iOS by first opening the Reminders app and then tapping on the ‚ÄòUpgrade‚Äô button adjacent to the ‚ÄòMy Lists‚Äô section.\nOn the next screen, tap on the ‚ÄòUpgrade Now‚Äô button to enable Smart Lists for your Reminders app.\nHow to Create Smart Lists in the Reminders app\nCreating Smart Lists on Reminders isn‚Äôt as hard as you think it may be. To do that, open the Reminders app on your iPhone and tap on the ‚ÄòAdd List‚Äô option from the bottom right corner of the screen.\nA ‚ÄòNew List‚Äô screen would pop up from the bottom. On this screen, enter the name of the list you want to create and select the color you want to assign to this particular list.\nOnce that‚Äôs done, tap on the ‚ÄòMake into Smart List‚Äô option under the list‚Äôs name.\nYou‚Äôll now see the ‚ÄòFilters‚Äô screen pop up.\nHere, select the filters and tags you wish to add to your list and customize it however you want. A detailed guide on which filters to select and how to customize them is provided in the section below this.\nOnce you‚Äôve customized filters for your Smart List, tap on the ‚ÄòDone‚Äô option at the top right corner.\nNext, you can complete creating the Smart List by tapping on the ‚ÄòDone‚Äô option again on the next screen.\nOnce you do that, your new Smart List will be created and will appear at the bottom of your existing Reminders list.\nWhat are the Filters you can Apply inside Smart Lists\nWhen you select the ‚ÄòMake into Smart List‚Äô option during the creation of a Smart List, you‚Äôll be presented with 5 different options to manually curate your list based on different scenarios. These include:\nYou can set date-based filters for your Smart Lists by choosing the ‚ÄòDate‚Äô option when the ‚ÄòFilters‚Äô screen appears.\nWhen you select ‚ÄòDate‚Äô, you‚Äôll get to choose any of these options ‚Äì Off, Any, Specified Range, and Relative Range. Choosing ‚ÄòAny‚Äô will show a list of reminders you‚Äôve set with an assigned date.\nWhen you select ‚ÄòSpecified Range‚Äô, you get to choose the Start Date and End Date for the reminders to show up in this list.\nSelecting ‚ÄòRelative Range‚Äô will let you set a roundabout period for the tasks to show up. You can configure it to show upcoming or previous tasks that are set to happen or have happened in a few hours, days, weeks, months, or years.\nWhen you select the ‚ÄòTime‚Äô parameter, you can choose from among the following options ‚Äì Any, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.\nThis way, Apple will find tasks that were set to be accomplished during a general period of time of a day. Assigning lists based on a part of the day provides you with tasks at hand that you can break down across different periods.\nYou can categorize tasks based on the location you‚Äôre at so that you can see only those tasks that have been assigned to your specific location. You can set different locations for tasks like when at home, work, in your car, or someplace else.\nSelecting this option, let you filter your tasks based on whether or not they‚Äôve been flagged by you. Flags can be used to set items at the highest of priorities so that they‚Äôre not lost under other tasks.\nIf you don‚Äôt like to flag stuff but you‚Äôre instead into categorizing tasks into different levels of priority, then you can sort through your reminders into High, Medium, Low, or Any.\nHow to Add Reminders to a Smart List\nOnce you‚Äôve created a Smart List inside Reminders, you can add reminders to it. There are two ways to do that ‚Äì one by creating a new reminder for a Smart List and the other by moving an existing reminder from one list to your new Smart List.\nCreating New Reminders for a List\nTo create a new Reminder for your Smart List, open the Reminders app on your iPhone and select the Smart List you have created.\nOn the next screen, tap on the ‚ÄòNew Reminder‚Äô option at the bottom left corner of the screen.\nA new reminder will now appear as a pointer inside the Smart List. You can add details to it by tapping on the ‚Äòi‚Äô icon on the right side of the new reminder.\nInside the Details screen, enter the required details for your reminder inside Title, Notes, URL (optional), Date, time, repeat, tags, location, flag, priority, and other info.\nTo make sure the new reminder is added directly to your Smart List, tap on the ‚ÄòList‚Äô option inside the Details screen.\nNext, select the Smart List you want to add the reminder to.\nTo confirm the process, tap on the ‚ÄòDone‚Äô option at the top right corner.\nYour new reminder will be created and will be visible inside your Smart List.\nMoving Existing Reminders to Smart List\nIf you have created a reminder previously but want to move it to your new Smart List, you can do that by opening the Reminders app and tapping on ‚ÄòAll‚Äô to see all of your reminders or selecting one from the pre-defined list or My Lists.\nOn the next screen, tap on the 3-dots button at the top right corner.\nWhen a menu appears under this button, select the ‚ÄòSelect Reminders‚Äô option.\nNow, select the reminders you wish to move from your screen. Once you‚Äôve selected the necessary reminders, tap on the Folder icon at the bottom.\nYou should now see a ‚ÄòSelect a List‚Äô screen pop up from the bottom. On this screen, tap on the Smart List you want to move the reminders.\nAfter you select your preferred Smart List, tap on the ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô button at the top right corner of the screen.\nThe selected reminders will now be added to your Smart List and you can view it when you open the list inside Reminders. You can repeat these steps for when you need to add more reminders to your Smart List in the future.\nHow to Re-arrange Smart Lists inside Reminders\nSmart Lists are there to show you tasks based on different factors you have assigned for them. If you‚Äôve got a bunch of Smart Lists inside Reminders, you may want to select which of these lists appear at the top when you open the Reminders app by rearranging it the way you prefer.\nTo rearrange Smart Lists, open the Reminders app. Here, tap and hold on the list that you want to move to the top of the ‚ÄòMy Lists‚Äô section and drag it to the top.\nYou can repeat this for other reminders you want to rearrange and place them wherever you deem them right.\nHow to Manage a Smart List\nOnce you have created a Smart List for your reminders, it‚Äôs easy to use and manage it within the Reminders app.\nRename a list/ Change its icon\nTo rename a list or change its icon, open the Reminders app and tap and hold on the Smart List you want to modify.\nWhen an overflow menu appears, select the ‚ÄòShow Smart List Info‚Äô option.\nAlternatively, you can also access this option by first opening the Smart List, tapping on the 3-dots button at the top right corner, and selecting the ‚ÄòShow Smart List Info‚Äô option.\nHere, tap on the current name of the Smart List inside the ‚ÄòSmart List Info‚Äô screen and then type a new name that you want to set for the list.\nTo change the List icon, scroll down on this ‚ÄòSmart List Info‚Äô screen and select the icon you wish to apply for the Smart List, and select from one of the colors available at the top to finalize your List icon.\nOnce all changes have been made, tap on ‚ÄòDone‚Äô at the top right corner.\nSort through a Smart List\nIf you‚Äôre finding it hard to locate tasks from within your Smart List, the Reminders app lets you view them in different sorting options. To change the sorting order of a Smart List, open the reminders app and tap on the 3-dots button at the top right corner.\nIn the menu that appears, select ‚ÄòSort By‚Äô.\nYou should now see the ‚ÄòSort By‚Äô option expand to another menu. From here, you can choose any of the following options ‚Äì Manual, Deadline, Creation Date, Priority, and Title.\nYou can also choose whether you want the arrangement to be sorted in ascending or descending manner based on the sorting you select.\nShow completed tasks in a list\nThe Reminders app lets you mark tasks as completed in an easy way by simply tapping on the circle on the left-hand side of any reminder you create. By default, when you open a list inside the app, you shall only be able to see only those reminders that are yet to be completed. If you wish to see tasks that you have completed within a Smart List, first open the Reminders app and select the Smart List.\nWhen the list loads up, tap on the 3-dots button at the top right corner.\nIn the menu that appears, tap on the ‚ÄòShow Completed‚Äô option to see tasks that you have completed in this Smart List.\nPrint a Smart List\nLike any list on Reminders, you can print your Smart List by tapping on the 3-dots button inside a Smart List and then selecting the ‚ÄòPrint‚Äô option.\nOn the next screen, you can modify your print options and then tap on the ‚ÄòPrint‚Äô button at the top right corner to print your Smart List.\nDelete a Smart List\nIf you no longer wish to access a Smart List or if you‚Äôve accomplished all the tasks within a Smart list, you can choose to delete it at any time. For this, open the Reminders app and tap, and hold on the Smart List you want to remove.\nWhen an overflow menu appears, tap on the ‚ÄòDelete Smart List‚Äô option.\nYou may need to confirm the deletion process by tapping the ‚ÄòDelete‚Äô button in the prompt that appears on the screen.\nAlternatively, you can also remove a Smart List after opening it, then going to the 3-dots button > Delete Smart List.\nOnce a Smart list has been deleted, you will no longer see it appear inside the Reminders app. However, the tasks that you had created previously will continue to appear in their original lists or inside the ‚ÄòAll‚Äô section.\nThat‚Äôs all you need to know about using Smart Lists inside Reminders on iOS.","- Fitness trackers and apps from companies including Google, Apple, Garmin and Strava offer a convenient way to stay on top of health and wellness, monitoring body metrics like sleep quality and heart rate.\n- But even the biggest brands focused on security and reputation can be hacked or share personal data in other unintended ways with serious, sometimes devastating, consequences.\n- Data collected by a fitness app is not protected like health information under the law, making social and location settings, and login credentials, critical for a user to set properly before making these devices part of their daily life.\nFitness trackers, which help keep tabs on sleep quality, heart rate and other biological metrics, are a popular way to help Americans improve their health and well-being.\nThere are many types of trackers on the market, including those from well-known brands such as Apple, Fitbit, Garmin and Oura. While these devices are growing in popularity ‚Äî and have legitimate uses ‚Äî consumers don't always understand the extent to which their information could be available to or intercepted by third parties. This is especially important because people can't simply change their DNA sequencing or heart rhythms as they could a credit card or bank account number.\n\"Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, you can't get it back,\" said Steve Grobman, senior vice president and chief technology officer of computer security company McAfee.\nThe holiday season is a popular time to purchase consumer health devices. Here's what you should know about the security risks tied to fitness trackers and personal health data.\nStick to a name brand, even though they are hacked\nFitness devices can be expensive, even without taking inflation into account, but don't be tempted to skimp on security to save a few dollars. While a less-known company may offer more bells and whistles at a better price, a well-established provider that is breached is more likely to care about its reputation and do things to help consumers, said Kevin Roundy, senior technical director at cybersecurity company Gen Digital.\nTo be sure, data compromise issues, from criminal hacks to unintended sharing of sensitive user information, can ‚Äî and have ‚Äî hit well-known players, including Fitbit, which Google bought in 2021, and Strava. But even so, security professionals say it's better to buy from a reputable manufacturer that knows how to design secure devices and has a reputation to upkeep.\n\"A smaller company might just go bankrupt,\" Roundy said.\nFitness app data is not protected like health information\nThere can be other concerns beyond having a person's sensitive information exposed in a data breach. For example, fitness trackers generally connect to a user's phone via Bluetooth, leaving personal data susceptible to hacking.\nWhat's more, the information that fitness trackers collect isn't considered \"health information\" under the federal HIPAA standard or state laws like California's Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. This means that personally revealing data can potentially be used in ways a consumer might never expect. For instance, the personal information could be shared with or sold to third parties such as data brokers or law enforcement, said Emory Roane, policy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer privacy, advocacy and education organization.\nSome fitness trackers may use consumers' health and wellness data to derive revenue from ads, so if that's a concern, you'll want to make sure there's a way to opt out. Review the provider's terms of service to understand the its policies before you buy the fitness tracker, Roundy said.\nDefault social, location settings may need to be changed\nA fitness tracker's default settings may not offer the most stringent security controls. To boost protection, look at what settings can be adjusted, such as those related to social networking, location and other sharable information, said Dan Demeter, security researcher at cybersecurity provider Kaspersky Lab.\nDepending on the state, consumers can also opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information to third parties, and in some cases, these rights are being expanded, according to Roane.\nCertainly, device users should be careful about what they post publicly about their location and activities, or what they allow to become public by default. This data could be searchable online and used by bad actors. Even if they aren't acting maliciously, third parties such as insurers and employers could get access to this type of public information.\n\"Users expect their data to be their data and use it how they want it to be used,\" Roane said, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\"It's not only about present data, but also about past data,\" Demeter said. For instance, a bad actor could see all the times the person goes running ‚Äî what days and hours ‚Äî and where, and use it to their advantage.\nThere are also a number of digital scams where criminals can use information about your location to make an opportunity seem more plausible. They can claim things like, \"I know you lost your wallet at so and so place, which lends credibility to the scammer's story,\" Grobman said.\nLocation data can prove problematic in other ways as well. Roane offers the example of a women seeking reproductive health care in a state where abortion is illegal. A fitness tracker with geolocation services enabled could collect information that could be subpoenaed by law enforcement or be purchased by data brokers and sold to law enforcement, he said.\nUse strong password, two-factor authentication, and never share credentials\nBe sure to secure your account by using a strong password that you don't use with another account and enabling two-factor authentication for the associated app. And don't share credentials. That's never a good idea, but it can have especially devastating consequences in certain circumstances. For example, a domestic violence victim could be tracked by her abuser, assuming he had access to her account credentials, Roane said.\nAlso be sure to keep the device and the app up-to-date with security fixes.\nWhile nothing is foolproof, the goal is to be as secure as possible. \"If somebody tries to profit from our personal information, we just make their lives harder so it's not that easy to hack us,\" Demeter said."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:45cf37b8-c5b4-47d4-94dc-e066bd40fb04>","<urn:uuid:760aa365-b7f3-4b99-94d6-4a27433898e1>"],"error":null}

Could you tell me what's the connection between the Phillie Phanatic mascot and Jim Henson's legacy?","answer":"The Phillie Phanatic mascot was created by Harrison/Erickson, the same company that created Miss Piggy. Bonnie Erickson, who was originally a costume designer for Jim Henson's productions including The Frog Prince in 1970, went on to create various characters like Miss Piggy and Statler and Waldorf. After establishing her independent design company Harrison/Erickson, she designed the Phillie Phanatic, which revolutionized mascots by transforming them from simple cheerleaders to full-fledged entertainers in the late '70s.","context":["Historical information provided by The Jim Henson Company Archivist:\nBonnie Erickson, a long-time collaborator on Henson, Sesame Street, and Muppet projects, is Executive Director of The Jim Henson Legacy. Through her independent design company, Harrison/Erickson, she created the Philly Phanatic and numerous characters for national sports teams, commercials, and television. Recently, she shared her reminiscences with us:\nI joined Jim as a free-lance costume designer for The Frog Prince in 1970 after working Off and On Broadway for several years. A friend mentioned that Jim Henson was looking for a costume designer for a TV special. I knew his work. I loved his zany humor and the abstract characters he performed on The Tonight Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. I didn‚Äôt believe they were serious but I called and actually spoke to Jim on the phone and made an appointment to show him my portfolio.\nAt the time I was also experimenting with my own work in what I called soft engineering. I was creating realistic muslin life sized human figures and costuming them in period dress. I believe it was that work and the all-plastic opera costumes for Dido and Aeneas that piqued his interest and led him to hire me for the job‚Ä¶and incredibly good luck!\nJim cleverly gave me a place to work at the brilliant and mischievous Donald Sahlin‚Äôs worktable, the beginning of a wonderful and entertaining friendship. Don also became a mentor, sharing tricks and techniques as I went from designing costumes to creating patterned foam puppets like The Muppet Musicians of Bremen and then experimenting with carved foam characters like the Country Trio, Miss Piggy and Statler and Waldorf. At the same time I was learning about business from Jim.\nMy original plan was to have my own design studio, but the appeal of working with Jim and the talented people he had gathered around him was impossible to resist. His projects were exciting and satisfying, I was learning so much and it was just so much fun. But once we completed that first year of The Muppet Show I felt I could leave. I loved the show and London, but the series was established and already a big success; I wanted my son to return to school in the states; and it was time for me to establish a business.\nWhen I told Jim I was leaving he said, ‚ÄúWell, I know this is what you need to do. And we‚Äôre not going to lose touch.‚Äù Luckily, we never did. Jim became one of our first clients, hiring me for productions like Fraggle Rock, Bunny Picnic, Christmas Toy and to consult on licensed product for Sesame Street where I was a Creative Director for fourteen years. After Jim‚Äôs death, I became a trustee of The Jim Henson Legacy, established by Jane Henson and colleagues in order to inspire others with the contributions he made to the worlds of film, television, puppetry and media technology. As you can see, I never went too far away.","The game may be baseball but it's the lacrosse helmet that makes Tom Burgoyne a hit. Feathery, furry, and securely strapped on his head, the helmet lets Mr. Burgoyne ‚Äì the inner self of the Philadelphia Phillie Phanatic ‚Äì move.\nWhile many big-league sports mascots are prisoners of static heads and frozen smiles, this one can do the double take. He can dodge and weave, bump and roll, swipe a shirt from a player and ‚Äì like an overexcited Labrador retriever ‚Äì dash it around the stadium and bestow it on a pretty girl, all the while feigning surprise at his own daring.\nCreated 30 years ago to bring more kids to the park, and later boosted to JumboTron dimensions, the Phanatic was recently crowned top sports mascot by Forbes.com. Along with the San Diego Chicken, Forbes said, the Phanatic \"pretty much revolutionized the role of the mascot ‚Äì from cheerleader to full-fledged entertainer ‚Äì at ball games in the late '70s, influencing the many that have followed.\" The award was the result of a Davie-Brown Index study assessing the brand recognition of the mascot's ilk.\nA championship mascot undergoes his own version of spring training at this time of year, says Burgoyne, in his dressing room under Citizens Bank Park. The greatest challenge is to keep the character current. So these days, he surfs the Web and combs YouTube, trolling for that perfect new tune or strut, that great dance troupe to bring into the stadium. He quizzes his sons ‚Äì ages 12, 10, and 5 ‚Äì at the dinner table about the latest schoolyard favorites: Who sings that? What are the words? How does that move go? He wants to work a little hip-hop, maybe, into an act that's largely pop, classic rock, and Motown.\nThough there are baseball purists who find the antics unbecoming the game, (indeed, former Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda admits having \"body slammed\" an early Phanatic incarnation to the turf), most of what the Phanatic does is familiar and beloved stuff. A cross between Daffy Duck and Charlie Chaplin, he spit-shines the bald pate of an embarrassed fan. He accidentally spills a lady's popcorn and then, when it's replaced, spills it again. He razzes visiting players, mimicking their characteristic stances, ever ready to tease the error-prone or the egotistical.\nVisiting teams often sit on their dugout step to watch the ribbing. \"I get the feeling they like coming to Philadelphia because of the Phanatic,\" Burgoyne says. When he's through with the players, he'll kidnap a choir member. Or her microphone. \"There are a lot of ways you can wreak havoc on the field before the game,\" he chuckles, as if he only watched the hijinks instead of perpetrating them.\nThe Phanatic is always sizing up the park, searching out his foil ‚Äì an overly lively dance partner who can be pulled atop the dugout after the seventh inning, for instance, or a loudmouth who's telling him to sit down. \"That's a person who wants to be in the act,\" Burgoyne observes. So the Phanatic will plop down next to him, or on him, maybe pull his shirt over the guy's face, or otherwise get in his space. Similarly, \"I can sense a vibe\" when someone wants to be left alone.\n\"You try to respond to what's given to you,\" he says, and then the fun begins. Will the umpire stand, stoic, while he gets belly-bumped? Will he walk away? Will the old-timer coach ignore the green creature circling him, or do a little dance in acknowledgment?\nThe Phanatic was designed by Harrison/Erickson (creators of Miss Piggy) when management noticed the San Diego Chicken and wanted something of its own. It's a rare species of bird said to have come to Philadelphia from the Galapagos Islands, a bird with the personality of an 8-year-old child who constantly gets into trouble but whom everyone loves because of his big heart. In search of an entertainer, not just window-dressing, the Phils allowed the creature wide creative berth. While some clubs bar their mascots from the field or dugout, the Phils don't. While some are expected to \"brief\" umpires in advance, Burgoyne isn't. The one requirement is that the humor be in good taste.\nThe role that he has played since 1993, now \"fits like a glove,\" says Burgoyne, who was his high school mascot. He told the school paper at the time, jokingly, that what he wanted to be in 10 years was the Phillie Phanatic. Who knew?\nAfter graduation from Drexel University in 1988, and eight months in the business world, he saw a blind ad \"mascot wanted,\" and responded on a lark. At the audition, dancing in the 35-pound green fur suit, the belly distended by Hula Hoop-like hoops, he recalls \"gasping for air, thinking 'this is terrible.' \" The rest is history.\nSince joining the team in 1989 as a backup to Dave Raymond, who originated the Phanatic role, he's donned the costume an estimated 5,000 times, for 81 home games a year and outside appearances. He's ready for anything, on-field and off, thanks to a large closet stuffed with costumes and props. Need a mini piano? Got it. An oversized barbell? A tuxedo? King Tut's headdress? No problem. And he boasts the only bathtub in Citizens Bank Park, a suggestion of his wife, who'd pulled her share of green fur from the drains at home.\nBurgoyne is as talkative as his Phanatic is mute ‚Äì an affable, full-time Phillies employee, team player, company man, and booster, who brushes off suggestions that the good-hearted-but-devilish character could ever cause trouble for management with those who don't share his sense of fun. He, as much as anyone, is smitten with this marketing concept made good.\nAs the baseball season opens ‚Äì with time off rare, and sweltering 14-day home stands observed through the green mesh neck of his closest friend, his only air conditioning the occasional ice pack strapped to his chest ‚Äì he laughs in anticipation. In his mind's eye he's already the great big kid who will kiss the pretty girls and goose the big shots.\n\"I feel like I'm reliving my childhood.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1f8fcc74-02eb-4e99-b96a-a377bb56aa87>","<urn:uuid:6e994b9f-9c4b-444c-bea5-5136841bbabd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What happens at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit with polyolefin materials in heat shrink vs Santoprene?","answer":"At approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius), heat shrink tubing made from polyolefin contracts and permanently shrinks to seal what it is covering. In contrast, Santoprene rubber, despite also containing polyolefin, maintains its form at this temperature and can continue functioning normally, as it has a much higher temperature tolerance up to 300¬∞F (149¬∞C).","context":["Heat Shrink: Use And Care\nIn order to protect the environment, wires or cables are encased or covered when using high temperature heat sink tubing. You may also call them ‚Äúheat shrink sleeves‚Äù if you choose. As many people believe, the process of heat shrinking isn‚Äôt difficult. In this case, you‚Äôll need one. Insert your wire, then warm the sleeve to get it ready for insulation. In the market, there are several shrinks as well.\nIn this post, we‚Äôll talk about how to use heat shrinks, what to keep in mind while heating them up, and the many kinds that are available.\nWhat Does Heat Shrink Tubing Mean?\nThis may be compared to a rubber sleeve that contracts when exposed to heat, most notably when heated to a temperature of roughly 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius), which is considered the heat shrink temperature. In an effort to permanently seal what it is covering, it immediately shrinks and stays smaller.\nWhy the Use of High Temperature Heat Shrink Tubing is Important\nHeat shrink tubing features some benefits. Let‚Äôs consider them:\n- Wire protection is adequate against risks like as abrasion and low impacts.\n- Insulation, both electrical and thermal.\n- Creates a defense system against pollutants such as water, dust, oil, acids, and water.\n- Complex networks bundle cables to keep them neatly arranged.\n- Boosts strength to avoid cables and wires from being put under stress.\nWhat materials and temperatures are needed for heat shrink tubes?\nFor any heat-shrinking tube, polyolefin is the most typical material. This polyolefin is a very resilient substance with a high temperature heat shrink threshold that is beneficial in applications requiring a high heat shrink temperature for functioning, such as in industrial, mechanical, and manufacturing environments. Railway, aircraft, electronics, and the military are among the industries that typically employ polyolefin.\nThere are several advantages of polyolefin material :\n- Quick shrinking\n- Great durability\n- High flexibility\nThis heat shrink tube has a temperature range of around 100 degrees Celsius, although it can tolerate temperatures of about 135 degrees Celsius.\nPolyvinyl chloride is the material used to make shrinks. It can tolerate temperatures of roughly 105 Celsius. The shrink is available in several colors and ranges in price from 10% to 50% cheaper than Polyolefin shrink. In addition to this, they have improved abrasion resistance and strength.\nFEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) Heat Shrink Tube\nFluorinated ethylene propylene is used to make the shrink tubes. This is quite strong and has the capacity to endure any significant strain. The heat shrink temperature of the tube is also around 180 degrees Celsius, although it can endure extremely steady temperatures between 200 and 205 degrees Celsius.\nPVDF Heat Shrink Tube\nDue to its excellent resistance to impact, cold flow, and abrasion, this type of heat shrink tube is well recognized. It is translucent and has a 175 degree Celsius minimum heat shrink tube temperature.\nElastomeric Heat Shrink Tube\nElastomers are used to construct the heat shrink tube. This class of polymers exhibits both elasticity and viscosity (elastoviscosity). This material has a 2:1 shrink ratio and can handle high heat shrink tube temperatures of about 150 degrees Celsius.\nIn conclusion, a heat shrink tube is crucial if you want to have excellent protection for cables and wires. Additionally, before you decide to purchase one, make sure you verify its major characteristics again. In addition to this, there are several heat shrink tunes that you need to take into account.

Call 1-844-Rubber-4\nFree Shipping on Orders Over $1000, Call 1.714.772.3000\nSantoprene rubber is mixture of vulcanized EPDM rubber and polypropylene. It is a fantastic choice of synthetic rubber material to use for any application that sees a high working temperature range. This thermoplastic rubber is ideal for use in various automotive and electrical projects thanks to its ability to operate in temperatures reaching up to 300¬∞ F. It is safe for outdoor use thanks to its resistance to ozone and UV rays. The Santoprene elastomer is also very durable and flexible, with a mid-level durometer rating of 55-65. This particular type of Santoprene sheet rubber comes with a unique block surface design.\nBlock-Patterned Surface Texture: The distinguishing feature about this Santoprene rubber sheet is its surface texture. Unlike the standard smooth surface texture of most other elastomers, this sheet of thermoplastic rubber is manufactured with a block surface pattern. All across its body are tiny blocks. These mainly serve an aesthetic function for application where appearances are important. However, they do provide for a better level of grip so as to reduce the chances of it slipping out of place.\nEPDM Benefits: This thermoplastic rubber is made partly from fully vulcanized EPDM rubber. The EPDM elastomer is known for being a good rubber material to use in outdoor settings. As a result, its outdoor weathering resistance traits are passed on to Santoprene rubber. A Santoprene sheet can operate comfortably in the outdoors because it features superior longevity in the face of UV rays and ozone. Outdoor elements like UV rays can damage other elastomers by causing cracks to form on their surfaces, but that is not the case with the Santoprene elastomer.\nExcellent Temperature Range: Silicone often tends to be the first rubber that comes to mind when people are looking for a high-temp elastomer. However, Santoprene rubber should also be considered. This synthetic rubber material has an excellent working temperature range. It can endure temperatures that go as low as -74¬∞ F and can equally function in conditions that reach as high as 300¬∞ F. This excellent feature allows the rubber to be used in various temperature intensive applications in the automotive, electrical, and industrial fields.\nSlow burn rate\nLow compression and tension set\nStocked in popular thickness gauges\nAlso available with a smooth surface texture\nStandard rolls of Santoprene sheet available in 24‚Äù and 36‚Äù width options and lengths of up to 50ft\nContinuous Temperature Range: -50¬∞ F to 275¬∞ F\nIntermittent Temperature Range: -74¬∞ F to 300¬∞ F\nThanks to its polyolefin base, Santoprene elastomer is recyclable despite being a synthetic rubber material\nSantoprene thermoplastic rubber is a family of high-performance elastomers which combine the performance characteristics of vulcanized rubber, such as flexibility and low compression set, with the processing ease of thermoplastics.

{"question":"As a healthcare technology consultant, I'm interested in understanding how digital transformation initiatives and AI technologies are converging to improve remote service delivery.","answer":"Digital transformation investments are growing at a compound annual rate of 16.5% (2022-2024), with organizations focusing on innovation, resilience, and improved service delivery. A key aspect is enhancing digital employee experience, with 87% of C-level executives agreeing that it fosters innovation. In the healthcare sector, specifically in behavioral telehealth, AI-based algorithms are being developed to analyze video and audio in real-time, helping clinicians overcome the limitations of videoconferencing. These tools measure patient-caregiver engagement by monitoring speech patterns, facial expressions, and gaze, addressing the challenges mental health professionals face in virtual care delivery. This integration of digital transformation and AI technology is particularly relevant as telehealth is expected to continue growing due to its convenience and potential cost benefits.","context":["Steps organizations can take to foster a digital mindset and drive workplace innovation that prioritizes end users\nDigital transformation is not just about technology. A successful digital strategy also requires a change in corporate culture, with all stakeholders embracing innovation and new ways of doing business. By focusing on end-user experience, organizations can ensure they make the most of their technology spending and foster the right mindset to drive change.\nIn response to the Covid-19 pandemic, companies have significantly increased their digital investments. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in his 2021 shareholder letter, ‚ÄúDigital transformation that was projected to happen over the next 10 years is happening today.‚Äù\nLockdown restrictions that interrupted in-person services and caused a major shift to remote forms of work forced organizations to rethink their modus operandi, modernizing their IT infrastructure, products, and services. But these digitalization trends are poised to continue post-pandemic, with direct digital transformation investments expected to grow to a compound annual growth rate of 16.5% in 2022-2024, based on an IDC forecast.\n‚ÄúIn 2022 more than half the global economy will be based on or influenced by digital,‚Äù according to the report.\nDigital Workplace Transformation Is Here to Stay\nOrganizations undergo digital workplace transformation for many reasons. Among the top rationales for those initiatives, Deloitte Digital Transformation Executive Survey 2021 listed:\n1. Enabling innovation\n2. Keeping up with the times\n3. Responding to changes in their industry\n4. Becoming more resilient\nAs organizations find themselves in different stages of their digital maturity, they face unique challenges, too. Their digital projects, after all, don‚Äôt look the same. Digital transformation examples include:\n- IT infrastructure modernization for more efficiency and security\n- Digitalization of services to better attend to customer needs and demands\n- Operational scalability through initiatives such as VDI migration\n- Business processes improvements with digital workflows to better meet key performance indicators (KPIs)\nWhile organizations in the early stages of their digital maturity might be interested in quick wins, such as cost control, more digitally mature companies might work toward truly transforming their culture.\nFocus on 2022: Driving a Year of Workplace Transformation\nHaving a Digital Mindset Is Key\nDeloitte‚Äôs research suggests that organizations with higher digital maturity tend to show a ‚Äúdigital mindset‚Äù and an inclination toward innovation. Key to this behavior is ‚Äúto look at old problems with new eyes and to ask how data and technology can be applied to reinvent products and processes.‚Äù\nThe takeaway is that a successful digital transformation strategy requires a deep understanding of how end-user experience helps organizations meet their business goals. In other words, a digital transformation project won‚Äôt succeed without garnering employee support.\nEnhanced Digital Experience Accelerates Innovation\nIf digital transformation starts with people, then digital experiences should be the cornerstone of your business strategy. According to Lakeside Software research on digital employee experience (DEX), all sides of the business agree on the importance of enhancing digital experience to support digital workplaces. Improvements in digital experience are needed in order to foster innovation, based on:\n- 87% of surveyed C-level executives\n- 93% of surveyed staff\n- 90% of surveyed IT professionals\nInvesting in digital employee experience helps organizations overcome some common obstacles to digital transformation projects, such as a culture adverse to change and a workforce that‚Äôs not tech-savvy. By setting experience level agreements (XLAs), for example, the support desk team can help minimize IT issues and boost productivity and engagement. According to Lakeside‚Äôs The Future of Digital Workplaces report, workers believe they would be about 18% more productive with the right digital experience.\nInside the Watermelon\nHow XLAs Deliver a Full Measure of Digital Employee Experience\nHow to Build Digital Transformation Projects that Emphasize End-User Technology Experience\nOrganizations won‚Äôt transform simply by investing in digital technology. You need the right talent, culture, processes, and IT visibility in your work environment.\nHolistic visibility into the IT estate enables organizations to plan their digital initiatives and understand software and hardware usage. These are critical steps to maximize the return on investment (ROI) on technology purchases. For example, rolling out new software is not enough if the employees are not using it.\nDon‚Äôt forget that digital tools can be intimidating. That‚Äôs why IT needs to track the way employees interact with workplace technology and what type of hurdles they encounter along the way. Being able to address their pain points proactively helps to boost productivity and engagement, leading to better digital business outcomes.\nIn order to incorporate end-user experience as part of your digital transformation agenda, consider the following steps:\nCollect telemetry data from the endpoint\nBy gathering rich data from telemetry metrics, IT teams can monitor digital experience in real time and anticipate issues before they escalate. Historical data enables IT to perform effective root cause analysis, leading to a quicker incident resolution.\nUse surveys to evaluate user sentiment\nOrganizations can use qualitative surveys to understand how users feel about digital workplace initiatives, including new deployments and service desk operations. Those insights are an opportunity to evaluate desktop transformation projects, for example.\nMonitor application and hardware usage\nUnderstanding workplace technology usage enables data-driven procurement decisions about hardware upgrades and software licenses, leading to better IT investments. For example, organizations can upgrade hardware based on employees‚Äô needs rather than the age of the machine or traditional three- to five-year refresh cycles.\nInvest in employee training and upskilling\nCompanies should make training and upskilling an integral part of their digital transformation agenda. As a PwC survey indicates, workers are willing to spend 12 hours per month on training to revamp their digital skills. Technology proficiency can also empower teams to perform their tasks more efficiently, boosting employee satisfaction and productivity.\nMake digital dexterity a priority\nDigital dexterity can help organizations accelerate their digital transformation agenda, as those competencies refer not only to the ability to use technology but also to the willingness to do so. In other words, digital dexterity involves the right mindset and openness to digital innovation.\nSupercharge Your Digital Strategy\nDiscover how a holistic view of your IT estate ensures the successful implementation of your digital transformation initiatives.

For mental health clinicians‚Äîwho are trained to assess social and emotional well-being, reactions to medications and other important factors through observation and interaction‚Äîthe drawbacks of videoconferencing can be more than just awkwardness.\nA new research project is seeking to break down that electronic divide with artificial intelligence-based tools, bringing together computer scientists from the University of Maryland, College Park and behavioral health clinical experts from the University of Maryland School of Medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. It was funded this fall by a COVID-inspired seed grant from the MPowering the State initiative, which harnesses the joint research power of both institutions.\nThe collaboration began to take shape during the spring when the pandemic started shutting down businesses shuttering people in their homes. It quickly became clear that behavioral health providers needed to find better ways to engage patients and clients who used to come to their offices, but whom they now encountered exclusively online during a time when half or more of U.S. respondents to polls indicated their mental health had declined.\n‚ÄúWe switched overnight from in-person to telehealth care for a lot of our patients; the profession had to adapt without training, because there was no time,‚Äù said Gloria Reeves M.D., a psychiatrist and associate professor at the medical school. ‚ÄúThe ability to assess nonverbal cues, how they are responding and interacting‚ÄîI lose a lot of that through virtual care.‚Äù\nAniket Bera, an assistant research professor in the Department of Computer Science and the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), meanwhile, had been working on ways to gauge emotions and behavioral traits with artificial intelligence and computer vision systems that monitor speech patterns, facial expressions or where a subject‚Äôs gaze wanders\nWhen the two began to talk, it became clear they could combine their expertise to seek ways to improve mental telehealth services. The project, which is focuses on rural child behavioral telehealth delivery, is aimed first at finding an effective way to measure caregiver-patient engagement‚Äîa necessity for successful outcomes.\nWith the MPower funding, Bera and his team are building an artificial intelligence-based algorithm to analyze video and audio in real time to measure engagement by sorting through a complex set of measures that are much harder for mental health professionals to pick up through videoconferencing, which lacks true eye contact, and creates a kind of tunnel vision that prevents the caregiver from understanding how a patient is reacting to their environment, or seeing most of their bodily movements. But creating technology to do this is far from simple, he said.\n‚ÄúYour eyes tell one story, your face tells a different story, your speech tells a different story. Which is more important?‚Äù Bera said. ‚ÄúHow do we automatically figure out what to pay attention to so we can measure the level of engagement?‚Äù\nBera and Reeves hope to use the seed funding to build the foundation for a larger project that will move on to measure other factors‚Äîpsychiatric symptoms, reactions to medicine and more‚Äîand create a broadly useful tool clinicians can use to help their patients, and which could have other uses as well.\nEven if the pandemic ends within several months, telehealth is likely to continue to grow, Reeves said; among other things, patients like the convenience and it could lower costs.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we know yet what the new normal is, but I don‚Äôt think we should assume it will be exactly what it was,‚Äù she said.\nMaryland Today is produced by the Office of Marketing and Communications for the University of Maryland community on weekdays during the academic year, except for university holidays.\nFaculty, staff and students receive the daily Maryland Today e-newsletter.

{"question":"As a safety inspector, I need to understand protection methods. What are main differences between how short circuits affect AC versus DC systems, and what protection methods are used for each?","answer":"In AC systems, short circuits can affect power supply of an entire area, but are protected by multiple levels of fuses and overload protection circuits from power station to house. In DC systems, particularly with batteries, short circuits cause overheating and rapid discharge, potentially leading to explosion in extreme cases. For AC installations, protection focuses on selective isolation using cascaded protective devices (fuses, circuit breakers) to limit fault to smallest possible area while maintaining continuity in unaffected parts. For DC systems, particularly in micro-control circuits, protection methods include transistor-based circuits that can shunt current or cut off power supply connection when short circuit occurs. Both systems utilize fuses or circuit breakers that cut off power under high current conditions, though specific implementation varies by system type.","context":["From the point of view of the operational safety and reliability of an entire low-voltage installation, it is usually desirable to specifically isolate the part of a system affected by a short-circuit in order to prevent spreading of the fault.\nSelectivity is intended to ensure that the protective shutdown is as close as possible to the location of the fault so that unaffected installation components can continue to operate normally.\nIEC 61439 standard ‚Äì The new standard for low-voltage switchgear and controlgear ASSEMBLIES ‚Äì Applies to enclosures for which the rated voltage is under 1000 V AC or 1500 V DC.\nThis is often also desired for safety reasons and in IEC 60439-1 (low-voltage switchgear assemblies) addressed for installations that require a high level of continuity in current supply.\nIn buildings and industrial plants, radial distribution networks are the norm. In radial distribution systems there are several protective devices in series, usually with decreasing rated currents from the supply end to the load end.\nWhile the operational currents decrease from the supply end to the load end, in the event of a short-circuit the same fault current will flow through all the protective devices connected in series.\nBy a cascading of the trip characteristics it must be ensured that only the respective protective device that is closest to the location of the fault is activated and hence the fault is selectively limited to the smallest possible part of the installation. We saw in one of the previous technical article Simplify Downstream Installation with Cascading ‚Äì that cascading actually makes protection system cheaper by simplifying the downstream installation (e.g. circuit breakers).\nSpecial attention should be paid to the area of high overcurrents, where the effects of current limitation and breaking times are significant. Thus an upstream fuse does not operate if the entire I2t of the downstream protective device (fuse, circuit breaker) is smaller than the melting I2t the fuse. An upstream circuit breaker on the other hand does not operate if the maximum cut-off current ID of the downstream protective device is smaller than the activation value of its magnetic release.\nIn individual cases, reference to manufacture documents and frequently the technical support of the manufacturer is required for the correct selection of devices. The basic facts are presented below.\nSelectivity between fuses connected in series\nFuses connected in series act selectively if their time current-characteristic curves have sufficient mutual spacing and their tolerance bands do not touch (Figure 1).\nAt high short-circuit currents the melting I2t value of the upstream fuse must be larger than the breaking I2t value (melting and clearing time) of the smaller downstream fuse. This is usually the case if their rated currents differ by a factor of 1.6 or more.\nSelectivity of circuit breakers connected in series\nIn distribution networks, the rated currents of the switches decrease constantly from the transformer to the load. As the short-circuit releases normally operate at a multiple of the rated current, their release levels decrease in the same way with distance from the supply.\nAs the prospective short-circuit currents also become smaller with increasing distance from the supply point due to line damping, a so-called natural selectivity can be created via the current magnitude.\nThis means that the maximum short-circuit current with a short-circuit on the load-side of the switch 2 (Figure 2) is below the trip value of the magnetic release of switch 1.\nThe short-circuit currents must be known at the installation sites of the switches. Selectivity is usually not assured with short-circuit currents above the response value of the magnetic release of the upstream circuit breaker.\nb = Overload release\ns = Short-circuit release\nWhen assessing the current selectivity the tolerance of the short-circuit trigger (+/-20 % in accordance with IEC 60947-2) should be taken into account.\nIf current selectivity between circuit breakers is not possible, selectivity must be achieved by cascading of the trip times, i.e. the upstream circuit breaker operates with a short delay to give the downstream circuit breaker time to clear the short-circuit.\nIf the short-circuit occurs between the two switches, then it will continue during the short trip delay time of the switch 1 and after lapse of this time it will be switched off by the latter (Figure 3).\nb = Overload release\ns = Short-circuit release (switch 1 with short-time delay; utilization category B)\nThe cascading of trip times requires that Switch 1 is capable of carrying the short-circuit current during the trip delay time. This is the case when using circuit breakers of utilization category B.\nThe critical variable is the rated short-time current Icw that determines the magnitude of the permissible short-time current during a defined period. It is usually stated as the 1s ‚Äì current and can be converted for other times with I2t = const.\nSelectivity between fuse and downstream circuit breaker\n1 = Circuit breaker\n2 = Fuse\nIn the overload range selectivity is given, if the trip characteristic of the overload release lies under the characteristic curve of the fuse (considering the tolerance band). In the short-circuit range selectivity is given to the extent that the total breaking time (including clearing time) of the circuit breaker is below the melting characteristic of the fuse.\nSelectivity between a circuit breaker and downstream fuse\n1 = Circuit breaker\n2 = Fuse\nSelectivity in the tripping range of the short-circuit release of the circuit breaker is given when the cut-off current of the fuse is smaller than its trip value.\nSelectivity and undervoltage\nIn a short-circuit the supply voltage breaks down at the short-circuit location. The size of the residual voltage depends on the impedance of the fault. If an electric arc is produced, the voltage is appr. 30 V to 70 V.\nAll connected electrical consumers are affected by the voltage drop and the closer they are to the fault location the greater is this effect. Devices such as contactors or undervoltage releases of circuit breakers may trip depending on the amount and duration of the voltage drop.\nIn order to guarantee operational continuity, suitable off-delays or remaking equipment should be provided. When short-circuits are broken by current limiting circuit breakers, voltage break-downs are so short that no disruptions should be expected.\nResource: Allen Bradley ‚Äì Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear","A short circuit is a circuit or a portion of a circuit that is shorted. If the two ends of the load and power supply are connected by wires, it is called a short circuit. It occurs in both AC and DC circuits. If it is in AC, short circuit will affect the power supply of an entire area, but there are many levels of fuses and overload protection circuits from the power supply station to the house. If it is a DC source like a battery, a short circuit will overheat the battery and the battery will discharge faster. In some extreme cases the battery can even explode. There are multiple circuits to avoid short circuits, and there are also many fuses to protect against overload. (see what is fuse)\nIn this example, we will design and learn a simple low-voltage DC short-circuit protection circuit. The purpose of this circuit is to make the micro-control circuit run more safely and protect it from the influence of other parts of the circuit.\nSK100B PNP Transistor\nBC547B NPN Transistor\nShort circuit protection circuit\nThe most common short circuit is that the positive and negative pins of the battery are connected by a low-resistance conductor, such as a wire. In this case, the battery may catch fire or even explode. Many cell phone battery fires often happen this way.\nTo avoid short circuit, we need to add short circuit protection circuit. The short circuit protection circuit will shunt part of the current or cut off the connection between the circuit and the power supply.\nSometimes power outages or sparks occur when we use faulty appliances such as ovens and irons. This is because the current is too high somewhere in the circuit, which may cause leakage or fire. To avoid such losses, we often use fuses or circuit breakers. In the event of a short circuit, the fuse or circuit breaker will cut off the house power. Fuse circuit breaker circuit is also a kind of short circuit protection circuit, in which the low-resistance wire will fuse under high current, thereby cutting off power supply.\nHow the short circuit protection circuit works\nThe above short-circuit protection circuit consists of two transistor circuits, one is the circuit of the BC547 NPN transistor, and the other is the circuit of the SK100B PNP transistor. The power input is a 5V DC power supply, which can be implemented with either a battery or a transformer.\nThe working principle of the circuit is very simple. When the green LED D1 is on, it means that the circuit works normally and there is no risk of damage. When the red LED D2 lights up, it means that a short circuit has occurred.\nWhen the power is turned on, the transistor Q1 is biased on and the LED D1 lights up. There is no short circuit during this time, so the red LED D2 is turned off.\nThe lighting of the green LED D1 also means that the power supply voltage is almost equal to the output voltage.\nIn the simulation circuit, we use a switch on the output to create a \"short circuit\". When a short circuit occurs, the output voltage drops to 0V and the Q1 base voltage is 0V so it is no longer on. The collector voltage of the transistor Q2 also drops to 0V and no longer conducts.\nSo now the current starts to travel along the short-circuit path (through the switch) and flows through the red LED D2 to ground. At the same time, D2 starts to conduct because of forward bias, the LED lights up to indicate a short circuit, and the current is diverted to D2 instead of damaging the entire circuit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12770ce0-bc3d-4ee6-b70f-83ca2a3eec4d>","<urn:uuid:e7d8beca-cf6e-4eb7-8038-139649d4ebc6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between wireless routers and file servers in managing network connections? ü§î","answer":"Wireless routers and file servers serve different primary functions in managing network connections. A file server is a computer with a shared hard disk that responds to requests from other computers and provides data storage for connected stations. In contrast, a wireless router's main function is to tap an internet connection from the modem via wire connection and create a wireless network to which all other devices connect, enabling internet distribution to multiple devices without cables.","context":["Multi-user Point of Sale and Multi-store POS Systems\nThis article will talk about multi-user point of sale systems ‚Äì defined as systems with more than one station. This could include a POS station at the front counter, and one in the back office for creating purchase orders, receiving merchandise and bookkeeping.\nPart 1: Multi-user Systems (Networking)\nIn a multi-user system, two or more computers are connected to exchange information and share common resources (data and peripherals, perhaps including printers or an Internet connection). This is also known as a network or LAN (local area network). Benefits of having a network include:\n- Shared storage of information gathered by each computer.\n- Shared access to all stored information..\n- Shared use printers or other devices.\n- Shared use of software, which is installed on the server and can be used by each station.\nA computer system for a retail or service business might include one or more stations at the front counter and one in the back office. With a networked system, the counter personnel can be ringing a sale while the back office personnel are printing reports, receiving merchandise, preparing mailing labels, and so on. The file server, which is the most critical of the machines in terms of security and dependability, can be located in the back office safely away from the hustle and bustle of the front counter. One of the networked computers will often be used as a file server or host.\nA multi-user POS system can require special networking software. This software directs the information from station to station. In addition, with most networks, each computer must have a network card. All stations may be linked together physically with some type of cable, or may be networked wirelessly.\nIf you decide that you would like a multi-user system (now or in the future), there are several things you will need to consider. First, the software you select must be able to support multi-user operations - some software is written to be used by only one person at a time. If you do not plan to use a multi-user system right away, just be sure that your software may be upgraded at a later date. Next, the network you select must be fast and efficient. As you add more users and data to the system, operations slow down. Before making a purchase, be sure to see just how quickly data is processed by seeing the system in use somewhere.\nA new approach to a multi-user point of sale system takes advantage of the Internet to link the stations. Each POS station has an Internet connection and runs the program. Data is combined on the servers of the company providing the software. A nice benefit of using Internet based software is that you can check your data in real time no matter where you are, if you have Internet or mobile access.\nA Typical Multi-user System\nA file server is a computer with a hard disk that is shared by two or more stations. It is called a ‚Äúserver‚Äù because it responds to the requests (serves) the other computers connected to it. For example, another computer may send it an item number and request the price of that item.\nPOS Stations are computers that are linked to the server. The stations use the file server for data storage. They can also have their own hard drives for additional data storage. On some networks, each station on the network may share its hard drive and printers with the other stations.\nThis term refers to bar code readers, printers, cash drawers, etc.\nNetworking software is special software that directs information between stations, peripherals, and the file server.\nIn wired networking, cables physically connect all stations with the server.\nNewer technology allows for wireless networking (without cables), where computers share information through radio and/or micro wave channels. Equipment for setting up a wireless network - for a live connection -includes network adapters (NICs), access points (APs), and routers.\nWiFi is most commonly used and is very effective. It also is capable of encryption to make the data more secure.\n- Next >>","For a home or office wireless network to function properly, it requires a variety of hardware components. Unless you are an IT expert, you may not be familiar with all of these components. The purpose of this write-up is to introduce you to the various hardware you need to create a wireless network. Here we go.\nLet‚Äôs Take a Look at the Hardware you Need for Wireless Networks\nWireless Network Adapters\nThe other names for the wireless network adapters include the wireless network cards or wireless NICs. They are required for older computers and laptops which do not incorporate wireless capabilities. If you have the newer smartphones, tablets, and laptops, you can be sure they already have wireless capability. For the older computers, buy add-on wireless adapters to be connected either via USB or PCMCIA. This will enable these computers to automatically connect to your wireless network.\nWithout a wireless router, there would probably be no network. Just line cable routers, these devices are the first to receive internet signals and then transmit to devices such as computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cameras, and so on.\nCurrently, the recommended wireless router standard is the 802.11ac, which allows for smooth online video streaming and responsive gaming. Even though a little slower, older routers are still up to the task. The good thing with an AC router is its incomparably fast speed. They can provide fast internet by more than 12 times the 802.11n routers.\nIf you want a router that‚Äôs capable of handling multiple devices, buy the AC router. Picture the many devices in your home. Most likely, you have desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, streaming boxes, smart TVs, smart speakers, smart cameras, and so on. You need a router with the capability to supply internet to all of your devices without breaking down.\nThe work of a wireless router is to tap an internet connection from the modem by a wire connection. It then creates a wireless network to which all of the other devices connect. It is, therefore, an integral part of your wireless network.\nWireless Access Points\nThe purpose of access points is to connect wireless networks to existing wired networks. If your home or office already has a wired router, you will need to have an access point. As such, you won‚Äôt need to replace your router with a wireless one.\nThe work of access points is to connect devices to a wireless network without the need for cables. With a wireless network, the number of devices can increase almost infinitely. What the access point does is to amplify the network. The wired router is the one providing the bandwidth while the access point only extends it to support a number of devices. It also extends the range of the network so that the devices can connect to it from further off.\nIn addition to amplifying and extending the network, an access point supplies key information on all the devices connected to the network. It also secures the network and ensures hackers don‚Äôt get easy access. When buying an access point, consider the standard on which it operates. Depending on the standard, access points can deliver varied bandwidth on varying frequencies. The number of channels supported also greatly differ.\nEven with the best routers and access points, your Wi-Fi signal may not reach as far as you would hope. That‚Äôs why you need a dedicated wireless antenna. Its purpose is to increase the range of the wireless radio signal. For the modern routers, the antennas are in-built. However, on older equipment, they are removable, since they are optional. Whatever the case, you can mount add-on antennas on the existing equipment to widen the range of the Wi-Fi signal. If you are building a home wireless network for your home, you may not require a wireless antenna. For a large office complex, the antenna is necessary to enable internet access from all locations.\nThe work of a wireless repeater is to extend the strength and reach of the network by connecting to an access point or router. A wireless repeater may also be referred to as a range expander or signal booster. It is basically a two-way station for relaying radio signals to connect equipment to the network. It makes it easier for far-off devices to also access the internet. If you have a large home with rooms that aren‚Äôt receiving the Wi-Fi signal, you definitely need a wireless expander.\nClearly, there are different kinds of hardware required to build a wireless network. For these hardware components to work properly, the right software must be installed. Also, you need an internet connection from a broadband provider. When you have all the necessary ingredients, there is just no reason you cannot have a home or office wireless network."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0926aa12-73a0-491f-ae1c-cb9f857a9dea>","<urn:uuid:b836f70f-dad9-4c22-8887-301b3b95fddb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How long must you wait before drinking stone tank wine from Lumi√®re Winery?","answer":"After the three-week fermentation process in the stone tank, the wine must age for approximately two years before it becomes available for purchase at the winery shop. This is evidenced by the fact that in 2018, visitors had to purchase the 2016 vintage while waiting for the new wine to age.","context":["On Sunday, September 16th, 2018, my daughter and I participated in a traditional winemaking event at Lumi√©re Winery in Fuefuki City, Yamanashi. The event culminated in an extremely rare ishigura (stone tank) winemaking experience. The event occurs only once each year at Lumi√®re Winery. The granite tank, which is 117 years old, is the only stone fermentation tank still in use in Japan. The following is an account of the experience.\nBefore the event could begin, a traditional Shinto blessing was performed in front of the stone tank. I do not intend to make light of the proceedings, but the head priest immediately reminded me of Yoda from the Star Wars saga. The way he shuffled to the alter in his priestly garb was identical to the way Yoda moved.\nThe attendees of the event then walked about 300 hundred metres to a nearby pergola (trellised) vineyard where we learned about the art of winemaking. Due to the high amount of rainfall, which can cause rot, pergola-style vineyards account for 95% of the vineyards in Yamanashi. Only recently have vineyards been planted using the guyot (vertical shoot positioning) method.\nWe then proceeded to pick the grapes, Muscat Bailey A, to make the traditional stone-tank wine.\nApparently, we picked enough grapes to make more than 8000 litres of wine! If you look closely enough at the crate in the back of the vehicle, you will see my last name („Ç®„É™„Çπ) written on a blue sheet of paper. Japanese katakana script does not allow for true English pronunciation, so my last name becomes ‚ÄúErisu‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúEllis‚Äù.\nWe then returned to the fermentation and storage facility to hear more about the winemaking process. Immediately behind the speaker you can see 500-litre barrels of wine. Many of the barrels contained wine that was still fermenting, so the air was heavy with the unmistakable sweet smell of wine.\nNext, we all went upstairs to begin the process of destemming and pumping the grapes into the stone tank. Here I am pouring my lot into the destemmer.\nOnce everyone had poured in their grapes, the tank was filled to about 80% of its total capacity. At this stage of the process, the stems were added on top of the grapes in order to make the taste as authentic as possible to the wine that was produced here over a century ago. In the past, there was no destemming machine, so everything was dumped into the tank as is. Now, even though they have a destemmer, they still insist on adding the stems at the end to keep true to the original recipe.\nHere is one of the employees adding the stems on top of the grapes.\nFinally, bamboo sheets were spread over the grapes and wooden poles were used to apply constant pressure on the grapes. After three weeks of natural fermentation, they should have their stone-tank wine!\nFor those of us who couldn‚Äôt wait three weeks, the employees made fresh-pressed grape juice. Yummy!\nIf everything goes according to plan, 2018‚Äôs wine should be available at the winery shop in a couple years. As I am completely impatient, I had to make do with their 2016 vintage.\nCopyright ¬© David Ellis | All Rights Reserved"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:03a9ce7a-cba8-4c6d-b931-676143049b0d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"In democratic nations, what is the relationship between institutional censorship and the handling of controversial speech like Holocaust denial?","answer":"Democratic nations typically have less institutionalized censorship and promote freedom of speech, which affects how they handle controversial speech like Holocaust denial. In the United States, this manifests in the lack of legal prosecution of Holocaust deniers and protection under the First Amendment. However, this doesn't mean complete freedom from consequences, as shown in cases like Mel Mermelstein's successful civil suit against Holocaust deniers. The contrast between democratic principles and the need to address harmful speech is particularly evident in how different democratic nations handle Holocaust denial - while European democracies have enacted specific laws against it, the US maintains broader free speech protections, demonstrating how democratic nations can take different approaches to balancing free expression with other societal concerns.","context":["- This article is about limits to free speech in publication and discussion. For other uses, see Disambiguation.\nCensorship is the systematic use of group power to broadly control freedom of speech and expression, largely in regard to secretive matters. Sanitization (cleaning or decontamination) and whitewashing (from whitewash) are almost interchangeable terms that refer to particular acts or campaigns of censorship or omission which seek to \"clean up\" the portrayal of particular issues and facts which are already known, but which may conflict with a presented point of view.\nIn a modern sense, censorship consists of any attempt to suppress information, points of view, or method of expression such as art, or profanity. Censorship is commonly used by social groups, organized religions, corporations and governments. There are also groups which specifically oppose censorship.\nTable of contents\nTypes of censorship\nCensorship can be explicit, as in laws passed to prevent information from being published or propagated (as in Australia, China, or Saudi Arabia where certain Internet pages are not permitted entry), or it can be implicit, taking the form of intimidation by government or even by popular censure, where people are afraid to express or support certain opinions for fear of losing their lives, or their jobs, position in society, or, in academia, their academic credibility. In this latter form it is similar to McCarthyism. These two forms (explicit and implicit) can be generalized to represent laws and government authority (explicit) and social forces or social persuasion (implicit).\nState Secrets and controversial history\nWartime censorship is carried out with the intention of preventing the release of information that might be advantageous to the enemy. Typically it involves obfuscation of times or locations, or delaying the release of information (e.g. the objective of an operation) until it is of no possible use to enemy forces. Mention of weapons and equipment (especially if newly introduced) is another favourite area for censorship. The moral issues here are somewhat different as release of the information carries a high risk of increased casualties among one's own forces and possibly loss of the overall conflict.\nA well-known example of sanitization policies comes from the USSR under Stalin, where publicly used photographs were often altered to remove people whom Stalin had ordered executed. Though past photographs may have been remembered or kept, this deliberate and systematic alteration of history in the public mind is seen as one of the central themes of Stalinism and totalitarianism. Hitler was considered a pioneer in creating propaganda material, all of which was, by definition, sanitized for the improvement of the Nazi image. Censorship is a form of sanitization. Specifically, censorship refers to a socially accepted policy of eliminating material rejected as harmful.\nThe content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, as their target audience is young people, and the term \"whitewashing\" is the one commonly used to refer to selective removal of critical or damaging evidence or comment. The reporting of military atrocities in history is extremely controversial, as in the case of Nanjing Massacre, the Holocaust (or Holocaust denial), and the Winter Soldier Investigation, regarding the Vietnam War. Also, the theory of evolution has been questioned by many since it contradicts the beliefs of their religion and some textbooks were even requested to include disclaimers at the beginning of the book about it.\nIn each society the representation of its own flaws or misconduct is typically downplayed in favor of a nationalist or patriotic view. In the context of high-school level education, the presentation of facts and history greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion, and socialization. The legitimate argument for censoring the type of information shown is based on the inappropriateness of such material for certain younger age groups. The use of the \"inappropriate\" distinction is controversial, as well, as it can be used to enforce wider politically-motivated censorship.\n\"Censorship\" comes from the ancient Roman word \"censor\". The first reference to the term \"whitewash\" dates back to 1762 by a Boston Evening Post article. In 1800 the word was first used in a political context, when a Philadelphia Aurora editorial said that \"if you do not whitewash President Adams speedily, the Democrats, like swarms of flies, will bespatter him all over, and make you both as speckled as a dirty wall, and as black as the devil.\"\nThe term \"sanitization\" is a euphemism commonly used in the political context of propaganda to refer to the doctoring of information that might otherwise be perceived as incriminating, self-contradictory, controversial, or damaging.\nCensorship, unlike acts or policies of sanitization, refers to a publicly set standard, not a privately set (or government-enforced but unannounced) standard. Censorship does not attempt to cover up material made by an organization, but rather to restrict or abolish defined types of material produced by private citizens.\nCensorship is regarded as a typical feature of dictatorships and other authoritarian political systems. Democratic nations usually have far less institutionalized censorship, and instead promote the importance of freedom of speech.\nSome thinkers understand censorship to include other attempts to suppress points of view or ideas such as negative propaganda, media manipulation, spin, disinformation or \"free speech zones\". These methods, collectively, tend to work by disseminating misleading information or by preventing other ideas from obtaining a receptive audience.\nOthers point out the suppression of access to the means of dissemination of ideas by governmental bodies such as the FCC in the United States of America, the CRTC in Canada, or a newspaper that refuses to run commentary the publisher disagrees with, or a lecture hall that refuses to rent itself out to a particular speaker, or an individual refusing to finance that lecture.\nPrevention and bypassing\nData havens and decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing systems such as Freenet can be used to prevent censorship. A recent phenomenon for avoiding censorship and speaking directly to members of society is culture jamming, where individuals or non-conforming groups use large-scale corporate techniques to attack implicit domination and censorship through trivial or deliberately irrelevant messages. More traditionally, mass protests are a method for resisting unwanted impositions.\nInterestingly, the censorship of swear-words in the United States seems not always to extend to non-American pronunciations. Instead of shit, the Scots and Northern English variant shite may apparently be used, as may fook for fuck. (Note: this was witnessed on broadcast television in early 2004, before the FCC levied several highly-publicized fines.)\nCensorship around the world\n- Censorship in Australia\n- Censorship in Egypt\n- Censorship in France\n- Censorship in Germany\n- Censorship in Iraq\n- Censorship in Malaysia\n- Censorship in the Republic of Ireland\n- Censorship in Singapore\n- Censorship in Taiwan\n- Censorship in the Russian Empire\n- Censorship in the United Kingdom\n- Censorship in the United States\n- Censorship in Tuva\n- Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China\nOther types of censorship\n- Biblical censorship\n- Censorship by organized religion\n- Censorship in cyberspace\n- Censorship under communist regimes\n- Censorship under fascist regimes\n- Government censorship\nCensorship of media\n- Al Menconi\n- Bleep censor\n- Book burning\n- the Censored Eleven (banned Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons)\n- Cindy's Torment\n- Entertainment Software Rating Board\n- Fahrenheit 451\n- Index Librorum Prohibitorum of The Roman Catholic Church\n- International Freedom of Expression eXchange\n- Joe Lieberman\n- John Stuart Mill\n- Lady Chatterley's Lover\n- Media controversy\n- MPAA rating system\n- Prior restraint\n- Pro-censorship lobbying\n- Production Code\n- Project Censored\n- Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy\n- Thomas Bowdler\n- TV Parental Guidelines\n- Video game controversy\n- Volkz.Net Against Censorship T-shirt (Not for profit organization)\n- Censorship of Curriculum Materials\n- The Right To Read: Censorship in the School Library\n- Challenges to and Censorship of School Guidance Materials\n- 'Ten things wrong with the media effects model' article by Prof David Gauntlett\n- National Coalition Against Censorship\n- International Freedom of Expression eXchange\n- Olympic Watch (Committee for the 2008 Olympic Games in a Free and Democratic Country) on censorship in China\n- Abbott, Randy. \"A Critical Analysis of the Library-Related Literature Concerning Censorship in Public Libraries and Public School Libraries in the United States During the 1980s.\" Project for degree of Education Specialist, University of South Florida, December 1987.

In this photo, a \"selection\" of Hungarian Jews on the ramp at the death camp Auschwitz-II (Birkenau) in Poland during German occupation, May/June 1944. Jews were sent either to work or to the gas chamber. The photograph is part of the collection known as the Auschwitz Album. (Public domain via Wikimedia Commons)\nHolocaust deniers assert that the slaughter of European Jews by the Nazis during World War II never happened. Holocaust denial is strongest in countries with direct experience with the Nazi past (such as Germany, France, and Austria), but deniers are also active in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Although the earliest examples of denial began immediately after World War II, Holocaust deniers emerged as a cultural phenomenon in the late 1970s. The official response of the United States to Holocaust denial has been significantly different from that in other countries, primarily because the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment provides for freedom of expression.\nEurope has responded to Holocaust deniers with legal prosecution\nMost European countries have responded to denial with legal prosecutions. At first, the prosecutions took place under an odd assortment of laws banning defamation of the dead, the falsification of history, and group libel; later, the prosecutions took place under laws that made Holocaust denial itself a crime.\nCanadian trial became a debate over the Holocaust\nIn 1985 the Ontario government in Canada prosecuted Ernst Zundel for distributing a pamphlet entitled Did Six Million Really Die? ‚Äî a case that proved difficult for prosecutors. Zundel was tried under a law banning the knowing distribution of false news. Because the adversarial legal system derived from the British common law lets the defense make its own case, Zundel was able to present several witnesses who explained to the jury why his belief that the Holocaust never happened was sincere. The trial thus became a debate over the Holocaust itself. Although a jury twice found Zundel guilty, some media headlines conveyed the idea that the Holocaust was in doubt. Finally, in 1992 the Canadian Supreme Court held that the false news law was unconstitutional.\nThe United States has had no Holocaust denial prosecutions\nThere have been no prosecutions of Holocaust deniers in the United States, although Mel Mermelstein, a southern California businessman who was a Holocaust survivor, in 1980 sued the Institute for Historical Review for breach of contract, after the institute offered $50,000 for proof that any Jews were gassed at Auschwitz. He provided documents, but the institute had refused to pay him. After a state judge took judicial notice of the Holocaust as a fact beyond reasonable dispute, the case settled out of court in Mermelstein‚Äôs favor.\nHolocaust denial has been an issue on college campuses\nThe main controversy posed by Holocaust denial in the United States arose in the early 1990s, when Holocaust deniers sent ads denying the Holocaust to college newspapers. Although most papers rejected the ads, a large minority ran them ‚Äî including papers at the University of Michigan, Ohio State University, and Brandeis University. The students who ran the ads argued that the free expression clauses of the First Amendment compelled them to do so. Holocaust scholar Deborah Lipstadt accused the college newspapers of ignorance about both the Holocaust and the First Amendment. (The student newspapers at private universities had no obligation to run the ads, and the papers at state universities had to run them only if the school administration had direct oversight of the papers.)\nMany of the papers that ran the ads also ran editorials explaining the importance of the Holocaust and decrying the deniers. These editorials also explained why the editors believed the First Amendment required them to run the ads. If the students were legally mistaken, they were moved by First Amendment values.\nNorthwestern University continued to employ electrical engineering professor Arthur Butz after he continued to deny the Holocaust, but he was careful not to espouse such views in the classroom. In similar circumstances, Florida Atlantic University eventually expelled James Tracy, a Professor of Communications, after he denied that a mass shooting had taken place at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school in December 2012. However, it largely did so on the basis that he had missed a deadline that the university had issued to him in which he was supposed to indicate how he had distanced his views from the university.\nRobert O‚ÄôNeil has observed that private universities are not governmental actors and that some universities may give greater leeway for individuals to deny facts outside their own academic disciplines than within it (2017). He notes that President Trump tapped Myron Ebell to head the transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even though he was well known as a climate change denier, despite a consensus of scientific evidence to the contrary.Send Feedback on this article"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3474ecfe-908a-424f-a353-55cfc2593bc5>","<urn:uuid:02b0a7ce-fb82-4ee0-826c-111e50cbe3fe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey legal experts! What's the disconnect between constitutional protections and actual press freedom implementation in South Sudan and Zimbabwe? Need specifics!","answer":"While both countries have constitutional protections for press freedom, there are significant gaps in implementation. South Sudan's 2011 Revitalized National Transitional Constitution incorporates press freedom provisions, but in practice, journalists face constant threats, intimidation, and censorship. Similarly, Zimbabwe's 2013 Constitution includes a Bill of Rights with explicit provisions for citizens' right to access information, but the government has been criticized for attempting to amend the constitution to centralize power and for continuing to harass and arrest journalists, creating what the UN Special Rapporteur described as an environment of fear and persecution.","context":["(Juba/ May 3,2023) The South Sudan Human Rights Defenders Network (SSHRDN) joins Journalists and media practitioners to commemorate the globally recognized Press Freedom Day; a day when we celebrate the fundamental principles of press freedom and the crucial role that journalists play in promoting transparency, accountability, and democracy under the global theme : ‚ÄúShaping a future of freedom of expression & other #Humanrights in #SouthSudan‚Äú.\nIndividuals and institutions have the unfettered right to express themselves through the media without censorship or interference, it is also a fundamental right enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ‚Äúeveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.‚Äú\nWhile in South Sudan global provisions on press freedom have been domesticated in the 2011 Revitalized National Transitional Constitution, the press grapples with significant challenges such as the surveillance, confiscation of newspapers and the closure of radio stations. Journalists face harassment, intimidation, and violence, and many have been imprisoned for their reporting. All these hinder their ability to report on important issues which becomes a human right issue.\nAccording to the most recent World Press Freedom Index, South Sudan ranks 128 out of 180 countries, with a score of 47.06, indicating that Freedom of the press is extremely precarious in South Sudan, where journalists work under constant threat and intimidation, and where censorship is ever-present. With these challenges at hand, it is crucial to recognize the significant role that journalists play in holding those in power accountable and keeping the public informed. It is also the obligation of government to ensure the respect and protection of the right to freedom of expression and the press, as enshrined in the country‚Äôs constitution and international human rights law.\nOn this World Press Freedom Day, we therefore call on the government of the Republic of South Sudan to;\n- Ensure concrete steps to promote and protect press freedom through promoting a culture of transparency and openness including instructing security agencies to provide protection for journalists and media workers.\n- Establish mechanisms to monitor threats to journalists and to investigate and prosecute those who attack or harass them.\n- Respect and fully give the independent media regulatory body professional mandate as globally recognized of a similar body to ensure that the media operates in a professional and ethical manner, without undue interference or censorship; this will help to promote media diversity and accountability, and ensure that journalists are able to operate without fear of reprisal.\n- Ensure journalists have access to information and are able to report on issues of public interest. This can be done by enacting freedom of information laws and ensuring that government officials are accountable to the public.\n- Institute platforms of regular engagements with Journalists and media practitioners as Human Rights Defenders with government agencies.\n- Ensure journalists alleged to have committed offenses are subjected to due process inclusive of right to legal representation and fair hearing.\nOn this World freedom Day, let us remember that, press freedom is crucial for the protection of other human rights, such as the right to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. By reporting on issues related to these rights, the media can raise awareness and mobilize public support for policies and programs that promote social and economic justice which is beneficial to every citizen.\nyou can download the full statement here SSHRDN Press release on World press freedom day","Zimbabwe‚Äôs state of the media report for 2020 unveiled by MISA-Zimbabwe\nFebruary 28, 2021\nBy Wallace Mawire\nMISA Zimbabwe has published its annual state of the media report which takes a look at the media landscape and operating environment with regards to freedom of expression, access to information, digital rights and media freedom in 2020 in Zimbabwe.\nAccording to the report, the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), together with the Public Order and Security Act, enacted in 2002, were among some of the most repressive laws used to suppress media freedom and free speech in Zimbabwe.\nIt is reported that scores and scores of journalists were arrested under AIPPA while newspapers such as The Daily News and The Tribune were closed under this law which at that time was used as the weapon of choice against dissenting voices and media workers.\nIt however adds that with the coming into being of the 2013 Constitution with its highly acclaimed Bill of Rights and explicit provisions on citizens‚Äô right to access to information, it became increasingly clear that AIPPA was anathema to the enjoyment of the very same right it purported to protect.\nThe point was driven home under Section 62 of the 2013 Constitution (on access to information), that new legislation should be enacted to give effect to the enjoyment of that right, thus paving way for the repealing of AIPPA.\nIt is in that regard that the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in July 2020, as part of the unbundling of AIPPA, was welcomed as one of the progressive steps taken by the government of Zimbabwe towards the alignment of the country‚Äôs laws with the Constitution.\nDuring the year under review, and as the country forged ahead with the media policy and law reform processes, another significant milestone was the licensing of the country‚Äôs first-ever privately owned‚Äô television stations and community radio stations.\nHowever, these otherwise positive outcomes on the media reforms front were marred by the government‚Äôs seeming determination to amend the 2013 Constitution prior to the alignment of several laws that are not in sync with the country‚Äôs supreme law enacted in 2013.\nThis came in the wake of the conclusion of the public hearings on the Constitution Amendment No.2 Bill. The Bill gazetted on 17 January 2020, is made up of 27 sections that propose to amend no less than 30 sections of the Constitution.\nMISA-Zimbabwe says that the proposed amendments follow the first amendment to the 2013 Constitution which gave the President powers to unilaterally appoint the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice and Judge President of the High Court.\nThe tampering with the Constitution at a time when several laws which have an impact on the enjoyment of the rights enshrined in Zimbabwe‚Äôs Bill of Rights, is widely viewed as being aimed at centralising the President‚Äôs powers, which vitiates against the principle of separation of powers to allow for democratic checks and balances in the spirit of good governance and accountability.\nIt is reported that another dent that cast further aspersions on the government‚Äôs commitment to uphold and respect constitutionally guaranteed rights was the spike in the harassment, arrests and assaults of journalists, human rights activists and members of opposition political parties, despite promises by the post-2017 and post-2018 elections Zanu PF government, to break with the ills of the era of former President Robert Mugabe.\nFor instance, journalist Hopewell Chin‚Äôono was arrested twice during the course of the year on two separate charges and denied bail at the Magistrates Courts, in the process enduring long detention periods at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison. For each of the separate charges, Chi‚Äônono only managed to secure his freedom after being granted bail by the High Court.\nAccording to MISA-Zimbabwe,it is against these retrogressive developments, that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association, Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, noted in a report during the year under review, that Zimbabwe was suffering from political polarisation and poor governance.\nThe Special Rapporteur noted then, that civic space continued to deteriorate, re-establishing an environment of fear and persecution.\nNkemnji Global Tech\nPan African Visions | April 10, 2021 7:12 pm\nPan African Visions | April 10, 2021 3:26 pm\nPan African Visions | April 9, 2021 4:27 pm\nPan African Visions | April 8, 2021 8:43 pm\nFrench historian Duclert hands over the voluminous report on Genocide against the Tutsi to President Kagame\nApril 10, 2021 7:32 pm\nApril 10, 2021 7:12 pm\nApril 10, 2021 3:26 pm\nApril 9, 2021 4:27 pm\nApril 9, 2021 3:34 pm"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9c9a7e58-8bb7-4061-9aaa-375e55388e0a>","<urn:uuid:700b7577-b589-4dd3-addf-bc111be0c3a1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the preservation methods at La Brea Tar Pits compare to the preservation of the 48-million-year-old bird fossil from Messel?","answer":"The preservation methods differ significantly between the two sites. At La Brea Tar Pits, fossils are excavated from tar pits where over 3.5 million specimens have been preserved and are displayed in the museum. In contrast, the Messel locality preserves exceptional details including soft tissues, stomach contents, and even original color. The Messel site notably preserved a bird's preen gland containing original fat molecules, which is a rare discovery as usually only melanin is preserved in such fossils. The unique preservation at Messel allowed researchers to study the chemical composition of the fossil wax using mass spectrometry, revealing distinct fat molecules from the original preen oil.","context":["The following is a news piece from UCD that features my latest paper on fossil preen (uropygial) glands and associated lipids preserved in a 48-million-year-old Eocene bird. Links to other media coverage are feature below this news piece.\nResearchers have shown that a well-preserved preen gland in a 48-million-year-old bird fossil contains its original fat molecules.\nThe fossil is from the famous Messel locality in Germany, well known to preserve birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, insects and leaves with exceptional details, including stomach contents and original colour.\n‚ÄúAnimal soft tissue fossils are rare discoveries but, when found, provide exquisite insight into past biological diversity and fossil formation ‚Äì that is why Messel is so special‚Äù said Dr. Shane O‚ÄôReilly, UCD geochemist and lead author on the study.\nThe study came about after co-author Gerald Mayr ‚Äì an ornithologist from the Senckenberg Natural History Museum who has studied birdfossils from Messel for over two decades ‚Äì and the Messel field crew unearthed a bird fossil that appeared to contain intact preen glands.\nThe preen gland, also called the uropygial gland, is an important gland in modern birds that produces a waxy oil birds use for waterproofing and maintaining the health of their feathers.\nDr. Mayr and his colleague, Dr. Jakob Vinther ‚Äì a palaeobiologist from the University of Bristol and also co-author on the study ‚Äì had been waiting for such a find for a number of years.\n‚ÄúUsually, only melanin is preserved in these sorts of fossils; all the keratin and other proteins are lost‚Äù said Dr. Vinther.\n‚ÄúPreviously collected fossils have all been transferred to a plate of resin and covered in varnish, which would complicate any analysis of the organic composition of the glands‚Äù he added.\nJakob and Gerald quickly contacted Professor Roger Summons, a geochemist in MIT and global expert in studying molecular fossils in petroleum and sedimentary rocks, to look at chemical composition of the wax material.\n‚ÄúI was a postdoctoral researcher working with Roger and jumped at the opportunity to get involved‚Äù said Dr. O‚ÄôReilly.\n‚ÄúFor decades, organic geochemists have been studying molecular fossils in petroleum and sedimentary rocks and making important discoveries about the history of life on Earth. Surprisingly, we have paid relatively little attention to preservation of organic molecules in vertebrate bone fossils and soft tissues fossil‚Äù said Dr. O‚ÄôReilly.\nUsing a technique called mass spectrometry to look at the chemical composition of a tiny amount of the fossil wax, the geochemist found distinct fat, or lipid, molecules preserved within the gland that were very different to the surround sediment and other parts of the fossil.\n‚ÄúBy studying the fossils within the fossil, and picking out the molecules coming from the algae and plants that made up the sediment, we could clearly see that a portion of the original waxy molecules that make up preen oil were preserved in the fossil gland‚Äù said Dr. O‚ÄôReilly.\n‚ÄúFinding the intact preen glands and the fat molecules within them is a milestone in our understanding of fossil formation as it shows that fat molecules can preserve well and are important for preservation of certain animal soft tissues‚Äù he added.\nWhen asked about what next, Dr. O‚ÄôReilly said: ‚ÄúThis research raises exciting new questions and research directions. How far back in time can we find fossil preen glands? What other fat-rich animal tissues are preserved at the molecular level?

{"question":"I'm currently writing my thesis and need to know: What's the difference between Dr. Borlaug's approach to global food security and FAO's current agroecology initiative regarding their stance on traditional farming knowledge?","answer":"Dr. Borlaug's Green Revolution approach primarily emphasized scientific and technological advancement, focusing on developing high-yield crops and modern crop management techniques to increase food production. His work was largely based on transferring new technologies to farmers, particularly in countries like India and Pakistan, where yields increased from 10-11 bushels per acre to 75-85 bushels using new technology. In contrast, FAO's agroecology initiative explicitly emphasizes co-creation of knowledge, combining local, traditional, and indigenous knowledge with multi-disciplinary science. It is specifically described as a 'people-centered and knowledge-intensive approach' that focuses on smallholder and family farmers, seeking to transform food systems by incorporating both traditional wisdom and scientific innovation. While both approaches aim to address food security, they differ in their integration of traditional farming knowledge, with agroecology placing greater emphasis on incorporating indigenous and local farming practices alongside modern scientific methods.","context":["Special Guests: Dr. Norman Borlaug and Author Leon Hesser\nDr. Borlaug‚Äôs new biography, by Leon Hesser: The Man Who Fed the World\nPenn‚Äôs just about trembling.\nDr. Borlaug: The green revolution.

Agroecology contributes directly to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): the eradication of poverty (Goal 1) and hunger (Goal 2); ensuring quality education (4); achieving gender equality (5); increasing water-use efficiency (6); promoting decent jobs (8); ensuring sustainable consumption and production (12); building climate resilience (13); securing sustainable use of marine resources (14); and halting the loss of biodiversity (15) while significantly increasing the resilience of both people and the environment, mitigating climate change, and sustainably using and conserving natural resources and biodiversity. Moreover, agroecology can contribute to achieving the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.\nRooted in sustainability, agroecology is a people-centred and knowledge-intensive approach that matches the transformative approach called for by the 2030 Agenda. It has the potential to meeting the needs of future generations while ensuring that no one is left behind. Agroecology focuses on smallholder and family farmers, fisherfolk and pastoralists. It seeks to transform food and agriculture systems by addressing the root causes of problems and providing holistic and long-term solutions based on co-creation of knowledge, sharing and innovation, including the combination of local, traditional, indigenous and practical knowledge with multi-disciplinary science.\nThe future of agriculture is not input-intensive, but knowledge-intensive. We need the integrated approach that agroecology can offer.\nFAO Director-General Jos√© Graziano da Silva, April 2018\nWith the organisation of the 1st International Symposium on Agroecology for Food Security and Nutrition in September 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) commenced strengthening the global dialogue and laying the groundwork for enhanced co-operation. This was followed by regional seminars held from 2015 to 2017 in five regions (sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and the Near East and North Africa), involving 1,400 participants ‚Äì representatives of governments, researchers, civil society, the private sector and the UN system ‚Äì from 170 countries. Not only did these regional seminars reveal a diversity of perspectives, experiences and approaches, but they also identified commonalities between regions and across different approaches to agroecology ‚Äì including shared challenges, opportunities and objectives, as well as common characteristics of agroecological systems, practices and approaches. In April 2018, a 2nd International Symposium titled ‚ÄúScaling-up Agroecology to contribute to the SDGs‚Äù was held which brought together 700 participants, including representatives from 72 governments, 350 civil society organisations and representatives from six UN organisations. Participants analysed experiences, evidence and public policies to respond to the challenges faced by our agriculture and food systems (see Recommendations in Box) and confirmed the notion that it is time to upscale agroecology.\nCOMMON RECOMMENDATIONS ON AGROECOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS\n1. Strengthening the central role of producers and their organisations in safeguarding, utilising and accessing natural resources.\n2. Fostering experience and knowledge sharing, collaborative research and innovation.\n3. Promoting markets for agroecology-based products and services.\n4. Reviewing institutional policy, legal and financial frameworks to promote agroecological transition for sustainable food systems.\nIn preparation for the 2nd International Symposium, FAO‚Äôs work plan for 2018‚Äì2019 was analysed to present an overview of the organisation‚Äôs engagement in the field of agroecology and to expose gaps and opportunities for upscaling. The analysis revealed that eight per cent of FAO‚Äôs results planned for 2018‚Äì2019 support transitions to sustainable food and agriculture through agroecology. Two-thirds (64 %) of these results are to be delivered in 78 countries across all five geographic regions addressing food security, nutrition and health, access to markets for local production, family- and small-scale production, climate‚Äëresilient approaches, sustainable natural resource management and sustainable food systems and livelihoods. In addition, 22 per cent of the work is being planned at regional level and 23 per cent at global level. Of the eight per cent of FAO‚Äôs results, almost 80 per cent of the activities contribute to building enabling environments for more sustainable food systems. Most of the planned work feeds into more than one of the four transition levels defined by FAO in 2018 (see Box), with a focus on level 1 in combination with level 4. Single-level interventions contribute only to level 4.\nA ROADMAP TOWARDS AGROECOLOGY-BASED SUSTAINABLE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS\nBased on Stephen Gliessman‚Äôs five levels of food system change converting conventional agricultural production and food systems to agroecological food systems, the FAO defined four levels that can serve as a roadmap outlining a transformation process simultaneously achieving economic, environmental, social, nutritional, health and cultural objectives. Each level requires mechanisms in place to strengthen capacities, institutions, legal frameworks, policies and programmes that support transitional processes. The four levels describe a progressive path towards greater environmental, social and economic sustainability and can be implemented in any combination. The first two levels are at producer level. Levels 3 and 4 go beyond the producer level involving the broader food system and societal level. They require co-operation among producers within the same territory, which may require public support.\nIn addition, deriving from a comprehensive consultation process, ten elements were defined that may be used by national policy-makers and stakeholders in planning, managing and evaluating agroecological transitions (see Figure): diversity; synergies; efficiency; resilience; recycling; co-creation and sharing of knowledge (describing common characteristics of agroecological systems, foundational practices and innovation approaches); human and social values; culture and food traditions (context features) and responsible governance; circular and solidarity economy (enabling environment). These elements are interlinked and interdependent.\nOpportunities exist for further incorporating and upscaling agroecology through better integration of the agricultural sectors (crop and livestock production, forestry, aquaculture and fisheries) and transition towards sustainable food systems approaches in collaboration with partners particularly at country and regional levels. In addition to the work already contributing to agroecology, a significant part of FAO‚Äôs work over 2018‚Äì2019 could be shaped to upscale the area.\nIn order to join forces and engage partners, the ‚ÄúScaling up Agroecology Initiative‚Äù was launched together with UN agencies and other partner organisations during the 2nd International Symposium in April 2018.\nIn the transformative spirit of the 2030 Agenda, we will work with food producers, governments and other stakeholders to strengthen agroecology ‚Äì as a promising approach ‚Äì, harnessing a range of sustainable practices and policies, knowledge and alliances to achieve equitable and sustainable food systems in support of the SDGs.\nMission of the Scaling up Agroecology Initiative\nThe initiative is to focus on the following challenges, which were identified in the consultations:\nThe Scaling up Agroecology Initiative aims to accompany and support national agroecology transition processes through policy and technical capacity. To this end, it will build alliances among different stakeholders, strengthen networks and allow co-creation of knowledge and knowledge sharing. The Initiative is to focus its efforts on three areas of work: knowledge and innovation improving the evidence base on agroecology and ecosystem-based approaches; policy processes assisting countries in the development of policies for agroecology with the participation of non-state actors by harnessing existing international instruments and decisions of inter-governmental bodies, including the 2030 Agenda;\nbuilding connections for transformative change by working with governments, producers‚Äô organisations, consumers, civil society, research and the private sector, supporting networks and platforms for knowledge exchange and dialogue for these stakeholders at national, regional and international levels.\nWe are convinced that co-operation among partners and a wide range of actors and institutions is necessary to scale up agroecology in order to achieve the SDGs and invite interested stakeholders to engage in the Scaling up Agroecology Initiative. As a first step, FAO will develop with partners a detailed ten-year action plan to operationalise the Initiative.\nBeate Scherf is Programme Officer for FAO‚Äôs Strategic Programme 2 (Making agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable).

{"question":"What are the key defensive communication tactics in lacrosse that create a strong unit? ü•ç","answer":"The key defensive communication tactics in lacrosse include: calling out 'I have ball' when marking a player with the ball, announcing 'I have number X' when marking specific players, and indicating your position by saying 'I am with on your right/left' or 'I am on your side.' This communication helps keep everyone aware of cutters through the middle of the 8M and assists in creating double teams around the goal. A strong defensive team unit succeeds through constant talking and communication throughout the entire game.","context":["In this issue of Girls Lax Guide, I will be focusing on specific concepts for defenders in the game of lacrosse. There are three overall areas of concentration for all players when defending. These are correct defensive body positioning, team concept defense and proper techniques for stick checking. Lacrosse is a great sport in which players have opportunities to highlight their skill and finesse all over the field. Therefore, it is important to understand the finer aspects of defense. You should take it upon yourself to learn these defensive skills by working on them every day at practice. You will be developing an overall presence as a defender by executing solid body positioning and patience with stick checking all over the field. Each player needs to play defense at some point in the game, so prepare yourself now for the challenges ahead. The best defenders in a lacrosse game display extraordinary will, hustle and DESIRE to keep their opponent from closing in on the goal. They have the ability to maintain composure, patience and a focused attitude during the entire game.\nIt is very critical to learn the basic ideas of defensive body positioning at a young age. Defenders who are marking or covering the player with ball must execute proper stick position and quick footwork. This defender is also known as the player marking \"on ball\". She could either be marking her player with ball in the midfield or inside the 8M critical scoring areas. You should focus on keeping your stick in a vertical position, dominant hand slightly down the shaft and non-dominant hand at the bottom of your stick.\nNote the hand placement on the stick,\nstrait outstretched arms and foot position.\nPlayers need to hold their stick up in front of them with straight, out-stretched arms. By demonstrating a solid defensive stance, players will continue to shadow their opponent's stick in the air. A major component of proper defensive positioning is quick footwork. All players must work hard to develop a clear understanding of their body position and footwork patterns on defense. They should keep their feet moving forward, remain balanced and be able to adjust well in order to make short and quick lateral movements.\nAs defenders in the game of lacrosse, let us remember our main objective- to prevent the other team from scoring on our goal cage. In other words, we are working hard to keep the opponent away from our scoring end of the field. Therefore, every single player must take responsibility to play strong defense all over the field.\nRun WITH your opponent, forcing\nthem out and to their weak side.\nOnce the other team's goalkeeper has made a save, attack players such as the 1H (1st home), 2H (2nd home), 3H (3rd home), LAW (left attack wing), RAW (right attack wing) as well as the rest of the team, must find their girl and mark her goal side. One way to describe marking goal side is to keep yourself between your player and your goal. As you are marking goal side, deny her the ball by keeping your stick up in the passing lane while also attempting to come up with any interceptions at the same time.\nThen, if your player does get open to receive a pass, you need to focus on strong individual defense in the midfield. It requires the defender to force her player out wide either weak side or to her non-dominant hand. It puts pressure on the other team causing them to make a mistake or force a turnover situation. Defenders need to step up the pressure by running with their opponent. It seems like a very simple concept, but you must not get caught running too far in front of your player with ball. She could make a sudden quick move and beat you around the other side, leaving you in the dust and headed wide open down field. You also do not want to get caught running behind your player trying to catch up with her down field. Therefore, you should find a happy medium by running with your opponent, maintaining good stick/body position and looking for the opportunity to check and regain possession of the ball for your team. Determine the speed and quickness of your opponent at the very beginning of a game so you can play the best individual defense all over the midfield.\nAround the goal you must mark a player who is \"off ball\". For example, an attack player has possession of the ball behind goal and your teammate is playing defense on her. Then we have YOU, as the defender, marking your player at the top of the 8M. This is a perfect representation of marking someone off ball, as the player you are defending is a scoring threat on a pass from behind. When marking off-ball, defenders must focus on a few crucial ideas:\nDefense around the goal: Every defensive player is marking an opponent.\nThe main objective is to recognize each situation as it comes, and mark the right player in the right way, communicating all along. Then you will have good defensive positioning around the goal.\nTo form a strong defensive unit, all players must learn to communicate with each other by calling out a few simple terms. When you are marking a player with ball, you need to say out loud \"I have ball\". When you are marking another player, you should say out loud \"I have number 10\". You need to talk with your teammates on defense because it helps keep everyone aware of cutters through the middle of the 8M. It also helps with trying to step up the pressure on ball by creating double teams around the goal. When you are playing defense around the goal, you should also let your teammates know where you are by calling out loud \"I am with on your right/left or I am on your side\". A strong defensive team unit will be successful with lots of talking and communication throughout the entire game.\nStick checking requires exact timing and precision. Learn the basic ideas of stick checking as soon as possible. It is an important fundamental skill that requires extreme discipline and patience to perfect. A stick check can be described as a short, quick jabbing motion, with the head of the stick, that hits the top corner or head of the opponent's stick. It must be done in a very specific manner. A check needs to be performed by hitting the stick away from their body. It may not be held down or you could get called for a dangerous held check.\nPatience and discipline, feet moving forward,\nnever swinging at the last minute in desparation!\n| As you attempt to make a stick check, you need to keep your feet moving the whole time. Players must NOT lose their body position and get caught standing or swinging to check at the last minute. Players should work on developing the ability to time their checks perfectly by going for the stick at the exact moment it may be left open. |\nAfter your check is made, it is extremely important to come up with the groundball pickup and keep possession of the ball for your team. If you are going to go for the check, then go for it hard and come up with the ball."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:81452fd8-284c-4cad-bfbe-a3b165aff227>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the first aid approaches differ between a broken tooth and a broken ankle? üöë","answer":"For a broken tooth, patients should immediately ice the injured area and contact their regular dentist for an X-ray to determine injury extent. In contrast, for a broken ankle, patients should follow the RICE protocol (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) and seek care from a podiatrist who may need to 'reduce' the fracture and possibly use metal plates and screws for fixation. While tooth injuries might require coordination between a dentist and orthodontist if braces are involved, ankle fractures typically require a single specialist's care and often need immobilization through casting or special boots.","context":["Occasionally, some patients will experience an injury to the mouth or have something break during treatment. Dental emergencies while wearing braces or other orthodontic devices generally fall into two categories ‚Äì emergencies related to your orthodontic appliances, and injuries to your mouth, teeth and gums.\nEmergencies Related to Orthodontic Devices\nSometimes, orthodontic devices might be broken or bent during your treatment. If there are any disturbances, such as loose bands, loose brackets, broken or poking wires, or ill-fitting devices please call our office for an appointment during patient hours. For your convenience and the convenience of scheduled patients, it is not possible to handle emergencies on a walk in basis. In the meantime, here are some helpful hints to remedy some of the problems you may encounter until our office can see you as well as some guidelines on what can wait until the next available appointment and what is a true emergency which requires paging the doctor after hours or on weekends.\n- If some part of your orthodontic device is irritating your mouth, cover it with the wax we provided with your braces kit or try to push it out of the way with a blunt soft object like a pencil eraser or Q-tip. Wax can also be purchased at your local drug store ‚Äì if it is not in the dental section check the ear section for pliable wax or silicon ear plugs.\n- Broken or loose devices or braces that are not causing pain are not an emergency and can generally be left in place until we can get you in to have them repaired or replaced. Please call our office as soon as you are aware that something is not right. If it is after hours or a weekend please leave a message in our general mailbox and we will call you when we are back in the office to answer any questions you might have and schedule an appointment to get you fixed up if need be.\n- If your orthodontic devices are causing pain which is severe enough that you cannot wait until the next business day to be seen, please call us immediately so we can get you in. If it is after hours or the weekend, follow the instruction on our answering machine and the system will forward your call on to either Dr. Osterman, one of our clinical staff, or a doctor who is on call for Dr. Osterman. If you are forwarded to a voicemail box , please don‚Äôt forget to leave your phone number on the message! Your call will be returned as soon as possible.\n- Watch this video on YouTube that explains how to handle an orthodontic emergency:\nDirect Injuries to The Mouth & Teeth\nFollowing a direct injury to your mouth or teeth, whether undergoing orthodontic care or not, immediately ice the injured area and you should contact your regular dentist as soon as possible. Usually an x-ray of the involved tooth or teeth is needed to determine the extent of injury. If a tooth has been displaced, knocked out, or fractured, it is best to contact your family dentist first, since we may not have the necessary materials or anesthesia required to treat these injuries. If the appliances are dislodged or displaced, we will need to replace or adjust the appliances as soon as possible, after you have seen your general dentist.\nAfter Office Hours\nIf an orthodontic emergency arises after hours and the patient is in severe pain and cannot wait until the next business day to be seen, please call our main number (925-283-1921). Follow the prompts which ask if you require immediate assistance. You will then be instructed to press a number on your phone which will forward you on to someone who is on call for the office. If you are forwarded on to a voice mail box, please leave your name, the patient‚Äôs name and the best contact number and someone from our office or someone who is on call during that time will return your call as soon as possible.","Striving To Cover All Your Foot & Ankle Needs\nThe feet and ankles work together to provide support and mobility to the body. A foot or ankle sprain is a soft tissue injury. Most often, a sprain occurs when an injury pulls, stretches, or tears the ligaments that connect bone to bone. A fracture is actually a break in the bone.\nInjuries are the most common causes of foot and ankle sprains and fractures. Many fractures and sprains occur during sports. Football players are particularly vulnerable to foot and ankle sprains and fractures. Basketball players are prone to ankle sprains, and runners may develop stress fractures of the ankle or foot. Gymnasts and dancers may also develop stress fractures.\nTripping or stumbling on uneven ground is another common cause of foot and ankle sprains and fractures.\nPain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty walking on the affected foot or ankle are the most common symptoms of a sprained or fractured foot or ankle.\nIf you‚Äôve hurt your foot or ankle, it‚Äôs best to err on the side of caution. The acronym RICE can help you remember what to do:\nRest‚ÄîRest the affected area. Stay off the injured foot or ankle until it can be fully evaluated. Walking, running, or playing sports on an injured foot or ankle may make the injury worse.\nIce‚ÄîApply ice to the affected area as soon as possible, and reapply it for 15‚Äì20 minutes every three or four hours for the first 48 hours after injury. Ice can decrease inflammation.\nCompression‚ÄîWrap an elastic bandage (such as an Ace¬Æ wrap) around the affected foot or ankle. The wrapping should be snug, but not so tight as to cut off circulation.\nElevation‚ÄîElevate the affected extremity on a couple of pillows; ideally, your foot or ankle should be higher than your heart. Keeping your foot or ankle elevated also decreases swelling.\nWhen to Visit a Podiatrist\nPodiatrists are doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of the lower extremities. If you‚Äôve injured your foot or ankle, see Dr. Farajian. She can determine the extent of the injury and develop a plan of care to get you back in the game (or back to your everyday life) as soon as possible.\nIncreased pain, swelling, bruising, redness, or difficulty walking after an injury are definite signs that it‚Äôs time to see a podiatrist.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nDr. Farajian will carefully examine your feet and ankles and take a complete medical history. She will also order tests, including an X-ray, ultrasound, or MRI, to determine the extent of your injury. If you have a fracture that‚Äôs clearly visible on X-ray, you may not need additional testing. Ultrasounds and MRIs are useful for finding soft issue injuries (including torn ligaments) and stress fractures.\nTreatment will depend on your injury. If you have a broken bone, Dr. Farajian may attempt to ‚Äúreduce‚Äù the fracture, which means lining up the ends of the bones so they can heal properly. (You‚Äôll be given a local anesthetic to numb the area first.) If the fracture is ‚Äúunstable,‚Äù meaning that the ends of the bone do not stay in place after a reduction, surgery may be needed. Podiatrists can use metal plates and screws to fix broken bones.\nStress fractures are treated with rest and immobilization. You will be instructed to stay off the affected area until healing is complete. Crutches and/or a special ‚Äúboot‚Äù or cast may be used to immobilize the area.\nSprains are also treated with a period of immobilization. Depending on the extent of your sprain, you may be able to resume activity fairly quickly, or you may need to wear a soft cast or special ‚Äúboot‚Äù and use crutches for a period of weeks.\nProfessional athletes may undergo surgery to repair torn ligaments.\nOral anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen, can be used to decrease pain, swelling, and inflammation.\nWarming up prior to physical activity can prevent ankle sprains and fractures. So can wearing proper shoes. If you‚Äôre an athlete, talk to Dr. Farajian to determine which shoes are best for your sport. Athletic shoes should be replaced yearly; running shoes should be replaced every 300‚Äì400 miles or so.\nAvoid running or walking on uneven surfaces.\n1. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be broken, because I can move it.‚Äù False; this widespread idea has kept many fractures from receiving proper treatment. The truth is that often you can walk with certain kinds of fractures. Some common examples: Breaks in the smaller, outer bone of the lower leg, small chip fractures of either the foot or\nankle bones, and the often neglected fracture of the toe.\n2. ‚ÄúIf you break a toe, immediate care isn‚Äôt necessary.‚Äù False; a toe fracture needs promptattention. If X-rays reveal it to be a simple, displaced fracture, care by your podiatric physician usually can produce rapid relief. However, X-rays might identify a displaced or angulated break. In such cases, prompt realignment of the fracture by your podiatric physician will help prevent improper or incomplete healing. Often, fractures do not show up in the initial X-ray. It may be necessary to X-ray the foot a second time, seven to ten days later. Many patients develop post-fracture deformity of a toe, which in turn results in a deformed toe with a painful corn. A good general rule is: Seek prompt treatment for injury to foot bones.\n3. ‚ÄúIf you have a foot or ankle injury, soak it in hot water immediately.‚Äù False; don‚Äôt use heat or hot water on an area suspect for fracture, sprain, or\ndislocation. Heat promotes blood flow, causing greater swelling. More swelling means greater pressure on the nerves, which causes more pain. An ice bag wrapped in a towel has a contracting effect on blood vessels, produces a numbing sensation, and prevents swelling and pain. Dr. Farajian may make additional recommendations upon examination.\n4. ‚ÄúApplying an elastic bandage to a severelysprained ankle is adequate treatment.‚Äù False; ankle sprains often mean torn orseverely overstretched ligaments, and they should receive immediate care. Xray examination, immobilization by casting or splinting, and physiotherapy to ensure a normal recovery all may be indicated. Surgery may even be necessary.\n5. ‚ÄúThe terms ‚Äòfracture,‚Äô ‚Äòbreak,‚Äô and‚Äòcrack‚Äô are all different.‚Äù False; all of those words are proper in describing a broken bone."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b52f4b2-f4a7-4bb2-9878-11038bfd30f8>","<urn:uuid:5f06babd-a0a9-4851-bb0d-48e24e573802>"],"error":null}

The recursive study of philosophy is an integral part of the philosophical enterprise because it is intertwined with all branches of philosophy as is logic or epistemology. Most metaphilosophy is part of either the formation or the criticism of a philosophical school, but some philosophers devote their time almost exclusively to metaphilosophy such as Stephen Toulmin, Richard Rorty and some continental philosophers.\nFor our purposes it might also include the psychology of philosophy. If it is the case that particular types of brain organization make particular forms of thought more attractive, easier to enter into etc we might take the view that the exposal of any particular philisophical position can be viewed as a projective personality test.\nTaxonomy of philosophical problemsEdit\nThere are many kinds of philosophy, dependent on the numerous human cultures. What is not controversial are the general types of problem branches which are included in philosophy. The major branches are: metaphysics and ontology, epistemology and logic, axiology and ethics. Philosopher and encyclopedist Mortimer Adler, however, excludes logic and includes all second-order problems (i.e. questions about specific ideas or fields of study). Second-order problems are often found arranged under various branches of philosophy which start with the phrase \"philosophy of....\" Adler (1994) divides these second-order philosophical problems into two branches. The first branch addresses the objects of thought, such as Being, Cause, Change, Infinity, Fate, Love. The second branch addresses the subjects, or procedural domains, of thought, e.g. philosophy of religion, philosophy of history, philosophy of language, philosophy of science. Metaphilosophy also attempts to understand both branches of second-order thought aided by the other major branches, e.g. metaphysical knowledge in religion, epistemology in religion, axiology in religion. In any case, one problem in metaphilosophy is to provide such a taxonomy.\nAims and nature of philosophyEdit\nAn important question for metaphilosophy is \"What is philosophy?\", and because different philosophers have offered different answers - often implicitly, it is the task of meta-philosophy to adjudicate. Prior to adjudication, however, the metaphilosopher must identify, clarify, and understand the alternative conceptions of the nature of philosophy, as well as his available reasoning tools and their limits.\nThe task is made more difficult by the fact that the use and meaning of the word \"philosophy\" has changed throughout history: in Antiquity it encompassed almost any inquiry, for Descartes it was supposed to be the Queen of the Sciences (a sort of ultimate justification), in the time of David Hume \"metaphysics\" and \"morals\" could be roughly translated as the human sciences, while analytic philosophy likes to define itself roughly as inquiry into concepts.\nApart, perhaps, from the vague idea of philosophy as a 'general' discipline that has something to do with 'life' and especially with 'reasoning', few genuine properties shared by all philosophers can be found. But the ways in which different thinkers characterize philosophy can be important as a normative statement about how philosophy should be done.\nEmpiricism or rationalismEdit\nOne important distinction is between those philosophers that conceive philosophy as an empirical discipline (if not necessarily a science) and those who believe it is rather an a priori discipline not really concerned with facts and not related to the sciences.\nThe distinction is mostly applied to modern, not current, philosophy with people like John Locke, David Hume and Immanuel Kant on the empiricist side and mainly idealist philosophers such as Georg Hegel on the other. However, the distinction can be just as meaningfully applied to current philosophy. Analytical philosophers believe that all meaningful empirical questions are to be answered by science, not philosophy. Pragmatists and naturalistic epistemologists on the other hand think that philosophy should be linked to science and should be scientific in the broad sense of that term.\nTheoretical or practicalEdit\nSome philosophers (e.g. existentialism, pragmatism) think philosophy is ultimately a practical discipline that should help us lead meaningful lives by showing us who we are, how we relate to the world around us and what we should do. Others (e.g. analytical philosophy) see philosophy as a technical, formal and theoretical discipline. Note that both parties can be and are just as theoretical and abstract - they differ rather in their views on the function and subjects of that theory.\nStephen Toulmin (Knowing and Acting, 1976) defined three basic approaches to philosophy:\n- the philosopher as geometer: centers on formal inquiry; thinkers from Plato to Frege.\n- the philosopher as anthropologist: tries to find the basics of human nature; thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Smith.\n- the philosopher as critic: investigates the a priori conditions on which e.g. knowledge can exist; Immanuel Kant and the phenomenological tradition.\nTypical of the phronesis-approach to philosophy were the thinkers Socrates and Epicurus. The questions of this form of Philosophy consist mainly of those relevant to the search for a happy life and the cultivation of the virtues, although political and religious philosophy is featured in recorded thinking. Consequently, much of Grecian philosophy would now be better termed psychology.\nThe epistemic approach centers upon the foundations of knowledge, in particular the debate between Rationalism and Empiricism. Typical of this era of speculation were Locke, Hume, Descartes, Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant. Ethical philosophy developed from speculative psychology into a logical study of meta-ethics, while normative ethics showed signs of practical development towards social reform, notably under the prodigious lawyer and philosopher Jeremy Bentham.\nLinguistic philosophy is the most recent development. It is practised both as a form of epistemology (the relation between language and world, the \"meaning of meaning\") and as the study of concepts and ideas. In its pure form, the logical study of meaningful language (conceived as the prime philosophical endeavor) is in decline in many universities but it lives on as part of the analytic tradition. A.J. Ayer in his book Language, Truth and Logic sets two criteria for a definition of Philosophy. Firstly, the science must be a genuine branch of knowledge, and secondly it must bear relation to the realm of ideas and impressions commonly known as \"Philosophy\". In the aforementioned publication, Philosophy is (contentiously) defined as a wholly analytic task and as a compilation of \"in-use\" definitions. It is commonly suggested by this school that questions such as \"What is Truth?\" or more generally \"What is x?\" are requests for definitions rather than empirical facts.\nRecently, philosophers have casted their doubt about intuition as a basic tool in philosophical inquiry from Socrates up to contemporary philosophy of language. In Rethinking Intuition (ed. Michael R. Ramsey, William DePaul) various thinkers discard intuition as a valid source of knowledge and thereby the whole idea of an 'a priori' philosophy.\nComputational means possible to implement and realize on computers. In the above context, we may construct several simplified artificial worlds with different ontologies and ethical systems, we can experiment with them and confront with the real world observations. This emergent research and scientific activity requires numerous meta-philosophical and meta-theoretical assumptions/propositions/axioms (see External links 2,3). This is also the domain of new computational philosophy and modern experimental philosophy\nProgress in philosophyEdit\nWhether or not there is progress in philosophy depends on one's assumptions about the nature of philosophy and the criteria of progress.\nMany philosophers have written on metaphilosophy. The tradition goes back to Plato, whose dialogues are directly concerned with ethics, but constantly raise questions concerning\n- the nature of philosophy and its methods (most explicitly addressed in the Meno)\n- the value and proper aims of philosophy (in the Apology, Gorgias, Protagoras, etc.)\n- the proper relationship between philosophical criticism and everyday life (a pervasive theme explored most famously in the Republic)\nLudwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations directly address logic, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mind, but the nature of philosophical puzzles and philosophical understanding is central to all of the discussions. Wittgenstein frequently diagnoses philosophical errors as involving confusions about the nature of philosophical inquiry.\nC. D. Broad is known for distinguishing Critical from Speculative philosophy. See his \"The Subject-matter of Philosophy, and its Relations to the special Sciences,\" in Introduction to Scientific Thought, 1923. Curt Ducasse, in Philosophy as a Science, examines several views of the nature of philosophy, and concludes that philosophy has a distinct subject matter: appraisals.\nRichard Rorty could be called a meta-philosopher, considering his many ideas about the nature of philosophy and the role of philosopher.\n- Adler, Mortimer (1994).

{"question":"How do honey bees and native bees compare in their effectiveness at pollinating crops?","answer":"Native bees are actually two to three times more effective pollinators than honey bees. While honey bees contribute to crop pollination, native bees are crucial for specific crops. For example, tomatoes require 'buzz pollination,' which honey bees cannot perform despite their ability to buzz. Only native bees like bumblebees and mud bees can perform this special pollination technique. Similarly, while honey bees do visit squash family plants, native squash bees are better pollinators for these crops as they are specifically adapted to their pollination needs, getting up earlier to match the plants' flowering schedule. Together with honey bees, native bees help pollinate 75% of fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States, worth about $16 billion in crops.","context":["If your favorite summer treat is a warm, ripe tomato straight from the garden, or even if the closest you get to a tomato is the ketchup on your burger, you should thank a bee, specifically a bumblebee or mud bee.\nWhen we think of bees, we picture usually honeybees. But honeybees are not native to the Americas- they were brought here by European settlers. Some honeybees escaped, forming wild colonies and some remained domesticated. But how were flowers pollinated before the arrival of the settlers and their bees? By native bees and other pollinators of course.\nNative bees are less familiar to most people because their habits differ from honeybees. Many are not social, do not form colonies or hive, and prefer to live alone and inconspicuously. Some bees nest in the ground, or in holes in wood. Many native bees have mild stings or cannot sting at all. There are over 4,000 species of native bees in the United States and these natives, along with honey bees, pollinate 75% of the fruit, vegetables and nuts grown in this country- about $16 billion dollars worth of crops.\nClearly we need bees for more than just honey, but our bees are in trouble. In the mid-2000s beekeepers began noticing a dramatic increase in the number of honeybee colonies dying off- they named this phenomenon ‚ÄúColony Collapse Disorder‚Äù or CCD. Scientists have been trying to figure out what causes CCD. Possibilities include parasites, pesticides (especially neonicotinoids), fungicides, loss of wildflower diversity, and disease. A recent study concluded that the cause is probably a complex combination of all these factors. Poor nutrition due to loss of flower diversity or exposure to pesticides can make bees more susceptible to parasites and disease.\nIt is not just honeybees that are suffering from CCD. Native bee species are declining too although less is known about their populations. Our native bees may not produce honey for humans, but they are crucial for pollination of our crops.\nMany of our favorite plants are pollinated by natives. For instance, tomatoes can be pollinated by the wind, but to produce large and numerous fruits they need ‚Äúbuzz pollination.‚Äù Honeybees, though they buzz, do not ‚Äúbuzz pollinate.‚Äù Buzz pollination is a special behavior in which the bee holds onto the flower, vibrates its flight muscles, and makes the flower vibrate as well. This loosens the pollen and maximizes pollination of the plant. Native bumblebees and mud bees buzz pollinate, so if you want productive tomatoes in your garden, you need these species.\nPlants in the squash family, such as zucchini, melons and cucumbers, are also best pollinated by natives. While honeybees do visit these plants, if you see a bee at your zucchini plant very early in the morning, it‚Äôs probably a squash bee. Squash bees look similar to honeybees, but behave differently. They get up earlier because squash flowers open early in the morning and they nest in the ground, often right under the squash plant.\nWe can help keep our native bees around by doing a few simple things in our own backyards. Plant a few bee-friendly plants in your garden, especially native plants which require less care and are favorites of many native bees. Avoid using pesticides when possible and when you do use them, apply carefully to avoid spraying bees. Bees need to drink and many native species use mud in their nests. Providing a source of pesticide free mud and water can be a huge benefit. You can also put up a ‚Äúbee block,‚Äù simply a chunk of wood with some small holes drilled into it. This provides critical nesting sites for mason bees and other species that nest in cavities. And don‚Äôt fear, these cavity-nesting bees are not aggressive, and rarely sting, so you are not inviting trouble into your backyard.\nSo if you enjoy fruits and vegetables or want a lovely, productive garden, do the bees a favor- make your backyard ‚Äúbee friendly‚Äù and look out for our amazing native bees. They have been doing us the favor of pollinating our farms and gardens for thousands of years. Support the bees, both honeybees and native bees- we won‚Äôt have much to eat without them!\nThis article first appeared in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel on March 25, 2015.","The super-pollinators of the garden are ‚Ä¶ native bees! While honey bees have their place, it‚Äôs our native solitary bees‚Äîsuch as mason bees and leafcutter bees‚Äîwhich are most vital to our flowers and food. Learn more about these amazing heroes of pollination‚Äîand see how to bring these docile bees to your garden.\nSolitary Bees: The Heroes of Pollination\nMost of us grew up learning about the sophisticated social structures of honey bees and bumblebees, and we‚Äôve come to think that their lifestyle represents all bee behavior. The truth is, the world is home to more than 20,000 species of bees, and a whopping 90% of them do not live together in hives.\nInstead, most of the world‚Äôs bees are solitary, meaning they live alone. Unlike social bees, each female solitary bee has to gather pollen and nectar, build nests, and lay eggs all on her own, without the help of hundreds or thousands of doting workers. And although honey bees tend to get all the credit for keeping our crops going, native solitary bees are almost two to three times more effective pollinators!\nSo, if 90% of bees don‚Äôt live in hives, where do they live? Well, about 70% of solitary bee species nest underground in tunnels and burrows, while the remaining 30% nest aboveground, in holes in logs and stems.\nMason bee nesting holes capped with a layer of mud and clay. Photo by Dominicus Johannes Bergsma/Wikimedia Commons.\nTwo of the most common hole-nesting bee species used for crop pollination are alfalfa leafcutter bees and blue mason bees. In the wild, both species nest in pre-made holes, such as old grub tunnels, crevices in peeling bark, or broken branches. As suggested by their names, leafcutter bees use pieces of leaves to build their nests, while mason bees use mud or clay. Other types of hole-nesting bees, such as sweat bees and carpenter bees, prefer to excavate their own holes in the ground, logs, reeds, or the dead canes of raspberry bushes.\nA curious carpenter bee (Xylocopa spp.)\nMost solitary bees have a short lifespan as flying adults. Male mason bees only fly for about two weeks‚Äîjust long enough to mate‚Äîand females only live a few weeks longer. With such a short adult lifespan, solitary bees have to use their time wisely! They do not have time to make honey, nor do they like to fly too far from home, meaning they spend the bulk of their time preparing their nests and pollinating flowers within a relatively small area. A big chunk of a solitary bee‚Äôs life is spent in their mother‚Äôs nesting site, hibernating over winter in their cocoons.\nMason bee (Osmia spp.).\nBackyard Bee Houses\nSome reports indicate that nearly 40% of bees are facing extinction today, leaving many people wondering what they can do to help. Fortunately, the best thing you can do is to start local, in your own backyard. Making your garden as bee-friendly as possible is as easy as adding things like native wildflowers and native bee nesting sites, including bee houses.\nSimilar to birdhouses, bee houses (or hotels) provide vital and otherwise missing nesting habitat. They are relatively simple in form, consisting of a birdhouse-like structure containing a series of exposed, reed-like tubes that the bees can lay their eggs in. Hole-nesting bees desperately search for appropriate nesting sites, sometimes even nesting in the ends of old garden hose nozzles, openings in metal garden furniture, or the hollow ends of wind chimes. Bee houses provide a more natural structure for the bees, and also allow for a bit of human assistance when necessary.\nBee houses can be an eye-catching addition to your garden.\nOn an annual basis, bee houses do need to be maintained and managed, or else they‚Äôll become uninhabitable. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîmaintaining a bee house is pretty simple: Just remove the bee-cocoon‚Äìfilled nesting materials and store them in a cool place over winter. Then, in the spring, remove the cocoons from the old materials and place them alongside new materials in your bee house. The new bee generation will emerge and get right to work. In exchange for pollinating all of our fruits and vegetables, a little housecleaning and maintenance is the least we can do!\nFor more advice on maintaining a bee house in your garden, see How to Maintain a Bee House to Increase Pollination.\nSolitary Bee Pests and Diseases\nLike any other animal, hole-nesting bees are susceptible to a number of pests, diseases, and predators. The three greatest threats that the bees face are pollen mites (they eat the bee larva‚Äôs food supply before the bee can), chalkbrood (a fungal infection that converts a larva into a mass of fungal spores), and parasitic wasps (gnat-sized wasps that lay eggs inside of healthy larvae).\nTo reduce the spread of pests and diseases in bee houses, simply harvest cocoons and separate healthy ones from infected nesting chambers. As you harvest cocoons, you‚Äôll learn how to identify infected chambers and keep healthy cocoons safe.\nFor more information on native bees and bee houses, see our top tips for maintaining a backyard bee house.\nTo learn about keeping honey bees, see our Beekeeping 101 series."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:527a18e7-60f6-4131-85e4-f8cd575d91d1>","<urn:uuid:c6eb2b25-a3ce-4b11-be5b-1bb8038ffc29>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which transfection method offers more precise control over individual cells - the femtosecond laser technique or the CRISPR plasmid protocol?","answer":"The femtosecond laser technique offers more precise control over individual cells. This method allows researchers to precisely target and transfect single cells by using optical tweezers to transport DNA and create tiny pores in specific cell membranes. In contrast, the CRISPR plasmid protocol is performed on populations of cells in wells containing 1.5x105 - 2.5x105 cells, without the ability to control transfection at the individual cell level. The laser technique enables researchers to selectively insert different genes into different individual cells, or leave some cells untransfected, while the plasmid protocol treats all cells in the well uniformly.","context":["The applications of gene therapy and genetic engineering are broad: everything from pet fish that glow red to increased crop yields worldwide to cures for many of the diseases that plague humankind. But realizing them always starts with solving the same basic scientific question - how to \"transfect\" a cell by inserting foreign DNA into it. Many methods already exist for doing this, but they tend to be clumsy and destructive, not allowing researchers to precisely control how and when they insert the DNA or requiring them to burn through large numbers of cells before they can get it into one.\nA team of scientists in South Korea have now developed the most precise method ever used to insert DNA into cells. The method combines two high-tech laboratory techniques and allows the researchers to precisely poke holes on the surface of a single cell with a high-powered \"femtosecond\" laser and then gently tug a piece of DNA through it using \"optical tweezers,\" which draw on the electromagnetic field of another laser. The team's approach, which is a breakthrough in precision and control at the single-cell level, was published today in the Optical Society's (OSA) open-access journal Biomedical Optics Express.\n\"What is magical is that all this happens for one cell,\" said Yong-Gu Lee, an associate professor in the School of Mechatronics at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea and one of the researchers who carried out the study. \"Until today, gene transfection has been performed on a large quantity of agglomerate cells and the outcome has been observed as a statistical average and no observations have been made on individual cells.\"\nCommon techniques to force DNA into cells can be clumsy or even violent, Lee said. For instance, researchers often use so-called \"gene guns\" to fire particles coated with strands of DNA known as plasmids at large populations of cells. Alternatively, scientists may puncture the membranes of individual cells with lasers, place the cells in a plasmid soup, and let the genes diffuse into the perforated cells on their own. While either method can transfect some fraction of a population, researchers cannot control whether any individual cell will incorporate the desired genes, and large numbers of cells may be damaged or destroyed in the process.\nIn the new study, the researchers sought to safely transfect an individual cell. To manipulate the foreign DNA, the scientists used optical tweezers, which essentially tweaks a laser beam whose electromagnetic field can grab hold of and transport a plasmid-coated particle. The researchers first moved the particle to the surface of the cell membrane. Guided by the trapped particle, they then created a tiny pore in the cell membrane using an ultra-short laser pulse from a femtosecond laser. While another laser beam detected the exact location of the cell membrane, they pushed the particle through the pore with the tweezers. Using this technique, the scientists were able to ease a microparticle right up to the pore in the membrane and drop it into the cell, like a golfer sinking an easy putt.\nTo determine whether their method had succeeded, the researchers inserted plasmids carrying a gene that codes for a green fluorescent protein. Once inside the cell, the gene became active and the cell's machinery began producing the protein. The researchers could then detect the green glow using a fluorescence microscope. They found that approximately one in six of the cells they studied became transfected. This rate is lower than that recorded for some other methods, but those are less precise and involve many cells at a time.\nLee hopes the work will allow other researchers to investigate the effects of transfection on individual cells, not just large populations. With the new technique, \"you can put one gene into one cell, another gene into another cell, and none into a third,\" he said. \"So you can study exactly how it works.\"","CRISPR / Cas9 KO Plasmid and HDR Plasmid Transfection\nPHASE 1. CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid and HDR Plasmid Transfection\nThis protocol is recommended for a single well from a 6-well tissue culture plate. Adjust cell and reagent amounts proportionately for wells or dishes of different sizes.\n- In a 6-well tissue culture plate seed 1.5x 105 - 2.5x 105 cells in 3 ml of antibiotic-free standard growth medium per well, 24 hours prior to transfection. Grow cells to a 40‚Äì80% confluency. Initial cell seeding and cell confluency after 24 hours are determined based on the rate of cell growth of the cells used for transfection. Healthy and subconfluent cells are required for successful KO and HDR Plasmid transfection.\n- Prepare the following solutions:\nNOTE: The optimal Plasmid DNA:UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent (sc-395739) ratio should be determined experimentally beginning with 1 ¬µg of Plasmid DNA and between 5-15 ¬µl of UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent. Once the Transfection Reagent volume is optimized to minimize cell toxicity, Plasmid DNA concentrations can vary between 1-3 ¬µg per well. If the optimal UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent volume is 10 ¬µl, then Plasmid DNA concentrations ranging from 1-3 ¬µg/10 ¬µl should be tested. For example, test Plasmid DNA/UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent amounts: 1 ¬µg/10 ¬µl, 2 ¬µg/10 ¬µl, and 3 ¬µg/10 ¬µl. The appropriate amount of Plasmid DNA/UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent complex used per well should be tested to determine which amount provides the highest level of transfection efficiency.\nNOTE: If transfecting more than one plasmid (i.e. CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid with HDR Plasmid), mix Plasmid DNA at equivalent ratios.\nSolution A: For each transfection, dilute 1‚Äì3 ¬µg of Plasmid DNA into Plasmid Transfection Medium: sc-108062 to bring final volume to 150 ¬µl. Pipette up and down to mix. Let stand for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nSolution B: For each transfection, dilute 5‚Äì15 ¬µl of UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent: sc-395739 with enough Plasmid Transfection Medium: sc-108062 to bring final volume to 150 ¬µl. Pipette up and down to mix. Let stand for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nNOTE: Do not add antibiotics to the Plasmid Transfection Medium: sc-108062.\n- Add the Plasmid DNA solution (Solution A) dropwise directly to the dilute UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent (Solution B) using a pipette. Vortex immediately and incubate for no less than 20 minutes at room temperature.\n- Prior to transfection, replace media with fresh antibiotic-free growth medium. Add the 300 ¬µl Plasmid DNA/UltraCruz¬Æ Transfection Reagent Complex (Solution A + Solution B) dropwise to well.\n- Gently mix by swirling the plate.\n- Incubate the cells for 24‚Äì72 hours under conditions normally used to culture the cells. No media replacement is necessary during the first 24 hours post-transfection. Add or replace media as needed 24‚Äì72 hours post-transfection.\n- After incubation, successful transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid may be visually confirmed by detection of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) via fluorescent microscopy and/or Western blot with GFP Antibody (B-2): sc-9996. Successful co-transfection of the CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid and HDR Plasmid, may be visually confirmed by detection of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) via fluorescent microscopy and/or Western blot.\n- For cells transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid, assay cells 48‚Äì72 hours after transfection step.\n- For cells co-transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid and HDR Plasmid go to Phase 2.\nNOTE: If puromycin selection or Cre Vector transfection are not applicable see Phase 4.\nPHASE 2. Puromycin Selection\nNOTE: If cells were co-transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid and HDR Plasmid, cells can be selected with media containing puromycin.\n- The working puromycin concentration for mammalian cell lines ranges from 1‚Äì10 ¬µg/ml. Prior to using the puromycin antibiotic (sc-108071), titrate the selection agent to determine the optimal concentration for target cell line. Use the lowest concentration that kills 100% of non-transfected cells in 3‚Äì5 days from the start of puromycin selection.\n- 48‚Äì96 hours post-transfection, aspirate the medium and replace with fresh medium containing puromycin at the appropriate concentration.\n- Select cells for a minimum of 3‚Äì5 days. Approximately every 2‚Äì3 days, aspirate and replace with freshly prepared selective media.\n- Cells may be assayed at this point.\n- For excision of the puromycin gene, proceed to Phase 3.\nPHASE 3. Cre Vector Transfection\nThis protocol is recommended for selected cells co-transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid and HDR Plasmid, and for the removal of genetic material flanked by LoxP sites.\nNOTE: Follow Phase I plasmid transfection protocol for Cre Vector: sc-418923 transfection.\nPHASE 4. Cell Assay\nComplete phenotypic and/or genotypic analysis may require isolation of single cell colonies to confirm complete allelic knockouts.\n- For protein analysis, change media to standard growth medium 3 days prior to cell lysis. To lyse adherent cells, aspirate media, rinse cells with PBS, scrape and centrifuge cells at low speed to obtain a cell pellet. For suspension cells, transfer the culture to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge cells at low speed to obtain a cell pellet. Wash once with PBS and centrifuge again. For 100% confluent HEK 293 or HeLa cells, add 100 ¬µl of RIPA Lysis Buffer System: sc-24948 to the pellet. For other cell lines or confluencies, the amount of RIPA Lysis Buffer System to use should be determined experimentally. Sonicate or shear cells.

{"question":"How do detection methods differ between observing neutron star mergers and coral bleaching events, and what challenges exist in studying both phenomena?","answer":"Neutron star mergers are primarily detected through gravitational wave observatories like LIGO and Virgo, with detection being challenging because stable neutron stars emit no detectable radiation. This creates an observational bias in what can be studied. For coral bleaching events, detection relies on visible observation of color changes, from white bleaching to neon coloration in some cases. Research on both phenomena faces time-sensitive challenges - neutron star mergers are momentary events that must be captured by precise instruments, while coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent due to climate change, requiring ongoing monitoring to study survival mechanisms.","context":["Astrophysicists Explain the Origin of Unusually Heavy Neutron Star Binaries\nSimulations of supernova explosions of massive stars paired with neutron stars can explain puzzling results from gravitational wave observatories.\nA new study showing how the explosion of a stripped massive star in a supernova can lead to the formation of a heavy neutron starA neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (between 10 and 29 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of just 10 ‚Äì 20 kilometers (6 ‚Äì 12 miles), they can have masses of about 1.3 ‚Äì 2.5 that of the Sun.‚Äù>neutron star or a light black holeA black hole is a place in space where the pull of gravity is so strong not even light can escape it. Astronomers classify black holes into three categories by size: miniature, stellar, and supermassive black holes. Miniature black holes could have a mass smaller than our Sun and supermassive black holes could have a mass equivalent to billions of our Sun.‚Äù>black hole resolves one of the most challenging puzzles to emerge from the detection of neutron star mergers by the gravitational wave observatories LIGOThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory supported by the National Science Foundation and operated by Caltech and MIT. It‚Äôs designed to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. It‚Äôs multi-kilometer-scale gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure the minute ripples in space-time caused by passing gravitational waves. It consists of two widely separated interferometers within the United States‚Äîone in Hanford, Washington and the other in Livingston, Louisiana.‚Äù>LIGO and Virgo.\nThe first detection of gravitational wavesGravitational waves are distortions or ripples in the fabric of space and time. They were first detected in 2015 by the Advanced LIGO detectors and are produced by catastrophic events such as colliding black holes, supernovae, or merging neutron stars.‚Äù>gravitational waves by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2017 was a neutron star merger that mostly conformed to the expectations of astrophysicists. But the second detection, in 2019, was a merger of two neutron stars whose combined mass was unexpectedly large.\n‚ÄúIt was so shocking that we had to start thinking about how to create a heavy neutron star without making it a pulsarFirst observed at radio frequencies, a pulsar is a rotating neutron star that emits regular pulses of radiation. Astronomers developed three categories for pulsars: accretion-powered pulsars, rotation-powered pulsars, and nuclear-powered pulsars; and have since observed them at X-ray, optical, and gamma-ray energies.‚Äù>pulsar,‚Äù said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.\nCompact astrophysical objects like neutron stars and black holes are challenging to study because when they are stable they tend to be invisible, emitting no detectable radiation. ‚ÄúThat means we are biased in what we can observe,‚Äù Ramirez-Ruiz explained. ‚ÄúWe have detected neutron star binaries in our galaxy when one of them is a pulsar, and the masses of those pulsars are almost all identical‚Äîwe don‚Äôt see any heavy neutron stars.‚Äù\nLIGO‚Äôs detection of a heavy neutron star merger at a rate similar to the lighter binary system implies that heavy neutron star pairs should be relatively common. So why don‚Äôt they show up in the pulsar population?\nIn the new study, Ramirez-Ruiz and his colleagues focused on the supernovae of stripped stars in binary systems that can form ‚Äúdouble compact objects‚Äù consisting of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. A stripped star, also called a helium star, is a star that has had its hydrogen envelope removed by its interactions with a companion star.\nThe study, published on October 8, 2021, in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was led by Alejandro Vigna-Gomez, an astrophysicist at the University of Copenhagen‚Äôs Niels Bohr Institute, where Ramirez-Ruiz holds a Niels Bohr Professorship.\n‚ÄúWe used detailed stellar models to follow the evolution of a stripped star until the moment it explodes in a supernova,‚Äù Vigna-Gomez said. ‚ÄúOnce we reach the time of the supernova, we do a hydrodynamical study, where we are interested in following the evolution of the exploding gas.‚Äù\nThe stripped star, in a binary system with a neutron star companion, starts out ten times more massive than our sun, but so dense it is smaller than the sun in diameter. The final stage in its evolution is a core-collapse supernova, which leaves behind either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the final mass of the core.\nThe team‚Äôs results showed that when the massive stripped star explodes, some of its outer layers are rapidly ejected from the binary system. Some of the inner layers, however, are not ejected and eventually fall back onto the newly formed compact object.\n‚ÄúThe amount of material accreted depends on the explosion energy‚Äîthe higher the energy, the less mass you can keep,‚Äù Vigna-Gomez said. ‚ÄúFor our ten-solar-mass stripped star, if the explosion energy is low, it will form a black hole; if the energy is large, it will keep less mass and form a neutron star.‚Äù\nThese results not only explain the formation of heavy neutron star binary systems, such as the one revealed by the gravitational wave event GW190425, but also predict the formation of neutron star and light black hole binaries, such as the one that merged in the 2020 gravitational wave event GW200115.\nAnother important finding is that the mass of the helium core of the stripped star is essential in determining the nature of its interactions with its neutron star companion and the ultimate fate of the binary system. A sufficiently massive helium star can avoid transferring mass onto the neutron star. With a less massive helium star, however, the mass transfer process can transform the neutron star into a rapidly spinning pulsar.\n‚ÄúWhen the helium core is small, it expands, and then mass transfer spins up the neutron star to create a pulsar,‚Äù Ramirez-Ruiz explained. ‚ÄúMassive helium cores, however, are more gravitationally bound and don‚Äôt expand, so there is no mass transfer. And if they don‚Äôt spin up into a pulsar, we don‚Äôt see them.‚Äù\nIn other words, there may well be a large undetected population of heavy neutron star binaries in our galaxy.\n‚ÄúTransferring mass onto a neutron star is an effective mechanism to create rapidly spinning (millisecond) pulsars,‚Äù Vigna-Gomez said. ‚ÄúAvoiding this mass transfer episode as we suggest hints that there is a radio-quiet population of such systems in the Milky WayThe Milky Way is the galaxy that contains the Earth, and is named for its appearance from Earth. It is a barred spiral galaxy that contains an estimated 100-400 billion stars and has a diameter between 150,000 and 200,000 light-years.‚Äù>Milky Way.‚Äù\nReference: ‚ÄúFallback Supernova Assembly of Heavy Binary Neutron Stars and Light Black Hole‚ÄìNeutron Star Pairs and the Common Stellar Ancestry of GW190425 and GW200115‚Äù by Alejandro Vigna-G√≥mez, Sophie L.

J√∂rg Wiedenmann, Elena Bollati & Cecilia D‚ÄôAngelo/University of Southampton, Palawan colourful bleaching image by Ryan Goehrung/University of Washington\nBleaching events used to be few and far between, but they now occur nearly every year. After the coral is exposed, it often breaks down and dies, altering the ecosystem for the diverse array of life that relies on it. Corals stand little chance of bouncing back from these events ‚Äî but a new study suggests they have an unusual survival method: taking on a vibrant neon color.\nWhen bleaching events occur, extended heat spikes cause corals to turn a ghostly white, often leading to their death. Even slight increases in annual ocean temperatures can wreak havoc on this relationship, expelling the algae from the coral‚Äôs tissue and exposing its white skeleton. These corals can still undergo some of their normal functions for a short period of time as they hope their algae come back ‚Äî whereas drastic changes in ocean temperature almost always lead to coral death. Reports of colorful bleaching during the most recent mass bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef in March and April gave scientists hope that patches of the system have a chance to recover. ‚ÄúBleaching is not always a death sentence for corals, the coral animal can still be alive,‚Äù said Dr. They found that colorful bleaching events occur when corals produce ‚Äúwhat is effectively a sunscreen layer‚Äù on their surface to protect against harmful rays and create a glowing display that researchers believe encourages algae to return. The Ocean Agency describes the process as a ‚Äúchilling, beautiful and heartbreaking‚Äù final cry for help as the coral attempts to grab the algae‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúOur research shows colorful bleaching involves a self-regulating mechanism, a so-called optical feedback loop, which involves both partners of the symbiosis,‚Äù lead researcher Professor J√∂rg Wiedenmann of the University of Southampton said in a press release.

But ‚Äúcolorful bleaching‚Äù has the opposite effect: the dying corals gain more pigment, and glow in shades of bright pink, purple and orange. Scientists first spotted the mysterious neon coral a decade ago, but they had been unable to figure out why it occurred. As the recovering algal population starts taking up the light for their photosynthesis again, the light levels inside the coral will drop and the coral cells will lower the production of the colorful pigments to their normal level.‚Äù\nColorful bleaching Acropora corals in the Phillipines. Dying coral reefs turn vibrant neon colors in apparent last-ditch effort to survive\nBy Sophie Lewis\nMay 22, 2020 / 4:48 PM\n/ CBS News\nScientists use mini-satellites to save coral reefs\nFor years, coral reefs around the world have been devastated by mass bleaching events as the oceans continue to warm due to climate change. ‚ÄúIf the stress event is mild enough, corals can re-establish the symbiosis with their algal partner.‚Äù\nThe internal changes that allow colorful bleaching to occur. In 2017 alone, nearly half the corals on the Great Barrier Reef died ‚Äî and experts say we are running out of time to save them. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, recent episodes of global bleaching caused by unusually warm water have resulted in high coral mortality, leaving the world‚Äôs coral reefs struggling for survival,‚Äù D‚ÄôAngelo said. Scientists emphasized that while colorful bleaching is a good sign, only a significant reduction of greenhouse gases globally ‚Äî in addition to improvement in local water quality ‚Äî can save coral reefs beyond this century.\n‚ÄúNow that we know that nutrient levels can affect colorful bleaching too, we can more easily pinpoint cases where heat stress might have been aggravated by poor water quality,‚Äù researchers said. Ryan Goehrung, University of Washington\nCoral reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine environment, including about 4,000 species of fish, 800 species of hard corals and potentially millions of other undiscovered species, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Colorful bleaching Acropora corals in New Caledonia.\nRichard Vever/The Ocean Agency/XL Catlin\nCoral animals symbiotically coexist with tiny algae, providing them with shelter, nutrients and carbon dioxide in exchange for their photosynthetic powers. Together, these actions can secure a future for coral reefs.‚Äù\nFirst published on May 22, 2020 / 4:48 PM ‚ÄúThe resulting sunscreen layer will subsequently promote the return of the symbionts. This study, published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, suggests the corals change color as a last-ditch effort to survive. ‚ÄúThis can be managed locally, whereas the ocean heat waves caused by climate change will need global leadership. Disruptions to coral reefs have far-reaching implications for ocean ecosystems.\nIt‚Äôs not just warming oceans that cause colorful bleaching. Researchers say changes in nutrient levels within coral reefs due to fertilizer run-off from farms also lead to bleaching events ‚Äî a problem that can be fixed at the local level. Experts believe only coral that has faced mild or brief disturbances, rather than extreme mass bleaching events, can attempt to save itself using this process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7be204f6-a9c3-42c6-89b3-3bb45f561bf1>","<urn:uuid:369f1095-9589-4d83-9007-35418b336092>"],"error":null}
