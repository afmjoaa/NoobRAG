{"question":"Could you explain how the adolescent brain changes during development and what behavioral signs might indicate sensory processing challenges during this age?","answer":"The adolescent brain undergoes significant changes, with brain growth peaking at age 11 for girls and 12½ for boys. During this period, nerve-signal transmissions become faster and more efficient, making the adolescent brain function like a racing car with fewer connections but faster operation. However, adolescents with Sensory Processing Disorder may show specific behavioral signs, including difficulty with motor skills, problems using both sides of the body together, challenges in planning and carrying out complex actions, and issues with fine motor skills like writing. They may also display sensory-seeking behaviors such as constant movement, touching everything, or speaking in an unusually loud voice. The combination of typical adolescent brain development and SPD can particularly affect their ability to judge consequences while dealing with their powerful sense of urgency.","context":["Discoveries in the last 10 years have given us new information on the emerging brain of newborns, the impulsive brain of adolescents, the efficient brain of the adult, and the slowed-down brain of seniors–to reach better functionality.\nResearch into the brain is one of the fastest growing fields of study in contemporary science. What we know about the brain today is vastly different than what we thought we knew just 10 years ago. And 10 years from now, it is likely that most of what we think about the brain today will have been overturned, and replaced by new knowledge. One indication of the infancy of the field is the amount of attention that is given to studying the brain (and its accompanying nervous system) in medical schools. It accounts for a mere 20%; the remaining 80% is devoted to human anatomy, physiology, and the systems of respiration, circulation and digestion.\nThanks to new imaging techniques, we can now actually look inside a living brain. From brain scans, we can see when the brain is active. We know that when the brain is alive and active, it demonstrates the attributes that we generally call intelligence. As well as having the capacity to learn, to recall, to express feelings and to conjure up thoughts and ideas, an active brain also dreams, argues beliefs, formulates discernments, makes decisions, creates behavior. We usually think about these qualities as belonging to the mind. But without the brain, the mind does not exist. The mind is, in essence, the brain in an animated state. For intelligence to grow, for emotional balance to be created, for understanding and experiencing the meaning of our individual lives–for all of what we value and cherish about what it means to be human, we need an animated brain.\nWe have long known that from the moment of birth, brain cells begin to die. This fact led to the belief that the mental decline most people experience as they age was due to the steady death of these cells. But the year 1998 was a hallmark year for brain research, as a team of American and Swedish scientists demonstrated for the first time that new brain cells are generated in adult humans. From this finding, we have scientific data that supports the notion that intelligence and mental capacity can continue to grow and expand throughout life.\nA second discovery turned another decades-long-standing theory about brain functioning, called brain specificity, upside-down, and this discovery was made from working with the brain-injured. The concept of brain specificity refers to the idea that a single portion of the brain is responsible for specific functions. Yet, this concept was disastrous for those who were either born with or incurred later in life any kind of brain injury. The theory predicts that when an area of the brain is damaged, the corresponding place in the body would be affected in terms of its function. This theory led to pessimism about recoverability from brain injury, and from this pessimism came a disinterest in exploring new methods of reversing brain damage. Whole populations of children born with brain dysfunctions were given up as un-helpable; similarly, it was thought that stroke victims could only make improvement if remedial therapy was given immediately after the stroke.\nWe now know, however, that the brain functionality is neither specific nor localized. The brain-injured children especially have taught us that lesson. Bob Doman has probably worked with more brain-damaged children than any other clinician in the country. Among the many thousands of children he has worked with, he refers to the remarkable case of a ten-year-old girl who had lost 95% of her brain. Her head was full of cerebral spinal fluid, and all that was left of her brain was a tiny little area in the forehead region. Yet, with only that much of her brain left, this child could both see and hear. She was seeing and hearing normally in spite of the fact that the primary parts of her brain that are responsible for the vision and auditory processing no longer existed.\nSimilarly, it was traditionally thought that if a stroke victim showed no improvement within the first two weeks, the paralysis and damage would be permanent. Yet, numerous recent studies have shown this long-standing supposition to be false. With new understandings of the workings of the brain, techniques have evolved that have enabled patients who had been paralyzed for more than 20 years to regain motor control.\nBecause functions of the brain are found in many different locations in the brain, there is a powerful compensatory mechanism that can be called upon to come into play. Brainercizing utilizes the findings of these recent discoveries to stimulate, balance and grow all brains–the emerging brain of newborns, the impulsive brain of adolescents, the efficient brain of the adult, and the slowed-down brain of seniors–to reach better functionality.\nTHE NEWBORN BRAIN\nThe brain is equipped with the largest amount of neurons it will ever have in utero–between the third and sixth month of gestation. After birth, the infant will enter the time when all five senses are being used. Offer a baby a rattle, and she will first look at it, using her visual sense. Then she may grab onto it, using her tactile sense. Then she will shake it, using her auditory sense. She may try to smell it, but the artificial scent of plastic will make this sensory stimulation an unpleasant one. So she will move quickly onto the next sense. She will put the rattle into her mouth, exploring her sense of taste. In the Brainercizing classes, when we work with the young brain, we especially emphasize the group of exercises we call Sensercize, and we accelerate the pace at which connections between the senses are made. Infants and children, then, become more alert, more responsive, more coordinated, and more adept at tasks.\nTHE ADOLESCENT BRAIN\nScientists have established that brain growth peaks in girls when they are 11 years old, and in boys when they are 12 ½. These changes mean that nerve-signal transmissions become faster and more efficient. One could sum up the brain functioning of adolescence as being like an efficient racing car: it has fewer connections, but operates faster. Part of the challenge of working with the adolescent brain is to balance the limited perception of long-term consequences with the powerful sense of urgency that the fast processing rate creates. When we work with adolescents in Brainercizing classes, we especially emphasize the group of exercises we call Limbercise, referring to the Limbic system in the brain, the seat of emotions. Adolescents then become more thoughtful about their actions, more in control of their impulses.\nTHE ADULT BRAIN\nMany higher cognitive skills, including judgment, emotional regulation and self-control, organization and planning, are not fully formed until adulthood. By the time we have reached our twenties, we have honed our sensory experiences. (We longer feel the urge to taste a rattle.) Taste, touch and smell have fallen into the background of the more ever-present auditory and visual senses. As adults, 90% of the conscious sensory experience we have, and 90% of the information we take into our brain will come from seeing and hearing. MRI brain scans show that white matter in the brain continues to increase until people are in their mid- to late-40s. When we work with the adult brain in Brainercize, we especially emphasize the group of exercises we call Imagercize. Individuals then become less stressed and more playful in their flights of fantasy where all things are possible.\nTHE MATURE BRAIN\nWe prefer calling it the mature brain, as opposed to the aging brain. The brain keeps growing throughout adulthood, specifically in the temporal lobe and frontal lobe–the parts of the brain that largely differentiates us from animals. This continued brain growth into late middle-age and old age can be associated with better emotional development and wisdom and perspective. But research verifies that the changes in the mature brain are much more complex: it loses reaction time, short-term memory ability and processing speed. The sensory input is weaker and less accurate in the mature brain; older adults neither see, hear, feel, taste nor smell as accurately as teenagers. In fact, in the diminishment of the fine articulation of sensory input, the mature brain begins to resemble its earliest origin: the new-born brain. Yet, in spite of these diminutions of certain abilities, complex reasoning skills improve.\nOne of the best examples of a mature brain functioning at a high level was renowned physicist Hans Berthe who, until his death in 2005, was the oldest living scientist who had worked on the atomic bomb. He also gave us the best explanation of how the sun works, His publishers apparently felt confident in his brain, as well as his health, since they signed him onto a five-year book contract when he was ninety. He fulfilled the contract, dying at the young age of 98. When we work with the mature brain in Brainercize, we especially emphasize the grouping of exercises we call Rememberercize.","Envision two unique babies.\nBenjy has been on the go since Day 1.Constantly active, frequently fretful, easily startled, and a fitful sleeper, he sure keeps his parents on their toes. Speaking of toes, he skipped crawling and walked on tiptoes at nine months! Mom and Dad are exhausted—but that's just how it is with an infant, they guess.\nValerie's parents appreciate her peaceful nature. She goes to anyone, naps often, sleeps all night, and is content being moved from car to grocery cart to stroller to house, strapped in her baby seat. Her parents notice that she's uninterested in watching it snow or grasping a rattle, but she does seem entranced with the laptop's screensaver beside her on the kitchen counter.\nTwo very different tots—one underlying disorder.\nSensory Processing Disorder (SPD) is the inefficient processing of messages from a person's body or environment received through the senses.\nChildren with SPD may be over-responsive to certain sensations, such as sudden touch or movement. However, some may be under-responsive, not noticing that the door slammed or the hammock is swaying.\nSome tots with SPD may be cravers, seeking loud noises, flickering lights, and vigorous movement.\nOthers may misjudge differences among sensations—are they moving up or down, forward or backward? Is the water hot or cold?\nMany with SPD are unusually clumsy, bumping into furniture, stumbling, and struggling to catch a beach ball or alternate feet to climb stairs.\nRather than growing out of it completely, children with severe SPD usually grow into it as they develop, sticking to regular routines and familiar environments that help them feel safe and comfortable.\nSPD is not a learning disability, but it can lead to academic and social problems, as a child may be inclined to avoid ordinary childhood experiences that are distressing, such as messy art and science projects, circle games with other children, new foods, and other sensory stimuli.\nHere are a few of the common signs of Sensory Processing Disorder in children. If your child shows one or two of these behaviors, not to worry! Therapists typically only diagnose SPD when an individual's symptoms are severe enough to negatively impact everyday life.\n• Resists being touched or held\n• Is distressed by baths, hairbrushes, and messy hands or face\n• Cannot tolerate textures of most clothing or sheets\n• Is a picky eater\n• Keeps hands fisted and won't put bare feet on the ground\n• Covers eyes or ears frequently\n• Is apprehensive of sudden movement, playground equipment, car rides, or elevators\n• Seems oblivious to irritating touch sensations like itchy fabric\n• Is unbothered by inoculations or bruises\n• Ignores loud noises\n• Does not notice when name is called\n• Does not notice when s/he is falling\n• Touches everything\n• Bumps and crashes, seeking deep pressure into skin and muscles\n• Seeks intense movement, constantly rocking, swinging, jiggling, or climbing\n• Enjoys shaking and nodding head, twirling, or being upside down\n• Sniffs objects and people\n• Puts inedible objects in mouth after 2 years of age\n• Speaks in booming voice\nInefficient sensory discrimination\n• Misjudges distance to a ledge or to moving objects such as kids swinging\n• Has difficulty seeing differences in faces, pictures, and letters such as “b\" and “d\"\n• Has difficulty hearing differences in voices, tunes, and sounds such as “g\" and “k\"\n• Gets confused when orienting limbs to get dressed\n• Can't tell if milk has soured or food is sufficiently chewed\nInefficient sensory-based motor skills\n• Has loose or “floppy\" muscle tone\n• Trips “on air\" (i.e., without an apparent obstacle)\n• Has difficulty using both sides of the body together to clap or read\n• Has difficulty thinking up, planning, and carrying out novel and complex actions, such as negotiating an unfamiliar obstacle course\n• Shows reduced fine-motor skills for drawing, writing, or articulating words\n• Shows reduced gross-motor skills for crawling, running, or climbing\nIf you think your child may be showing signs of Sensory Processing Disorder, chat with your pediatrician or ask for a referral to a pediatric occupational therapist. If you think something is amiss with your child's development, listen to your motherly instinct! No one knows your tot like you do.\nFortunately, SPD is treatable, especially when children are young and their brains are malleable.\nLooking for a few activities to introduce sensory-motor experiences and enhance your child's developmental skills at home?\nTry these hands-on, body-on activities with your little one!\n• Circle games (e.g., Hokey Pokey or Duck, Duck, Goose)\n• Resistive activities (Tug-o-War or gentle roughhousing)\n• Heavy work activities (carrying bags of potatoes and buckets of water, digging, or pushing a stroller)\n• Stretching activities (crouching like a seed and gradually “growing\")\n• Playing in tubs filled with water, sand, beans, rice, mud, shaving cream, or other ingredients pleasing to the touch\nWhether your child is diagnosed with SPD, or simply needs a little extra time to develop basic sensory-motor skills, fear not, mama! Now that you know the signs of SPD, you can stop worrying so much and seek help if necessary. In the meantime, have fun with your child, go outdoors daily, and join the ranks of parents everywhere raising “sensational\" kids."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ab8ca5eb-249b-4387-abc7-ff4e36c5eea3>","<urn:uuid:bd8133ef-c67a-4c74-b45c-a6866967340e>"],"error":null}

Together Finding Global Solutions for Global Problems”\n67th United Nations DPI NGO Conference\nUnited Nations Headquarters, New York\n22-23 August 2018\nWe, the young peoples of the world gathered at the 67th United Nations DPI/NGO Conference, join our voices and efforts to uphold the value of multilateralism and re-commit ourselves to seeking global solutions for global problems, including but not limited to, achieving the targets set forth in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nYouth, with our unique capacities and vibrant energy, are propelling humanity’s movement towards a new future. Today, millions of families are still trapped in extreme poverty, struggling to access even basic resources like education, healthcare and employment. Today, a quarter of the world’s youth still live in the shadows of violent conflict, everything from wars to human trafficking to substance abuse threaten to steal the promise of our tomorrow. And today, all on the planet earth are impacted by environmental degradation, communities of people and creatures are endangered by pollution, climate change, sea-level rising, and many other byproducts of human development. If we don’t join in concerted action now, we may not have an earth to live on tomorrow.\nThe rising generations recognize that we must work collectively, across national, generational, and other real or fabricated boundaries, to shift the current paradigm and create new global and multilateral structures, to weave a new tapestry of economic, technological, environmental and social life that can drive humanity’s evolution towards collective prosperity. We have power in numbers and when united, can demand immense change. We the Youth are taking the lead and contributing our expertise, energy, experience, passion, and creativity in implementing global solutions. It is in this spirit that we set forth this Declaration of our shared visions, commitments, and recommendations.\nWe the Youth are united in our vision for a peaceful and sustainable world. Together we affirm that:\n- Global problems are beyond the power of any single entity to tackle; partnerships are essential to create and facilitate lasting change. Multilateralism is more than partnership by multiple entities, but rather inclusive collaboration of states and non-state actors. We need to implement the new collaborative model, as described in “People-Centered Multilateralism: A Call to Action”, recognizing and respecting all peoples’ right to participate, especially those who have been traditionally underrepresented.\n- We will continue to work together and undertake sustainable actions that can benefit all of humanity; we will continue to work towards ending conflict, countering violence and building sustainable and lasting peace.\n- We share responsibility for our planet, strive to live in harmony with nature, and must work to minimize the human-made effects of climate change.\n- We must create economic systems that can provide for the well-being of all, ensuring that development does not take precedence over the health of people and the planet.\n- We are one in our humanity, with natural and inalienable human rights, including the right to determine our future; civic participation must also be a right ensured to all.\n- We work to remove all forms of discrimination against sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, religion, physical appearance, political affiliation, other-abled individuals, which are all counterproductive to progress.\n- We must be included in decision-making at all levels of political processes and structured mechanisms for youth participation must be incorporated into all public institutions.\nWe pledge to commit our abilities, efforts, and heart to:\n- Increase awareness of and work persistently towards the accomplishment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, their corresponding targets, and the commitments set forth in the Gyeongju Youth Declaration.\n- Become active global citizens supporting our peers across their spectrum of needs, from ending poverty in all dimensions, supporting women and girls, to quests for public office and other leadership positions in service of the community. We also proactively demand space for youth in all public fora.\n- Become more conscious of the effects of our own consumption activities and make responsible decisions in our daily lives that can help in achieving Agenda 2030.\n- Increase awareness of and advocate for human rights in our work, honor all life with respect, and join together to fight the injustices committed against youth across the world;\n- Contribute to the repositioning of the UN Development System and improvement of other international bodies, making them more progressive, fair, sustainable, effective, youth-friendly, and shouldering our share of the responsibility in shaping the future of our world.\n- Serve as open partners, sharing our technology, information, knowledge and skills with those who can benefit from them and creating opportunities for intergenerational partnerships, learning from friends and spreading best practices.\n- Help create safe spaces of expression for those who are left out of the existing political system, including but not limited to residents of conflict-ridden areas, migrants, displaced people, refugees, stateless people, and other groups in vulnerable situations.\n- Draw on our advantageous position as youth to facilitate peacebuilding, reconciliation, and the cultivation of new communities.\nFully understanding that in order to achieve a paradigm shift, we need more than just personal action. By resonating the hopes of youth around the world, we, with a unified voice, call upon:\n- States and other entities committed in multilateral agreements to deliver their promises and to be trustworthy partners to ensure stability in the rules-based international order.\n- States and non-state actors to augment diversity and inclusion across all spectra in their decision-making process, making sure that those most impacted are part of the deliberations, understanding that superficial tokenism does not foster true partnership.\n- States to ensure access to quality and culturally-relevant education for all, reaching even the most vulnerable communities, providing the materials and knowledge to cultivate independent learners.\n- States to integrate Agenda 2030 into all facets of their education curricula, considering informal, non-formal, experiential, service-based and interdisciplinary education as emphasized elements of the learning experience.\n- States to consciously design their education systems to enhance global citizenship by fostering inclusivity, developing leadership, and encouraging innovation and creativity in youth.\n- States to address youth unemployment as a priority by investing in workforce development, creating green jobs, internships, and apprenticeships, supporting entrepreneurship; and to implement effective workplace policies to protect youth from exploitation.\n- Everyone to respect youth as equal partners in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n- Everyone to consider environmental consequences, including those affecting life on land, life below water, and the global climate, and to prioritize the use of renewable energy and technology.\n- Governments to increase financial resources for public health concerns, such as mental health and wellness, drug use and addictions, family planning, wireless radiation, reducing cancer risk amongst the youth, and the global obesity epidemic.\n- All levels of government to dedicate time, space, and resources to develop localized plans that achieve the targets of the SDGs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4cb2ca50-5689-46b4-a409-bb68ab7203bb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which safety measure is more comprehensive: the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requirements for chemical labeling or the safety protocols for solvent handling in workshops?","answer":"The safety protocols for solvent handling are more comprehensive, covering multiple specific aspects of safety. While the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard primarily focuses on labeling requirements, accessibility of safety data sheets, and employee training, solvent safety protocols include detailed guidelines for storage, ventilation, handling in hot weather, fire prevention, explosion prevention, proper respiratory protection, and specific behavioral restrictions (like not operating machinery or climbing ladders after exposure). The solvent protocols also address multiple hazard types including fire, explosions, health effects, and even specific situations like dust particle interactions.","context":["Hazard Communication Standard Basic Outline Requirements\nEmployees have the right to know about the dangers of hazardous chemicals they use or are exposed to in the workplace and how to protect themselves. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires companies to provide this information. The standard outlines key tasks that companies must complete and chemical information they must gather to assure a hazard communication plan that is workplace specific and beneficial to employees.\nThe hazard communication process starts with chemical manufacturers and importers. They are required to identify and classify the hazards of their chemical products and provide this information to product users. This information can be in the form of safety data sheets and labels. You can use supplier information in developing your company’s hazard communication plan.\nWorkplace Chemical List\nTo kick start the hazard communication process, companies need to create a list of hazardous chemicals that employees are exposed to during the course of their jobs. Hazardous chemicals are defined by certain harmful characteristics. If a chemical presents a physical or health hazard, is a combustible dust, an asphyxiant or a gas that ignites spontaneously, then is it hazardous. Include chemicals that fit into any of these categories on your workplace chemical list.\nSafety Data Sheets\nSafety data sheets provide details about chemical hazards and safety precautions. You must have a current safety data sheet for every chemical on your workplace chemical list and make them readily accessible to employees in their work areas. Safety data sheets can be in paper or electronic form. Employees must know the location of paper copies or how to gain access to electronic copies.\nContainers of hazardous chemicals in the workplace must be labeled. Labels must be legible, identify the chemical and provide adequate hazard warnings. You should devise a system that makes sure containers of hazardous chemicals are always properly labeled. You must also advise employees not to tamper with, deface of remove container labels.\nEmployees must be trained on chemical hazards and safe use practices. You must teach them how to read and interpret chemical safety data sheets and container labels. Employees need to understand the nature of the hazards, how to avoid the hazards or how to protect themselves. They must also know exposure warning signs and what to do if exposed to a hazardous chemical. Your training must cover routine and non-routine operations.\nWritten Communication Plan\nA written hazard communication plan is mandatory. Your written plan must be specific to your company operations. The plan must cover how the workplace chemical list will be maintained, how chemical labeling requirements will be met, how safety data sheets will be maintained and how employees will be trained. You must also address how the communication plan will be maintained and updated.\nBecause some states have approved OSHA programs, there may be additional hazard communication requirements. State approved programs can have more stringent requirements, such as annual employee training or annual update and certification of the workplace chemical list. If you are in an OSHA approved state program, you must check for any state right-to-know requirements.\n- Medioimages/Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images","Many solvents pose serious health and safety hazards, and the government is increasingly regulating worker exposure and overall usage. Epoxy users commonly use solvents to dissolve epoxy from tools and to degrease surfaces before bonding. Solvents’ ability to dissolve and degrease is part of why they are hazardous to your health. They leach oils from the skin and break down protective fatty layers. This makes skin more susceptible to dermatitis. While dermatitis is the most common skin problem solvents cause, it doesn’t stop there.\nOnce solvents have penetrated the protective skin layers, they may quickly find their way into the blood stream. You can absorb toxic amounts in this way. If you use solvent to clean epoxy from your skin, your skin can absorb both the solvent and the dissolved epoxy. This will intensify epoxy exposure.\nAlmost all solvents are toxic if you swallow, absorb or inhale enough. Solvents can irritate your respiratory system, eyes, and skin. Some solvents may damage your heart, liver, and other vital organs. Several solvents have been linked to cancer.\nRepeatedly inhaling low to moderate levels of solvents can irritate the respiratory tract. Because of their drying effect, solvents can also interfere with the lung’s natural ability to clean themselves of impurities. When inhaled in high concentrations, solvents may depress the central nervous system. This is called narcosis. Symptoms of overexposure range from nausea and irritability to something that resembles alcohol intoxication. Continued overexposure to particularly toxic solvents can lead to loss of consciousness, permanent brain damage and death.\nSome solvents give off a strong odor when highly concentrated, while others do not. Even for those that do, you may not notice the odor after you are exposed to it for a few hours, or if you have a cold. If you notice a strong odor while using a solvent, vapors may already be too highly concentrated and you will need to ventilate more or use a supplied-air respirator. Many milder solvents are being developed to replace the more hazardous solvents. If the manufacturer of solvent claims its product can be used on the skin, you should follow instructions carefully, and wash afterward with warm, soapy water.\nOSHA sets Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for chemicals, based on the amount or vapor level a worker can safely be exposed to in a given time period. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists also sets exposure levels based on an 8-hour time-weighted average, called Threshold Limit Values or TLVs. These values are expressed in parts of contaminant per million parts of air.\nAlways select the least toxic and least flammable solvent that will get the job done. Avoid solvents completely if at all possible.\nDo not smoke or use equipment that may generate sparks near solvent vapors or solvent storage areas. Store solvents in tightly closed, approved containers. Store them a safe distance from any ignition source and out of children’s reach.\nUse solvents only in well-ventilated areas. Bring fresh air into your shop and exhaust solvent laden air. In confined areas, wear the appropriate respiratory protection. If you can, set up a basic mechanical ventilation scheme for all projects calling for solvents.\nTake special care in hot weather, when solvents evaporate quickly and are more likely to ignite.\nDo not operate power machinery or climb ladders if you have been working with solvents in a confined area. If you feel drowsy, nauseated, *high* or irritable while using solvents, immediately move to an area of fresh air. First aid for unconsciousness resulting from overexposure to solvent vapors is fresh air.\nMost solvents are extremely flammable. By themselves, in paints, or other products, solvents cause many shop fires. The fire hazards that solvents pose may be their greatest threat, to both human health and property. You must follow basic shop safety rules whenever you use them. Research the flash points and evaporation rates, and use adequate ventilation. Remove all ignition sources. The table below lists some important comparative health and flammability information for solvents commonly used in the shop.\nAn explosion can happen when solvent vapors mix with high concentrations of fine dust particles suspended in the air. Even by itself, wood dust is explosive. The finer the dust particle, the greater the chance of explosion. Also, as temperatures increase, an explosion can happen at lower solvent vapor concentrations. One worker, hand sanding, could not raise enough dust to cause an explosion, but several people operating power sanding equipment could.\nAn open flame can set off an explosion, as can an accidental charge of static electricity or a spark from a combustion engine, light switch or power tool. Some fine powders and fillers can generate enough static electricity to ignite a flammable atmosphere. When handling large quantities of powdered material, keep airborne concentrations to a minimum and use grounding devices on transfer equipment.\nDust from partially cured epoxy can cause respiratory problems if inhaled, and dermatitis if allowed to settle on skin. Dust from fully cured epoxy is chemically inert and considered a nuisance dust from a health hazard standpoint. However, enough cured epoxy dust suspended in the air could creat a combustible dust atmosphere.\nDust from woods commonly used with epoxy, such as cedar, redwood, mahogany and teak, can cause allergic skin and respiratory reactions. Wood saps and oils contain irritants. These allergens are reduced as lumber dries, so it is always better to work with seasoned wood.\nDust from minerals, such as asbestos and crystalline (not amorphous) silica are dangerous because of their shape, which makes them difficult to expel from the lungs. This is also true of airborne glass, carbon and similar fibers, coming from cutting and handling glass tape or cloth, or from sanding or grinding a fiberglass composite. Use these materials only with adequate ventilation and appropriate respiratory protection, such as an approved particulate dust mask. For comfort and safety, avoid inhaling these dust!\nThe following sensible shop suggestions may help to reduce exposure to epoxy dust, wood dust and fillers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0405083c-9187-4afa-b7cb-8c1e076e1508>","<urn:uuid:db55812f-8784-41f2-931f-46abce06943d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between placing flowers in Islamic and Buddhist funerals? Break it down by purpose and rules.","answer":"In Islamic funerals, placing flowers on a grave (not coffin) is considered sunnah because flowers recite tasbih to Allah and may help lessen the deceased's punishments. However, placing flowers on coffins is haram as it's considered a non-Muslim ritual. In Buddhist funerals, flowers are used to symbolize honor and grief, with white flowers being the traditional symbol of mourning. Mourners are expected to bring flowers to present near the altar as a show of respect, though red flowers are inappropriate as they symbolize happiness.","context":["Assalamualaikum Datuk Mufti, sorry but I want to ask.

From Abdullah bin Abbas R.Anhuma, the Prophet PBUH once passed by two graves of people who were tortured:\nإِنَّهُمَا لَيُعَذَّبَانِ وَمَا يُعَذَّبَانِ فِي كَبِيرٍ أَمَّا أَحَدُهُمَا فَكَانَ لاَ يَسْتَتِرُ مِنَ البَوْلِ وَأَمَّا الآخَرُ فَكَانَ يَمْشِي بِالنَّمِيمَةِ ثُمَّ أَخَذَ جَرِيدَةً رَطْبَةً فَشَقَّهَا بِنِصْفَيْنِ ثُمَّ غَرَزَ فِي كُلِّ قَبْرٍ وَاحِدَةً فَقَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ لِمَ صَنَعْتَ هَذَا فَقَالَ: \"لَعَلَّهُ أَنْ يُخَفَّفَ عَنْهُمَا مَا لَمْ يَيْبَسَا\".\n\"They are being tortured not for a great thing (to avoid). One of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine, while the other was going about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends). He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you done so?\" He replied, \"I hope that their punishment may be lessened till they (the leaf) become dry.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari (218)\nSyeikh Abu Bakar Uthman al-Dimyathi al-Bakri stated in his writing:\nيُسَنُّ وَضْعُ جَرِيْدَةٍ خَضْرَاءَ عَلَى الْقَبْرِ لِلْإ تِّباَعِ وَلِأَنَّهُ يُخَفِّفُ عَنْهُ بِبَرَكَةِ تَسْبِيْحِهَا وَقيِسَ بِهَا مَا اعْتِيْدَ مِنْ طَرْحِ نَحْوِ الرَّيْحَانِ الرَّطْبِ\n“It is sunnah to place green leaves of date tree, for it will lessen the punishments of the deceased through the blessing of its recitation of tasbih and this is equated with the custom of scattering fresh and sweet-smelling flowers on a grave.”\n(Refer I’anah al-Thalibin, 2/119)\nThus, the conclusion is, in Islam, placing flowers on a grave is sunnah for it is an intermediary medium for it would always recite tasbih to Allah SWT. Hopefully, for the tasbih recited by the flowers that Allah SWT would bless the deceased and lessen the deceased’s punishments.\nReferring back to the question asked, what is the ruling of gifting and placing flowers on the coffin of a deceased?\nAccording to the teachings of the Christians, flowers are used to symbolize grieve and sadness. In fact, there is not much difference with the teachings of Buddhism. In a funeral ceremony, gifting flowers is a symbol of honouring the deceased. It is greatly appreciated when we are visiting the house or grave of the deceased. However, it is inappropriate in funeral homes. White flowers are the traditional symbol of grief. Red flowers are a symbol of happiness and celebration and is inappropriate to be a gift during times of mourning. (Refer A Guide to a Proper Buddhist Funeral, pg. 12; Theravadin Buddhist Chinese Funeral, pg. 11)\nIn answering the above question, in our opinion, gifting and placing flowers on the coffin of a deceased is haram in Islam for it is a part of non-Muslims’ ritual in their funeral ceremony. Especially when the intention of the person placing the flowers is to ask for forgiveness from Allah SWT and bless the deceased, then it is haram. Allah SWT states:\nمَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْ يَسْتَغْفِرُوا لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ كَانُوا أُولِي قُرْبَى مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَابُ الْجَحِيمِ\n“It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire.”\nSurah al-Tawbah (113)\nThe same is stated by Imam al-Nawawi who said:\nوأما الصلاة على الكافر والدعاء له بالمغفرة فحرام بنص القرآن والإجماع\n“As for praying for disbelievers and supplicating that their sins are forgiven is haram according to the Quran and consensus of scholars.” (Refer al-Majmu’ Syarh Muhazzab, 5/120)\nOur advice, if a person is forced to place flowers on the coffin of a non-Muslim deceased, then he should just place it without any intention. May Allah SWT guide us with His guidance. Amin.","5 Important Buddhist Funeral Customs and Rituals in Singapore\nIt is important to understand the various customs and rituals when planning for a Buddhist funeral. One important aspect that plays a big role in these customs is the idea of reincarnation. Death is viewed as a transitory state from one life to the next that brings the soul ever closer to Nirvana. In this article, we look at the top five Buddhist funeral customs in Singapore that ought to be kept in mind when planning a traditional Buddhist funeral.\n1. Funeral Space for Buddhism\nBuddhist funeral Services Singapore takes place in a funeral home and not in a temple. The whole funeral is quite simple and dignified and is held within a week after death. The viewing takes place for a night amidst incense and candlelight. It is usually held the evening before the funeral. In Singapore, most Chinese Buddhist will book a funeral venue for the ceremony to be conducted. It can be near the house area of the deceased or it can also be held in Funeral parlour. Commonly seen at HDB void decks, tentages are often a set-up for the funeral services to be conducted. Such an arrangement requires booking of space with the housing board managed by the Singapore Government.\n2. Buddhist Funeral Service\nIn Singapore, Buddhist Funeral customs and rites are often led by monks. During the service, the family sits nearer to the front, greeting all those who come to honour the deceased. Mourners go to the casket to approach the casket quietly with their hands folded in a praying position and show their respect for the dead by bowing in front of the altar. A portrait of the deceased is usually placed at the altar, in front of the casket. Visitors of the wake should approach the altar and pay their last respect and condolences. Monks would then led the funeral ceremony with prayers and food offerings such as fruits and vegetables. A period of meditation takes place during the ceremony to reflect on the life of the departed. The entire Buddhist funeral service usually lasts between three to five days.\n3. Funeral Rites and customs\nDuring the cremation ceremony which takes place on the morning of the burial/cremation, monks are invited as per Buddhist funeral traditions. They chant verses, eulogies and give sermons thereby aiding the family with the whole ceremony. Organ donation is not prohibited since it is seen as a way of helping others. However, the medical practitioner is expected to wait for at least three to four days before the autopsy since it is believed that the soul departs the body during this period. While embalming is a common custom for Buddhist Funeral in Singapore, mourners are advised to wear white as it symbolizes sympathy and grief. Since the traditional Buddhist belief is that it takes 49 days before reincarnation of the deceased, prayers will be conducted by the same monk. Buddhist funeral etiquette is similar to that of Taoist funeral in Singapore, where in both religions, it is believed that after the 49th day, the deceased will reincarnate. The 49th day, Buddhist funeral prayer will be conducted by the monk with a series of chanting. Whereas, Taoist funeral customs are led by priests, a Taoist ritual, known as “Gong Teck” which consists of burning of paper house.\n4. Burial and Cremation\nChinese Buddhists allow the families to either bury or cremate the dead as per their family custom. Once the ceremonies get over, the casket bearing the dead is taken to the burial site which is often on a hillside via a funeral procession. In Singapore, land burial site is at Lim Chu Kang Cemetery. While the casket is being lowered into the ground, it is customary that the family looks away as a show of respect. During cremation, it is a traditional custom for the family to witness the cremation. In Singapore, regardless of land burial or cremation, post-funeral rituals and chanting must be performed by a monk.\n5. Proper Buddhist Funeral Etiquettes\nIn Singapore, mourners can either send sympathy cards or white flowers to the family after learning of the death of their loved one. Chinese customs include giving condolence money to help ease the funeral spendings of the affected family. However, anything red should be avoided. Gifts, donations, or food can also be sent as a show of respect and charity. During the funeral, it is expected to bring flowers to present to the family as a show of honour and respect. These should be placed near the altar. Mourners are also expected to join in the chanting and meditation that takes place during the funeral and should refrain from documenting the ceremony.\nThese are the five most unique aspects of Buddhist funeral customs. With this information, you can now understand how to prepare for the Buddhist funeral and follow the etiquettes that go along with it."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a58249e4-2e69-4614-8ee5-bc94da6e92a9>","<urn:uuid:a4ffddd2-22dd-463b-977d-d46dc20c3f4a>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Hey garden experts! I'm trying to use ducks for pest control - what benefits do they offer for slug control and what's the biology behind slugs that makes them such persistent pests? 🦆","answer":"Ducks are excellent natural pest controllers for slugs, offering several benefits. They are efficient slug-hunters, providing chemical-free pest control while also fertilizing your garden with their droppings. Additionally, they help maintain ecological balance by keeping slug populations low without completely eliminating them. As for slug biology, these creatures are highly resilient due to several adaptations - they have up to 27,000 tiny sharp teeth on their radula for feeding, produce copious amounts of protective slime that helps them move and stay moist, and are most active at night in wet conditions. They can live for up to 6-7 years in some species and can lay several hundred eggs multiple times per year, which explains their persistent presence in gardens.","context":["Anyone who owns animals always wants to give them the best. We’ve all heard time and time again which foods we can’t feed ducks at the pond, so it’s good to be cautious about what you’re offering—or what your own ducks are allowed to get into!\nDo ducks eat slugs and snails?\nYes! Ducks are excellent slug-hunters, and many gardeners and hobby farmers recommend using ducks as a pest control method.\nSnails, slugs, and other insects are also a great source of nutrients (especially protein) for your ducks and help them to grow.\nSo if you’ve got a nasty slug infestation in your garden or you want to give your ducks a more natural diet, keep reading to find out more information on ducks, their eating habits, and other benefits they can bring to your garden or farm.\nBenefits of Eating Slugs and Snails\nThough it may seem a little gross to you, snails are a great source of nutrition for ducks. Here’s a snapshot of the nutritional value of a snail:\n- High protein content. Snails are a great source of protein. The protein content of a snail is quite similar to beef or pork.\n- Low fat content. You don’t have to worry about your ducks gorging too much on snails because they’re also low in fat.\n- Iron. Iron helps your duck’s red blood cells stay healthy and carry oxygen through their blood.\n- Calcium. This is especially beneficial to laying ducks because the formation of eggs requires a lot of calcium. Not only that, but calcium benefits a duck’s bones, wings, and muscle formation.\n- Vitamin A. Snails are an excellent source of vitamin A. This vitamin has several important functions for your ducks, including strengthening the immune system, developing and maintaining vision, and manufacturing red blood cells.\n- Omega-3 Fatty Acids. This essential fatty acid is a building block of cell membranes and can help reduce inflammation.\n- Minerals. Snails contain other minerals such as magnesium and selenium. Selenium is a powerful antioxidant, and magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties.\nRisks of Eating Slugs and Snails\nSnails and slugs can benefit ducks, but are there any risks?\nIf you’ve been using pesticides on your garden to keep away slugs and snails, don’t let your ducks get into it. These chemicals can also hurt your animals if they ingest snails or slugs that have been exposed to the pesticide.\nIf you want to let your ducks into your garden, go pesticide-free. Ducks are so efficient at catching slugs and snails that you won’t need them anyway. But, if you’re interested in implementing ducks as a pest-control method, keep reading.\nSnails and slugs can serve as the intermediate host for parasites that can infect your ducks, such as the gapeworm. The gapeworm infects the tracheas of birds and obstructs the airway. In severe cases, this can even cause asphyxiation.\nIf you want your ducks to have access to slugs and snails in your garden, you can reduce the risk of gapeworm by tilling the soil in your duck’s pen to reduce residual infection and administering a dewormer to your ducks every 15-30 days.\nAre Certain Slugs Dangerous For Ducks to Eat?\nSlugs may become dangerous for ducks to consume if they are very large.\nSince slugs produce a sticky, mucousy coating, a slug that is too large for your duck could become stuck in its throat. So use caution when letting your ducks loose, and keep an eye on the size of those slugs.\nWhat Other Insects Can Ducks Eat?\nDucks love slugs and snails, but they can eat many other kinds of insects, too.\n- Earthworms. Ducks love snatching worms from the dirt on a rainy day.\n- Potato Beetles. These tiny beetles can make quick work of your garden by devouring your plants, but ducks love to eat them.\n- Grasshoppers. Another pest that ducks can help you get rid of.\n- Mosquitoes. Ducks don’t eat the adult mosquito, but they do consume the water-dwelling pupa stage, preventing adults from developing in the first place.\n- Grubs. Like the mosquito pupa, ducks also love snacking on all kinds of beetle larva.\nCan Ducks Digest Snail Shells?\nYes! If you’ve ever watched a duck eat, you know that they aren’t too discriminating with what and how fast they swallow their food—all without chewing anything. So what happens to the shells?\nDucks, like other birds, swallow rocks and grit to help them crush food items like seeds or shells. These rocks are stored in their gizzard and, with the help of their powerful muscles, crush the shells so they can be digested.\nUsing Ducks as Pest Control\nLetting your ducks into your garden is a popular method of pest control. As we’ve seen above, ducks love eating common garden pests like slugs, snails, and other insects.\nSo what other benefits do they offer? Are there any risks to using ducks as a pest control method?\nIt’s All Natural\nDucks can get rid of pests without pesticides, which makes this method of pest control safe and eco-friendly. Ducks also provide excellent fertilizer for your garden with their droppings, so it’s a two-for-one deal!\nWhen they aren’t foraging for pests, ducks will graze on your lawn, endlessly foraging to sate their neverending appetites. Due to their help, you won’t have to mow your lawn as often.\nObliterating an entire population of slugs or snails can have a bit of an opposite effect. If all the slugs are gone from an area, their predators will also move on to greener pastures. Due to the lack of predators, the slug population explodes. Ducks will keep the population low enough without eliminating it completely, avoiding this issue.\nWhat Not to Feed Your Ducks\nNow that you know all the benefits of slugs and snails, are there any foods you should avoid feeding to your ducks?\nA few foods of concern are listed below, but you can find a more comprehensive list here.\n- Bread. Even though ducks love to eat them, staple human foods like bread and crackers aren’t a good choice. These offer no nutritional value to ducks and can cause malnutrition if they consume too much.\n- Citrus Fruit. These fruits interfere with your duck’s ability to absorb calcium, which is a critical nutrient. If ducks don’t have sufficient calcium, they’ll produce very thinly shelled eggs.\n- Raw, Dried Beans. These are toxic to ducks! Canned beans should also be avoided due to their high sodium content.\n- Onions. They are toxic to ducks and can cause hemolytic anemia in birds.\n- Avocados. The skin, leaves, and the pit of avocados are highly toxic to ducks, but the whole fruit should be avoided in general.\nIf you are ever in doubt about what to feed your duck, or you think your duck may have ingested something toxic, be sure to consult with your veterinarian.","Slugs: Interesting Facts, Mucus Slime, and Pest Control\nSlugs in Human Lives\nSlugs get little respect from most people. They are usually thought of as slimy, very unappealing creatures and annoying garden and agricultural pests. Not all slugs are pests, however. After careful observation and study, a person may decide that they are actually interesting animals. Some people even keep them as pets.\nSlugs produce copious amounts of slime. Many people think that the slime is gross, but it has some impressive properties. Researchers are investigating these properties to see if they can be helpful for us.\nShould it be necessary to remove slugs from an area in order to protect plants, some type of pest control will be necessary. Removal of the animals can be safe for the environment and humane, depending on how it's done.\nThe Body of a Slug\nA slug has a soft, elongated body. The head has two pairs of tentacles, which can be retracted. The top tentacles are longer. They have eyes at their tips that can detect light, but the eyes can’t form an image. The lower tentacles are sensitive to smell. Both pairs of tentacles are also sensitive to touch. They wave gently through the air as the slug moves, sensing the environment as it travels. The tentacles can be regrown if they're lost.\nBehind the head is a fleshy lobe known as the mantle. The mantle has an opening called the pneumostome, which leads to the slug’s single lung and is used for breathing. The pneumostome is usually on the right side of the mantle.\nThe anus and the genital opening are located underneath the mantle. These openings aren’t located near the rear of the body as they are in many animals because of a phenomenon called torsion. Torsion takes place in the larval stage of the slug's development. The visceral mass of the animal contains its internal organs and is twisted 180 degrees during torsion.\nSlugs don’t have a single structure that can be called a brain, but they do have ganglia distributed around their body. A ganglion (the singular of ganglia) is often described as a “knot” of nerves. The ganglia of a slug are connected to each other, forming a nerve network.\nDiet and Life\nSlugs eat fresh or decaying plant parts and fungi. They may also eat insects, worms, carrion, animal droppings, kitchen scraps, and pet food. Some species eat other slugs.\nA slug’s mouth contains a structure called a radula, which is covered by rows of tiny and sharp teeth. The teeth are used for cutting and scraping or for grabbing hold of active prey like worms. There can be up to 27,000 teeth on the radula.\nSlugs are most active at night when their surroundings are wet. They may be active in winter in mild climates but hibernate if it gets too cold. Some species die at the end of a season, living for only a few months, but others can live for six or seven years and need one or two years to mature.\nA slug contains both male and female reproductive organs and is therefore known as a hermaphrodite. During mating, two animals entwine, exchange sperm, and then separate. The leopard slug has a very unusual and impressive mating ritual. A pair of slugs climb a tree or shrub and then lower themselves towards the ground on a string of mucus. Mating happens in midair before the animals continue their journey to the ground. Not only do the slugs entwine, but their reproductive organs do, too.\nOnce sperm have been transferred from one slug to another, the sperm fertilize the eggs inside the animal’s body. A few to several hundred eggs are laid, depending on the species. The eggs are generally white or transparent and are deposited in sheltered areas, such as in soil or under leaves or logs. Several batches of eggs may be produced in a year. The adult doesn’t guard the eggs once they're laid. The eggs stay dormant until the environment is suitable for them to hatch.\nIn Borneo, a green and yellow slug called Ibycus rachelae has been found to use “love darts’ when it's preparing to mate. The darts are needle or harpoon-shaped structures made of calcium carbonate. A slug releases a dart when it contacts another member of its species. The dart enters the second slug and injects a hormone that increases the chance of successful reproduction.\nThe David Attenborough video below shows the amazing courtship of the leopard slug.\nComposition and Nature of the Slime\nSlug slime contains water, mucus, and salts. Mucus is made of mucins, which are proteins with attached carbohydrates. They are able to form sticky, moisture-trapping gels when they're added to water. Slug slime is said to be hygroscopic due to its ability to absorb water. It also has the ability to change its consistency when pressure is applied and has elastic properties.\nFresh slug slime is hard to wash off our skin due to its stickiness and hygroscopic nature. Although it may be tempting to immediately reach for soap and water if we're covered with the slime, it's easier to let the material dry and then rub our hands together. The slime will form little balls that are easy to remove.\nFunctions of Slug Slime\nThe soft slug body dries out quickly if it's not protected. Slugs deal with this dilemma by secreting copious amounts of slime from skin glands, which keeps the skin moist and acts as a barrier against desiccation. Even so, the animals are usually seen in damp environments rather than dry ones and are most active at night. Many slugs spend a lot of time underground.\nThe slime also plays a vital role in locomotion. The lower surface of a slug’s body contains many slime-secreting glands. The material released by these glands allows the animal to stick to surfaces—even vertical ones—as it moves by a series of muscular waves in the body. This movement is known as adhesive locomotion. A slug sticks part of its body to the ground with its slime, uses its muscles to move its body forward, and then pulls its body away from the adhesion. More slime is released and the process is repeated. The slime also helps to prevent injury when a slug travels over rough surfaces containing stones or sticks.\nA trail of glistening slime remains after a slug has passed through an area. The trail contains chemicals that can be detected by other slugs, indicating where the trail-layer has gone. This can be especially useful if a slug wants to find a mate. In some species, different chemicals appear in the slime during the mating season. The chemicals sometimes attract predator slugs, which is unfortunate for the prey.\nResearch and Potential Applications\nScientists and engineers working in the area of robotics are very interested in the relative roles of slug slime and muscles in controlling movement. The engineers are creating experimental biomimetic robots—ones that operate according to principles discovered in animals—based on their research.\nResearchers are also studying the properties of slug slime with the aim of creating a similar material for human use. The slime has the unusual characteristic of changing its consistency as a slug moves over it. Its very adhesive nature allows slugs to move over a wide variety of textures at a wide variety of angles, even while hanging in an inverted position in some cases. The material is inspiring scientists in their effort to create a new type of surgical adhesive.\nSlug are often thought of as animals with dull colours. Brightly coloured yellow, pink, and blue slugs exist, however.\nUnusual Slugs: Banana and Pink\nThree species in the genus Ariolimax are referred to as banana slugs. They are interesting and attractive animals. The animals are bright yellow to greenish yellow in colour and sometimes have black blotches. They live in the Pacific Coast region of North America from Alaska to California.\nThe banana slug is the second largest slug in the world and may reach a length of almost ten inches, although most adults are six to eight inches in length. (The largest slug in the world is Limax cinereoniger, which is found in Europe and may reach a length of nearly twelve inches.) The slime of a banana slug contains an anesthetic. A predator that grabs hold of the animal would feel their mouth go numb and might drop the slug without harming it.\nOn Mount Kaputar in Australia is the strangest slug so far discovered—a bright, neon pink species known as Triboniophorus aff. graeffei. As far as is known, the species reaches a length of up to eight inches. It's thought to be related to the red triangle slug, which is found elsewhere in Australia, although it's not identical to its relative. The pink slug lives only on an isolated mountain top but is locally abundant.\nAlthough it’s understandable that farmers and gardeners would want to wage war on the slugs destroying their plants, many types of slugs do not attack domestic plants. Pest species can create a lot of damage, but unless slugs are interfering with human lives in some way there is no need to kill them.\nSometimes it is necessary to get rid of the animals, however, such as in cases where important plants are being killed. There are many methods of control, some of which are better than others. Both natural and chemical methods can be useful.\nHand Picking to Get Rid of Slugs\nThe kindest way to remove slugs and the safest method for the environment, wildlife, pets, and children is to collect the animals by hand and transport them to another place. This is the method that I use. It works well for me. If I had a major slug problem I might need to use other control methods, however. I've described some of these methods below. I haven't used them myself, but they seem to be worth trying.\nAttracting the slugs to a particular area would make the job of collecting them easier. Placing the rind of a grapefruit on the soil at night reportedly attracts the animals. People also report success when they create a shallow pit covered with a board to keep the inside of the pit humid. Slugs are said to be attracted to the pit because of the moisture and enter it through the gap left for them.\nCarpathian blue slugs (Bielzia coerulans) are yellow with as juveniles. They become a beautiful light to dark blue colour as adults. The animals are found in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe.\nDrowning and Salting\nA popular way to trap and kill slugs is to put a small quantity of beer in a container such an empty yogurt tub and then bury the tub in soil with just the rim exposed. Slugs are said to be attracted by the odour of the beer. They may climb into the tub and drown. Tubs should be cleared of dead animals every day. Water containing sugar and yeast is said to have the same effect as beer.\nSprinkling salt on a slug also kills it. The salt draws water out of the animal, causing dehydration. This method of removing slugs is not the best from a gardener's point of view, since it increases the salt content of the soil. In addition, it's almost certainly a very unpleasant way for the animal to die.\nRed triangle slugs (Triboniophorus graeffei) have only two tentacles instead of four, a variable background colour, and a distinctive mark on their back.\nCreating an Abrasive Barrier\nCreating a physically repellent and abrasive barrier around plants might help to control slugs. Abrasive materials that may work include coffee grounds, broken egg shells, and diatomaceous earth. A large amount of barrier material arranged in a deep and wide band may be required in order to be effective, however. The University of California Integrated Pest Management Program recommends that the barrier be one inch high and three inches wide.\nThe caffeine in coffee grounds may act as a neurotoxin for slugs, perhaps increasing the effectiveness of a coffee barrier. Egg shells must be clean and dry before they're used. In addition, the inner membrane of the shell must be removed. Some people say that they have found coffee grounds and egg shells helpful for slug control while others say that these materials are useless. The University of Minnesota says that diatomaceous earth is moderately useful and that it \"is most effective when used in dry conditions and has little effect when it absorbs moisture\".\nThere are several problems with any abrasive barrier. The first one is the necessity to create a thick barrier in an attempt to overcome the slug's protective slime. The second is that in damp weather, when slugs are most active, the barrier material may be absorbed by the wet soil. In addition, even if it's not absorbed, the material may become ineffective once it absorbs moisture. Another problem is that some barrier materials may alter the soil's properties. Egg shells raise the soil's pH, for example.\nCreating a Copper Barrier\nThe best way for a gardener to discover whether a particular abrasive barrier is helpful is to make it while following the recommendations for its creation. There may be another option for controlling slugs, however. Copper tape or foil wrapped around plant containers, trunks, or other items is said to repel the animals and may be a better choice for a barrier than an abrasive material. The exact mechanism of the repulsion isn't known, but it's thought that the copper and components of slug slime interact to give a slug an electric shock.\nTwo pesticides are commonly used to kill slugs. Both can be effective. Iron phosphate has very low toxicity for children and pets. It's sometimes classified as nontoxic. In fact, it's used as a human mineral supplement. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) classifies iron phosphate as GRAS, or Generally Recognized as Safe.\nIron phosphate pellets containing tasty food for slugs as well as the pesticide are applied as bait around plants. The slugs eat the pellets, which kill them. The poisoned animals stop feeding, hide, and eventually die. Even though the chemical is considered to be safe for children and pets, it's important to keep the bag of iron phosphate pellets out of their reach. Many chemicals are safe in small quantities but not in large amounts.\nThe second chemical pesticide that is commonly used for slugs is metaldehyde. This is much more toxic than iron phosphate and can produce some horrible symptoms in humans, as described in the Extoxnet reference below. The chemical is also very dangerous for dogs and cats. If they eat the pesticide they may die unless they are treated very soon. The chemical is dangerous for wildlife as well. In the UK, it will be banned from outdoor use in Spring 2020 for this reason.\nThe Importance of Slugs\nMany slug species play useful roles in the environment. They break down and recycle plant and animal material in the soil. They also provide food for some birds, frogs, snakes, and even mammals such as raccoons. Studying the sticky mucus and movement mechanism of the animals may enable scientists to create new materials and devices with useful applications. While slugs can certainly be pests at times, I think that their behaviour is interesting to observe.\n- Snail and slug biology and management from the University of California Integrated Pest Management Program\n- The discovery of a slug with love darts from The Guardian (The photo of the animal is the first item in the gallery.)\n- Information about slug slime and surgical glue from NPR (National Public Radio)\n- Facts about banana slug slime from Scientific American\n- A report about pink slugs in Australia from National Geographic\n- Information about Bielzia coerulans from the University of Gottingen\n- More slug facts and pest removal ideas from the University of Minnesota\n- Iron phosphate for slug control from the Florida Department of Agriculture\n- Metaldehyde dangers from the Extoxnet (Extension Toxicology Network from Cornell University and other institutions)\n- Metaldehyde ban from the Government of the UK\nThis content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional.\nQuestions & Answers\nIs slug slime harmful to humans in any way?\nAccording to researchers, slug slime itself is harmless. It’s still a good idea to wash our hands after handling a slug in case the slime has picked up something harmful from the environment. There is one situation in which the slime may be dangerous. In some places, slugs and snails may be infected by a parasite called the rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus costaricensis). The parasite may enter the slime and then enter humans if they ingest the slime, causing illness. You should do some research to see if the rat lungworm has been found where you live.Helpful 1\n© 2011 Linda Crampton"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c74ad853-3802-4256-81c3-e7a7a7852b88>","<urn:uuid:780e535c-4959-40be-915c-312bc5496c88>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Please tell me what problems can an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) fix?","answer":"An uninterruptible power supply corrects various power quality problems including: power sags (when air conditioning units turn on), power spikes (caused by lightning or power supply malfunctions), line noise (caused by nearby equipment or frequency variations), and brownouts (extended periods of under voltage).","context":["Power failures are infrequent, but nevertheless they do still occur, thus every business should review its contingency and emergency power plans.\nBy submitting your personal information, you agree that TechTarget and its partners may contact you regarding relevant content, products and special offers.\nThere are two main components in a complete emergency power system -- power generation and protection -- and these are provided by:\n- an auxiliary or emergency power system\n- an uninterruptible power supply (UPS)\nAn auxiliary or emergency power system provides generated power, usually via a diesel generator, but gas, petrol or hydrogen in the case of fuel cells may also be used. However, there's a delay before a conventional generator reaches operating power and can supply electricity. This gap in supply can cause problems for computers and the applications running on them, so a generator isn't enough to provide a reliable power supply.\nThis is where the uninterruptible power supply comes in. An uninterruptible power supply provides stored power, usually from lead-acid batteries, but it can also come from NiCad batteries and flywheel systems. Its primary roles are to provide near instantaneous protection from input power interruptions and short-term power in the event of a power failure.\nUninterruptible power supplies correct a variety of poor power quality problems. A sag in power can occur when an air conditioning unit turns on, while power spikes -- brief, high-energy bursts -- are typically caused by lightning or malfunctions in the power supply. Line noise -- usually caused by nearby equipment or frequency variations -- and brownouts -- extended periods of under voltage -- are all smoothed out and corrected by an uninterruptible power supply.\nThe short-term power supplied by an uninterruptible power supply presents enough time in which to shut down protected equipment safely, or to bring an auxiliary power source on-line, which can deliver more sustainable power. For many smaller organisations, a generator is not a viable option. Cost and maintenance are obvious issues, but there can be problems such as location, planning permission, size, noise, heat and exhaust fumes. In such a situation, choosing the best uninterruptible power supply is even more important.\nDesktop computers should be supported by an off-line uninterruptible power supply with an Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) transformer -- often described as line interactive -- or, if the organisation can afford it, a slightly more expensive on-line uninterruptible power supply . The main advantage of an on-line UPS is its ability to provide an electrical firewall between the incoming power and the equipment connected to it. An on-line uninterruptible power supply may be necessary when the power environment is noisy, such as in industrial settings, for larger equipment loads like data centres, or when operation from an extended-run backup generator is necessary, because electrical interference from other machines -- even a vacuum cleaner -- can disturb power waves. Critical servers should be protected with an on-line double conversion UPS, filtering the input power and controlling output voltage and frequency.\nWherever possible, choose an uninterruptible power supply that has the ability to initiate a controlled shut down of the equipment it's protecting, and check that it can support the equipment's load and sensitivity. The battery runtime depends on the type and size of batteries and rate of discharge -- which, in turn, is based on the type of equipment connected to it -- and for most uninterruptible power supplies is relatively short, five to 15 minutes being typical. In order to bridge longer supply interruptions, you will need extended-runtime UPSes with extra batteries.\nIn small offices, a cheaper option is to use laptops instead of desktops that are connected to the mains power via power strips, which include surge protection. This setup only requires the investment of an uninterruptible power supply for the office server. However, it is best to avoid relying on a single uninterruptible power supply, as it can be a single point of failure. It is better to use multiple smaller uninterruptible power supplies to provide greater redundant power protection.\nMany servers and more powerful desktops can accept more than one power supply, so. in the event of one power supply failing, one or more other power supplies are able to power the load. Redundancy can be further increased by connecting each power supply to its own uninterruptible power supply. This provides double protection from both a power supply failure and a UPS failure. This configuration is referred to as 2N redundancy. If the budget does not allow for two uninterruptible power supply units, then plug one power supply into the mains power via a power strip and the other into the UPS, making sure each power supply can power the entire server by itself.\nIf your operations require constant power with no breaks and high reliability, then you will need a generator or generators in addition to uninterruptible power supplies with switchgear, so the generator can start automatically on a mains failure. In such situations, seek professional advice from a company specialising in power protection.\nAlso, power supply equipment needs to be maintained. A UPS manufacturer's standard warranty is normally only two years, and UPS batteries do decline in efficiency. Regular controlled tests of the system need to be carried out to ensure power can be restored within an acceptable timeframe.\nInstalling a suitable, uninterruptible power supply is a proactive and cost-effective decision. It helps ensure profitability and employee productivity won't suffer during any type of power disruption, as you can keep your electronic systems running. Doing so also avoids lengthy recovery periods and the need to re-input data. Even if your equipment is insured, the insurance won't cover any loss of goodwill or reputation if your level of customer service is affected. Lightning rarely strikes twice, but make sure you're ready, and install either an emergency power source, or test that the one you have is up to the job.\nAbout the author:\nMichael Cobb, CISSP-ISSAP, CLAS is a renowned security author with more than 15 years of experience in the IT industry.

{"question":"How do the hydro turbines automatically adjust their vane angles based on water levels? 🤔","answer":"The vane angles in the turbine are automatically adjusted based on water levels measured at predetermined intervals.

A method for monitoring and controlling the operation of at least one hydro turbine including an adjustment of vane angles in said at least one hydro turbine for maximum utilization of available water comprising the steps of:\nsensing the level of water in a dam to determine the presence of at least first, second and third levels;\ngenerating signals in response to the level of water sensed; and\ncontrolling the operation of said at least one hydro turbine and adjusting the vane angles of said at least one hydro turbine in response to said signals generated, said step of controlling including enabling said at least one hydro turbine to be\nstarted during the presence of said first level with the vane angles thereof set to a minimum condition, said first level representing a mean start level, increasing said vane angles in response to the level of water sensed reaching or exceeding said\nsecond level, increasing said vane angles to a maximum value with respect to available water in response to the level of water sensed remaining at or exceeding said second level, and decreasing said vane angles in response to said level of water sensed\ndecreasing to said third level.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThis invention concerns a monitoring system for hydro turbines and more specifically a system for start and stop of such turbines and adjustment of the vane angles in one or several turbines.\nThe hydro turbine comprises a rotating hub provided with a number of vanes and arranged in a tube or the like for flowing water. The rotary energy obtained is transmitted to a generator for producing electric current.\nThe rotary energy generated is of course entirely dependent on the amount of flowing water as well as its potential energy, i.e. pressure head. The water amount may vay considerably which means that the turbine will operate with different volume\nflows at different times. As the turbine is designed to have a maximum efficiency at a certain flow and a certain pressure head, the energy of the water will be utilized to a greater or lesser extent.\nBy designing the vanes to be adjustable, which means that the vane angle with relation to the water flow may be varied, there is a possibility of optimizing the efficiency within a relatively wide range of water amounts.\nAn additional way to effectively utilize the water in a current is to minimize the amount of water which passes the turbine or turbines without actuating them. One solution is to arrange a number of small turbines in the plant letting many or\nfew of them operate in dependence on the available amount of water.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn order to further refine the methods mentioned above, the invention provides for a monitoring and control system for one or several turbines where at least one turbine has adjustable vanes.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\nThe invention is described more closely below with reference to the enclosed drawings in which:\nFIG. 1a is a diagrammatic representation of an exemplary groove structure depicting the various sensing levels.\nFIG. 1b is a diagrammatic representation of a generator turbine system according to this invention.\nFIG. 2a is a diagrammatic representation of control levels employed in this invention.\nFIG. 2b-2c represent left and right halves of a program for the monitoring system.\nFIG. 3 is a detailed block diagram of a hydraulic control system according to this invention.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nIn FIG. 1b of the drawings Tl and Tn are turbines having adjustable and non-adjustable vanes respectively. Gl and Gn stand for corresponding electric generators. As shown in FIG. 1a, a groove S is located in the upper part of the water dam\nwhere the different levels such as mean start level, increase vane angle level and decrease van angle/stop level are represented respectively by SL, IL and DL.\nAccording to the invention, the potential energy is best utilized if the water level is maximum above the turbines. This means that the amount of water passing the turbine must be the same as the amount of water flowing into the dam. In order\nto control this, level indication means are arranged in a control section, (having the form of a groove S), in the dam, which means measure the level at predetermined intervals. At a certain level SL, the turbine Tl is signalled to start. This turbine\nis provided with adjustable vanes which at the start moment are adjusted for a minimum water flow. If, at a later moment, the water has reached or remains at level IL, a signal is given to increase the vane angles in turbine Tl which means that more\nwater is let through and a stronger effect is obtained. If the water level continues to rise or remain at IL, the vane angles are increased to their maximum value, the maximum effect with regard to the available water amount being obtained. If then,\nthe water level continues to rise or remains at IL or above, a signal is given to start turbine TN and so on.\nIf, on the other hand, the level in the control section drops to a position DL, the angles of the vanes in Tl are decreased until a stable position has been reached and, if necessary, down to almost zero when the turbine is stopped. In a\ncorresponding way the remaining non-adjustable turbines are stopped. These, however, only have two positions, maximum or zero.\nAccording to the invention, the level in the water dam varies and the generator capacity is adapted thereto. In this way the had is utilized to the optimum and only small amounts of water will pass without being used. In practice some\ntolerances are built into the system in order to restrict the numbers of starts and stops. In addition Tl is adapted not to work when the amounts of water are too small which is a detriment to efficiency. The minimum amount of water allowed corresponds\nwith the level difference SL-IL in the groove S. If the amount of water flowing into the dam is very small, TL will operate interruptedly, the water level being varied between two values SL and DL respectively. The difference between these values should\nnot exceed 10 cm.\nThe system described above provides for one or several turbines, at least one of them having adjustable vanes. In addition, all signal processing takes place in a stationary installation above the water and separated from the turbine units which\npreferably are built together with respective generators as submersible units.\nAfter the system has been started, preferably manually, by Tl being started when the water level in the tank is high enough for start, SL, the plant is self controlled. When the turbine Tl is stopped, the vane angles automatically take positions\nwith a minimum angle, which mans that the turbine is almost closed. Thus every start begins with minimum angles.\nFIGS. 2b and 2c show left and right halves of an typical program which illustrates in detail a typical monitoring system. However, different programs are included within the scope of the invention.\nReferring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary hydraulic system is described. During normal duty, the pressure governor 3 is measuring the pressure in the accumulator 2 and operates the hydraulic pump 8 if and when it is necessary. The magnetic valves 7\nwhen selectively energized stop oil from flowing to the cylinder 9. In case of shut down, i.e., power failure or low oil level in the oil tank 12, (level switch 11) the valves 7 open and the accumulated oil in the accumulator 2 goes to the cylinder 9\nwhich closes the blades. At normal operation, the pumps and one of the magnetic valves 6 are activated at the same time pumping oil to the cylinder 9 via the non-return valves 1, where the oil flow also can be adjusted. On its way to the cylinder which\nis arranged in the propeller hub the oil has to pass a rotating coupling 10. When the cylinder 9 reaches its end position, it is sensed by one of the pressure governors 15. The sensors 15 are set below the setting of adjustable pressure limit valve 4\nwhich also operates as an emergency valve. The pressure governors 15 are connected via an electric contact to the process controller for further actions.\nIn regard to the above, it is noted that magnetic valves 6 and 7 are illustrated in such a manner that magnetic valves 6 are shown in the condition of normal operation while magnetic valves 7 are shown in a condition of operation at shutdown.\nTherefore, pressure governor 3 measures the pressure in accumulator 2 and operates the hydraulic pump 8 as necessary. Under normal conditions of operation, the magnetic valves 6 are activated so that oil from reservoir 12 is pumped through valve 6 and\nthrough the throttled adjustable non-return valves 1 to the coupling 10.\nThe magnetic valve 7, when selectively energized stops oil from flowing to the cylinder 9 in that such oil, as applied to the coupling by valves 6 and 1, may be returned to the reservoir 12 as a function of the energized condition of the magnetic\nUnder shutdown conditions, such as may occur during power failure or a low oil level in tank 12, the valves 7 open and the accumulated oil in the accumulator 2 goes to the cylinders 9 to close the turbine blades. Under shutdown conditions, as\nthus specified when the magnetic valves 7 are open, a path from the accumulator 2 through the valves 6 and 1 to the coupling 10 is clearly indicated in FIG. 3. When magnetic valves 7 are open, no drainage from the coupling 10 occurs and hence the oil\nfrom the accumulator 2 applied thereto will flow to the cylinder 9. Cylinder 9 controls the blades of the turbine T in the manner indicated in FIG. 3.\nReferring to FIG. 2b, it is seen that the program periodically checks the angle of turbine blade, as indicated by the diamond in the extreme left hand column annotated \"Is The Angle Max\". Similarly in the extreme right column of FIG. 2b\npositioning of the turbine blade to +or-4.degree. positions, which is an essentially closed condition, is indicated. The full open or fully closed condition of the turbine blade is indicated by the pressure governors 15 (FIG. 3) which act as end\nposition sensors. Hence the open or closed position of the right and left pressure governors for the right and left end positions act as sensors to enable to program for the controller shown in FIGS. 2b and 2c to ascertain whether or not the turbine\nblades present on T1 are in either of their extreme end positions as required for use in the program.\nWhile I have described above the principles of my invention in connection with specific apparatus, it is to be clearly understood that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation to the scope of my invention as set\nforth in the objects thereof and in the accompanying claims."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9aefa0ad-6b20-4d5e-82d6-b58476aa24f4>"],"error":null}

In fact, the SQL injection threat has been number one on OWASP’s Top 10 list since it was publicly disclosed more than 10 years ago.\nSQL injection attacks have caused historic havoc. They have been used to breach the World Health Organization (WTO) database and steal data from internal staff, and also to attack U.S. government agencies, including the U.S. Army and NASA. SQL injection has also been used to steal the personal data of close to 157,000 TalkTalk customers and this is only the tip of the iceberg.\nIn the same way that SQL injection attacks are relatively straightforward and anyone with some SQL knowledge or access to tools could launch them, their prevention and protection strategies are also straightforward.\nIn this post, we’ll go through the process of an SQL injection, the types of SQL injections and why they are exploitable. We’ll also highlight the prevention and protection mechanisms for all types of SQL injections.\nThe SQL Injection: What Is It and How Does It Work?\nAn SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a type of cyberattack that aims to substitute a legitimate website’s input, such as a username, password, or URL, with an SQL statement that injects code.\nHackers perform an SQL injection, by entering fake SQL statements into a website input form view bits and pieces of information or alter a database table. In other words, hackers use unauthorized SQL code to “piggyback” on an authorized path (an input form) to reach and interfere with a site’s SQL database.\nWhere Is the Vulnerability?\nA site with an SQL injection vulnerability has forms of entry, such as input application forms or URL strings, that are unable to differentiate between a user’s input and the native commands in the site’s code.\nText fields, such as the username or password areas on login pages that allows a user or hacker to interact with the backend SQL database are at risk.\nFor example, when a user inputs a username and password, the information is compared with the website’s database using SQL statements.\nAs shown in the screenshot below, a SELECT statement is the one used to select data from a database and return results to a result table. This statement could be exploited to steal data.\nRefer to the screenshot above. When someone types a username in the text input, the SELECT statement will search in the database’s table users by utilizing this input from the user which according to the example code above, relies on a variable (“ + txtUserId;).\nIf there is no protection or way to prevent a user from entering invalid inputs, the user could enter calculated SQL statements. For example, an unknown visitor could enter a “crafted” input in the username field, such as “105 OR 1=1”.\nWith this crafted input, the SQL statement would change, but still be valid.\nNormally, the variable (+ txtUserId, as stated above) would be replaced with a normal UserId, such as “Diego”.\nHowever, with this crafted input, something else happens. The invalid input “105 OR 1=1” was designed by the hacker to intentionally create a brand new query. For example, OR 1=1 means “always TRUE”. It makes the database return all row values from the Users table.\nAlthough calculated statements like these can be dangerous, there are far sneakier ways hackers can steal, gain control, and even destroy entire databases.\nFor example, by entering something like “or 1=1–” in the password field, a new SQL statement is created that could return all password values for a Users table.\nWhy Certain Types of SQL Injections Are Exploitable\nAlthough SQL injections are generally easy to execute, hackers tend to be really persistent, especially if they want to get something out of an SQL injection.\nSQL injections can be classified based on the server’s response and the channel extraction method. Based on the server’s response, an SQL injection can be either performed by error or blind (inferential), and based on the communication channel, an SQL injection can be either in-band or out-of-band.\nA. In-band Error-based SQL injection\nAn in-band SQL injection occurs when a hacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and collect results. In the in-band error-based SQL injection, the hacker attempts to find and exploit visible error results given by the database server, to retrieve information, such as table names and contents. This intention behind this type of SQLi attack is used to learn as much as possible about the structure of the database.\nAn error-based SQL injection is exploitable due to:\n- User-supplied data (input) is not filtered by the web application.\n- Dynamic SQL queries (non-parameterized calls).\nUnsanitized inputs can lead to error-based feedback that provide too many useful clues for the attacker.\nB. In-band UNION-based SQL injection\nAn in-band UNION-based SQL injection is another type of in-band SQL injection in which a hacker uses the same communication channel to attack and gather results. This SQLi is based on the UNION SQL operator, which extends the results provided by the original query. For example, it could combine the results of two (or more) SELECT statements into a single result.\nA UNION-based SQLi is exploitable due to:\n- User-supplied data (input) is not sanitized by the web application.\n- Dynamic SQL queries (non-parameterized calls).\nC. Blind Attacks (Inferential SQL injection)\nAs the name suggests, hackers who perform blind SQL injection attacks have no idea what is on the other end. The application or website is still vulnerable to SQL injection, but the HTTP response does not come with clues about the SQL query or database error. The hacker can launch this type of attack by blindly reconstructing the database structure with the response and behavior of the server. A blind SQL injection can be Boolean or Time-based.\nA blind SQLi is exploitable due to:\n- Lack of parameterized queries or prepared statements.\n- Dynamic SQL queries using their procedures.\nD. Out-of-Band (OOB) SQLi\nThis type of SQLi occurs when an attacker exploits two different channels, one for launching the attack and the other for collecting data. This attack uses an OOB channel, such as DNS or HTTP protocol to exfiltrate data.\nAn OOB SQLi is exploitable due to:\n- Lack of sanitized or validated inputs from web applications.\n- Lack of (or poor) network security measures that allow the listening database server to initiate outbound requests (HTTP or DNS) to the public.\n- The right permissions to run the necessary function that starts the outbound request.\nHow to Prevent an SQL Injection\nAn SQL injection is one of the easiest to perform and most effective forms of cyber attacks. On the other hand, it is also relatively easy to defend against an SQL injection. The best way to prevent an SQL injection attack is to separate data from queries and commands using prepared statements.\nHow to defend against an SQL injection\n- User Prepared Statements\n- Validate User Inputs\n- Enforce Least Privilege\n- Perform Penetration Testing\n- Set Up a a WAF (Web Application Firewall)\nA. Use Prepared Statements with Parameterized Queries\nPrepared statements guarantee that user inputs passed to SQL statements are safe. The idea is that a user’s input cannot directly influence the SQL commands that control and access an SQL database. The database will treat all inputs (including malicious SQL statements) as ordinary inputted data and not as commands.\nIn a prepared statement, the variables in a query are always separated from the rest of the query. In other words, when a developer defines the code for SQL queries (prepared statements) the user input and code are separated.\n- Parameterize stored procedures.\n- Avoid dynamic SQL or at least parameterize them.\n- Prepared statements also help escape to evade user-supplied inputs. Configure user inputs to a specific function to ensure that characters, such as the single quote (‘), are not passed along to an SQL query as instructions.\nB. Validate User Inputs\nAnother way to defend a website’s front line against SQL injections is to validate user inputs. With this method, whatever a user inputs to the web application, there is always a validation (filtering) process allowing/disallowing inputs.\nTo validate user inputs, identify and define the essential SQL statements. Establish an SQL statement whitelist that helps filter out all unvalidated statements and accepts valid inputs.\nAdditionally, user data input can also be defined by context. For example input fields can be filtered for email addresses by allowing only the characters used in the email, such as the @ symbol or phone number inputs, which can be filtered by only allowing numbers.\nC. Enforce Least Privilege\nAs a second line of defense, the level of access and user’s privileges to a database should be limited. It is important to restrict access rights to the specific users, accounts, or computer processes that need to perform a specific activity on the database. For example, if a website or application only needs to use SELECT statements for the database, there should not be any user privileges to use INSERT or DELETE.\nEnforcing the least privileged account strategy will help reduce the level of damage in case a user account gets compromised. If a hacker steals a user’s account information, they will also have limited access to the database.\nD. Perform Penetration Testing\nA great way to prevent an SQL injection is to know the website’s flaws and to perform regular assessments of the website’s defenses by auditing suspicious activities, user privileges, and using pen-testing tools.\nSQL injection hackers and even script kiddies are beginning to use automation for time-consuming and repetitive tasks. Examples are Havij, an automated SQL Injection tool, that helps penetration testers (or bad actors) to find and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Another is SQLMap, an open-source penetration tool used to automatically scan, detect, and perform SQL injections and take control of databases.\nE. Set Up a WAF\nUse a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect web applications with access to databases. A WAF can filter out malicious traffic data by using a set of security rules to monitor and filter suspicious traffic behavior.\nCloudBric’s Cloud-Based Smart Web Application Protection (SWAP) is one of the most comprehensive WAF solutions against SQL injections, and other common threats. SWAP uses a patented logic (including pattern matching, semantics, and heuristic analysis) and a ruleset to automate attack detection and mitigation.\nSQL injections pose a great threat to web apps and sites. Hackers can steal, modify, and even destroy entire databases.\nThe best way to prevent an SQL injection is to parameterize statements. This ensures that all parameters (like inputs) that are passed into SQL statements are treated safely. Another way to defend against these threats is to validate or filter all user inputs.\nTo stay ahead of the game, we also recommend enforcing your user privileges and access rights, using an advanced WAF, and always pen-testing the website’s defenses."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ab005357-cae3-4658-ae3f-9c02588460fe>","<urn:uuid:744f28a5-65f6-4866-99a0-409456138607>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello! I'm concerned about endangered species. What are the main threats to aquatic organisms in streams, and how do scientists assess their populations?","answer":"The main threats to aquatic organisms include habitat destruction, pollution of waterways, and reduced water flow due to human consumption. For example, many major rivers like the Colorado River have seen severely depressed flow over the last 100 years, and rivers like the Yangtze have become badly polluted. To assess populations, scientists use various monitoring methods. They conduct biological monitoring by checking for living organisms in streams - even polluted streams contain pollution-tolerant species. Teams of scientists collect and catalog fish species, weighing and measuring them to calculate an Index of Biological Integrity (IBI). They also monitor aquatic insects, particularly in spring, using nets to collect specimens from stream riffles, as these organisms are key indicators of water quality.","context":["Warning: This post will not be my usual happy, hooray for nature type post. This one deals with a serious issue and may be considered depressing to some readers. Consider yourself warned.\nThe Zoological Society of London recently released a publication called Priceless or Worthless? The World’s Most Threatened Species. In spite of the fact that I absolutely hate the title (I don’t like to think of any species as worthless, no matter how few of them are left), I was eager to look through the document to see what sorts of invertebrates their list contained. I was happy to see that several insects and other arthropods are featured, including a few damselflies, a few butterflies, a spider, a crab, a cricket, a bee. I think it’s fantastic that so many invertebrates made the list as it means that people out there care whether these animals live or disappear forever, and that sort of attention and love is rarely bestowed on the spineless creatures of our planet. It’s sad that these creatures made the list in the first place, but it also means that they will get a lot of attention, and that’s a good thing. Insects and their relatives get far too little attention when it comes to endangered and threatened species lists and it’s high time we started paying more attention to them.\nLooking at the list as a whole, however, got me thinking. Yes, there are several insects on the list, but I noticed something else: there are a lot freshwater species listed overall. This wasn’t especially surprising as I know how specialized aquatic organisms can be, how they can be so incredibly picky about where they live that it puts them at risk when anything in their environment changes. For example, amphibians have been on the decline for years. Scientists have variously pointed to habitat destruction, pollution of aquatic habitats, increased UV radiation passing through a thinner ozone layer, climate change, and the recent epidemic of chytrid fungus throughout most of the world as explanations for the decline. In some areas, a combination of these factors have even led to extinctions of amphibian species and may lead to more in the future. Amphibians are incredibly sensitive to changes in their environments, and that’s not really a good trait to have in a changing world.\nBut frogs are big, showy animals that a lot of people like. Many aquatic insects are likely similarly sensitive to changes in their environments, but we know so little about them we can’t even describe the distribution of many species with any sort of accuracy. One species of riffle beetle was described from specimens found only in a single stream in the Chiricahua Mountains of southern Arizona, but is that really the only place they live? Is a population still found there? And what about the big Horseshoe 2 fire there two summers ago that burned a huge part of the mountain range? Riffle beetles generally require clear, cool, flowing water to survive and that one population was likely incapable of surviving ash flows. Has that species gone extinct? Does anyone know?\nPriceless or Worthless also includes an 8-page list of species that have already gone extinct. Among the relatively small handful of insects that are known to have disappeared (and there are half as many insect species listed as birds, in spite of being a much more diverse group), you see the usual trends: mostly butterflies and moths with some beetles and several aquatic insects. The latter include caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies, insects that are generally sensitive to pollution, habitat loss, and other changes in their habitats. However, that list includes only species that we know have gone extinct. How many insect species have disappeared without our even noticing? I think we’d be lucky to observe the disappearance of most species. And then there are the untold millions of insects that we haven’t even cataloged and named. There are so many insects out there that it’s simply impossible to monitor them all and we know very, very little about most species. That, combined with the public relations problems that insects typically face, means that insects are often ignored when endangered species lists are compiled. It is likely that countless species have gone extinct without ever even drawing our attention.\nLooking through the list of the 100 most threatened animals and seeing some aquatic insects and other aquatic organisms there gives me hope that people do care about these species and are working to protect them. That’s a step in the right direction. But are we going to be able to save them? Consider this: the human population topped 7 billion people about a year ago. We added 1 billion people between 1999 and 2011. That’s 1 BILLION more people who needed places to live. That’s 1 BILLION people who needed water to drink. That’s 1 BILLION people who depended on crops that require watering. That’s 1 BILLION people who produced more waste, a lot of which ended up in our waterways. Many of the world’s great rivers are already so badly polluted that they are becoming virtually unusable by humans (the Yangtze River, for instance). Many of our rivers have seen severely depressed flow over the last 100 years such that even mighty rivers like the Colorado River, once a lush and vibrant river along its entire length from the Colorado Rockies to the Gulf of California, only rarely reach the ocean now. We humans are in direct competition with aquatic plants, animals, and other organisms for aquatic resources. When it comes down to a choice between us or them, does that rare caddisfly living in one stretch of one mountain stream have any chance as the human need for water advances into its habitat?\nIf you haven’t noticed from my writing on this blog, I love this planet. I try to stay positive about things, think that we can make things better. For the most part I focus on all the positive, wonderful things in our world. But, I also recognize that my favorite insects, the ones that live in my favorite habitats, really are at risk of extinction. I know I would gladly give up a golf course to save a caddisfly species when both required the water. I would gladly forego a lush, green lawn to ensure that my unborn children have a chance to see a rare stonefly in a local stream. I like to believe that a lot of people would do the same if they recognized the risk these animals face (that’s one of the seven impediments to invertebrate conservation I discussed back in January). However, if we ever have to decide between getting enough water to drink and saving that caddisfly or that rare stonefly, it’s unlikely to end well for the insects.\nSo what can I do about it? Well, I’m going to keep blogging for starters. Very few non-scientists even know aquatic insects exist, so getting information about aquatic species out there into the world is a good thing to do. I can educate people through my job and encourage people in my area to conserve water. I will continue photographing aquatic insects because I believe people are less inclined to let a species go extinct if they can attach a face to it than if it remains a total stranger. I can continue to make changes in my own life to help alleviate some of the stress on our aquatic habitats. I truly believe we can coexist with the species around us with proper education, planning, and awareness of how our actions impact our world. And indeed, Priceless or Worthless ends on a similar note, describing some conservation successes, species that have recovered after nearly going extinct. There aren’t any insects on that list, but there have been some successes in saving butterfly and dragonfly populations from extinction over the last few years that weren’t featured. It’s my hope that someday I will see an insect on that conservation success list – and maybe it will even be aquatic.","Biological Monitoring Program\nNets are used to block off a stream\nreach before it is sampled.\nStreams, even the one meandering through your backyard, are habitat for fish, aquatic insects, and other life. If nothing is living in the stream, then chances are there’s a problem. Even polluted streams are home for pollution-tolerant species like the blacknose dace, mummichog, or black fly larvae.\nBiological monitoring, watching and tracking the living things in our waters, is one of the ways to determine that waterway’s health. By combining information on species living in streams with data from chemical analysis and the physical condition of the stream channel scientists determine stream health.\nIn the summer, teams of scientists and volunteers don their waders and head to the streams to count, weigh and categorize the fish. Pumpkinseed, stoneroller, white suckers, rosyside dace, greenside darters, brown trout and about 100 other species are catalogued during the survey.\nFish are collected and then\nidentified and weighed before\nthey are returned to the stream.\nSome fish species can tolerate a great deal of pollution and can live in conditions that other fish would not survive. During the survey, scientists record the number of different species, the types of species and the number of fish. They also weigh and measure the fish. The information that they collect is entered into a variety of mathematical formulas which provide an index, called the IBI (Index of Biological Integrity). This index allows scientists to quantify and compare for streams around the county and state.\nSimilar mathematical formulas are used to evaluate the insects in streams. The insects, like the fish, vary in their tolerance for pollutants. If particular species are found in a waterway, you can be relatively confident that the waterway is healthy.\nA \"Dnet\" is used to\ncollect aquatic insects.\nThese are used as\nindicator of a\nEvery spring insects are collected from rocky, fast flowing, shallow sections of streams. These spots are called riffles and are the part of the stream referred to when we speak of babbling brooks. The insects we are interested in live between and beneath the rocks on the bottom of the stream and are called benthic macroinvertebrates. Benthic, because they live on the bottom, and macroinvertebrate because they are large invertebrates (without backbones). Large is a relative term: the largest of these insects is a couple of inches long and the smallest, quite small, but still visible to the naked eye. Scientists sometimes refer to these pollution-sensitive insects EPT. This is an acronym for the scientific orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. Using macroinvertebrates as a measure for stream health is an easy and to effective way to track changes in water quality.\nWhen the information on insect species is combined with a fish index and other monitoring efforts, the county gains a great deal of understanding about stream health. The IBI for insects is often referred to as the BIBI which stands for the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. Using these statistics, we are able to assign values to the biological health of a stream and determine if the health of the stream is improving or declining.\nWe look to the life in the streams to determine whether the streams are healthy, but don’t forget that it is that beauty and diversity of life that we’re working to protect.

As water is forced around the wood different velocities result in the stream creating a variety of habitats.

Guam is a territory of the United States of America and is located in the western Pacific Ocean. It is the largest and southern-most of the Mariana Islands. It is approximately 2,500 kilometres from Guam to Japan and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. It is a bit west of north of Sydney, albeit 5,283 kilometres away.\nWhile Guam is an extremely popular location for holidays for people from many Asian countries, especially Japan and to a lesser extent, South Korea, it is not a place high on the \"must do\" list for Australians. Virtually the only Australians who visit Guam are scuba divers, and even then, most only visit as a consequence of their aim to visit other locations. For many Australian divers, the only time they visit Guam is when travelling to or from Chuuk or Palau.\nGuam is not all that big, it is only just over 40 kilometres long and up to 16 kilometres wide. There are coral reefs all around the island and as such, there is a lot of dive sites around Guam. However, there is only one location that visitors can dive as charter boats/dive shops only run out of one location, Apra Harbor.\nApra Harbor is the only protected anchorage in Guam and is located at the westernmost part of the island. It is not a huge harbour (in fact is appears to be an artificial harbour with the northern side man-made), but big enough to be home to a US naval base (with nuclear submarines). Inside the harbour are a number of wrecks, the best known being the World War I German ship SMS Cormoran and the World War II Japanese ship Tokei Maru.\nLooking towards Orote Point from Blue Hole\nAnother shot of Orote Peninsula\nMost of the diving seems to be not on the wrecks, as when we dived there the operator had not dived the above two wrecks for a long time, over a year.\nOutside Apra Harbor there are a number of dive sites quite close and there are even a couple of sites inside the harbour. This article is about the most popular site outside the harbour, Blue Hole.\nAlthough the harbour is man-made, the southern headland is a very dramatic geographic feature called Orote Point. The cliff here is as high, if not higher, than North Head in Sydney Harbour. After heading across the harbour, the dive boat turns left and heads south. The dramatic cliff runs for quite a while along this section of coastline.\nBlue Hole is located only a kilometre south of the harbour at GPS Reading N13Â° 26' 11.4\" E144Â° 37' 33.9\" using WGS84 as the datum. At this location there is a mooring. The mooring is in about 18 metres on the top of the reef wall. As you have probably worked out, Blue Hole is a hole in the top of the reef that drops down and exits onto the wall.\nBlue Hole as you drop down from the mooring\nLooking back from deep inside Blue Hole\nOnce you enter the water, you descend down the mooring line and straight away you will see the Blue Hole. It is about 20 metres long and 10 metres wide. At 18 metres you enter the hole and straight away you can see the bluish glow coming from the exit below. As you head down, look back up at the other divers following you. You can get some great photographs if you are careful with your exhalation bubbles.\nThe hole drops to about 40 metres before you can exit. The exit is huge, the opening extends all the way to the bottom of the hole at about 55 or perhaps 60 metres. The wall here is shear and runs back up to the reef top at 18 metres. The bottom of the wall is at least 80 metres from what I could see.\nKelly McFadyen approaching the exit of Blue Hole\nA sea whip on the wall just outside of Blue Hole\nNormally there is a current so you drift with the flow and your boat will pick you up when you surface. On my dive here the tide was running back towards the harbour. Outside the hole the wall has some nice gorgonias, but mostly these are deeper than the depth you will need to be at for the dive. Some of the gorgonias are huge, probably two metres across. However, other than that, there is little live coral or sponge life to be seen on this dive.\nAs the visibility here is normally excellent, at least 30 metres, you will be able to see a long way up and down the wall. As such, it is easy to see what is coming up as you drift along and change direction to make sure you see all the feature of the site. The current is not extremely strong and you could swim against it if you wanted to.\nKelly with some clownfish on the wall\nOne of the huge boulders back up on the reef top\nYou will have to start ascending almost as soon as you exit the hole as you will have reached about 45 metres, meaning you only have about eight minutes before you will enter decompression. If you are careful, you can stay out of decompression by gradually ascending.\nThe wall seems to be patrolled by reef sharks. On my dive here I saw a white-tipped and a black-tipped reef shark. Along the wall there are moray eels, some anemones and clownfish and other smaller fish.\nAfter about 10 minutes you will still be at 30 metres but soon have to come up onto the top of the reef. A few minutes later you will be at 20 metres and this is the top of the wall. For the next 20 minutes the depth stays roughly the same.\nSome more boulders on the reef top\nA strange, thin rock near the boulders\nAs soon as you hit the top of the wall you will see that the reef top is very wide, at least 30 metres. Back towards the shore it gradually rises back up towards the surface. On the top there are lots of huge boulders. Some of these are as big as a garage. In some places the boulders are bunched together and form small swim-throughs.\nAfter about 35 minutes you will need to move closer towards the shore so that you can get a bit shallower. The wall here is a gradual slope. In places along here there are some small holes and cracks. Check them out, we found a mantis shrimp in one. There are also more sharks patrolling this part of the reef.\nFinally, you will need to start your ascent. To do this you will have to swim out at right-angles to the reef to get away from the shore. This is so the dive boat can safely collect you. Do a safety stop as you swim out, but make sure you do not go too far. Your guide should have a safety sausage to send up, but if you have separated from the guide, send up your own.\nKelly at the entrance to a swim-through formed by two boulders\nA mantis shrimp on the shallower reef\nThis is a nice dive, with a very exiting start, a great vertical wall and some shark-life. It also has excellent visibility. It is a pity that there is not more coral and fixed marine life.\nProbably the best available reef dive in Guam done by the dive shops.\nI dived with Micronesian Divers Association but did not use their own boat. As they had a lot of divers on the days we were diving with them, they sub-contracted the boat for us from someone else. I can recommend them as the operation seems pretty good.\nVideo shot by Kelly McFadyen during our November 2011 trip to Guam."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b0bf852a-450a-4155-905e-8ded1065217a>","<urn:uuid:24451d6d-fb98-41cd-8eb4-11d61d445b42>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi there! In manufacturing settings, what's the main difference between Microsoft's 'Execute' sub-process and digital twin's manufacturing operations use case?","answer":"The Execute sub-process in Microsoft's framework and digital twin's manufacturing operations serve different purposes in manufacturing. The Execute sub-process is focused on taking vetted ideas and proposals through formal project development to commercialization. In contrast, digital twins in manufacturing operations provide real-time visibility and insights into current operations, enabling increased operational efficiency and agility throughout the supply chain, including specific applications in quality assurance processes and work instructions delivery. While Execute is about bringing innovation projects to life, digital twins focus on optimizing existing manufacturing processes through real-time monitoring and analysis.","context":["“Industries are being commoditized at a faster rate and you have to look for ways to create more value and set yourself apart,” says Braden Kelley of Business Strategy Innovation. “Innovation is one of the few ways to do that because people use the same best practices for operational excellence. The way they innovate and the culture they build are the ways they can differentiate.”\nTo help companies with their quest to sustain their innovation efforts, Microsoft has reached out to collect a number of innovation best practices into an evolving framework, that I’ve provided a preview of below.\nMicrosoft’s Innovation Management Framework\nEvery company serious about innovation should anchor their pursuit in a vision, strategy and goals for innovation. These core innovation components should address not just enabling technology but processes and culture too. Microsoft has published this Innovation Management Framework as the culmination of a collaboration with a consortium of visionaries and practitioners to ensure that it includes thought leadership on innovation from Microsoft and its broader ecosystem, including current charter members and contributors to the framework:\n- Business Strategy Innovation\n- Quantum PM\n- Siemens PLM\n- United Healthcare\n- Wolters Kluwer\n“Microsoft’s Innovation Management Framework is designed to help companies develop a comprehensive, integrated approach to implement and support an innovation management strategy. This framework is a repeatable reference architecture for innovation and is intended to allow companies to share and learn about innovation management best practices and enabling technologies as a starting point for strategic discussions for their company’s innovation management strategy.\nThe framework includes best practice processes and solutions that offer a strategic roadmap. The roadmap offers techniques that are proven through experience to improve innovation and innovation management performance. For example, the framework shares lessons learned from Microsoft’s own innovation strategies and processes that help fuel innovation across the Microsoft enterprise. These processes are used within Microsoft, enabling teams to quickly implement innovation programs that are fit for purpose.”\nAt its core the framework focuses on five main innovation sub-processes that we’ll give you a very brief preview of here:\nInnovation is critical to achieving the goals of the modern business strategy. The Envision process should put in place the strategy and plan to achieve the innovation goals in the business strategy.\nAt the front end of innovation where ideas are generated, sometimes referred to as “ideation,” is where Engage occurs.\nIn this process, companies engage employees, customers, and partners in an innovation community to capture and share new ideas. Formalizing engagement transforms it from a passive, unfocused, ineffective “suggestion box” to a proactive approach that effectively produces targeted ideas. The goal is to generate ideas that will drive new business value. As Braden Kelley of Business Strategy Innovation explains, “The key in the engage processes is to get closer to the customer, what they desire, how they will make their lives better, and how your product will displace something.”\nThe third process, “Evolve,” takes the output of the Engage process to the next level. In this process, companies evolve ideas – as individuals or as teams – to increase their quality and value. Soliciting and capturing ideas is not enough. Early feedback allows great ideas to be improved upon and issues to be raised so they can be resolved (if possible).\nSimply discussing ideas is not enough. “It’s important to be able to organize, de-duplicate, and merge ideas and take them to the next step in order to turn ideas into money,” offers Newsgator’s Markus von Aschoff. At some point companies must identify the innovations they believe are candidates for further investment. Unfortunately, many companies are drowning in too many ideas.\nOf course all of the best ideas, proposals and business plans in the world are of no value unless they can be turned into a reality. The “Execute” sub-process takes the input from the previous processes and executes a formal project to further develop the idea or commercialize it.\nThe Microsoft DIRA Framework\nThis Innovation Management Framework is tightly aligned with Microsoft’s Discrete Industry Reference Architecture for the discrete manufacturing industry. The DIRA framework covers three primary business imperatives that are critical to the growth and profitability of a manufacturing enterprise. These imperatives are:\n- Innovate – Manage cross-boundary innovation and accelerate time-to-market\n- Perform – Deliver operational excellence with reliable business continuity\n- Grow – “Observe & serve” customers globally to drive growth with profitable proximity\nThis framework represents the “Innovation Management” portion of the “Innovate” imperative (see diagram). This framework will also align with the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Framework, which also falls under the Innovate imperative of DIRA.\nI’m sure you can tell by now, or at least I hope you can tell, that this has just been a teaser of some of the great content that exists in the full document.\nFor more detail on Microsoft’s DIRA Framework and to see the complete Microsoft Innovation Framework, be sure and download it as a PDF.","Digital twin is one of the most exciting technologies of our time.\nIt’s not new – it was first used by NASA in the Apollo flights – but technology is finally at a place where the concept is no longer a “shoot for the moon” endeavor.\nFor those who work in the industrial markets, digital twin technology is the means to leverage other increasingly prevalent technologies, like Internet of Things (IoT) cloud computing, and sensors, to unlock higher value insights and analytics.\nIf you’re looking to learn more about digital twin, you’ve found the right place. There’s both misinformation and different interpretations out there of what digital twin technology is and the potential it has. We’ve consolidated the most frequently asked questions about digital twin in one place – let’s dive in!\nHere’s how we broadly define digital twin technology:\nDigital twins are digital models that virtually represent their physical counterparts. This virtual representation of a physical product, an operational process, or a person’s task is used to understand or predict the physical counterpart by leveraging both the business system data that defines it and its physical world experience captured through sensors.\nIn many instances, the digital twin is the key to unlock siloed data sets and bring them together to present a contextualized representation of a product or process. Industrial digital twins are gaining traction for this reason; disparate data sets are brought together to uncover new insights and possibilities. With digital twin, enterprises are driving business outcomes like operational effectiveness, product differentiation, and increased quality and productivity.\nYes, digital twins are created at the convergence of the physical and digital – and that isn’t limited to physical things or products, people and processes, such as a workflow, can have a digital twin enabled by augmented reality. A manufacturing process – even an entire factory – can have a digital twin.\nWith the increasing prevalence of IoT in industrial spaces, machines are now producing incredible amounts of data. Not only that, they’re able to communicate with each other, and with the right technologies in place, this data can be converted to insights that help businesses better understand the inner workings of product or process within its native environment. Ultimately, this information can be leveraged to drive efficiency in daily tasks and processes and inform broader business decisions.\nDigital twins range from basic to complex, depending on the goals of the initiative. As we mentioned, both physical products and entire processes, even factories, can have digital twins. Different technologies enhance the fidelity of a digital twin. Here’s a quick overview of digital twin technologies for consideration:\nAt a basic level, to build a digital twin the physical asset(s) there should be some access to compute power to generate data and access to servers (on-premises, cloud, or edge) and reliable connectivity. A digital definition provides the backbone for the digital twin, for example a CAD model, product lifecycle management data, and real-time sensor data.\nFrom there, enterprises are building on the complexity and fidelity of digital twins with IIoT platform and analytics integrations, ERP & MES, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, and more.\nMost industrial enterprises are already using many of these technologies already, a digital twin strategy unifies them in a way that brings additional value.\nIn industrial enterprises, we see three distinct digital twin use cases categories emerging across the value chain: Engineering, Manufacturing and Operations, and Maintenance and Service.\nFor discrete manufacturers, digital twins enable products to “talk” – in other words, it replaces usage assumptions with data and insights, ultimately accelerating time-to-market for optimized designs and features. With digital twin, product designers are better understanding how the products are being used in the field, and with a full lifecycle feedback loop, customer-centric optimizations (or completely new products/features) are made faster and more efficiently.\nDigital twins of processes are making a big difference in the factory. Enterprises are gaining deeper visibility and insights into their current operations that uncover ways for increased operational efficiency and agility throughout the supply chain. We’re seeing examples of digital twins being used effectively in quality assurance processes and delivery of work instructions as well.\nThis use case is all about enabling customer success in the “wild”. Before the advent of IoT, businesses needed to rely on customer feedback and reactive data to understand the performance of their products.\nWith digital twin, there is capability for real-time feedback – and even predictive monitoring and insights. This is leading to new revenue opportunities, such as enhanced service delivery. Outcomes of these use cases are increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, driven by improved asset uptime and faster time-to-resolution.\nOur ebook, “Top Use Cases for Digital Twin Technology to Drive Digital Transformation”, goes into much more detail and offers real-world examples from Volvo Group, Polaris, and Elekta.\nThis is, of course, the next obvious question after looking at use cases. Within each of the broad use cases described above there are significant opportunities for role-based digital twins. A single digital twin can be used in different ways – through different lens, or views – to drive value for specific roles and/or tasks.\nFor example, a service technician uses a digital twin to access work order information to perform machine maintenance, while an operator uses the same digital twin to monitor and analyze key metrics, to ensure utilizations, available and quality. Beyond the factory floor, an executive has greater visibility into operations, which can inform day-to-day and long-term business decisions.\nThe benefits of digital twin are nearly universal in the enterprise space. In fact, a 2019 IDC report, Digital Transformation FutureScape, 30 percent of G2000 companies will have implemented advanced digital twins to optimize operations by 2020. The majority of adopters will be industrial enterprises.\nThe appeal for industrial enterprises is digital twin is likely possible with the existing technologies already in play. With a focused digital twin strategy, enterprises can start leveraging existing data and technologies in new and powerful ways.\nThe value of digital twin is individual to each company and the extent and use case for which they are leveraging the technology. We can say with certainty that digital twin initiative makes an impact on people, products, and process.\nBy getting contextualized information to the right personnel, it streamlines how workers do their daily tasks. Twins of products are creating new customer-centric business models, such as product-as-a-service. Manufacturers are driving significant efficiencies, while improving flexibility and agility across their processes.\nIdentifying the desired business outcome of a digital twin and identifying measurable ROI is an integral part of strategy development, even before the technology and implementation discussion.\nCheck out this whitepaper for more detail on the business outcomes we’re seeing from digital twin implementations at the enterprise level.\nNew technologies are emerging that will enable high-fidelity digital twins, as well as connections to transformative manufacturing processes, from generative design to additive manufacturing. Digital twins when combined with artificial intelligence capabilities, such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms, will derive new operational insights. Increased transparency and security will be made possible with blockchain as well.\nWe outlined several digital twin predictions here, but as digital twins become more prevalent across the enterprise, there is great potential in orchestrating twin networks and enablement of communications between two distinct digital twins.\nA digital thread is the term used to describe simple, universal access to data. It’s the connection synchronizing related upstream and downstream information from multiple sources and systems. A digital thread enables a more complete, real-time representation of a product, process, or person across enterprise functions.\nThis data unification of digital thread is a pre-requisite to building a robust digital twin.\nNow, of course! The potential for digital twins to bring increased value to your digital transformation initiatives should not be ignored or pushed off to next year. As we mentioned above, many of the technologies enabling digital twins are already in use within industrial enterprises. Leveraging these technologies and building connections with a digital twin strategy drives further measurable value for your business.\nOur Digital Twin Primer for Industrial Enterprises walks through the essential steps to a digital twin strategy to get you started.\nWe hope to have answered all your most pressing digital twin questions. The opportunity to drive real business outcomes and value for industrial enterprises is there for the taking. If you haven’t already, start looking into how digital twin technology could help remove silos within your organization and deliver value to multiple teams.\nDid we miss any of your most pressing digital twin questions?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6c91a00a-bdec-431d-ae0e-28cb6afde340>","<urn:uuid:4e776f07-14fd-4c08-8104-c1716442e1e2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between SMBC's and POIG's approach to palm oil sustainability certification?","answer":"SMBC relies solely on the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or equivalent certification systems for palm oil sustainability, which is considered insufficient to address deforestation, management of carbon-intensive peatlands, and human rights. In contrast, POIG goes beyond RSPO standards by implementing more ambitious requirements, including specific commitments to break the link between deforestation and palm oil, maintain peatlands, and ensure comprehensive Free, Prior and Informed Consent of indigenous peoples and local communities.","context":["Rainforest Action Network\nJune 21, 2018 Tokyo, Japan — On June 18, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) announced its “policy towards financing businesses with potentially significant adverse environmental and/or social impact” including coal-fired power, palm oil plantation developments and deforestation.\nEnvironmental groups ー 350.org Japan, Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society (JACSES), Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Kiko Network, Friends of the Earth Japan and Greenpeace Japan ー issued the following statement on SMBC’s new policies.\n“We had high hopes for SMBC being the last of the major Japanese financial groups to announce an update of their social and environmental policy (1), following Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group. However we are very disappointed to see the visible loopholes in SMBC’s coal-fired power sector policy, which may defeat the purpose of the policy itself. There is also a lack of clarity around specific actions that the company will take on deforestation. While we welcome the fact that SMBC has shown a willingness to restrict coal financing and address deforestation, this announcement does not come even close to addressing the climate action needed in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nThe decision that SMBC should have made here is to announce a stop to any new financing for domestic and foreign coal-fired power projects and companies involved in such projects, with a clear strategy and timeline. (2) SMBC’s recent decision in April 2018 to finance the Nghi Son 2 coal-fired power plant in Vietnam, which will utilize sub-critical coal technology and has been challenged by local groups for apparent violations of the Equator Principles, highlights the potential loopholes of its coal policy.\nOn deforestation, SMBC should have laid out clear criteria for halting deforestation and protecting carbon-intensive peatlands. Its mere reliance on weak certification systems and national laws is clearly not enough.\nSMBC states that they are committed to the Paris Agreement and the SDG goal of “tak[ing] urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.” We urge SMBC to step up their game by making immediate steps towards divesting from coal and strengthening their policies on deforestation.”\nThe NGOs also provide the following detailed analysis of the policy which reveals glaring inconsistencies:\n“In the document, SMBC states that it will limit lending to coal-fired power plants that “use ultra-supercritical or more advanced technologies which are considered highly efficient.” Firstly, the policy’s inclusion of financing for any type of coal-fired power is insufficient when research endorsed by the United Nations Environment Programme clearly indicates there is no space to build any more new coal-fired power plants – no matter how efficient – in order to keep global temperature rise well below 2 degrees. More worrisome is the fact that SMBC states it will make exemptions for projects that [they have] already committed support […] or where the Japanese government or Multilateral Development Banks support.” This is a major loophole that will likely nullify the limitation that is set in the first place.\nSMBC, like Mizuho Financial Group, also references palm oil and logging, which are significant causes of deforestation, which in turn contributes to climate change. However, for palm oil, mere reliance on the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or equivalent certification systems is not sufficient to address deforestation, management of carbon-intensive peatlands or human rights, and additional measures are necessary, including use of the High Carbon Stock Approach. Additionally, SMBC’s policy to prohibit financing to businesses involved in illegal logging and illegal land clearance activities is a good start, but not sufficient to achieve zero deforestation by 2020 as stipulated in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15. ”\nNotes to the editor\n- Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation: Establishment of policy for businesses associated with Environmental and Social risk\n- 350.org Japan and supporting NGOs are currently running a global petition calling upon Japan’s three biggest financial institutions — Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group — to: i) disclose financial exposure to carbon intensive industries in line with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); ii) outline business strategies and clear targets and metrics to align their finance policies with the Paris Agreement; iii) cease all new lending to coal fired power generation and coal extraction projects and companies involved in such projects.\nKiko Network （https://www.kikonet.org）Tokyo Office: TEL. +81-3-3263-9210 E-mail. email@example.com\n350.org Japan: +81(3)070-2793-3648 Shin Furuno E-mail. firstname.lastname@example.org","Jakarta – A group of progressive palm oil companies together with environmental and social NGOs today announced their intention to push the boundaries of current requirements of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The group says that the new RSPO standards agreed by RSPO members at its meeting in Kuala Lumpur last April do not go far enough to adequatelyaddress the most critical issues facing the industry today.\nThe Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) released the following joint statement at the Tropical Forest Alliance meeting in Jakarta:\n“We are innovators in one or more aspects of palm oil production; and we are NGOs active in environmental and social issues and together we wish to show what responsible palm oil production could look like. We hope others who want to tackle the most burning issues facing our industry will join us.\nThe current negative image of palm oil needs to be reversed if the sector is to thrive. The palm oil innovation group will demonstrate that by setting and implementing ambitious standards that stretch the RSPO principles and criteria we can break the link between deforestation and social conflict and palm oil.\nOne of our objectives is to develop a Palm Oil Innovation Group Charter1 and to explore ways to increase the market demand for palm oil products that are produced by innovators within the industry. It’s not an easy challenge, but this is a call for other innovators to join us.”\nPalm Oil Innovations Group\nThe POIG aims to build on RSPO standards and commitments by both demonstrating innovation to implement RSPO existing standards but also on additional critical issues. With a focus on the three thematic areas of environmental responsibility, partnerships with communities, and corporate and product integrity, POIG members will strengthen their commitments to socially and environmentally responsible palm oil production.\nThe POIG is a constructive group that focuses on leveraging its experience to innovate the palm oil industry and act as advocates for these innovations. The current negative image of palm oil needs to be reversed if the industry is to thrive. The Palm Oil Innovation Group will demonstrate that by setting and implementing ambitious standards, the industry can in particular break the link between deforestation, and human, land and labour rights violations, and palm oil.\nObjectives and Purpose:\n• promotes and supports innovation and improvements in oil palm plantation and extraction mill management on a range of environmental, social and governance issues, and seeks to have the innovations rolled out across the palm oil industry and reflected in the RSPO standard.\n• creates added value for innovative and progressive producers through increased market recognition and demand for palm oil products from innovative and improved practices.\n• acts as a forum for open discussions and sharing of experience with innovations and improved oil palm plantation and extraction mill management practices.\n• acts as a forum to collectively engage with governments towards achieving recognition and support for innovations, and have them included in regulations and law.\nPOIG Charter Elements:\n1.

The Everest Base Camp trek reaches significantly higher elevations, with multiple acclimatization days required at places like Namche Bazaar (3420m) and Pheriche, ultimately reaching 5545m at Kala Pattar. The Bolivia Salt Flats are at a lower but still challenging altitude of 3,650 meters (12,000 ft), and while altitude considerations are mentioned in the travel recommendations through suggestions like resting upon arrival and drinking coca tea, they don't require the same extensive acclimatization protocol as the Everest trek.","context":["|Maximum elevation:||5545m||Best Season:||October to December|\nMake a direct approach to the foot of the world's highest mountain.

There are many hotels and lodges.\nDay 03: Acclimatization day; Namche Bazaar\nOn the third day of our trek, first acclimization day of Everest Base Camp. Namche bazaar is the main trade and administrative centre for the solu khumbu region and there have many restaurents, bakeries, hotels, shops, bank and other facilities also available. Higher the altitude, thinner the air, we need to gain altitudes slowly and steadly. However, we need acclimatization day on the trek. We will do just short hike in this day.\nDay 04: Namche Bazaar to Tengboche(3870m)\nIn this day we will hike to Tengboche from namche bazaar. The slightly longer route from Namche bazaar to Tengboche via Khumjung and Khunde is more intersting then one. The route starts through hillside and enjoying the view of Ama dablam(6856m). We followed by the descend of river , tropical forest hill; we will reach Tengboche.\nDay 05: Tengboche to Pheriche (4240m)\nWe starts trek after breakfast with enjoy the view of Ama Dablam. The trails drops down to Debuche, crosses the Imja Khola and climbs through rhododendron forest past superb mani stones to Pangboche. The typical Sherpa village, the village is a good place for lunch stop. The trail then climbs orsho to pheriche.\nDay 06: Acclimatisation day in Pheriche\nAnother acclimatization day should be spent at Pheriche. Pheriche is good place to spend a day. The villages of Dingboche and Chukkung are possible distinction and both offer good views, we just hike one or two hour hike on this day.\nDay 07: Pheriche to Duglha(4620m)\nThe trail climbs to Phulang Kala then Duglha. it is short trek. Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) doctors at Pheriche urge everyone to stay for aid acclimatization. If any kind of problem in your health it help to you immediately. After walking four or five hours you reach in the Duglha and overnight in lodge.\nDay 08: Duglha to Lobuche(4930m)\nEverest Base Camp trail today gains the attitude almost of 5000m. After early breakfast, we start our hiking uphill gradually. The trail goes directly up the gravely terminal moraine of the Khumbu glacier,for about an hour. It eventually takes you to the higher altitude; so slow and steady pace is important for comfortable ascending. On the reaching top, we have memorial stupas of the dead Sherpa’s and western trekkers and climbers who lost their life in tragic accident in the Himalayas. And we stay overnight in Lobuche.\nDay 09: Lobuche to Gorak Shep(5160m)\nThis is the most important day of Everest Base Camp Trek as we reach Everest Base Camp (EBC). After the breakfast, we walk along the rocky terrain alongside the Khumbu glacier to EBC. We’ll visit Khumbu Ice fall, glacial area of EBC, enjoy the view of Himalayas and make best photos and videos, then we return back to Gorakshep. Gorakshep was base camp for the 1952 Swiss expedition to Everest. There is accommodation here but it’s cold and the altitude makes life uncomfortable. We stay overnight in Gorekshep.\nDay 10: Gorek Shep to Periche via kala Pattar(5545m)\nAfter the breakfast, we will start hiking to a big black rock hill kalapatter, just above Gorekshep. This hike is straight climb up hill for two hour. The trek to Kalapatter is most tough because of there has very windy so we prepared with warm clothing. The summit of Kalapatter offers us the good view of the Mt.Everest (8848m) including the full spread of Khumbu Himalayas. You get better chance to see the highest mountain in the world. As the sunset, the views are more colourful, the kalpatter is one of the prime highlights of Everest Base Camp Trek. We stay overnight at Lobuche because descending down is better for the body and minimize the risk.\nDay 11: Periche to Namche Bazzar (3440m)\nToday, we start our trek from Periche in early morning after breakfast. We begin the trek from Periche cross the bridge over Khumbu Khola then we trek down to Orsho and keep on down pangboche and cross the small bridge again and enter the jungle. And we walking through Debuche , Khumjung and finally we arrive Namche Bazzar. Overnight at Namche.\nDay 12: trek to Lukla from Namche Bazzar\nThe trail from Namche to Lukla (2840m) takes about six and half hours. This day the trail gradually descends and then ascends as well as you cross the Dudh koshi river. On arriving Lukla our trekking officially ends. Stay overnight at Lukla.\nDay 13: fly to Kathmandu\nOur flight to Kathmandu is in the morning. After the breakfast we will check in to Lukla airport then the plane to Kathmandu. Flight is depends on the weather condition sometime flight may delays. On arrival to Kathmandu, we will transfer you to hotel. In the evening, we will meet the again and take your feedback on the trek with our guide.\nWhat is Included:\n- 3 star accommodation in Kathmandu\n- All land transportation\n- Domestic Flight ticket\n- TIMS card\n- National park fees\n- Professional trekking guide\n- All meals during the trekking (Breakfast, lunch, Dinner)\n- Tea House accommodation during the trekking\n- Farewell dinner in Kathmandu\nWhat is excluded:\n- All drinks\n- Lunch and dinner in Kathmandu\n- Personal expenses\n- Guests trekking Insurance","Bolivia Salt Flats Q&A\nThe Bolivia Salt Flats make up the largest and highest salt desert in the world. Situated in the Potosi region in southwest Bolivia (South America), the Bolivia Salt Flats, also known as the Uyuni Salt Flats, attract many visitors for their remarkable topography and otherworldly charm. Here are some answers to the most frequent travel questions.\nWHY SHOULD I VISIT THE BOLIVIA SALT FLATS?\nA Paradise for Photography:\nAt nearly 12,000 square kilometers in size, and an extraordinary flatness, the Bolivia Salt Flats provide an endless horizon, which allows photographers to experiment with perspective and proportion. The results yield very creative and fun pictures that will surely go up on your walls.\nThe endless horizon is perfect for playing with perspective & proportion\nIn addition, during the rainy season, the salt flats are covered with a thin layer of water, which creates an amazing mirror effect for truly breathtaking pictures. The effect is one of floating among the clouds!\nAt over 3,650 meters above seal level (nearly 12,000 ft.), the Bolivia salt flats can prove to be a challenging environment. The journey through the flats requires experienced drivers who also play the role of mechanics, as it is not uncommon for vehicles to break down. Only rugged, mechanical 4×4 vehicles are allowed in the salt desert because of the inhospitable environment. Also, it is very easy to get lost in such an expansive landscape, so it is important to hire good quality guides from a reputable tour company who know their way around. Finally, you can satisfy your inner explorer and visit beautiful caves, lakes and islands in the surroundings.\nSpend the night in a Salt Hotel:\nBelieve it or not, the Bolivia Salt Flats are home to several salt hotels that have sprung in the last few decades to accommodate the growing number of tourists. And they are not as rugged as people might think. Many offer great amenities, such as hot water, spacious rooms and even Internet service. The experience of sleeping in a salt hotel is definitely worth putting on your bucket list.\nWHEN SHOULD I VISIT?\nThe region has two marked seasons: wet and dry. The rainy or wet season usually begins at the end of November and lasts through March. The dry season is typically from April to November. Both seasons offer unique experiences of the Uyuni Salt Flats, so you should plan your trip based on what you want to do.\nDuring the rainy season, the Bolivia salt flats are covered in water. As such, travelers can capture amazing pictures of the Salar’s mirror effect but access to certain areas is limited. In addition, excessive rain may cause some tours to cancel. On the other hand, during the dry season, temperatures drop and the salt ground hardens. As such, visitors can explore the iconic Incahuasi Island, and other areas, usually inaccessible during the wet season.\nHOW DO I GET THERE?\nBecause the Uyuni Salt Flats are located in southwestern Bolivia, travelers can cross the border in Chile and Argentina. They can enter Bolivia through the San Pedro de Atacama desert in Chile or through the town of Quiaca in Argentina. From here, it will be two to three days before you reach the flats, however, the voyage is amazing as you’ll explore colorful high-altitude lakes, geysers, rock valleys and more. The scenery of the Bolivian plateaus are spectacular and a final visit to the Salar will be icing on the cake.\nIf you are looking for a quicker trip to the Bolivia salt flats, simply book a flight to either La Paz or Santa Cruz, Bolivia from where you can take a short flight to the town of Uyuni where the flats are located. In addition, other forms of transportation to Uyuni are available within Bolivia, such as buses (from La Paz) and trains (from Oruro). However, these can take long hours, which leaves less time to visit the country.\nTRAVEL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE HIGHLANDS: (La Paz, Tiwanaku, Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, Uyuni)\n- If you are flying to La Paz, we recommend you rest for at least 3 hours; do not eat much, as digesting food might be a bit slow during your first day due to the altitude. Also, you can drink coca tea (except those who suffer from high blood pressure and heart problems).\n- Wear comfortable footwear and clothes (dress in layers).\n- Drink water, wear sunglasses, sunscreen and sun cap.\n- Bring moisturizing cream and a small backpack for excursions.\n- Do not forget a camera or videocamera to capture the amazing places you’ll visit.\n- We recommend bringing abundant contact lens solution or an additional pair of glasses."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7eec7887-0957-492f-80f0-5e02499a5674>","<urn:uuid:a4afe139-8c46-4591-a303-0f503ee9bad2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Considering the emphasis on reproducibility in research, how do the formatting requirements for presenting results differ between a thesis and dissertation when it comes to ensuring replicability of findings?","answer":"In a thesis, there is explicit emphasis on making results reproducible through practical means - requiring programs to run on lab computers, having staff who can operate the software, and ideally providing a simple interface for repeating experiments or test runs. The dissertation guidelines focus more on the formal presentation of results through properly formatted tables, graphs and charts, with full data versions (like interview transcripts) included in appendices. Both formats stress the importance of reproducibility, but theses place greater emphasis on practical replication through functional software and interfaces, while dissertations emphasize detailed documentation and proper presentation of data.","context":["Frequently Asked Questions\nThe following guide is adopted from my supervisor Joachim Hertzberg. It was a great help for me.\nFormat and Size of a Thesis\nTheses differ in breadth, depth, and size, depending on the grade they are for, i.e., Bachelor, Master, Diploma, or Doctoral thesis, but their structure is essentially the same:\nIntroduction: Summarize scientific and/or application background, formulate precisely the scientific and/or technical problem that the thesis tackles, state clearly the contribution that the thesis makes (YES, even in the introduction – the reader has a right to know what is in the thesis in order to decide whether s/he considers it worth reading), outline thesis structure.\nState of the art: Review in necessary depth and breadth the literature, systems etc. that existed before the thesis has started, i.e., the body of scientific knowledge that the thesis sets out to improve at some point.\nTechnical part: The main part of the thesis describing your contribution – its internal structure differs wildly over different theses, depending on what the contribution actually is.\nSummary, Conclusion, Outlook: The wrap-up part reformulating the contribution, drawing conclusions, if there are any (a summary is not the same thing like a conclusion!), and sketching open issues (only dumb or ingenious theses claim to have solved everything in their ballpark – decide yourself whether you want me to judge your thesis between these two categories!).\nUnless you have had some prior instruction about how to write a thesis, you should give this matter a bit of thought. There are three things to do here:\nAsk your instructor.\nRead prior theses. Check out my backlist of supervised theses. You can download there theses graded with 1.x where the supervisee agreed to publish the thesis online. I have never understood candidates setting out for writing a thesis who tell me they have never before seen other peoples' theses (and don't even seem to find that puzzling). \"Humans are case-based\" (Roger Schank). Act human-like!\nGet yourself some guidance. There's tons of stuff out on the Web and on the bookmarket about how to write theses. A good point to start with for an Informatics-related thesis would be Justin Zobel's book.\nAnd how long should my thesis be?\nThere is no fixed rule about that (\"If a Bachelor thesis has 90 pages, then it's probably an A\" – no!). What matters is the contents and the presentation, where writing concisely is a virtue, but writing too scant means you won't be understood.\nAs a rough guidance, think of the following sizes as defaults:\n- Bachelor thesis / guided research: 35 -- 60 pages,\n- Master or Diploma thesis: 80 pages,\n- Doctoral thesis: 150 pages,\nassuming common-sense formatting. Deviations of these default sizes are welcome if they make sense. For example, if your topic is in image processing, and your thesis contains many images, then it is very likely to be significantly longer. On the other hand, if a bachelor candidate manages to write down the proof that P is unequal to NP in three pages, then he or she will most probably pass.\nA point about formatting. You need not use LaTeX. However, if a student/candidate in Informatics delivers a thesis in a layout that is significantly worse than what TeX/LaTeX has been achieving since 35 years now, then s/he needs to explain that to me. (Remember: Science is all about improving on existing results!) This is particularly true for bibliographies that BibTeX would produce for you as a bibliography has to be, without any further effort.\nWhat's in a Thesis Exposé?\nWhen I accept to supervise a thesis (be it a Bachelor, Master, or Doctoral Thesis), I will ask the candidate to produce, as the first milestone in the project, an exposé of his or her thesis. Its size and the time available for producing it differ for the three types of theses: For a Bachelor thesis, it should be available about 2-3 weeks after the formal thesis start; for a Master thesis after 1 month; for a Doctoral thesis after 3 months. However, the idea and structure are equal in all three cases.\nA thesis is a one-person research project, and think of the exposé as a project plan. It needs to answer the questions: What is the goal of the project? Where does it start from? Why bother? What is the plan to run it in time? In terms of a research project and a thesis exposé, this leads, more sternly, to the sections\nDescribe the goal of your work. This may concern an analytical result (e.g., proving that P=/=NP), or an empirical one (e.g., examine the performance of the 6D SLAM algorithm in an a botanical garden), or a constructive one (e.g., a new algorithm for stereo matching of images taken in complete darkness), or – most frequently for an Informatics thesis – a combination of the three (e.g., a new 3D scan matching algorithm running in O(log log n) and its evaluation in a botanical garden). Normally, the title of the thesis would reflect the goal.\nScientific and/or technological background\nGive a sketch of the state of the art that your thesis sets out to improve. In an exposé, the sketch has to be very short and to the point, mentioning exactly the top most relevant papers. For a university thesis, the background includes stating which local equipment and results you will use, if any (e.g., the USARSIM simulator or the real robot).\nIf you have absolutely no idea where to start in order to reach your goal, you will probably not make it in time for thesis submission. State here where you will start working. In many cases (typically in Bachelor theses, often in Master theses), a particular approach is enforced as part of the thesis topic that you get.\nExpected scientific and/or technological contribution\nState briefly in what respect you expect your result to be significant. It should somehow improve on the state of the art, or provide new empirical data, or lead to a result that was never there before.\nBreak down your thesis project into smaller steps and make a schedule what you plan to do in which order and in what time. Plan in the order of weeks and months rather than days. If possible and useful, formulate milestones, i.e., important intermediate results. Plan the immediate future in more detail than the distant one. Don't plan for doing all the technical work first, and writing everything down from scratch in the last three weeks: That will almost never work out! Plan to interleave the reading / thinking / programming / experimenting and the writing.\nThe size and detail of the exposé varies with the type of thesis, according to the calibre of the problem and the available project time. For a Bachelor thesis, think of 3-4 pages; for a Master thesis 10-15 pages; for a doctoral dissertation 15-35 pages.\nThe author of the exposé is the candidate, i.e., you! Why?: Your thesis supervisors have normally an idea of the thesis topic that they give to you. Your formulation in the exposé shall make sure that you have the same understanding of what you are supposed to work on. Moreover, much of the exposé text may in fact go into your final thesis: a typical introduction shares much of the material with your exposé, and you should have written that yourself.\nBe prepared, however, to adjust your topic while working on it! In fact, this is the norm rather than the exception, which leads to the final remark about the exposé: This is a plan for your thesis work, and, like all plans in life, is subject to revision in detail! Don't hesitate to change details of what your exposé says, if it turns out to be necessary. However, do hesitate to change significantly the topic and approach of your thesis that you have described in your exposé – before you do that, consult your instructors!\nReproducibility (a much too unfrequently asked question!)\nA valid scientific experiment has to be reproducible. In Informatics, this norm is frequently violated, and even more often, nobody seems to care about reproducing some particular experiment. But that does not invalidate the norm.\nFor a good or even excellent thesis, this means: If your thesis goals include empirical and/or constructive elements, then your results need to be reproducible for others -- these may be your advisors, and, even better, anybody who reads your thesis and wants to check your results or wants to examine your examples by himself or herself. So, if you write a program or a set of modules as a part of your thesis work, please do make sure that they run at least on our lab computers and that there is somebody of the staff who knows where the software is and how it can be used. Even better, write a little(!) simple(!) interface (which may or may not be graphical) that allows at least your experiments or test runs to be repeated, or, optimally, that gives everybody a chance to do their own experiments or test runs with their own test data. Frequently, bachelor or master candidates, when facing texts from the literature, complain that the reported results cannot be checked or easily varied; and then, the same candidates would often deliver their own results in exactly the same manner that they found so irritating about others' work. Isn't that inconsistent? And, what is worse: It is no sound science!","How to structure a dissertation\nA dissertation or thesis is a long piece of academic writing based on original research, submitted as part of a doctoral, master’s, or bachelor’s degree.\nYour dissertation is probably the longest piece of writing you’ve ever done, and it can be intimidating to know where to start. This article helps you work out exactly what you should include and where to include it.\nTable of contents\nDeciding on your dissertation’s structure\nNot all dissertations are structured exactly the same – the form your research takes will depend on your location, discipline, topic and approach.\nFor example, dissertations in the humanities are often structured more like a long essay, building an overall argument to support a central thesis, with chapters organized around different themes or case studies.\nBut if you’re doing empirical research in the sciences or social sciences, your dissertation should generally contain all of the following elements. In many cases, each will be a separate chapter, but sometimes you might combine them. For example, in certain kinds of qualitative social science, the results and discussion will be woven together rather than separated.\nThe order of sections can also vary between fields and countries. For example, some universities advise that the conclusion should always come before the discussion.\nIf in doubt about how your thesis or dissertation should be structured, always check your department’s guidelines and consult with your supervisor.\nThe very first page of your document contains your dissertation’s title, your name, department, institution, degree program, and submission date. Sometimes it also includes your student number, your supervisor’s name, and the university’s logo. Many programs have strict requirements for formatting the dissertation title page.\nThe acknowledgements section is usually optional, and gives space for you to thank everyone who helped you in writing your dissertation. This might include your supervisors, participants in your research, and friends or family who supported you.\nThe abstract is a short summary of your dissertation, usually about 150-300 words long. You should write it at the very end, when you’ve completed the rest of the dissertation. In the abstract, make sure to:\n- State the main topic and aims of your research\n- Describe the methods you used\n- Summarize the main results\n- State your conclusions\nAlthough the abstract is very short, it’s the first part (and sometimes the only part) of your dissertation that people will read, so it’s important that you get it right. If you’re struggling to write a strong abstract, read our guide on how to write an abstract.\nTable of Contents\nIn the table of contents, list all of your chapters and subheadings and their page numbers. The dissertation contents page gives the reader an overview of your structure and helps easily navigate the document.\nAll parts of your dissertation should be included in the table of contents, including the appendices. You can generate a table of contents automatically in Word if you used heading styles.\nList of Figures and Tables\nIf you have used a lot of tables and figures in your dissertation, you should itemize them in a numbered list. You can automatically generate this list using the Insert Caption feature in Word.\nList of Abbreviations\nIf you have used a lot of abbreviations in your dissertation, you can include them in an alphabetized list of abbreviations so that the reader can easily look up their meanings.\nIf you have used a lot of highly specialized terms that will not be familiar to your reader, it might be a good idea to include a glossary. List the terms alphabetically and explain each term with a brief description or definition.\nIn the introduction, you set up your dissertation’s topic, purpose, and relevance, and tell the reader what to expect in the rest of the dissertation. The introduction should:\n- Establish your research topic, giving necessary background information to contextualize your work\n- Narrow down the focus and define the scope of the research\n- Discuss the state of existing research on the topic, showing your work’s relevance to a broader problem or debate\n- Clearly state your research questions and objectives\n- Give an overview of your dissertation’s structure\nEverything in the introduction should be clear, engaging, and relevant to your research. By the end, the reader should understand the what, why and how of your research. If you need more help, read our guide on how to write a dissertation introduction.\nLiterature review / Theoretical framework\nBefore you start on your research, you should have conducted a literature review to gain a thorough understanding of the academic work that already exists on your topic. This means:\n- Collecting sources (e.g. books and journal articles) and selecting the most relevant ones\n- Critically evaluating and analyzing each source\n- Drawing connections between them (e.g. themes, patterns, conflicts, gaps) to make an overall point\nIn the dissertation literature review chapter or section, you shouldn’t just summarize existing studies, but develop a coherent structure and argument that leads to a clear basis or justification for your own research. For example, it might aim to show how your research:\n- Addresses a gap in the literature\n- Takes a new theoretical or methodological approach to the topic\n- Proposes a solution to an unresolved problem\n- Advances a theoretical debate\n- Builds on and strengthens existing knowledge with new data\nThe literature review often becomes the basis for a theoretical framework, in which you define and analyze the key theories, concepts and models that frame your research. In this section you can answer descriptive research questions about the relationship between concepts or variables.\nThe methodology chapter or section describes how you conducted your research, allowing your reader to assess its validity. You should generally include:\n- The overall approach and type of research (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, experimental, ethnographic)\n- Your methods of collecting data (e.g. interviews, surveys, archives)\n- Details of where, when, and with whom the research took place\n- Your methods of analyzing data (e.g. statistical analysis, discourse analysis)\n- Tools and materials you used (e.g. computer programs, lab equipment)\n- A discussion of any obstacles you faced in conducting the research and how you overcame them\n- An evaluation or justification of your methods\nYour aim in the methodology is to accurately report what you did, as well as convincing the reader that this was the best approach to answering your research questions or objectives.\nNext, you report the results of your research. You can structure this section around sub-questions, hypotheses, or topics. Only report results that are relevant to your objectives and research questions. In some disciplines, the results section is strictly separated from the discussion, while in others the two are combined.\nFor example, for qualitative methods like in-depth interviews, the presentation of the data will often be woven together with discussion and analysis, while in quantitative and experimental research, the results should be presented separately before you discuss their meaning. If you’re unsure, consult with your supervisor and look at sample dissertations to find out the best structure for your research.\nIn the results section it can often be helpful to include tables, graphs and charts. Think carefully about how best to present your data, and don’t include tables or figures that just repeat what you have written – they should provide extra information or usefully visualize the results in a way that adds value to your text.\nFull versions of your data (such as interview transcripts) can be included as an appendix.\nThe discussion is where you explore the meaning and implications of your results in relation to your research questions. Here you should interpret the results in detail, discussing whether they met your expectations and how well they fit with the framework that you built in earlier chapters. If any of the results were unexpected, offer explanations for why this might be. It’s a good idea to consider alternative interpretations of your data and discuss any limitations that might have influenced the results.\nThe discussion should reference other scholarly work to show how your results fit with existing knowledge. You can also make recommendations for future research or practical action.\nThe dissertation conclusion should concisely answer the main research question, leaving the reader with a clear understanding of your central argument.\nIn some academic conventions, the conclusion refers to a short section that comes before the discussion: first you directly state your overall conclusions, then you discuss and interpret their meaning.\nIn other contexts, however, the conclusion refers to the final chapter, where you wrap up your dissertation with a final reflection on what you did and how you did it. This type of conclusion often also includes recommendations for research or practice.\nIn this section, it’s important to show how your findings contribute to knowledge in the field and why your research matters. What have you added to what was already known?\nYou must include full details of all sources that you have cited in a reference list (sometimes also called a works cited list or bibliography). It’s important to follow a consistent citation style. Each style has strict and specific requirements for how to format your sources in the reference list.\nTo save time creating the reference list and make sure your citations are correctly and consistently formatted, you can use our free APA Citation Generator.\nYour dissertation itself should contain only essential information that directly contributes to answering your research question. Documents you have used that do not fit into the main body of your dissertation (such as interview transcripts, survey questions or tables with full figures) can be added as appendices.\nEditing and proofreading\nMaking sure all the sections are in the right place is only the first step to a well-written dissertation. Leave plenty of time for editing and proofreading. Grammar mistakes and sloppy formatting errors can drag down the quality of your hard work.\nYou should plan to write and revise several drafts of your thesis or dissertation before focusing on language mistakes, typos and inconsistencies."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a6c381f2-ab05-4dd1-bb93-6a2b326fb4e5>","<urn:uuid:c4faa034-f0c6-4e1b-9c7e-5a358cdcb4d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey outdoor folks! I'm trying to decide between a regular waterproof jacket and a tent for my next purchase. Which one typically has higher waterproof ratings? 🤔","answer":"Waterproof jackets and tents are both rated in millimeters for their waterproofing, but jackets typically have higher ratings. Waterproof jackets can reach ratings up to 20,000mm (equivalent to withstanding 64 feet of water in 24 hours), while tents like MSR's models often use lower ratings around 1200mm. However, it's worth noting that both products use different types of waterproof coatings - jackets often use breathable membranes like Gore-Tex or HyVent, while tents use polyurethane coatings like Durashield combined with water-repellent treatments like silicone or DWR.","context":["Clothing & Apparel 101: Waterproof Versus Water-Resistant OuterwearDecember 14th, 2013 By Adam Broderick\nOther than injuries and broken equipment, wet weather has always been the quickest way to a ruined outdoor adventure. But it doesn’t have to be.\nStaying under the safety of your tent’s rainfly isn’t the only option when a storm rolls in, unless of course all you brought was that beautiful 800-fill down puffy. That jacket may be the warmest garment in your closet, but anyone who’s spent more than ten seconds in one during a torrential downpour knows it will just turn you into a human sponge under those conditions. Thankfully, dragging around more rubber than a dominatrix isn’t the only alternative anymore!\nTahoe Mountain Sports put this waterproof gear guide together to help you navigate the modern plethora of sleeker, lighter, more-comfortable, water-shedding, moisture-wicking, wind-breaking and all-around-adventure-slaying wet-weather gear out there.\nOuterwear fabrics these days almost all have some built-in (or coated on) resistance to getting wet, but there’s a big difference between water-resistant or water-repellent and truly waterproof outerwear. Under harsh conditions, water-resistant/repellent quickly translates to absorbent. It won’t take those types of jackets, pants, boots etc. long to become saturated in heavy rain (e.g., the aforementioned puffy).\nHow Waterproof is It?\nLegitimately waterproof means sealed seams, welded or storm-flap-protected zippers and waterproof membranes. These items are rated based on how well they resist the entry of pressurized moisture in a laboratory setting. Most are measured in millimeters, but what the heck do those numbers actually mean?\nThe “mm rating” of a waterproof garment tells how much rainfall the item can withstand over a 24-hour period without any moisture leaking in. The higher the “mm rating”, the more waterproof the garment is. There are just shy of 305 mm in a foot, so a 20,000 mm waterproofing is pretty darn waterproof (withstanding 64 feet of water in 24 hours). Some garments, however, might also (or instead) provide a “psi rating” (pounds-per-square-inch).\nA higher “psi rating” means a garment can handle more pressure. Rainfall can range between 1 and 7 psi. So, why do you see ratings of 25 or even 40? It’s because other forms of pressure can try to squeeze that moisture through the waterproof membranes in your outerwear (e.g., pack weight on your shoulders/back or sitting in the snow). That must be why my butt always gets wet when I’m snowboarding!\nBreathable vs. Non-Breathable Outerwear\nOkay, now that you’ve calculated the pressure of your bottom, let’s talk about those pits. Non-breathable fabrics are going to be the most bomber of waterproof materials, but that’s not going to help much if you’re moving around a lot.\nLook at it this way: Breathable fabrics (e.g., Mountain Hardwear Dry.Q Elite) let moisture move from the inside out, but not from the outside in. Non-breathables don’t let moisture move in either direction. That’s why Old Yellow, your raincoat from the 90’s, keeps you dry until you start exercising, then the inside turns into a steam room.\nBreathability is measured by how many grams of water vapor will pass through a square meter of your garment’s fabric, from the inside to outside, in a 24-hour period (g/m2/24 hours). The pores the vapor passes through are thousands of times smaller than a raindrop, which is why something waterproof can also be breathable. Waterproof membranes also usually incorporate materials resistant to oils, like those from your body, sunscreen, etc., that might compromise the waterproofing over time.\nIn summary, the rubber raincoat you grew up with, or a more stylish modern version made from polyurethane-coated nylon, will always keep you the driest if you are only doing things like hanging outside or walking a short distance to school, the store or across town on an errand-run.\nBut if you are backpacking through the Sumatran rainforest, jogging in Seattle or backcountry skiing the Sierra Nevada, you’ll want something that is both waterproof and breathable.\nHey, That’s Not Waterproof!\nLeather is not fully waterproof, ever. Neither are water-repellent coatings. But many waterproof products do use water-repellent coatings, because the waterproof membrane is usually sandwiched between other layers. This is generally called the DWR or “durable water repellent” coating/finish. Washing your Levis in some Nikwax, however, does not make them a pair of ski pants.\nNikwax is, however, a great way to extend the life of your waterproof garments. You see, your garment’s DWR will wear out before its waterproof membrane does. And if you revitalize it before that happens, the garment lives on. Once the DWR is completely gone, though, there’s no bringing it back. And the rest of that garment is now compromised. But please, read each item’s care instructions before playing Scientist. Then try either NikWax Tech Wash for in-laundry care or NikWax TX Direct for spray-on pre-wash care.\nHere are some of our favorite industry-leading waterproof-breathable membranes:\n- The North Face HyVent\n- Helly Hansen Helly Tech\n- PolarTec NeoShell\n- Marmot PreCip and Marmot MemBrain\n- Mountain Hardwear Dry.Q Elite\n- Gore-Tex (used in many brands)\n- eVent Fabrics (used in many brands)","Originally Published June 2nd, 2015.\nWhen you’re looking to purchase a tent, it’s easy to compare tent features, but it’s a little harder once you get into fabric specs. At MSR, we put a lot of thought into the details, including the type of fabrics and coatings used for each tent, and it’s worth understanding what the numbers mean. In this post, we’ll show you how to read the specifications of tent fabrics. In part two, we’ll get into waterproof ratings and what they mean.\nLet’s start with the tent’s spec description, typically laid out as a formula. Here’s an example:\n20D x 330T ripstop nylon 1200mm Durashield™ polyurethane & silicone\n[denier] [thread count] [waterproof coating] [water-repellent coating]\nDenier, e.g. 20D\nDenier is used to determine the thickness of the fibers in the tent fabric. It’s a unit of density based on the length and weight of a yarn or fiber. A single strand of silk is considered 1 denier. The fibers in a 40-denier nylon fabric have over 6.5 times the diameter of the silk strand, and almost 1.5 times the diameter of fibers in a 20-denier or “20D” nylon fabric.\nAs you can see, the higher the denier count, the greater the diameter of the yarn.\nDoes a larger denier number mean the yarn is stronger?\nOften it does, but not always. Strength also depends upon the material. For example, the following tent fabrics are shown in increasing order of strength:\n- Nylon 6\n- Nylon 66\nAt MSR, we use our engineering and design expertise to determine when and where to use different fabrics to serve each tent best for its intended use. For example, we selected higher strength Nylon 6 and Nylon 66 fabric for the hardwearing floors and rainflies in our Hubba™ NX and Carbon Reflex™ series backpacking tents. But when designing our Elixir™ series tents, we chose packcloth for the rainflies. Packcloth, a polyester fabric, is not as light as nylon but is more durable—and durability was a top priority for the Elixir tents. (Polyester also doesn’t stretch as easily as nylon, making it more user friendly, and it’s naturally more UV and water-resistant.) These are just a few of the many factors we consider when selecting fabrics for MSR tents.\nComparison of fabric type, denier and thread count\n10D nylon 300D packcloth 10D micromesh\nThread Count, e.g. 330T\nThis measurement refers to the sum of the vertical and horizontal threads (or yarns) per square inch of fabric. A higher thread count doesn’t always mean a stronger fabric. For instance, our Carbon Reflex and Hubba NX tent canopies and rainflies—which are made of 20D nylon—use a high thread count of 330 threads per inch, yet our Elixir rainflies—stronger because of their 68D packcloth fabric—use only 210 threads per inch.\nAt MSR, we carefully consider how thread count, fabric type and denier (fiber thickness) will affect the overall tent performance, and we make our decisions based not only on how the tent will be used (e.g. thru-hiking, weekend backpacking, basecamping), but also on where the fabrics are used in the different parts of the tent. Tent floors, for example, require strong, tear-resistant fabric, while rainflies need to be strong yet also supple.\nWaterproof and water-repellent coatings, e.g. 1200mm & silicone\nThe last set of specs in the formula refers to fabric coatings. The first part is the waterproofing rating, a measurement we’ll discuss at length the next post: Understanding Tent Fabrics Part 2: Waterproof Fabrics. In short, a fabric’s waterproof rating measures how much water can be sustained on top of the coated fabric—in this case, 1200mm—before water can leak through. For each MSR tent, we select an ideal level of waterproof coating, which is applied to the interior side of the base fabric, to achieve waterproofness without compromising tear-strength.\nThe second part of the above spec refers to the type of water-resistant coating, such as silicone or DWR (Durable Water Repellent), which is applied to the exterior side of the tent fabric to cause water from rain or dew to bead up and resist saturating the material. Silicone coating offers some UV resistance and makes the fabric softer, pliable and a little stronger, making it a good choice for rainflies. Tent floors, which don’t require UV resistance, typically use DWR.\nWhat to look for in your tent fabric specs\nUltimately, you want to keep in mind that the higher the denier or thread count, the stronger and heavier the fabric. If you want a lightweight tent (and everyone does), you have to accept that one made with 15D fabric won’t be as strong as one made with 40D fabric. At MSR, we try to strike that ideal balance in weight and fabric strength by putting extra fabric strength where it’s needed (double- or triple-reinforcing the stress points) and leaving it off where it isn’t needed in order to save weight. If you decide to purchase a lightweight tent, you should take care to select from among tents with reinforced stress points in all the right places because these details, like all the fabric specs, can affect tent performance. And we want to help you find the best tent for you."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f9925b6d-0e0a-4bca-8379-2720e1ebf7a4>","<urn:uuid:a15d3fe6-2aeb-4f14-a5e5-b336eac2ec62>"],"error":null}

Through music, many possibilities are created. You must transcend challenges and disappointments and persist to the end. It is vital that you truly recognize the beauty of music.” - Words from my teacher, the legendary Russian pianist Lazar Berman, that inspired me most.\nRUEIBIN CHEN Pianist\nMr. Rueibin Chen's distinguished career as an internationally-acclaimed pianist has earned him a reputation for technical brilliance, immense energy, and intense artistic expression.\nHe was invited to be the opening soloist in the 2010 World Expo in China, performing the Yellow River Concerto. Critics hailed it as the best performance of the iconic piece in its history. His masterful performances of Rachmaninoff's complete piano concertos (including the Paganini Rhapsody Op. 43) in two consecutive nights at Taiwan’s National Concert Hall garnered significant critical acclaim. The performance was considered to be “the first of its kind and has left a sensational imprint in the minds of the overflowed audience.\" Such praise befits \"one of those geniuses that come along once in twenty years.\" (Neue Zürcher Zeitung)\nAn Austrian-Chinese pianist born in Taiwan, Chen won a total of eighteen medals, five of them gold, before the age of 20 in various international piano competitions in Tel Aviv (Rubinstein), Warsaw (Chopin), Salt Lake City (Bachauer), Athens (Callas), Vienna, Manresa, and Italy (Rome, Rachmaninoff, Bellini, and Stresa), to name a few.\nChen received his first piano lessons from his father when he was five. At the age of thirteen, he was selected by the government in a national talent search and was sent to Vienna, Austria, where he obtained a concert diploma from the Vienna Conservatory. Subsequently, he received a soloist's examination award from the Hannover Hochschule für Musik in Germany and then continued his study under the legendary Russian pianist Lazar Berman as his only disciple of Asian descent.\nIn addition to his masterful artistry, Chen’s humble background and the hardship he endured as a youngster growing up in Europe all by himself have inspired many young pianists, both in Asia and abroad. His unique blend of East/West sensibility, his Chinese heritage, his European upbringing and training, his modest personality and his inspiring personal story have earned him a significant following all over the world.\nChen started his career as a child prodigy and concert pianist at age ten when he made his debut with the Taipei Symphony Orchestra. He was named the Principal Soloist of \"Moldova\" Iasi and Tirgu Mures Philharmonic Orchestra in Romania. He has appeared as a soloist with many orchestras around the world, including the Utah Symphony, Budapest Symphony, Prague Symphony, Czech State Philharmonic of Brno, Moscow State Symphony, Russian State Symphony, Singapore Symphony, New Philharmonia Japan, Shanghai Symphony, National Symphony Taiwan, Taipei Symphony, Hong Kong Sinfonietta, and London Chamber Players, among others.\nChen made his European debut to much acclaim in the Grossensaal of the Konzerthaus in Vienna in 1984. He has been invited to perform at many festivals, such as the International Salzburg Music Festival, Vienna Spring Festival, Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, Hong Kong Festival, Taipei Music Festival, Taipei Arts Festival, the International Rachmaninoff Music Festival in Moscow, the Janáček Music Festival in the Czech Republic (formerly Czech Republic), the Chopin Festivals in Austria, Czech Republic and Poland, various festivals in Romania, and the Auckland International Piano Festival.\nHe has participated at many internationally and historically significant events, including his performances as the designated soloist of the 75th Anniversary of Turkey and the designated soloist for the Macau/China Reunification Celebration Ceremony. He was especially honored to be invited by the Chinese government to perform at the World Expo in Shanghai.\nChen tours regularly throughout the world, performing in major concert halls, such as Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, Kennedy Performing Arts Center in Washington, DC, Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, Kodak Theater in Hollywood, Jack Singer Concert Hall in Calgary, Musikverein and Konzerthaus in Vienna, Gewandhaus in Leipzig, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Opera de Monte Carlo, Warsaw Philharmonie, Bolshoi Hall in Moscow, F. Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv, Suntory Hall in Tokyo, the Symphony Hall in Osaka, Hong Kong Cultural Center, Beijing Music Hall, National Chiang Kai-Shek Cultural Center in Taipei, Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Sydney Opera House. He has held various artist-in-residence positions for various entities, including Hong Kong Radio Television, and he has acted as music director of various chamber festivals.\nHe has been selected as the soloist for many orchestral world tours, including the Taipei Symphony on its Asian tour, Kaohsiung City Traditional Orchestra of Taiwan on its America tour and its Australia tour, the Evergreen Symphony, and the Taipei Symphony on their China tours. Chen has worked with many renowned conductors, such as Sergiu Comissiona, Antoni Wit, Pavel Kogan, Joseph Silverstein, and András Ligeti.\nIn recent years, in addition to his solo recitals and orchestral performances of classical repertoire, Chen has devoted much effort to the collaboration and premiering of new solo and piano concerto works. Critically-acclaimed new piano concerto compositions, such as the Love River Concerto, which depicts the fondness for a famous river in Taiwan, and the Winter Trilogy, written to celebrate the Hakka heritage, were both composed through a collaboration with Chen on the piano part and premiered worldwide with performances at Lincoln Center in New York, Sydney Opera House in Australia, and the Hong Kong Cultural Center.\nChen is also an active chamber musician and has performed with international chamber groups, such as the Lark Quartet and Shanghai Quartet.\nHe has given master classes in musical strongholds, such as the New England Conservatory in Boston and the Masterplayer International Music Academy in Lugano. He has also served as a jury member in international piano competitions in Switzerland.\nIn commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Chopin’s birth in 2010, Chen launched a project to present a series of concerts featuring Chopin's masterpieces, including solo and piano concerto works, in major cities throughout America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region from 2008 through 2010.\nIn between his demanding touring schedule, Chen has devoted much of his time to helping the underprivileged and various worthy causes. In 2012, he was the keynote celebrity performer at the American Red Cross Gala in Los Angeles and performed for the gala guests and Ms. Jane Seymour. That same year, he organized the first National Piano Competition for Disabled Youngsters in Taiwan. The winners got a dream of lifetime to perform on stage with Chen in two large concerts with over 2,000 people in the audience. Also in that year he participated in a special project called “Play Me I’m Yours” with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and a benefit concert with the Pasadena Symphony in honor of Mr. Marvin Hamlisch.\nHonoring Rachmaninoff’s 140th anniversary, in 2013 Chen has been touring worldwide performing programs dedicated to the composer. In the following year he will be touring Greater China performing forty concerts with orchestras and solo recitals.\nChen is the best-selling classical musician in Greater China in CD recordings. He has produced a dozen CD recordings with various labels, such as Universal, Naxos International, KKM Austria, and Jingo Records, recording works by Chopin, Liszt, Wagner-Liszt, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky, and Piazolla, as well as his own transcriptions. His concerts have been broadcast on many radio and television programs throughout Europe, Asia, America, and Australia.\nPrizes and Recognition\nIn addition to the awards from various international piano competitions, Chen has been the recipient of various distinguished awards and honors, such as the \"Bösendorfer\" prize in Vienna and being chosen by Taiwan’s Minister of Culture as the \"Best Young Artist.\" Chen won the \"Best Prize for Contributions to Music\" at the Salzburg International Music Festival and the \"Albert Roussel Prize\" in Paris. He was invited by the president of Taiwan, Teng-Hui Lee, to his Festival Concert at the Presidential Palace, which was broadcast by national radio and television networks. He was awarded the \"Taiwan Millennium Best Artistic Performance Award\" in 2000, the \"Golden Melody Awards\" for \"Best Performance\" and for \"Best Album,\" and the \"Character of Highest Potential\" in Taiwan. Chen was also honored by the county supervisor of greater Los Angeles County for promoting diplomacy between the United States and Taiwan through music with his solo recital at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\nChen's musicianship has been highly praised by many renowned musicians and critics. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was particularly impressed with his astonishing technique. Spanish pianist Alicia de Larrocha described his playing as \"magnificent\" and \"full of promise.\" After his performance of Rachmaninoff's second piano sonata in a piano competition, he received tremendous accolades from former New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg, who wrote that Chen's interpretation was the best he had heard by a young artist in a long time. The Boston Globe raved, \"He plays with white-hot energy, steel-fingered power and athletic virtuosity,” and that he also “show(s) that he can play with delicacy and imagination.\" Additionally, Christoph Braendle, a well-known Swiss writer, gives a detailed account of the Chinese-Austrian pianist's musical achievements in his book, Die Wiener.\nCapriccio Chamber Orchestra\nTel/Fax: + 886-2-3233-6304"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:467cc088-d8dc-4785-9c92-48ae6937d721>","<urn:uuid:285db2ff-c572-4f56-ab80-ad60b3ed7cb8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Pour les joueurs stratégiques, how does the turn structure work in Godtear?","answer":"Godtear features a two-phase turn structure: Strategic and Tactical. The Strategic Phase comes first, providing a zoomed-out battlefield view where Champions plan, set traps, and shift their warbands to prepare for engagement. During this phase, each player activates their entire warband. The Tactical Phase follows, zooming into the action where players take turns activating models from their warbands as their plans unfold and combat begins. Mastering both phases is essential for success.","context":["Dette er full pakke fra Kickstarter med ALT som var tilgjengelig.\nDet meste av dette er ikke tilgjengelig i vanlig distribusjon enda.\nNeoprene spillmatte følger også med\nChoose Champions. Destroy enemies. Claim Tears. Ascend.\nThe gods have been forsaken…\n…their bodies shattered as they wept at the betrayal of their sacred covenant. Their tears fell from the heavens as a magnificent rain, each a crystalline shard containing the raw essence of the divine, borne upon the mortal realm by tragedy and sorrow. These are the Godtear, and in each of these gems lies not only the strength to master the petty kingdoms of mortals but the promise of transcendence.\nYet the power of the gods cannot be so easily usurped.\nMost creatures are consumed by exposure to such wild and untameable energies, their bodies destroyed in an instant. Instead the Godtear wait for the Chosen, those destined by some unknown force as heirs to the gods. These individuals have risen as mighty Champions among their people, able not only to survive exposure to the Godtear but absorb this potency and claim it as their own.\nAllied with other Champions and aided by devoted followers they search far and wide for the remaining shards, each discovery one step further along the path of immortality. The wisest of their number are not fooled by such brotherhood. The ties uniting the Chosen are transient, and respect earned in battle is worth little in this world. It is well known even the most steadfast and honourable shall turn upon each other during the final trials.\nFor it is only the legacy of few to claim the mantle of ascended godhood…\nThe first step of playing a game of Godtear is choosing your Champions, there are no factions in Godtear so you can choose whichever Champions you wish!\nThese Champions are as diverse as the lands from which they hail. Each possesses a unique combination of knowledge, skills, and strengths, all of which will be needed in their quest for godhood.\nChampions are loosely categorised into four distinct classes:\nSLAYERS are the most familiar type of Champion. They focus on dealing damage to a single target, but their individual methods vary greatly. For example, one Slayer could make brutal shots with a bow from a great distance while another could smash an enemy’s face with their fists while yet another could whip their Followers into ruthless murder machines. Regardless of the methods they employ, however, Slayers are the go-to Champion class for dealing with tough targets.\nGUARDIANS concern themselves less with the opposing warbands destruction than with their own warband’s longevity. Most Guardians are extremely tough in their own right, but Guardians are far more varied than walking barriers. Guardians can focus on taking hits for nearby allies, increasing damage reduction for themselves or others, healing friendly models’ wounds, or even returning armies of Followers to the battle.\nMAELSTROMS place a greater focus on the quantity of their attacks than their individual quality. These Champions can’t deal as much damage as Slayers against hard targets, but they’re more capable of thinning out the ranks of an opponent’s army. Maelstroms also favour a more fluid fighting style, moving from enemy to enemy rather than going toe-to-toe with a single foe. As with any Godtear class, this can take many forms – from fireballs blasting apart clustered enemies to whirlwind style attacks against every adjacent enemy to effects that chain from foe to foe.\nSHAPERS, last but not least, weave the flow of battle to give their warband the upper hand. Shapers typically have at least one ability to move other models (friendly and/or enemy), but they’re also the class that interacts most directly with scenario objectives and the battlefield board. Right down to how they make Skill rolls and deal damage, Shapers are a unique breed, but what they lack in raw offence, they make up for with abilities that can change the course of battle at its pivotal moment.\nChoosing which classes to include in your warband can be a tough decision with lots of pros and cons to weigh against one another. Once you consider the unique ways each Champion embodies their class, the decisions become even tougher.\nWith your Champions selected and gathered together to form your warband you’re ready to play! So, how do you win?\nA game of Godtear breaks down into 5 turns and will always end between turn 3 and 5. A combination of Turn Tokens and the Battle Ladder are used to show the ebb and flow of a clash between two warbands.\nDuring a turn the actions and movement of your warband will move the Turn Token towards your end of the Battle Ladder. Your token will move as you take out Champions, cull followers and control Godtears.\nNaturally your opponent will be opposing you, trying to drag the Turn Token onto their side of the Ladder. At the end of the turn, the player with the Turn Token in their half of the Battle Ladder wins the turn and gains the number of Victory Points shown on the reverse side of that turn’s Turn Token. Turns increase in value as the action intensifies and then taper off again as the battle nears its conclusion.\nThe first player to have 5 Victory Points wins the game!\nTo represent the flow of battle Godtear features a unique turn structure with two phases; Strategic and Tactical. In each of these phases warbands activate differently and have different abilities.\nThe Strategic Phase begins the turn with a zoomed-out view of the battlefield. Champions plan, set traps and shift their warbands readying for engagement. During this phase each player activates their whole warband.\nThe Tactical Phase zooms into the action as the engagement begins. Players take turns activating models from their warbands as the plans from the previous phase are set in motion and combat begins.\nMastery of both phases is the key to establishing your legacy on your way to ascension."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1a7c5894-f9d6-4e45-b596-61351a0bcb2e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Chinese religious sites integrate with gardens, and what cultural practices are preserved in these spaces?","answer":"Chinese religious sites and gardens maintain a deep integration, combining spiritual and cultural elements. The Shaolin Temple, dedicated to Chan (Zen) Buddhism, exemplifies this connection as a UNESCO site that preserves both religious architecture and cultural practices like Shaolin Kung-Fu. In garden spaces, this integration continues - for example, the Lion Grove Garden was built by a Zen Buddhist monk as part of a monastery, while the Lingering Garden preserves UNESCO Intangible World Heritage Arts including traditional Pingtan music and Guqin musical performances. These spaces often served multiple purposes, as seen in the Jin Dynasty where a former education minister's house became a Jingde temple before being transformed into the Mountain Villa with Embracing Beauty garden, demonstrating how religious and cultural elements have historically coexisted in these spaces.","context":["Alongside the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, Henan is widely regarded as the cradle of Chinese civilisation. Archaeological sites have shown that northern Henan was settled as early as the Neolithic Period (c. 8500-2100 BC), with cultural sites such as Yangshao and Longshan dating back over thousands of years. Near the modern-day city of Anyang, the ancient Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BC) placed its capital at a site called Yin sometime around 1300 BC. It was in these ancient ruins that archaeologists discovered the Oracle Bones and Oracle Bone Script, the earliest known Chinese writing system in history. Over time, three of Henan’s cities (Luoyang, Anyang, and Kaifeng) would come to be ranked among the Seven Great Ancient Capitals of China. Yet don’t be mistaken for thinking that Henan’s glory days are behind it! It still has plenty to offer in the way of stunning scenic spots and historical attractions.\nWhen the Shang Dynasty fell to the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1045-256 BC), Yin (Anyang) lost its status as capital, but the cities of Henan were destined to make an epic comeback. Luoyang served as the imperial capital for the Eastern Zhou (c. 771-256 BC), Eastern Han (25-220 AD), Wei (220-265), Western Jin (265–316 AD), Northern Wei (386–535), and Later Tang (923-937) dynasties, while Kaifeng enjoyed the title throughout the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). Their strategic location as gateways between the North China Plain and the Huai River basin meant that these two cities played a key role in Chinese history even when they weren’t the official capitals. But, when it comes to Henan’s venerable history, it seems that the higher you climb, the harder you fall!\nHenan suffered profoundly during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), as widespread famine, drought, and destruction crippled the province. The after-effects of this devastating period resonated right up until the 1960s, resulting in the deaths of millions of people. Fortunately the region has since recovered, and is now one of the most popular provinces in China for tourism. Regional handicrafts such as the Junci porcelain of Yuzhou, the jade carvings of Zhenping, and the Tang Dynasty tricoloured pottery of Luoyang enjoy great renown throughout the country. The provincial capital of Zhengzhou is a major hub for rail transport, and the province remains one of the country’s main producers of silk. Like a phoenix, Henan has veritably risen out of the ashes!\nThe province benefits from a temperate climate, bordering on humid subtropical in the south and humid continental in the north. Winters can drop to a chilly −2 °C (28 °F), while temperatures rise to a comfortable 28 °C (82 °F) in summer. Most of the province is dominated by the North China Plain, with mountains rising in the west and the Yellow River cutting across the north. The magnificent Mount Song, one of China’s Five Great Mountains, towers over the eastern part of the province. This sacred mountain boasts a plethora of spectacular temples, the most famous of which is the Shaolin Temple.\nDating back over 1,500 years, the Shaolin Temple is dedicated to the Chan (Zen) sect of Buddhism and was the birthplace of Shaolin Kung-Fu. In 2010, it was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with its accompanying Pagoda Forest. Other Buddhist sites, such as the Longmen Grottoes and the White Horse Temple at Luoyang, have become popular tourist attractions and are some of the earliest examples of Buddhist architecture in the country.\nAlongside the Shaolin Temple and the Longmen Grottoes, the ancient ruins of Yin, the Shang Dynasty capital, were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006. From the mountain resort of Jigong to the colossal statue of the Spring Temple Buddha, you’ll find sites of major historical significance wherever you turn in Henan! And, if all that history becomes too taxing for you, you can always settle down to an evening performance of the celebrated Henan or Yu Opera.","This city in China is bursting with UNESCO World Heritage gardens\nCategory: Fields and StreamsVia: buzz-of-the-orient • 4 years ago • 4 comments\nThis city in China is bursting with UNESCO World Heritage gardens\nBy JACQUELINE GULLEDGE , Mother Nature Network, August 3 2018\nHumble Administrator's Garden is one of the most famous of the gardens of Suzhou. (Photo: Leonid Andronov/Shutterstock)\nMore than 2,600 years ago in an area west of current-day Shanghai, the city of Suzhou was the capital of the Wu Kingdom and home to several royal hunting gardens and classical gardens. During the fourth century B.C., private gardens became popular and remained so until the 18th century. More than 50 gardens still exist today. However, nine of them are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site .\nFilled with luscious plants, vibrant flowers, elaborate rock formations and tranquil ponds, these gardens reflect microcosms of the natural world. Similar to a traditional Chinese landscape painting, they represent how the Chinese diligently and artfully blended nature into an urban environment.\nSo, why did these nine gardens receive UNESCO World Heritage protections?\nAccording to the organization's website, \"classical Suzhou gardens are intended to be a microcosm of the natural world, incorporating basic elements such as water, stones, plants, and various types of buildings of literary and poetic significance. These exquisite gardens are a testament to the superior craftsmanship of the garden masters of the time. These unique designs that have been inspired but are not limited by concepts of nature have had profound influence on the evolution of both Eastern and Western garden art. These garden ensembles of buildings, rock formations, calligraphy, furniture, and decorative artistic pieces serve as showcases of the paramount artistic achievements of the East Yangtze Delta region; they are in essence the embodiment of the connotations of traditional Chinese culture.\"\nThe Humble Administrator's Garden (pictured above) is the largest garden in the group. The garden was constructed in the 1500s and occupies 13 acres with pavilions and bridges on islands separated by ponds. It's divided into three sections — Eastern, Central and Western Gardens — and many scholars consider this garden to be a prime example of Chinese classical garden design.\nThe Lingering Garden is the second largest one and was first built in the 16th century by Xu Shitai, an imperial official. It was abandoned for a period of time until it was purchased in 1873, refurbished and expanded. Four sections are connected by a covered corridor where tourists can see calligraphy carved into the stone. The most striking element throughout the garden are intricately designed rock formations — some are more than 20 feet tall.\nThe garden also houses two UNESCO Intangible World Heritage Arts, Pingtan music (traditional story singing) and Guqin, which is a plucked seven-string musical instrument of the zither family.\nOriginally called Ten Thousand Volume Hall, the Master of the Nets Garden was built in 1140 by Shi Zhengzhi , a government official who was inspired by a fisherman's way of life filled with solitude and quiet reflection.\nAfter Zhengzhi's death, the garden fell into disrepair until the 18th century when Song Zongyuan, a retired government official, purchased the land. He renamed it Master of the Nets Garden and constructed additional buildings. The garden would have several private owners through the next couple centuries until it was donated to the government in 1958.\nSmaller buildings are built on top of rocks and piers while the larger buildings are covered by trees and plants to help them blend into the natural surroundings.\nDating back to the Jin Dynasty (265-420 B.C.), the land that now houses the Mountain Villa with Embracing Beauty garden was originally the site of a house that the education minister and his brother donated to become a Jingde temple. The land became a garden during the 16th century and was expanded two centuries later when the site was excavated. While digging nearly a meter deep into the ground, a spring emerged and was constructed into a pond called Flying Snow.\nDuring the 19th century, a man-made mountain and interconnected pavilions were added. The pavilions were designed in such a way that no matter where someone stands in the garden, they will see all the pavilions at different heights, giving the illusion that the quaint garden is much larger than it really is.\nThe Canglang Pavilion stands apart from the rest because the central focus isn't a lake or pond but instead a fake \"mountain.\" It was built during the 12th century by a Song Dynasty poet and is the oldest garden of the nine UNESCO gardens.\nBamboo, weeping willows and a variety of ancient trees can be found throughout the pavilion along with more than 100 \"windows\" that look out from the garden's interior.\nThe Lion Grove Garden is most famous for its grotto and got its name because the rock formations look like lions. The garden was built in the 14th century by a Zen Buddhist monk in honor of his teacher and was part of a monastery. The garden's name also refers to Lion Peak on Mount Tianmu where the monk's teacher, Abbot Zhongfeng, achieved nirvana.\nThe massive grotto contains a labyrinth of nine paths that cut through 21 mazes on three levels. Waterfalls and ponds are partially concealed by flowers that grow in the shallow waters like the lotus flowers pictured here.\nThe Garden of Cultivation was first built in 1541 and was later purchased in 1621 by Wen Zhenheng, grandson of Wen Zhengming who designed the Humble Administrator's Garden. While the garden may be one of the smallest in Suzhou, it houses the largest waterside pavilion.\nA lotus pond is the central focal point and is surrounded by pavilions and mountain scenery.\nIn 1874, a couple purchased a garden and renamed it Couple's Retreat Garden. A residential building sits in the middle of the garden and is surrounded by canals and artificial mountains — creating a romantic oasis.\nThe garden also contains several other buildings, a fruit orchard and a grotto.\nLocated in the waterside village of Tongli on the outskirts of Suzhou, the Retreat and Reflection Garden was designed in the late 19th century by Ren Lansheng, a dishonorably discharged imperial service official. Lansheng wanted a quiet place to meditate and reflect on his failings.\nA residence, tea hall and gardens winding through corridors make up the one-acre garden. The pavilions give the illusion that they are floating on water.\nAll of these gardens are open to the public."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b575da6c-7130-4c81-98b9-f72db68f54a0>","<urn:uuid:e0761e3c-6507-46eb-9b82-1bf0fbc51f09>"],"error":null}

These related conditions include active duodenal (upper intestinal) ulcers; active benign stomach ulcers; erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (backflow of acidic stomach contents); excess acid conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a form of peptic ulcer with too much acid); and prevention of upper abdominal bleeding in those who are critically ill.\nCimetidine is also used for maintenance therapy of duodenal ulcer after active ulcers are healed.\nThere is also an over-the-counter (OTC) version of the drug used to relieve heartburn, indigestion, and sour stomach.\nWhat is the most important information I should know about Cimetidine?Short-term treatment with cimetidine can result in complete healing of a duodenal ulcer. However, the ulcer can reappear after cimetidine has been stopped. The rate of ulcer recurrence may be slightly higher in people healed with cimetidine rather than other forms of therapy. However, cimetidine is usually prescribed for more severe cases.\nReversible states of confusion may occur, especially in severely ill patients. Patients >50 years old or with liver and kidney disease may be at greater risk. Discontinuation of cimetidine may be necessary.\nRare cases of irregular heart rhythm and low blood pressure have been reported after rapid administration of intravenous cimetidine.\nStop using OTC cimetidine if your heartburn continues or gets worse, stomach pain continues, or you need to take it for more than 14 days.\nWho should not take Cimetidine?Do not use cimetidine if you are allergic to the active ingredient, cimetidine, or any other ingredient in it.\nDo not use OTC cimetidine if you have trouble or pain swallowing food, vomiting with blood, or bloody or black stools.\nWhat should I tell my doctor before I take the first dose of Cimetidine?Tell your doctor about all prescription, OTC, and herbal medications you are taking before beginning treatment with cimetidine. Also, talk to your doctor about your complete medical history, especially if you have kidney or liver disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system. Ask your doctor before using OTC cimetidine if you have: frequent chest pain; frequent wheezing, particularly with heartburn; unexplained weight loss; nausea or vomiting; stomach pain; had heartburn >3 months; heartburn with lightheadedness, sweating, or dizziness; or chest pain or shoulder pain with shortness of breath, sweating, pain spreading to the arms, neck, or shoulders.\nWhat is the usual dosage?The information below is based on the dosage guidelines your doctor uses. Depending on your condition and medical history, your doctor may prescribe a different regimen. Do not change the dosage or stop taking your medication without your doctor's approval.\nActive Benign Gastric Ulcer\nAdults: The usual dose is 800 milligrams (mg) once a day at bedtime or 300 mg taken four times a day with meals and at bedtime.\nActive Duodenal Ulcer\nAdults: The usual dose is 800 mg once daily at bedtime. Other effective doses include 300 mg four times a day with meals and at bedtime or 400 mg twice a day, in the morning and at bedtime. Most people heal in 4 weeks. If you require maintenance therapy, the usual dose is 400 mg at bedtime.\nErosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\nAdults: The usual dosage is 1,600 mg daily divided into doses of 800 mg taken twice a day, or 400 mg taken four times a day, for 12 weeks.\nPathological Hypersecretory Condition (eg, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome)\nAdults: The usual dose is 300 mg taken four times a day with meals and at bedtime. Your doctor may adjust your dose based on your needs, but you should take no more than 2,400 mg per day.\nRelief or Prevention of Heartburn\nFor relief, take one tablet of OTC cimetidine with a glass of water. For prevention, take it 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything that may cause heartburn. Do not take more than two tablets in 24 hours.\nSafety and effectiveness have not been established in children <16 years of age.\nCimetidine Injection may be used in hospitalized patients. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose for you.\nHow should I take Cimetidine?You can take cimetidine with or between meals. Do not take antacids within 1-2 hours of taking a dose of cimetidine.\nIt may take several days for cimetidine to begin relieving stomach pain. Be sure to continue taking the drug exactly as prescribed even if it seems to have no effect.\nIf you need to take an antifungal drug such as ketoconazole, you should take it at least 2 hours before you take cimetidine.\nWhat should I avoid while taking Cimetidine?Antacids may be needed for pain relief; however, avoid taking antacids at the same time as oral cimetidine. Antacids can reduce the effect of cimetidine when taken at the same time.\nUlcers may be more difficult to heal if you smoke.\nAvoid excessive amounts of caffeine while taking cimetidine.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages while taking cimetidine. This drug increases the effects of alcohol.\nWhat are possible food and drug interactions associated with Cimetidine?If cimetidine is taken with certain other drugs, the effects of either could be increased, decreased, or altered. It is especially important to check with your doctor before combining cimetidine with the following: antidiabetes drugs, antifungal drugs, amoxicillin, antiarrhythmics, aspirin, benzodiazepine tranquilizers, blood pressure drugs, blood thinners (like warfarin), chlordiazepoxide, chlorpromazine, cisapride, cyclosporine, diazepam, digoxin, ketoconazole, lidocaine, metoclopramide, metronidazole, narcotic pain relievers, nicotine, nifedipine, paroxetine, phenytoin, propanolol, quinine, sucralfate, theophylline, or tricyclic antidepressants.\nWhat are the possible side effects of Cimetidine?Side effects cannot be anticipated. If any develop or change in intensity, tell your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking this drug.\nSide effects may include: headache, breast development in men\nCan I receive Cimetidine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?The effects of cimetidine during pregnancy have not been adequately studied. Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.\nWhat should I do if I miss a dose of Cimetidine?If you miss a dose of cimetidine, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take two doses at once. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\nHow should I store Cimetidine?Store at room temperature in a tightly closed container, away from light.\n- The Power of ProbioticsProbiotics and other supplements have been hyped as remedies for digestive problems.

{"question":"What are the privacy settings for CZ ID project uploads, and how does allele-specific filtering handle data privacy in multi-allelic sites?","answer":"For CZ ID project uploads, there are two privacy settings: Private projects keep samples private to you and collaborators until you choose to make them public, while Public projects are discoverable to all CZ ID users. Raw sample data remains available only to the original uploader regardless of privacy status. For allele-specific filtering, privacy is maintained while improving accuracy by treating each allele separately during annotation, recalibration and filtering phases. This is especially beneficial for multi-allelic sites, which occur more frequently in large cohorts (e.g., 3% in 42-sample sets vs 8% in 60,000-sample sets).","context":["Jump to Section:\nReady to upload metagenomic samples to CZ ID and explore results? Here we describe how to upload Illumina sequencing files and sample data (metadata) to your CZ ID account. Click here if you are working with Nanopore sequencing data.\nTo upload new samples to CZ ID, log in to the application using your email and password. Once logged in, you will see your name in the upper right-hand corner of the application. Next to your name, you will see a link to the Upload page.\nThe Upload page provides users different settings and options for uploading data. Note that the upload process is divided into three general steps, including Samples, Metadata, and Review upload pages. In the \"Samples\" step you will select a project, analysis type, and sample files to upload.\nSamples uploaded to CZ ID are organized into projects. You can upload samples to an existing project or create a new project. The project selection will affect the pipeline version used to run the samples (see Pipeline Version below). When creating a new project, provide a name for the project and select its privacy status. You also have the option to add a brief project description to document the background or context of your project. Select the analysis type after specifying the project where samples will be uploaded.\nBelow we describe privacy status for samples uploaded to private and public projects.\n- Private Projects - Samples uploaded to private projects will remain private to you and your collaborators until you decide to share it with other researchers by making it public on CZ ID. CZ ID will not automatically change your samples from private to public - the decision if and when to share samples is entirely yours.\n- Public Projects - Samples uploaded to public projects are discoverable to all CZ ID users. Note: raw sample data (i.e., genetic sequence files in FASTQ or FASTA format) that have been uploaded to CZ ID are only available to the original uploader, no matter if your sample is public, private, or shared via a project. Raw data is not shared with any other CZ ID user, nor is it ever accessed by anyone working on CZ ID unless specifically requested by a user, such as to debug an issue.\nNote that you can change the privacy status of your project from Private to Public at any time. However, you cannot do the opposite. If you or your collaborators make a project Public by mistake, please contact our team immediately by sending an email to email@example.com.\nSelecting Analysis Type\nFor analysis type, select Illumina under the Metagenomics dropdown options.\nThe pipeline version that will be used to run uploaded samples is specified within your choice of analysis type. Metagenomic samples uploaded to projects created after April 19, 2023 (mNGS pipeline v8.0 and up) will run on the latest pipeline available with updated QC and host filtering steps. Samples uploaded to projects created prior to this date will run on pipeline version 7. Learn more about QC and host filtering pipeline updates here.\nKeep track of the pipeline version when comparing samples. If you are planning to compare samples, you should run them using the same pipeline version.\nFile Requirements for mNGS Illumina Pipeline\n- Pipeline accepts FASTQ files (\".fastq\", \".fq\", \"fastq.gz\", \".fq.gz\"). Click here if you need to upload FASTA files.\n- CZ ID can process single- and paired-end read files.\n- Paired files must be labeled with \"_R1\" or \"_R2\" at the end of the basename. CZ ID will automatically detect paired reads based on the naming convention.\n- File names must be no longer than 120 characters and can only contain letters from the English alphabet (A-Z, upper and lower case), numbers (0-9), periods (.), hyphens (-) and underscores (_). Spaces are not allowed.\nUpload from Your Computer\nTo upload files directly from your computer you can select them through our file browser or drag and drop them directly in CZ ID.\nCZ ID will automatically name your samples based on your file name. Once you have selected and reviewed the files you want to process, click the Continue button at the bottom of the screen to continue to the next step (Add Metadata).\nIf you have sequencing files split over multiple lanes per sample, CZ ID will automatically detect this based on Illumina's naming convention and concatenate these files for you. For example, the NovaSeq system provides so much sequencing data that one sample may be split over 4 lanes. Such NovaSeq paired-end sample would produce 8 files. In the screenshot below you can see that CZ ID automatically detects that each file is part of the same sample.\nUpload from BaseSpace\nIf your files are hosted on the BaseSpace cloud, you can pull them directly into CZ ID. Select the Upload from BaseSpace tab on the upload page to access your files. Select Connect to BaseSpace to launch the BaseSpace login page. Use your credentials to log in to BaseSpace and select files for upload.\nOnce you have selected and reviewed the files you want to process, click the Continue button at the bottom of the screen to continue to the next step (Add Metadata).\nAfter uploading sequencing files, you have two options to upload sample metadata to CZ ID. You can add metadata to your samples by manually entering data through the interface or uploading a CSV file with metadata.\nThere are six required metadata fields. However, we encourage our users to upload as much metadata as possible. Metadata associated with public projects helps our users compare across samples and find meaningful patterns. You can edit sample metadata to add or update information at any time.\nYou can learn everything you need to know about the metadata fields by looking at the metadata dictionary. Below we describe required metadata fields.\n- Host Organism - Refers to the organism from which you collected your metagenomic sample. If the sample is a cultured isolate or does not contain any host reads, specify “ERCC only”. Note the following:\n- Your choice of host organism will determine which genome gets subtracted out during the host subtraction step in the pipeline. If your host organism maps to one of the available host genomes on CZ ID, reads aligning to that genome will be removed. The available host genomes are updated often and listed at the top of the Upload Metadata page. You will see \"Host will not be subtracted\" in the host organism dropdown menu if we do not have a genome for your chosen host organism.\n- Regardless of your choice of host, the pipeline will always remove ERCCs (synthetic RNA spike-ins) and reads aligning to the Human genome. If you are unsure which host to select or if your desired host is not in the available options, you can select “ERCC only” as the Host Organism, in which case no host subtraction will be performed.\n- Sample Type - Type of sample, tissue or site most accurately describes sample.\n- Water Control - Indicates whether or not the sample represents a negative water control\n- Nucleotide Type - DNA or RNA\n- Collection Date - Date sample was originally collected. For privacy reasons, only use month or year for human data.\n- Collection Location - Location sample was originally collected. For privacy reasons, only use country, state, or county/sub-division for human data. If you enter a more specific location (e.g. city-level), the platform will only save the location up to the county-level.\nManual Data Entry\nEnter the information in the provided metadata table. By default, only the required fields will be shown. However, you can add metadata fields by clicking the \"plus\" sign to the right of the table.\nHost Organism: Organism from which the sample was collected. If the sample is a cultured isolate or does not contain any host reads, select “ERCC only”.\nSample Type: Tissue or site that most accurately describes sample. \"Suggested\" list is based on Host Organism selection.\nWater Control: Whether or not the sample is a water control.\nNucleotide Type: RNA or DNA.\nCollection Date: The month and year the sample was originally collected.\nCollection Location: Location where the sample was originally collected. For privacy reasons, location data for human samples can only be collected on the state or county level.\nCSV Upload Instructions\nUse the \"CSV Upload\" tab to upload a comma-separated value (CSV) file with metadata.\nNote the following:\n- Review the fields in our metadata dictionary, where you will find definitions and format requirements.\n- Take special note of the required fields, which you must provide when uploading a new sample.\n- Make sure your column headers match the required naming convention.\n- Make sure your metadata values are in the correct format.\n- You can use your own CSV or copy your metadata into our CSV template.\n- If you entered a Host Organism that does not match a supported host genome, the pipeline will only subtract reads aligning to ERCCs and the Human genome. You can read more about how to request a new genome to be added to CZ ID here.\n- If there are errors, you will see an error message after uploading your CSV file. Please make the necessary changes in your CSV and re-upload the file.\nAfter adding your metadata, you will be directed to the Review page where you can view samples and metadata ready to be uploaded. If you see an issue, you can edit your projects and your samples before uploading (note \"Edit\" links by each review section).\nBelow the table listing samples to be uploaded, you will see \"Host Subtraction\" information. This information tells you how your selection of host organism will affect the pipeline, specifically the host subtraction step. If CZ ID has the genome of the host organism, the pipeline will subtract out reads aligning to that genome. Regardless of your choice of host, the pipeline will always remove ERCCs and reads aligning to the Human genome (hg38). If CZ ID does not have the genome that matches to your host organism, you can request it by following the instructions in our FAQs.\nDo not close the web page when your samples are uploading to our servers. The upload will be canceled and you will have to start your upload over. You will see an \"Uploads completed\" confirmation when your samples have been uploaded successfully.\nOnce you see the confirmation page you can close your window or return to your project page. The CZ ID pipeline can take 30 minutes or a couple of hours to complete. You can see the status of your run by returning to the project page.\nOnce completed, your samples will be flagged as \"Complete\" on your Project Page. You can now explore the Sample Report. If you encounter issues, please get in touch with our team by selecting \"Contact Us\" from the Username dropdown menu in the upper right hand corner of your screen.","The traditional VQSR recalibration paradigm evaluates each position, and passes or filters all alleles at that position, regardless of how many alternate alleles occur there. This has major disadvantages in cases where a real variant allele occurs at the same position as an error that has sufficient evidence to be called as a variant. The goal of the Allele-Specific filtering workflow is to treat each allele separately in the annotation, recalibration and filtering phases.\nMulti-allelic sites benefit the most from the Allele-Specific filtering workflow because each allele will be evaluated more accurately than if its data was lumped together with other alleles. Large callsets will benefit more than small callsets because multi-allelics will occur more frequently as the number of samples in a cohort increases. One callset with 42 samples that was used for development contains 3% multi-allelic sites, while the ExAC callset with approximately 60,000 samples contains nearly 8% multi-allelic sites. Recalibrating each allele separately will also greatly benefit rare disease studies, in which rare alleles may not be shared by other members of the callset, but could still occur at the same positions as common alleles or errors.\nNo additional resource files are necessary compared to the traditional VQSR workflow, but this must be run starting from the sample BAM files. The relevant annotations cannot be calculated from VCF or GVCF files alone.\nAfter running the Allele-Specific filtering workflow, several new annotations will be added to the INFO field for your variants (see below), and VQSR results will be based on those new annotations, though using SNP and INDEL tranche sensitivity cutoffs equivalent to the non-allele-specific best practices. If after analyzing your recalibrated data, you’re not convinced that this workflow is for you, you can still run the classic VQSR on your genotyped VCF because the standard annotations for VQSR are still included in the genotyped VCF.\nTo be clear, this workflow cannot be run without the GVCF mode. This is because the way we generate and combine the allele-specific data depends on having raw data for each sample in the GVCF.\nNote that this workflow is not yet officially part of the GATK Best Practices for germline variant discovery. Although we are happy with the performance of this workflow, our own production pipelines have not yet been updated to include this, so it should still be considered experimental. However, we do encourage you to try this out on your own data and let us know what you find, as this helps us refine the tools and catch bugs.\nSummary of workflow steps\nBegin with a BAM file that has been fully pre-processed according to our Best Practices recommendations for each sample. The read data in the BAM are necessary to generate the allele-specific annotations.\nStep 1: Generate a GVCF per sample with HaplotypeCaller\nUsing the locally-realigned reads, HaplotypeCaller will generate GVCFs with all of its usual standard annotations, plus raw data to calculate allele-specific versions of the standard annotations. That means each alternate allele in each VariantContext will get its own data used by downstream tools to generate allele-specific QualByDepth, RMSMappingQuality, FisherStrand and allele-specific versions of the other standard annotations. For example, this will help us sort out good alleles that only occur in a few samples and have a good balance of forward and reverse reads but occur at the same position as another allele that has bad strand bias because it’s probably a mapping error.\n-G StandardAnnotation -G AS_StandardAnnotation -G StandardHCAnnotation to request the appropriate annotations at this stage.\nStep 2: Consolidate GVCFs (using either CombineGVCFs or ImportGenomicsDB)\nHere the allele-specific data for each sample is combined per allele, but is not yet in its final annotation form. Use\n-G StandardAnnotation -G AS_StandardAnnotation to request the appropriate annotations at this stage.\nStep 3: Joint-call all samples with GenotypeGVCFs\nRaw allele-specific data for each sample is used to calculate the finalized annotation values. Use\n-G StandardAnnotation -G AS_StandardAnnotationto request the appropriate annotations at this stage.\nStep 4: Variant filtering with VQSR\nIn allele-specific mode (activated using\n-AS), the VariantRecalibrator builds the statistical model based on data for each allele, rather than each site. This has the added benefit of being able to recalibrate the SNPs in mixed sites according to the appropriate model, rather than lumping them in with INDELs as had been done previously. It will also provide better results by matching the exact allele in the training and truth data rather than just the position.\nWhen you run the second step of VQSR, ApplyRecalibration, allele-specific filters are calculated and stored in the AS_FilterStatus INFO annotation. A site-level filter is applied to each site based on the most lenient filter across all alleles. For example, if any allele passes, the entire site passes. If no alleles pass, then the filter will be applied corresponding to the allele with the lowest tranche (best VQSLOD).\nThe two ApplyRecalibration modes should be run in series, as in our usual Best Practices recommendations. If SNP and INDEL ApplyRecalibration modes are run in parallel and combined with CombineVariants (which would work for the standard VQSR arguments), in allele-specific mode any mixed sites will fail to be processed correctly.\nOutput of the workflow\nThis workflow adds new allele-specific info-level annotations to the VCFs and produces a final output with allele-specific filters based on the VQSR SNP and INDEL tranches.\nThe AS_Standard annotation set will produce allele-specific versions of our standard annotations. For AS_MQ, this means that the root-mean-squared mapping quality will be given for all of the reads that support each allele, respectively. For rank sum and strand bias tests, the annotation for each allele will compare that alternative allele’s values against the reference allele.\nRecalibration files from allele-specific VariantRecalibrator\nEach allele will be described in a separate line in the output recalibration (.recal) files. For the advanced analyst, this is a good way to check which allele has the worst data and is responsible for a NEGATIVE_TRAIN_SITE classification.\nAfter both ApplyRecalibration modes are run, the INFO field will contain an annotation called AS_FilterStatus, which will list the filter corresponding to each alternate allele. Allele-specific culprit and VQSLOD scores will also be added to the final VCF in the AS_culprit and AS_VQSLOD annotations, respectively.\n3 195507036 .

{"question":"As someone who wants to build better online courses, I'd like to understand - how do breakout rooms for peer feedback compare to using rubric-based peer assessments?","answer":"While breakout rooms are excellent for encouraging student-to-student conversations and building community through short 5-minute sections, rubric-based peer assessments provide more structured and consistent feedback. Breakout rooms support social interaction and immediate discussion, but rubrics offer specific advantages for peer assessment: they help students understand clear evaluation criteria, promote awareness about assessment standards, allow for more objective and consistent feedback between peers, and provide specific performance characteristics arranged in levels. The rubric approach also helps students analyze their own work and others' work against the same standardized criteria, making the peer feedback process more focused and meaningful.","context":["Solve Common Online Teaching Problems\nHere we offer recommendations and resources to help address common online teaching issues that instructors typically encounter when teaching fully online courses.\n- \"Too much Zoom!\"\n- \"Students don't know each other.\"\n- \"I'm not connecting with my students the way I usually do.\"\n- \"Bad internet, disparate time zones.\"\n- \"Students need extra help.\"\nNeed something else? Schedule a consultation with the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL).\nIf you’re feeling burned out on Zoom, you’re not alone.\nLuckily, you can run a very successful class by cutting down on in-person Zoom time and shifting some of the class time to asynchronous activities. This can help both you and your students overcome Zoom fatigue. Learn more about using a mix of asynchronous and synchronous teaching.\nAnother tip is to build more engaging activities throughout a Zoom session. If you've been talking for fifteen minutes or more, it might be time to shift to something interactive, whether that's starting up a discussion or activity or even just asking an open-ended question and getting students to type a quick answer into the class chat. See some ideas from Stanford instructors on how to alleviate Zoom fatigue.\nIt takes some intentional effort to build a community online, and peer-to-peer community can be among the hardest to support.\nBreakout rooms are an excellent tool to encourage student-to-student conversations. Sometimes very short (~5 minute) sections work better than longer ones, depending on the task. You can do a range of small-group activities in Zoom that will help students connect with each other.\nYou can also reinforce student-to-student community by rethinking some assignments--consider awarding points for low-stakes social interactions (i.e., writing an introduction on the class discussion board), or assigning group projects to encourage students to get to know each other. See more ideas on supporting student interaction from Stanford instructors.\nYou'll want to think about intentional ways to build classroom community, such as sharing some information about yourself and encouraging students to come to office hours. Some of the tips in adding warmth to live video calls might also be helpful. Try building time into the class structure specifically around community-building. See more ideas about creating opportunities for connection and presence from Stanford instructors.\nYou might also want to consider ways you can seek student feedback; it can be more challenging to know how students are actually feeling in an online class, so build in low-stakes minute-papers or mid-term evals. See more about how Stanford instructors are eliciting student input.\nWhile you can check out tips to mitigate internet connection issues, realistically internet and time zones will at least occasionally be a problem.\nThe best way to handle this is through course structure. Talk to your students early, and think about providing a mix of asynchronous and synchronous activities–not relying wholly on Zoom for every class period will make it easier for students who have difficulties completing some or part of the lesson. Try to be flexible where you can in offering alternatives for students who face issues, and set equitable classroom policies. This will also make the course more accessible.\nWhether it's help connecting with digital library resources or addressing urgent psychological or financial needs, you may find student struggles are making it harder for them to succeed in your classroom. The good news is that there are ample campus resources; sometimes a simple email connecting students to the right program can have a huge impact. See Support Resources for Students for a comprehensive list.","What is feedback?\nFeedback is information provided by an agent (e.g. teacher, peer, experience) regarding one’s performance or understanding of a task. An instructor or peer may provide corrective information, alternative strategies, or encouragement. Instruction and feedback run on a continuum -- both are needed to keep moving forward on course content. Providing correctional feedback is a form of instruction, making the two an intertwined process that takes on the form of new instruction, rather than only informing the student about correctness.\nFeedback needs to provide information relating to a specific task or process of learning to take on an instructional purpose (Sadler, 1989). Instructional feedback can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as motivating or engaging students, confirming to students when they are correct or incorrect, reiterating directions, or indicating an alternative approach or line of thinking.\nClearly, feedback can be a powerful tool. Students who receive informative feedback about a task and how to do it more effectively achieve higher learning outcomes than those students who receive praise, rewards, or punishment. Providing cues or reinforcement to learners in the form of audio, video, or computer-assisted instructional feedback is the most effective measure.\nThere are several ways to provide feedback to learners. Instructional designer and co-founder of E-learner Engaged, Anna Sabramowicz, describes some methods for providing learners with positive and effective feedback in the video below.\nThree Feedback Questions\nTeaching information to students involves providing constructive tasks and dialog and assessing and evaluating students’ understanding of this information in order to reach the next stage of teaching, which is done through feedback. Approaching feedback through three main questions can help provide the best feedback to the learner.\n- Where am I going? (Feed up)\n- How am I doing? (Feed-back)\n- Where to go next? (Feed forward)\nWhen both teachers and students seek answers to each of these questions learning goals can be achieved.\nWhere am I going? -- Feed Up: Clarify the Goal\nCritical to feedback is laying the foundation of instruction with learning goals. These provide the learners with a clear purpose or roadmap to attain information related to the task or performance, referred to as “success criteria.” When students understand the learning goal, they are more likely to focus on the task at hand. Outlining the learning goals and activities of how they will reach those goals provides students with the understanding of what the instructor’s expectations are so that students can focus on achieving the goals.\nWith assignments, providing clear expectations and instructions to the students will help them meet the requirements and allows the instructor to align the various assessments. For example, when it's clear that the purpose of a unit is to compare and contrast the branches of government, students know what to expect and the teacher can plan readings, collaborative projects, investigations, and assessments to ensure that students focus on content related to this goal.\nGoals inform individuals of the level of performance that is to be attained so that they can direct and evaluate their actions and efforts accordingly; therefore, feedback allows students to track their performance in relation to their goals and redirect their progress as needed. Feedback for goal-driven activities needs to be direct and students need to share a commitment to attaining them as they will be more likely to seek and receive feedback.\nHow am I doing? -- Feed Back: Respond to Student Work\nThe feed-“back” dimension covers the individual responses given to students about their work. Instructors provide information directly related to the performance task. Feedback is effective when it consists of information about progress and how to proceed next. Students often seek information about how they are doing and crave feedback as a self-regulatory tool to move forward successfully. Feedback can occur in an email, on a discussion post, or after formal testing. An instructor may find that emailing students progress reports can be the olive branch the students needed to ask specific questions on their success or failures of the instructional content.\nFor example, in a unit on writing high-quality introductions, a teacher gives students multiple opportunities to introduce topics using such techniques as beginning with a question or startling statistic, leading off with an anecdote, and so on. The teacher provides students feedback on each introduction they have written so the students revise that introduction and use the suggestions to improve their next attempt. Rather than simply noting mechanical errors, the teacher acknowledged areas of success and highlighted things students might focus on sharpening.\nWhere to go next?\nFeed-Forward: Modify Instruction\nInstruction is often sequential -- meaning instructors provide learning content and activities, students attempt these tasks, and these are then followed by more instruction and tasks. However, the consequence of this sequence is that giving constructive and effective feedback takes too long. Students are moving on to the next learning task before they receive feedback on the previous activity. Feed-“forward” can have some of the most powerful impacts on learning as it tries to enhance challenges, provide more self-regulation of the learning process, and a deeper understanding of what is or is not understood about the information.\nThe feed forward aspect of the formative feedback system is often left out. In an effective feedback system, teachers use assessment data to plan future instruction based on student performance. As the instructor analyzes student work, whether checking for understanding or using formative assessment, they use what they learn to modify their instruction. This demands greater flexibility in lesson planning because it means that teachers can't simply implement a set series of lessons.\nEven adult learners can struggle with content, which can become apparent during an activity, assessment, or discussion board. If there is an issue from multiple learners, it is time to re-evaluate the instructional materials and remediate where necessary. Remediation can occur through several avenues:\n- Redirection in a current discussion board\n- Creation of a new, clearer discussion topic to discuss the misinterpretation of a previous discussion\n- Feedback directly to the students who need it\nSometimes the content is predetermined for the instructor, which can provide students with a consistent experience. Courses are revised based on student and instructor feedback, which can lead to the reorganization of content to clarify any roadblocks along the way. In self-paced courses, feed-forward can be seen through adding clarification in a discussion post, following up directly with a student about the content, or providing personal examples to clarify confusion. It is important to focus on feed-forward as a teaching and learning opportunity for both the instructor and learners.\nIntegrating the Three Questions\nFeed-up, feed-back, and feed-forward work together across for levels of feedback which closes the gap between where students are and where they are aiming to be. The focus of feedback is critical and the level at which feedback is directed influences its effectiveness. The task, the process, self-regulation, and the “self” are the levels feedback can be directed.\nThe Focus of Feedback: The Four Levels\nThe focus of feedback is critical and the level at which feedback is directed influences its effectiveness. The task, the process, self-regulation, and the \"self\" are the levels feedback can be directed.\nAbout the task\nFeedback can be directed towards the correctness or incorrectness of the task or assignment. On this level, feedback may include directions to acquire more, different, or correct information, such as \"You need to include more information about the Gettysburg Address.\"\nFeedback can focus on the process used to create the assignment, which aims more at the processing of information or learning process required to understand or complete the assignment. For example, the instructor may suggest that the learner needs to revisit strategies covered in the materials.\nAiming feedback at the self-regulation level can boost confidence and self-evaluation skills. This feedback can influence self-efficacy and self-regulation, such that the students understand how to more effectively continue with the task. For example, the instructor can remind the student what they already know and direct them to check if they have included it, such as \"You already know the components of a hypothesis, check to see if your introduction paragraph has one.\"\nFeedback can be personal in the sense that it is directed to the \"self,\" which are often unrelated to task performance. This feedback includes \"you're a great student\" and \"that's a great response, well done.\"\nStructuring feedback appropriately is part of what makes it effective. It should reference the goal or objective that needs to be accomplished by the learner with tangible and actionable items that help obtain the ultimate goal. Only telling learners \"good job\" or \"you did that wrong\" does not benefit or help the learner obtain the module objective and move onto the next course goal. While specific and accurate feedback is important, it is not useful to the learner if it overwhelms them or is not understandable. Too much feedback can be counterproductive, whereas focusing on one or two key elements of performance can get the learner to focus.\nProviding students with feedback is only useful to learning when it is timely -- not immediate or delayed. Communicate to students when they can expect feedback on activities and assessments. If feedback is delayed for any reason, it is necessary to communicate this delay with students quickly.\nAs an instructor, it is important to evaluate learner performance as a reflection of teaching. Are there areas where multiple learners are struggling on the same concept? Were the instructions of the task communicated clearly? Could a concept been explained more clearly? Consistent, accurate, and trustworthy feedback helps learners adjust their performance.\nAs stated before, it is important for the instructor to allot enough time to grade items and provide vital feedback to learners. If the instructor falls behind with providing individual feedback to learners, communicate the delay with the learners while reiterating the activity or lesson objective and encourage the learners to keep moving forward with the course content.\nIn short, begin with a description about task performance, follow with guidelines for what to keep doing or change (not just the \"what\" but the \"how), and end with encouragement to persist.\nRubrics as Feedback\nAs mentioned, the importance of the feed-\"up\" step to feedback highlights expectations to learners. Providing learners with a rubric is part of the feed-\"up\" step and is an effective scoring tool that lists criteria and articulates the degree of quality for each criterion. Rubrics can improve learner performance by clarifying expectations and showing learners how to meet these expectations, because the rubric defines the level of quality expected out of them. In turn, this helps learners analyze their own work to self-assess areas of improvement.\nFor the instructor, rubrics save valuable time when evaluating a learner's work. Once items have been self- or peer-assessed, instructors find that the gaps have already been filled in and they can focus on providing more focused and itemized feedback. Also, rubrics provide the instructor with a way to justify grading based on the expectations and criteria outlined within the rubric, which eliminates instructor bias.\nGrading student assignments can be a daunting task, especially if the assessment criteria provided was vague and subjective. Providing students with rubrics, an authentic assessment tool, justifies and defends the grades assigned to a given activity. Authentic assessment focuses on complex and subjective assessments that correlate to real-world experiences, during which, the instructor observes students in process, provides feedback, monitors student use of the feedback, and adjusts instruction and evaluation accordingly.\nRubrics provide a formative type of assessment because it is an ongoing part of the whole teaching and learning process. With rubrics as an instructional tool, students become more focused and self-directed as expectations are laid out as a pathway to success.\nThe advantages of using rubrics in assessment are that they:\n- allow assessment to be more objective and consistent\n- focus the teacher to clarify his/her criteria in specific terms\n- clearly show the student how their work will be evaluated and what is expected\n- promote student awareness of about the criteria to use in assessing peer performance\n- provide useful feedback regarding the effectiveness of the instruction\n- provide benchmarks against which to measure and document progress\nRubrics can be created in a variety of forms and levels of complexity, however, they all contain common features which:\n- objective (performance, behavior, or quality)\n- range to rate performance\n- contain specific performance characteristics arranged in levels indicating the degree to which a standard has been met\nCreate a Rubric\nRubrics help instructors evaluate authentic, performance-based assessments that is tailored to an instructor's own curriculum and teaching style. In order to develop an effective rubric using the following:\nSteps in Rubric Development\n- Determine learning outcomes\n- Keep it short and simple (Include 4 - 15 items; use brief statements or phrases)\n- Each rubric item should focus on a different skill\n- Focus on how students develop and express their learning\n- Evaluate only measureable criteria\n- Ideally, the entire rubric should fit on one sheet of paper\n- Reevaluate the rubric (Did it work? Was it sufficiently detailed?)\nTerms to use in measuring range/scoring levels\nNumeric scale ranging from 1 to 5, for example\nAfter you write your first paragraph of the highest level, circle the words in that paragraph that can vary. These words will be the ones that you will change as you write the less than top level performances.\nPresence to absence\nComplete to incomplete\nMany to some to none\nMajor to minor\nConsistent to inconsistent\nFrequency: always to generally to sometimes to rarely\nBelow are links to rubric examples that can be customized to fit your assignment requirements.

{"question":"I have type 1 diabetes - what's the only treatment that actually works?","answer":"The only remedy that works effectively for type 1 diabetes is regular injection of insulin.","context":["Understanding Type 1 Diabetes Risk for Hormonal Disorders\nDiabetes type 1 and type 2 are both incurable and the only remedy for type 1 diabetes is insulin. The endocrine system of the body comprises of glands that produce hormones. These hormones act as chemical messengers and control several important functions of the body. Somatotropin stimulates growth and cell reproduction. In females, prolactin triggers milk synthesis and release. Calcitonin is another hormone that spurs bone construction. Apart from the importance in maintaining blood glucose levels, insulin plays a major role in bone formation and health. A proper balance in the production and use of these hormones is required for the smooth functioning and overall health of the body. When an imbalance occurs in the production or use of any of these hormones, it may result in serious disorders that require medical attention. These complications can prove dangerous if they are not treated at the right time.\nDiabetes mellitus is caused by the failure of the pancreas to produce sufficient insulin for the needs of the body (in type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients) or the failure of the body to use the hormone in the proper manner (in type 2 diabetics). With type 1 diabetes the risk of hormonal disorders builds up over a period of time.\nType 1 Diabetes\nOne of the primary functions of the hormone insulin is to regulate glucose levels in the blood. Insulin also regulates the conversion of excess sugar into fat and the storage of new fat in the adipose tissue. When the body is deprived of food and nutrition for an extended period of time (whatever the reason), insulin triggers use of the fat stored in the adipose tissues for meeting the body’s energy requirements. When the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin the result is diabetes. If the form of diabetes is type 1, the only remedy that works effectively is regular injection of insulin.\nComplications Caused by Type 1 Diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is referred to as an autoimmune disease because the core cause is the destruction of the insulin production areas of the pancreas, by the body’s immune system. This condition is seen more often in children and young adults. Unless the condition is kept under very strict control, the blood glucose level excesses that type 1 diabetes causes lead to other complications that can be classified under hormonal disorders. These complications include neuropathy, retinopathy and the increased risk of osteoporosis, as lack of sufficient insulin may result in low bone mass. The potential for bone fractures increase, and when a fracture does occur, it takes a very long time to heal.\nDue to these reasons, when a person is suffering from type 1 diabetes the risk for hormonal disorders is exceedingly high, and correct treatment of the condition becomes imperative.\nCorrect treatment includes regular administration of prescribed medication like insulin, regular eating habits, the consumption of healthy foods, regular exercise and avoidance of stress. Blood and urine glucose levels should be constantly monitored. These steps when practiced well can help to reduce the risk of hormonal disorders in diabetics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ed1b0aa1-9c7c-4641-a1b7-3b5223ee6d82>"],"error":null}

The organization also reports that at least five active duty military members attempt suicide every day.\nKevin Kip, Ph.D., F.A.H.A., professor and executive director at the University of South Florida College of Nursing, led the team of scientists and clinicians who conducted the first randomized controlled trial of ART in a military population.\nThe trial enrolled 57 service members and veterans, primarily from the Tampa Bay area.\n“Based on this trial and an earlier study completed at the USF College of Nursing, we believe that accelerated resolution therapy may provide the quickest way to effectively and safely treat post-traumatic stress disorder,” Kip said.\n“Our goal is to obtain enough evidence and interest to warrant classifying ART as a potential first-line treatment for PTSD among both civilian and military personnel.”\nThe patient first visualizes in his or her mind a prior traumatic experience which typically elicits uncomfortable physiological sensations like tightness of the chest, increased heart rate and sweating.\nThen, through talk therapy and a series of rapid left-to-right eye movements in which the patient follows the clinician’s hand back and forth, the sensations are minimized.\nIn the second phase, and with similar clinician input, the patient “replaces” the distressing images they have seen with positive ones in a way that the original distressing images can no longer be accessed.\nART is delivered in two to five one-hour sessions, requires no homework, and no written or verbal recall of the traumatic experience.\n“Through this therapy, we’re able to quiet down and separate physiological symptoms that come with re-envisioning a traumatic experience,” Kip said.\n“We can also alter or replace the traumatic images and add positive material to them. We are changing how images are remembered in the brain.”\nIt worked well for Brian Anderson, a former Green Beret, 10-year Army veteran and director of the Pasco County Veteran Services and Stand Down program.\nHe had tried an endorsed first-line PTSD treatment known as prolonged exposure therapy, which was very lengthy and worked for a while, but then symptoms like hypervigilance returned.\n“ART changed my life,” Anderson said.\n“This brief therapy took the bad memories that constantly resurfaced and put them in the proper order or long-term storage; it was almost like I was thinking about a time in history.\n“As a veteran, I would much rather go through a therapy that works, in only a few sessions, than sit through intensive and grueling sessions that last as long as 16 weeks.”\nIn the new study, researchers compared ART to a non-therapeutic PTSD treatment called attention control (AC) regimen.\nClinicians treated half of the 57 study participants (29) with ART, and the other half (28) received AC, which consisted of either physical fitness assessment and planning or career assessment and planning.\nAfter initial treatment, both groups received a three-month follow-up assessment.\n“Before and after these interventions, we compared the response, analyzing reductions in PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety, and the results were very impressive,” Kip said.\n“In an average of less than four ART sessions, participants had very substantially reduced symptoms of PTSD, while those who received AC did not.”\nAfter the AC regimen, all veterans had the opportunity to receive ART, and in the full study, 94 percent completed treatment. Favorable results persisted at three months.\n“Accelerated resolution therapy is giving hope to many veterans who felt like they had no hope,” said Lt. Col. (Ret.) Lawrence A. Braue, Ed.D., director of the USF Office of Veterans Services.\n“I look forward to the day when this treatment is widely available across the country.”\nSource: University of South Florida","Transitioning from the military to college life is something that may come as a culture shock to many veterans across the country. Whether it be the newfound sense of freedom to set an individualized pace and schedule, navigating the nuances of G.I. Bill funding, or simply deciding on a career outside of military commitments, there are several interlocking aspects of making the adjustment from military to civilian life. In addition to these challenges, many veterans are left asking about the social aspects of transitioning from military life to campus life.\nVeterans as Students\nThe American Council on Education (ACE) reports that veteran students differ from civilian students in a number of impactful ways. According to a study conducted by ACE, student veterans and service members are 70 percent more likely than civilian students to spend a significant amount of time, 10 hours or more per week, preparing for classes. Veteran students are 60 percent more likely than civilians to approach their professors to discuss their performance in classes, while 61 percent of veteran students reported having positive relationships with their faculty members as opposed to only 54 percent of the civilian population reporting the same.\nRanking: 30 Best Military-Friendly Colleges\nSocial Challenges Faced by Veterans\nWhile ACE has identified several positive traits of veteran students, the fact remains that veterans face a number of social challenges that may separate them from their civilian peers. Of the social constraints and differences identified by ACE, the average age of veteran versus civilian students may be one of the most significant contributing factors to social challenges faced by veterans. The average age of veteran students identified by this study was 33, whereas the average age of civilian college students was 22. Even without taking the unique experiential differences between these two groups into account, veteran students may feel an overwhelming sense of culture shock as they integrate with peers over a decade younger than themselves. To put that into perspective, it is very likely that the average veteran student may have experienced the dawn of smartphones, while the average civilian student has not known an adult life without one.\nACE also identified that only 49 percent of veteran students surveyed indicated that they collaborated with peers outside of class as opposed to 57 percent of the civilian student body. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veteran students may feel an intimate connection to military culture and may struggle with the lack of this culture upon return to civilian life. The concepts of responding to orders and respecting rank may be starkly different from the more-liberal and free-thinking climate observed by many universities. The VA also identifies that veteran students may be impacted by physical and mental illnesses and disabilities ranging from musculoskeletal problems, hearing problems, or less-visible impairments including depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nIn addition to resources provided to you by the VA, many college campuses have professional support staff available to assist with transitioning from the military to college life, including counselors, advisors, and VA professionals. Seeking out student organizations and support groups comprised of other veterans may also assist veteran students in making the transition from military to college life.\nTransitioning from military life to civilian life comes with its own unique set of obstacles, but many universities are equipped to assist veteran students with this transition. Recognizing the social differences between veteran and civilian students, and knowing where to seek out help are just two ways that veterans can make a successful transition.\nGet prepared for your next steps\nUse articles and resources to uncover answers to common questions, get guidance on your goals, and learn about applying to schools.\nA Career Guide to Getting a Job With a Master’s in Psychology\nIf you’re pursuing a master’s degree in psychology, you may have been asked the following question: “What can you do with a master’s in psychology?” It may even be a...\n8 Career Paths for a Master’s in Counseling Graduate\nAre you interested in helping others resolve their issues and hurdles through talk therapy?

{"question":"stem cells inner ear vs retina safety risks compare","answer":"The stem cell treatments for inner ear and retina have different safety considerations. For inner ear treatment, the main risk is that the process of converting stem cells using the NEUROG1 gene could trigger uncontrolled cell division leading to cancer, though this might be managed through chromatin regulation. For retinal stem cell treatment, while specific risks aren't detailed, it's noted as being particularly challenging because transplanting nerve cells into the retina is more difficult than transplanting surface cells like in corneal repair. Both treatments are still in development and require further research to fully understand and address safety concerns.","context":["Using stem cells is one of the most promising technologies, say scientists, as they are capable of turning into any part of a human body. Hearing loss is also a condition which, according to recent researches, can be reversed with the help of stem cells. Yet such an approach, despite offering hope to those who believe in the method, can also be very dangerous. Investigators from Rutgers University explain what benefits and perils may await those who will inject stem cells into their inner ear in an attempt to restore hearing.\nImage Credit: Gary Bendig / Unsplash.com\nWhat does Inner Ear Do, and How Is Hearing Lost?\nThe human inner ear has a bony spiraled structure that looks like a shell of a snail. This “shell” is a home for about 15,000 cells that are called “hair cells” – these are used to receive the sound signals coming from the outside world, process them, translate into the language of neurons, and then send this code to the brain. That is how our body can hear sounds. Yet these hair cells are prone to damage: there are a lot of risk factors and damage sources that affect our hearing, including excessive noise (remember loud music in headphones and noisy concerts?), drugs of certain kinds (including antibiotics), chronic infections, and wearing off in the course of cell using.\nWhen there cells get damaged, a person’s ability to hear gets worse. Degeneration of auditory neurons is a process which is, in most cases, rather slow, but the lost neurons are not regenerated, so the hair cell pool is constantly being depleted. In America, about fifteen percent of the population are affected by hearing loss – many of these people do not even realize their hearing ability is hindered until they get tested.\nResearchers from Harvard (HSCI, to be exact) reported earlier this year that hearing loss can be treated by means of injecting a special molecule cocktail which is capable of generating normal hair cells. That study was supposed to offer a solution which would help develop a new kind of hearing loss treatment and become a platform for further studies, because the approach can be applicable to a variety of tissues and cells, not just hair cells. The very principle of using molecules to stimulate the transformation processes of stem cells can definitely drive advanced technologies, but, as a research team from Rutgers University has found, it can be a double-edged sword.\nWhy Stimulating Stem Cells Is Both Promising and Dangerous?\nIn a new study, researchers made an attempt to reverse deafness by turning inner ear stem cells into special cells designed to ensure hearing, auditory neurons. To make the cells transform, they overexpressed a gene found in stem cells that promotes their turning into neurons; it is called NEUROG1. The attempt was a success, as new auditory neurons appeared in the Petri dish, but this technology, say the researchers, can be very dangerous: the process of conversion can trigger another process which will make cells divide uncontrollably, thus promoting cancer development. Yet the investigators have already made a suggestion as to how this issue can be handled: the way NEUROG1 functions is regulated (at least to some extent) by chromatin, and making changes in chromatin can help reduce the level of cell proliferation, which means the chance of unnecessary division will be lower.\nThere is still a lot of work to do, but if the study results prove to work in further trials and studies, it can help develop an approach to treat those whose hearing ability was lost.\nRemember that you can help your hair cells right now – avoid too loud music and don’t neglect infections!","Clinician scientist, Professor James Bainbridge was recognised for his contribution to gene therapy research through this year’s António Champalimaud Vision Award. The €1m prize (£902,000) was distributed to three teams that conducted research leading to the development of a genetic treatment for Leber Congenital Amaurosis. OT spoke with Professor Bainbridge about the award and the future direction of his research.\nCan you tell me about the research the António Champalimaud Vision Award recognised?\nThe research recognises the development of gene therapy for blinding eye disease. This is a relatively new technique that has been developed over the last few decades. It involves an intervention designed to target gene defects. Many people have poor sight because they lack one of the many critical genes that are required for our vision to work properly. One way to improve their sight is to provide the eyes with the genes that they are lacking.\nOur treatment focused on a severe retinal disease that affects children and adults called Leber Congenital Amaurosis. For this particular condition, there are two central benefits. One is to improve night vision and the second is to protect the daylight vision in the long-term. We are currently working to optimise the treatment by testing a new version of the therapy with the aim of finding out whether it can protect sight for longer.\nIt is hugely rewarding to see that this new technology can improve people’s sight. At the moment, it is directed towards people with relatively rare forms of inherited eye disease, but it is hoped that the same technique or a similar technique may be effective for people with other forms of genetic eye disease.\nWhat is the expected timeframe for translating this research into a treatment that will benefit a large number of patients?\nWe can be confident that gene therapy will be valuable for people with rare forms of genetic eye disease. The hope is that the technology could also be used for commoner forms of eye disease, including conditions like macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease. I think it is important to stress that we are looking at a long timeframe. Its application so far is directed toward people with specific forms of rare genetic disease, but proof-of-principle in that context suggests that a similar kind of technology could be of value for other forms of eye disease. It may take many years before one can expect this to be available as a treatment for common conditions.\nCan you tell me about your work to develop a treatment using stem cells?\nWe are interested in the possibility of reconstructing or repairing the retina using the transplantation of cells from a variety of sources. Stem cells are one very exciting source of cells for retinal repair. For some time we have been working to transplant photoreceptor cells into the retina in the laboratory. We are very excited by the results in terms of improvement in function. We are now working towards translating these findings in the laboratory into something that could be useful to people with blinding eye disease. Specifically, those people with relatively advanced degeneration because in that situation there are too few cells surviving to target with gene therapy.\nThere are many challenges. It is going to take a number of years before we can expect to see significant benefits for people with eye disease. In fact, stem cells are already used for certain applications in the eye – for corneal repair, in particular. To use stem cells to repair the retina is more challenging. It is harder to transplant nerve cells than it is to transplant surface cells.\nWhat are the key messages you would like optometrists to understand about your stem cell research?\nIt is important for optometrists to be aware that the field of regenerative medicine is progressing towards a point where we hope in the future that stem cells will be able to provide benefit for people with conditions that are currently considered untreatable – like macular degeneration, for example. At the moment, these treatments are not fully developed and are not available, but there is hope that they will become available in the future.\nWhat are the advantages of working as both an ophthalmologist and a researcher?\nAs a surgeon, it is very rewarding to be able to make a difference to individuals with sight impairment. Working in science, it is exciting to have an opportunity to contribute to the development of new treatments that could offer benefits to a large number of people."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cde4d053-bb17-4763-973c-59d724b6acd4>","<urn:uuid:39d6ac70-22ae-40b8-8754-4f15b1f4f0fb>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do maintenance requirements compare between straw bale gardening and urban container gardening in terms of watering needs?","answer":"Both gardening methods require careful attention to watering, but with different demands. Straw bale gardens tend to stay dry and require quite a bit of water, making a soaker hose system necessary to avoid constant manual watering. Additionally, they need weekly liquid fertilizer application since nutrients get washed out with frequent watering. Urban container gardens also need more frequent watering than traditional soil gardens, requiring daily watering in hot months and watering every five days in winter. For container gardens, it's important to water with small amounts frequently to avoid waterlogging and ensure good drainage.","context":["Gardening can be challenging if you are a beginner and unsure of where to start. Gardening can be more difficult for older gardeners and people with disability as well because tasks like digging the soil and weeding are hard to do.\nFortunately, there is a newer method of gardening which takes much of the work right out of it. It is a great method for beginners, those who are physically challenged, or those who are elderly and loves to garden but finds it difficult to do these days.\nIt’s also great for people in the northern hemisphere who want to extend the growing season.\nWhat’s this amazing method? It’s gardening in straw bales—or straw bale gardening.\nWhat is Straw Bale Gardening?\nStraw bale gardening is a modern method of cultivation where you compost straw bales and plant vegetables within them. It requires less maintenance than most other gardening varieties and is an excellent way for everyone to be able to enjoy gardening regardless of their situation.\nHow to Garden Using Straw Bales\n1. Collect Your Bales\nTo begin, you need straw bales. Consider how many bales you’ll need for the size garden you want to grow.\nFor a smaller garden, consider starting with a dozen bales. If you want to grow a more extensive garden, once you know this method works for you, consider expanding to around 30-40 bales.\nIt’s easiest to find straw with a lesser price tag in the fall. You could buy it and be prepared to plant the following spring.\nKeep in mind, you can shop local for your bales, buy from big box stores, or if you grow straw or hay each year, you may be able to set a few aside and use them for a modern method of gardening.\n2. Setup Your Future Garden\nWhen you have your straw bales, consider where you are going to plant your garden. You’ll want a location where you can get six to eight hours of sunlight, if possible.\nAlso, be sure to cover the ground where your straw bale garden will be with cardboard, newspaper, or landscaping fabric, to deter weeds from growing up through the bales of straw.\nWhen your groundwork is done, set the bales up. You should arrange them in rows with the cut side facing up. Be sure the twine is across the side of the bales and not running through the planting area.\nThe twine will help hold the bales together when the composting process begins to happen.\n3. Get the Bales Ready to Compost\nThe composting process is what makes this growth process work exceptionally well. It will take ten days for the bales to be ready to begin composting.\nOn days one through six you’ll put three cups of nitrogen fertilizer on the bales every other day. On the days you aren’t dumping nitrogen on the bales, water the bales thoroughly.\nOn days seven through nine add 1.5 cups of nitrogen fertilizer to the bales and water each day too.\nOn day ten, add three cups of bone meal and 1.5 cups of wood ash to the bales. This will cover the necessary potassium and phosphorous needs.\nAlthough this might sound like a ton of nitrogen, it’s what encourages composting to happen and accelerates the process as well.\n4. Get Ready for Optimum Grow Space\nWhen you grow your straw bale garden, it’s a good idea to put posts at the end of each row of bales. You can run twine horizontally from one post to the other to form a lattice. This will optimize your growing space.\nAlong with this idea, you also have a makeshift greenhouse in effect as well. When you plant your seedlings, you can run a piece of plastic over the top of the posts and seedlings. You’ll need to tuck the plastic under the pieces of twine holding the bales together.\nIt will protect your crops if a cold snap occurs after planting.\nThis type of gardening allows you to plant vegetables on top and flowers on the lower parts of the bale as well. It’s important to maximize and utilize the growing space the bales provide.\n5. Plant Your Garden\nAfter your bales have been set-up and have started the composting process, you’ll be ready to plant. You should wait two weeks after the composting process to began to plant.\nYou’ll know the bales are finished composting by sticking your finger into the middle of the bale. If the bale is scorching hot, you’ll know you need to wait a few days and test the bales again.\nHowever, if the bales are only warm on the inside, you’ll know they’re ready to be planted in. If you’re planting seedlings, dig a hole big enough for the seedling in the bale. Place the seedling in the bale and put potting mix around it to close the gap.\nIf you are planting seedlings in the bales, you’ll need to cover the bales with two inches of seed starting mix. Sprinkle the seeds over the mix.\nThis is all there is to planting your straw bale garden.\n6. Care for Your Garden\nThere is very limited care necessary for a straw bale garden. You should invest in a soaker hose system to keep the bales watered. Straw bales tend to stay dry which means they’ll require quite a bit of water.\nA soaker hose will keep you from having to water the bales constantly. You should fertilize your bales with liquid fertilizer one time per week.\nBasically, the more you water your bales (which you have to for moisture purposes) the more of the nutrients will be washed out of them. If you keep up with fertilizing and watering the bales, your plants should do fine.\nKeep in mind; this is very little to ask considering there is no weeding to a straw bale garden if you laid the groundwork before starting, and you don’t have to worry about continually amending soil either.\n7. Enjoy the Benefits\nAs I mentioned previously, there is very little work to a straw or straw bale garden. There’s no digging in the dirt, no need to amend poor soil for adequate growth, and no battling weeds.\nYou can enjoy watching your garden grow and harvesting from it. Where the beds are off the ground, it makes it easier to harvest as well.\nstraw bale gardening is an ideal gardening technique for anyone who is trying to test the gardening waters or someone facing physical limitations and struggles with traditional gardening techniques.\n8.

These concepts have popularized the fashion of creating urban gardening ideas on the terrace or balcony. Next, we give you the keys to be able to carry it out without any problem.\nThere are foods that are worthwhile to grow in your urban garden. Vegetables grown in a particular garden will have a flavor that cannot be compared to those you can buy in a package. This is due to the lack of sunlight when they are maturing. They are harvested when they are green and mature in artificially lit chambers to be transported (long distances) to the consumer.\nFoods grown in an urban garden without chemical fertilizers or pesticides have the aroma and flavor of natural products in contact with nature. See grow plants and collect their fruits to provide great satisfaction and personal pride.\nWhere to develop urban gardening ideas?\nIt is essential that the plants receive sunlight, the ideal would be a continuous exposure, but if it is not possible at least they receive it from 5 to 6 hours. The advisable orientation is the south or southwest.\nSome leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, chard, watercress, aromatic plants, adapt well and prefer semi-shaded areas. With 3 or 4 hours of sun they have enough. Strawberries and strawberries only need 2 or 3 hours of light in the morning. In case of not having enough solar lighting, you can create reflective surfaces that help increase it.\nIrrigation in the urban garden\nTo work with urban gardening ideas, the balcony or terrace must have a water tap, to fill the shower or install an automatic irrigation. If you do not have a tap, you can install a water tank with a programmer in which hoses with drippers will be attached.\nPlants that are grown in containers need more water than those that grow in the soil. You have to do frequent watering but with little water to avoid waterlogging. Make sure that the containers have good drainage. To the extent possible, avoid watering leaves and foliage to prevent fungal attack.\nYou should be aware of the weather, in the hot months the plants will need a daily watering, while in winter with one every five days will be sufficient. To check if you need water you just have to touch the earth, if there are traces stuck on your finger it is still wet, but you should water.\nChoose the right containers for urban gardening ideas\nYou can choose from a wide variety of containers, depending on the available space of your terrace or balcony.\nThe pots that you use for your plants can also be used to grow vegetables and aromatic plants. If you choose the model with water reserve, you will not have to worry about watering.\nThe culture boxes are suitable for growing aromatic plants, cherry tomatoes, peppers and leafy vegetables.\nIf you have enough space you can opt for cultivation tables. They are more comfortable because you do not have to bend over, suitable for species that do not grow in height: peppers and leafy vegetables.\nYou can create a vertical garden on your terrace or balcony with mini gardens. They are polypropylene containers, a material that is very resistant to the weather. You can grow aromatic plants, lettuce, strawberries…\nChoose the substrate for your crops\nA good substrate makes the plant grow healthy and develop bearing good fruit. The most recommended is that which is composed of coconut fiber and earthworm humus because it is spongy, light and has porosity to have the nutrients. It is advisable to pay with compost regularly.\nChoose simple crops to develop urban gardening ideas\nTo get started in the urban garden, it is better to start with simple crops. When you have gained experience you can incorporate other species.\nIt is one of the most appreciated products. They need a lot of sun and heat to ripen well, in addition to constant watering. You will need support where you can tie it to develop in height. There are tomato species that do not need it like cherry.\nIt is one of the most grateful vegetables because they grow fast and you can plant them in all seasons.\nIt is planted in the month of May and begins to bear fruit in the summer months. There is a wide variety of sizes, spicy, sweet … It is a perfect vegetable to grow in an urban garden.\nIt can be grown every month of the year. They need a deep soil to grow and develop well.\nIt is a resistant vegetable that can be grown all year round.\nIt is one of the vegetables for hard and cold resistant. If the plants in the summer months you can harvest their fruits in winter.\nVegetable short cycle. You just have to wait a month for the harvest. It needs frequent watering and a fertile land.\nAromatic and culinary plants.\nYou can grow from parsley, oregano, basil, thyme, chives, and coriander. For the mint, it must be grown in separate containers because they are very expansive.\nWhat do you think of these tips of urban gardening ideas to create an urban garden?

{"question":"Hello! I'd like to know how HBO's approach to dealing with pay differences based on fame compares to the OECD's view on gender pay inequality causes?","answer":"HBO acknowledges that pay differences can initially stem from actors' varying levels of fame and experience, but according to HBO's president Casey Bloys, such disparities become harder to justify in later seasons of successful shows, requiring adjustment of payment structures. In contrast, the OECD, through Secretary-General Angel Gurría, takes a more systemic view, identifying multiple root causes of gender pay inequality including flawed policies, discriminatory laws and regulations, misplaced economic incentives, workplace practices, and social norms and institutions. This shows how HBO focuses on fame-based disparities within their industry, while the OECD addresses broader structural causes of pay inequality.","context":["An HBO executive said the company examined and corrected pay disparities at the network — thanks to Reese Witherspoon.\nThe actor, who stars in and serves as an executive producer for HBO’s Big Little Lies, played an instrumental role in HBO’s pay parity assessment through her work with the Time’s Up movement, created earlier this year by prominent women in the entertainment industry.\nCasey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming, told The Hollywood Reporter the decision to identify and eliminate any pay disparities came out of “thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese, who’s really at the forefront.”\n“We’ve proactively gone through all of our shows,” he told the magazine. “In fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward. And that is a direct result of the Time’s Up movement.”\nWitherspoon is one of the high-profile actors who launched the Time’s Up movement in response to an outpouring of accusations of sexual misconduct against numerous high-profile men in Hollywood. Witherspoon has long been an advocate for promoted women in Hollywood, giving impassioned speeches about equality and starting her own production company dedicated to making films and shows with strong female leads. Her production company Pacific Standard Films produced Big Little Lies, as well as 2014’s Gone Girl and Wild.\n“Bring women to the front of their own stories, and make them the hero of their own stories,” Witherspoon said in September 2017 when HBO won Outstanding Limited Series at the 69th Emmy Awards.\nThe Time’s Up movement has taken on issues that face women in the workplace beyond sexual harassment. Initiatives within the movement include a legal defense fund for survivors of sexual misconduct, a committee dedicated to filling more boards with women and people of color and raising awareness about the gender wage gap.\nHBO is one of several companies that have conducted internal or third-party audits of its payrolls in recent years to eliminate existing pay disparities. Equal pay advocates have said payroll audits are vital for businesses to ensure wage equality, and companies like Starbucks and Adobe have announced the elimination of any pay disparities after conducting payroll audits.\nOf course, in Hollywood, massive wage differences can come as a result of the existing fame of an actor or an actor’s negotiation tactics. Last month, Left Bank Pictures, the production company behind Netflix’s The Crown, came under fire when an executive revealed the Matt Smith, the actor who played Prince Philip on the show, earned more than Claire Foy, the actor who played Queen Elizabeth II. The company attributed Smith’s higher salary to his already-existing Doctor Who fame, and Foy’s smaller salary due to her newcomer status. Still, fans and critics were still angered by the pay difference — especially since Foy went on to win a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for her portrayal of the Queen.\nIn his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, HBO’s Bloys addressed this issue faced by networks and production companies when actors come onto shows with different levels of experiences. “But when you get into season two or three of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers,” Bloys said, “and that’s where you have to make sure that you’re looking at the numbers — that they don’t end up just on the path they were on from the pilot stage.”","19 September 2017\nPowerful Global Coalition to Boost Equal Pay for Women at Work\nNew initiative will support innovative and effective equal pay policies and practices around the globe.\n(New York)—One of the most persistent barriers to women’s success at work and to economic growth, unequal pay, will be actively challenged by a new global partnership, the Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC).\nWith the launch of EPIC, the International Labour Organization (ILO), UN Women and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are bringing together a diverse set of actors at the global, regional and national levels to support governments, employers and workers and their organizations, and other stakeholders, to make equal pay between women and men for work of equal value a reality.\n“One of the most visible, tangible and pervasive manifestations of discrimination is that women across the globe are still being paid less than men for work of equal value. That is why this equal pay initiative was developed and why it is a focus area of the ILO’s Women at Work Centenary Initiative. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value is enshrined in the ILO Constitution of 1919. One hundred years is too long to wait, and we must all work together to make equal pay for work of equal value a reality. ” said Guy Ryder, the Director-General of the ILO.\nEPIC is a global response to a critical problem that has been prioritized in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular Target 8.5, which calls for equal pay for work of equal value by 2030. Equal pay, in addition to empowering women, can have a significant impact on achieving other key goals, such as promoting inclusive societies, reducing poverty, and creating conditions for decent work and gender equality.\nPhumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women, said: “There is no justification for unequal pay for a woman when her job is of equal value to a man’s. This injustice has been unseen for too long, and together we are changing that. Equal pay for women translates into lifelong benefits for them as well as their families: better career prospects and lifetime earnings, greater independence, and higher investments in their children’s education and health.”\nEmployers and trade unions, as well as other key stakeholders, will have a central role in the application and rolling out of equal pay policies. A Platform of Champions, launched earlier this year by UN Women at the Commission on the Status of Women, will also contribute to strengthening advocacy on equal pay, as part of EPIC.\nA recent ILO-Gallup report, based on a representative survey of 142 countries, shows that women and men alike want women to be in paid jobs, but there remain a range of challenges for women at work, including unequal pay, balancing work and family responsibilities, lack of access to affordable care and unfair treatment.\nOECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría noted that “gender inequality has many roots, including flawed policies, discriminatory laws and regulations, misplaced economic incentives, workplace practices, and social norms and institutions.” He asserted that “it is in our power to make an immediate improvement in the quality of life of hundreds of millions of women and their families if we succeed in delivering equal pay for men and women.”\nThe issue of equal pay remains high on the UN’s agenda. This year, the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel for Women’s Economic Empowerment, released a report that focused on transformative actions needed to advance women’s economic empowerment, highlighting the importance of equal pay for work of equal value.\nThe innovative work of the newly created EPIC will contribute significantly to challenging some of the main assumptions reinforcing unequal pay, which were also highlighted by the High-Level Panel and the ILO-Gallup report.\nFurther information on the Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) can be accessed at www.ilo.org/epic"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3616381a-5e2e-4ef8-8a3d-9308b0c2886a>","<urn:uuid:c1c75b6c-0d3f-40dc-a0d5-1d5058fad31a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main difference between FSP's and VTT's methods for assessing material performance in fire safety?","answer":"FSP focuses primarily on analyzing building construction and compliance with building codes through fire safety engineering assessments, while VTT takes a more comprehensive scientific approach by combining experimental methods (using cone calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry) with advanced numerical simulations to evaluate material performance, investigate flame retardant effects, and explore structural optimization as part of product R&D.","context":["Fire Safety Engineering\nOur fire safety engineers can develop alternative building solutions using performance based requirements to overcome non-compliance with the deemed to satisfy provisions of the Building Code of Australia (BCA).\nFire Safety Engineering involves more than just building code consultancy and building design, the fire safety engineer will analyse the building’s construction to achieve building approval.\nOur fire safety engineers have the experience to develop alternative solutions using performance based requirements to overcome building code non-compliances with the deemed to satisfy (DtS) provisions of the Building Code of Australia (BCA). One of the methodologies is to use sophisticated computer fire and smoke modelling programs, egress calculations, radiation calculations etc.\nAs you would appreciate, approval of any Alternative Solution is subject to fire authority and building certifier as such no guarantees can be made in relation to the gaining acceptance of authorities e.g. Fire brigades, building certifier, in relation of the above approaches.\nOur approach to the fire safety engineering will be based on the current industry practice as described in the ‘International Fire Engineering Guidelines’ published by the ABCB and the ‘Society of Fire Safety – Code of Practice‘ published by Engineers Australia, reducing the time frame on your project\nWe follow the four stages of the Fire Engineering Process as set out by the International Fire Engineering Guidelines 2005 (IFEG, 2005):\nFire Engineering Brief (FEB)\nFollowing confirmation of the preferred concept design strategy and the associated building code non-compliances, a Fire Engineering Brief (FEB) would be prepared. The FEB would outline the acceptance criteria, fire safety systems, method of analysis with the aim of resolving the fire safety assessment parameters.\nThe FEB will be presented to the authorities and other stakeholders so that the fire safety strategy and Alternative Solutions are agreed upon in principle. At the end of this stage, we would be able to give our opinion as to the likely outcome of the Building Approval process.\nFire Engineering Report (FER)\nOnce the details of the FEB is agreed in principle with all the stakeholders, a detailed Fire Engineering Report (FER) would be undertaken for submission to the client, authorities and the design team. The FER would be presented in report format, with proposed fire safety measures defined. It will also contain performance parameters for input to the detailed design of fire safety measures by the project team.\nThe assessment may use qualitative analyses or quantitative modelling, or a combination of both where considered appropriate. Formal presentation and negotiation with the authorities for Building Approval will occur at this stage. The submission of the FER report is considered to complete the main scope of work for fire engineering services.\nThe outcome of a Fire Engineering Report ranges from extended travel distances, reduction of the fire resistance levels (FRLs) required for the classification of the building or even the deletion of certain essential fire safety measures.

We have the capabilities to model and analyse most types of buildings, ranging from multi-storey shopping centres to high rise office buildings.\nType of evacuation software we commonly use:\nContact FSP to discuss how we can help you with your Fire and Evacuation modelling needs.\nFrequently Asked Questions.\nWhen do you formulate a Fire Engineering Report (Alternative Solution)?\nThe Building Code of Australia (BCA) is a performance-based building code which allows non-standard designs (alternative solutions) which are demonstrated to comply with the performance requirements. The Amending Regulation introduces new and changed requirements for fire safety alternative solutions that relate to Class 1b to 9 buildings.\nThe aims of these changes are to:\n- Ensure there is a record of all accepted fire safety alternative solutions that apply to a development\n- Improve construction compliance\n- Clarify compliance checking.\nThe Amending Regulation requires an Alternative Solution report to be submitted for building work relating to a Class 1b to 9 building that involves a fire safety Alternative Solution. The report must be submitted with an application for a CC or CDC, or for a modified CC or CDC.\nThe Amending Regulation also requires that related certificates record each report and details about the person who prepared it. In combination, these provisions require reports to cover every fire safety Alternative Solution for a development no matter when they arise during the project.\nWho can prepare Alternative Solution reports or Fire Engineering Reports (FER)?\nA fire safety alternative solution report must be prepared by or on behalf of a competent fire safety practitioner (and in some cases a fire safety engineer e.g. C10). Importantly, the report must include a copy of the brief on which the justification for accepting the alternative solution is based. The required content of these reports is intended to reflect industry good practice and what is expected under the International Fire Engineering Guidelines (IFEG).\nThe new regulation will require the principal certifying authority (PCA) to be satisfied that all accepted fire safety Alternative Solutions have been constructed or installed in accordance with the associated Alternative Solution Reports. While this requirement is consistent with the existing responsibility of the PCA, the new regulation will clarify the PCA’s responsibility on Alternative Solutions. There is some concern that this crosses the line where Accredited Certifiers move from being an independent public authority, to that of a certifier of construction components. Submissions have been made to state government regarding these concerns.\nThe NSW Government is now reviewing stakeholder feedback on the draft regulation changes.","Fire and Evacuation Safety\nVTT’s Fire and Evacuation Safety team conducts research on the methods of fire and evacuation safety assessment, material performance and risk analysis. We use both experimental and computational methods for the benefit of our customers. Fire tests using standardized methods are performed by VTT Expert Services.\nNew materials, products and building methods can lead to unexpected risks for fire and evacuation safety. The consideration of both technological and human behaviour aspects of safety requires interdisciplinary research.\nMethods for fire and evacuation safety assessment\nVTT is one of the developers of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a CFD-based computer code for the numerical simulation of fire phenomena. We are responsible for the development of thermal radiation and condensed-phase heat transfer and pyrolysis modules of FDS. Scientific novelty combined with the systematic verification and validation processes have made this open-source code the most widely used fire simulation code in the World.\nWe develop and maintain the evacuation simulation module of the FDS code, called FDS+Evac. This open-source module allows stand-alone or coupled simulation of human evacuation and is the major tool for any performance-based assessment of human safety in buildings and transport systems. FDS+Evac contains an agent-based model for the human movement and decision making processes, considering e.g. way-finding and toxicological aspects.\nEfficiency of fire safety systems\nWe use both experimental and simulation-based methods for the assessment of fire safety systems that are commonly used to ensure the safety of modern infrastructure, such as large buildings, ships and tunnels. In co-operation with industry, we develop the simulation methods and use them to support applications such as high-pressure water mist, conventional sprinklers and smoke management systems.\nWe use experiments to increase our understanding of human behaviour during emergency situations. The results are used to model human reactions and decisions in safety assessment projects. Experimentally observed characteristics, such as specific flows through doors and corridors, walking speeds and stair climbing speeds, are also used to validate the capabilities of the tools like FDS+Evac. We also develop algorithms for the modelling of exit-selection, counterflow and congestion-induced downfall.\nSimulation of fire and structures\nWe have developed a software tool for coupling the CFD fire simulations with the FEM-based structural analysis. FDS2FEM-tool transfers the fire simulation predictions for the surface heat flux and/or temperature to the time-dependent boundary conditions of the FEM-analysis.\nMaterial fire safety\nAtomistic simulation of materials\nReactive Molecular Dynamics (RMD) simulations are used to investigate the thermal degradation of polymers. The goals are to increase the theoretical understanding of flame retardancy and to support pyrolysis modelling. MD simulations are also performed to study metal oxidation and clay hydration processes.\nPyrolysis experiments and modelling\nUnderstanding the thermal degradation of materials is an important part of material fire safety assessment. We use experiments and numerical simulations to evaluate the material performance, to investigate the effects of flame retardants and to explore the possibilities for structural optimization as part of product R&D.\nFor experiments, we use cone calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Other commonly used assessment tools for material flammability and chemical composition are also available.\nModelling the heat transfer and pyrolysis in practical material requires determination of a large number of material specific parameters. We have developed both direct and optimization-based methods for the pyrolysis model parameter estimation, including the Pyroplot –tool.\nPerformance of electrical cables\nVTT has developed a unique experimental apparatus for the investigation of flame spread on cable (and other cylindrical objects) at elevated temperatures. When combined with small and bench-scale experiments and simulations, the new method can be used to assess the performance of electrical cables in fire conditions.\nFire safety of composites\nThe performance of new composite materials and structures can be evaluated using a wide range of methods, ranging from flammability tests to overall performance evaluation of complete structures. We have developed advanced simulation tools that combine fire and pyrolysis modelling (CFD) to structural analysis using FEM.\nQuantitative fire risk analysis\nQuantitative risk analysis combines the probabilities of events to their consequences. We use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the likelihood of the critical consequences. Our tools, such as the Probabilistic Fire Simulator (PFS), have been developed in the context of nuclear power plant fire safety, but have found applications in many other fields of fire safety engineering.\nThe level of acceptable risk is usually based on the statistics of the past incidents and political decisions to change the situation. We help authorities to specify what can be tolerated by a society and how to measure the impact of their decisions.\nOperation time modelling\nThe efficiency of rescue and crisis management organizations can be evaluated using the Stochastic Operation Time Model. This model allows us to estimate the development of available resources by considering the distributions of individual operation times, inter-organizational communication needs and possibilities for additional delays. It has been used to evaluate the performance of nuclear power plant fire services and city fire service in case of a large railway fire.\nFire service impact and strategies\nResearch results can be used to measure the impacts of municipal fire services and the efficiency of the means to reduce residential fire deaths. We support the authorities when they are making strategic decisions on the allocation and distribution of resources in fire services and other first responders. We promote the use of numerical simulations in fire investigation.\nPeople in urban environment\nUrban planning needs to consider a wide range of aspects, such as safety, accessibility and comfort. Many of these aspects can, and should be evaluated in an integrated fashion. We study the application of computational methods in multi-objective evaluation of urban environment functionality.\nNuclear power plant fire safety\nFor more than 20 years, we have carried out research on the fire safety of nuclear power plants by participating in both national SAFIR-programmes and international research programmes, and by carrying out contract research for industry and authorities. Some of the current public research topics include:\nresponse by plant personnel and electrical systems\nsimulation of large fire loads, such as pool and cable fires\nOECD NEA PRISME and PRISME2\nFire protection of structural elements\nFire safety engineering is used to produce justification for protective methods for structures under building fire conditions. The concept makes use of the measured distributions of the fire load densities and opening factors, parametric fire curves and event tree analysis, as well as comparisons with statistical data of real fires. The methodology enables the use of both passive and active protection methods and is applicable for timber, steel, etc. framed buildings.\nFire and evacuation safety of ships\nWe have strong expertise in fire and evacuation risk assessment of passenger ships. We use modern simulation tools to evaluate the alternative design of passenger ships, according to IMO MSC/Circ. 1002. The outcome is safe, comfortable and attractive ship with larger uniform spaces than what could be implemented following the conventional design rules.\nFire and evacuation safety of large buildings\nVTT has more than 20 years of experience in applying the fire safety engineering (FSE) methods to performance-based design of large buildings. As a result, safe building can be constructed with reduced cost.\nWe investigate the fires following an aircraft impact using CFD and FEM tools. Advanced experimental techniques, such as high-speed cameras with laser back lights, are used to determine the drop size and velocity distributions from high-speed impacts. Large-scale tests are used to validate the numerical simulations.\nFire and evacuation safety of passenger trains\nVTT is experienced in assessing the evacuation safety of passenger trains in case of fire. The evacuation simulation procedure is applicable to various train scenarios with different geometries and features. The coupling of the FDS+Evac evacuation module with FDS fire simulation program makes it possible to take into account the effects of heat, smoke and toxic gases on the evacuation. Simulations provide a cost-effective method for fire and evacuation safety design of passenger trains.\nNew experimental apparatus for cable flame spread rate measurement."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:32a5a1f3-b333-4709-b2e1-1d7beabe1018>","<urn:uuid:f5837cca-8861-4381-9147-dbf3c65f79c7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key components of the upper respiratory system, and how does chronic bronchitis impact respiratory function in these areas?","answer":"The upper respiratory system consists of several key components: the nostrils and mouth (which filter air through vibrissae and mucous), the nasal cavity (which warms and moistens air), the pharynx (a 5-inch funnel-shaped tube connecting nasal and oral cavities), and the larynx with its protective epiglottis. In chronic bronchitis, there is excessive mucus production that affects the entire respiratory system. This condition is characterized by a productive cough that occurs daily with sputum production lasting at least two months for two consecutive years. The excess mucus production and inflammation lead to airway narrowing and increased susceptibility to lung infections, affecting the overall respiratory function and making breathing more difficult.","context":["Upper and Lower Structure of the Respiratory System in Males and Females\nOne of the most important systems in the bodies of males and females is the one which supports the function of breathing. The structure of the respiratory system consists of several vital components which enable humans to receive oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere and get rid of carbon dioxide. This structure is discussed and explained below in detail.\nThe upper structure of respiratory system is divided into the following important parts.\nNostrils and Mouth\nThe process of respiration begins from the nose or mouth which acts as a two-way passage for air. Fresh air enters while the used up air leaves the body through the nostrils or the mouth. This process is termed as breathing. It is preferable to breathe through the nostrils since it can filter the air before it reaches the more delicate components of this system. The walls of the nostrils are lined with tiny hair called vibrissae. A layer of mucous is also present which is a sticky and slimy substance. Both the vibrissae as well as the mucous trap dust particles and pass on purified air to the internal parts of the system.\nThe layer of epithelium present in the nasal cavity makes the air warm and provides moisture to it. This is important for the process of respiration before the air enters the other parts of the system.\nFrom the nasal cavity, air now enters a tube known as the pharynx. This tube is funnel-shaped and is approximately five inches in length. The main function of this structure is to connect the nasal cavity with the oral cavity. The pharynx also houses lymphatic tissue which produce white blood cells for protection against diseases and infection.\nLarynx and Epiglottis\nLarynx provides the entrance to the internal components of the respiratory system. The epiglottis, on the other hand, is shaped like a flap and covers the mouth of larynx when food is passing down the adjacent components of the digestive system. In this way, the epiglottis performs an extremely important function of preventing food and water from entering the respiratory tract in order to avoid choking.\nNow begin the components which make up the lower structure of respiratory system. These components are explained below in detail.\nThe trachea is also referred to as the windpipe. The inhaled air passes down from the larynx above to the trachea lying immediately below. The windpipe is a tube which is rigid and muscular. It is 4.5 inches in length and 1 inch in width. Around the walls of the trachea are rings of cartilage which are c-shaped. These rings account for the rigidity of the windpipe and also allow it to remain open instead of collapsing.\nThe trachea branches off into a pair of bronchi. These are tubes which in turn branch off into smaller tubes referred to as bronchioles. Each bronchus provides passage for the inhaled air to enter into the lungs.\nLungs, Bronchioles and Alveoli\nEvery male and female contains a pair of lungs which play a significant role in the process of respiration. Lungs are organs which are spongy and filled with air. They reside in the chest cavity and are protected by the ribcage. Each lung contains bronchioles and air-filled sacs which are known as alveoli. Any obstructions or damage to the bronchioles or alveoli can cause respiratory diseases, like asthma.\nDiaphragm is a very important muscle used in the process of respiration. It is shaped like a dome and can expand or contract according to breathing movements. When the process of inhalation takes place, the diaphragm contracts and becomes flat. This creates more room in the chest cavity for fresh air to enter. On the contrary, during exhalation, this muscle relaxes and returns to its dome-shaped form. This puts pressure on the lungs to force the used up air out.\nIndeed, each and every component of the respiratory system plays a vital role to sustain life. Any birth defect or damage to any of these parts can lead to infections and respiratory diseases.","What is it?\nBronchitis is a term that describes inflammation of the bronchial tubes. In Chronic Bronchitis, this inflammation causes excessive secretions of mucus into the tubes that along with tissue swelling results in bronchial tube narrowing. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts at least two months for at least two consecutive years. Chronic Bronchitis is one type of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a disease that is distinguished by chronically poor airflow. The other conditions associated with COPD include Asthma and Emphysema.\nThe normal function of cells that line the airways of the lungs is to produce mucus, which acts as a part of the body’s defense mechanism against bacteria, viruses, and other foreign particles. The mucus helps catch the particles while tiny hair-like projections in the airways called cilia clear the mucus out of the lungs. In chronic bronchitis, there is an overproduction of mucus that the cilia are unable to clear from the lungs. Over time, the cilia lose function and become less efficient at removing mucus from the lungs. This excess mucus results in airway narrowing and also provides a haven for bacteria to grow, thus making patients more susceptible to serious lung infections.\nWho does it affect?\nAbout 10 million Americans are affected by some form of COPD, which is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for developing chronic bronchitis and 90% of patients have a history of smoking. Other risk factors for chronic bronchitis include: long term exposure to chemicals and dust, exposure to secondhand smoke, family members with COPD, history of frequent lung infections, and long term asthma.\n|Increased mucus production|\n|Shortness of breath, especially after light activity|\n|Chest pain or tightness|\nHow is it diagnosed?\nThe diagnosis of Chronic Bronchitis is confirmed clinically after a patient presents with symptoms of a productive cough that has been present for 3 months for at least 2 consecutive years. However, additional tests are used to determine prognosis and staging of the diagnosis. A breathing test may be ordered to assess lung function. Blood tests may be ordered to look for signs of infection and carbon dioxide levels, and a Chest X-ray can be used to look for infection or disease progression.\nHow is it treated?\nThere is no cure for chronic bronchitis so treatments aim at reducing symptoms and improving lung function. The best way to reduce symptoms and slow disease progression is to stop smoking. Medications can be prescribed to improve lung function. These medicine help manage chronic bronchitis by opening and relaxing the airway and by decreasing inflammation. Oxygen therapy can be helpful if oxygen levels in the blood are too low. Pulmonary rehabilitation can strengthen chest muscles and decrease the workload on the lungs by building endurance. Additionally, all patients with chronic bronchitis should receive yearly flu vaccines unless contraindicated. They should also receive the vaccine that protects against many forms of pneumonia.\nBecause there is no cure for chronic bronchitis, the patient should learn to manage their lifestyle. For example, patients should set attainable targets for physical activity and learn different relaxation techniques to alleviate stress. Patients should try to reduce stress as anxiety can increase the breathing rate, which will make breathing more taxing.\nTell us how can we improve this post?\nLog In is required for submitting new question."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c914742c-e5ef-4119-a4fd-276814cd6fe8>","<urn:uuid:215ef21e-bf1d-49f3-bcf7-be4e280cef16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the composition and preparation process of bacon, and what are the proper storage guidelines after purchase?","answer":"Bacon is a salt-cured pork product with high fat content, typically made from the pig's belly, sides, or back. It's usually thinly sliced and can be smoked using different woods like applewood or maplewood for flavor enhancement, resulting in a deep pink color with a golden rind. Regarding storage, the USDA recommends using dry-cured sliced bacon within 10 days when unrefrigerated and within 4 weeks if refrigerated. After purchase, bacon should be used within 7 days of the sell-by date, or within the manufacturer's use-by date. If frozen, bacon can be safely thawed and cooked within 4 months.","context":["Table of Contents\n- 1 What happens if uncooked bacon is left out?\n- 2 Can you cook bacon that was left out?\n- 3 How long can sealed bacon sit out?\n- 4 Does raw bacon need to be refrigerated?\n- 5 How long can sealed bacon be left out?\n- 6 How long does bacon take to defrost at room temp?\n- 7 How long can Bacon be left at room temp?\n- 8 Is it OK to throw away raw bacon?\nWhat happens if uncooked bacon is left out?\nThe average room temperature is approximately 68 degrees. Therefore, dangerous bacteria could be growing on your uncooked bacon when it’s left unattended on the counter. For your safety and the safety of your family, it’s never advised to cook and consume your bacon after sitting out longer than 2 hours.\nCan you cook bacon that was left out?\nCured bacon prevents the growth of bacteria. Also, when cured bacon is fried, all the moisture is removed from the meat strips. So, most of the time, cooked bacon does not go bad if left out on the counter overnight. Cooked bacon left outside will eventually get cold and change in texture.\nHow can you tell if raw bacon is bad?\nWhen spoiled, the signature red hue of your bacon may start to become dull and fade into a grey, brown, or greenish color. Spoiled bacon may also be slimy or sticky rather than soft and moist. Bacon that has a sour smell or rotting odor should also be thrown out, as this is another sign of spoilage.\nCan you leave bacon out overnight to thaw?\nYou’re asking for trouble. Never leave the frosted bacon out at room temperature for longer than two hours. To stay on the safe side, you should refrigerate it immediately. There is always the danger when frozen bacon is left out at room temperature that the exterior might thaw while the interior is still frozen.\nHow long can sealed bacon sit out?\nHow long can bacon be left at room temperature? Bacteria grow rapidly at temperatures between 40 °F and 140 °F; bacon should be discarded if left out for more than 2 hours at room temperature.\nDoes raw bacon need to be refrigerated?\nAfter cooking, refrigerate and use within four to five days. But not all bacon is the mass-produced kind you find next to Lunchables. The USDA recommends using dry-cured sliced bacon within ten days when unrefrigerated, and within four weeks if you keep it in the refrigerated.\nCan you cook 1 day out of date bacon?\nCheck the expiry date on the bacon packet. If the “use by” date has expired, then that bacon is unsafe to use. Always use bacon within seven days of purchase (“sell by”) or by the “use by” date listed by the manufacturer. You can also safely thaw and cook the bacon within four months of freezing bacon.\nWhat are the white spots on bacon?\nCooked meat can get mouldy if left too long in the fridge, so if you see small fuzzy white or blue spots on your bacon, it’s definitely not safe for consumption. The bacon is sticky. If your raw bacon is still soft and just a bit moist, it’s safe to eat.\nHow long can sealed bacon be left out?\nHow long does bacon take to defrost at room temp?\nBacon should thaw in 30 minutes and should be cooked immediately. Do not refreeze. You can also defrost bacon in the microwave.\nCan bacon be stored at room temperature?\nBacon CAN be heavily smoked and cured for room-temperature storage, but most grocery-store bacon is not this kind. Due to the nitrates/nitrates and smoking process, normal bacon should be safe at room temperature for longer than the 2 hours we give uncured meats, but 32 hours is simply WAY TOO LONG.\nCan you eat 2 year old frozen bacon?\nEditor: According to the USDA, fresh or thawed bacon should be used within 7 days. Technically, frozen food will stay safe to eat nearly indefinitely, but for the sake of quality and taste we tend to freeze bacon no more than a few months.\nHow long can Bacon be left at room temp?\nBacteria grow rapidly at temperatures between 40 °F and 140 °F; cooked bacon should be discarded if left for more than 2 hours at room temperature. Do you need to refrigerate bacon?\nIs it OK to throw away raw bacon?\nAs painful as it is to throw bacon away, it’s definitely better than getting sick. The general, culinary school rule of food safety for raw meat is that you don’t let things sit out more than four hours. For raw mass-produced bacon, that’s probably a good rule of thumb.\nHow long does bacon grease last in the fridge?\nBacon grease can last for up to 6 months at room temperature in a cupboard, in an airtight container. In the fridge it can keep for up to a year in the same container. If left out in the skillet at room temperature it will still good even after a week.\nHow long after the expiration date can you freeze Bacon?\nThis kind of bacon usually has an expiration date stamped on the package, which you should definitely check before you buy or consume it. Once the package is opened, the FDA recommends that you use or freeze the bacon (yep, you can freeze bacon) within seven days to ensure freshness.","Freezing your bacon is an excellent way to store it for later use. Continue reading to find out how to properly defrost frozen bacon.\nWhat Exactly Is Bacon?\nBacon is a type of salt-cured pork product with a high fat content. Bacon is typically made from the pig's belly, sides, or back. The combination of crispiness, salt, and fat in bacon makes it a popular savory treat. Bacon is typically thinly sliced and can be smoked, a flavor-enhancing cooking process.\nDifferent types of wood, such as applewood or maplewood, are used to smoke the bacon, imparting the flavor of those trees to the bacon. Smoked bacon is deep pink with a golden rind and can be cut thick or thin. Other countries have different types of bacon, and in other countries, this type of bacon is known as \"American bacon\" or \"streaky bacon.\"\n5 Good Ways to Defrost Your Bacon\nDepending on your specific needs and the equipment you have available, there are several ways to defrost frozen bacon. Consider the following approaches:\n1. Bath in cold water: You can defrost the bacon quickly by using cold water. Place the bacon in its original packaging in a watertight container or freezer bag, then place the bag on the kitchen counter in a bowl of cold tap water. The amount of time required to thaw depends on the amount of bacon being defrostedâ€”a pound of bacon can take up to twenty minutes to thaw. You can also run the bacon under cold water from the sink.\n2. Refrigerator: If you have the time, the overnight refrigerator thaw is the best method. Remove the frozen bacon from the freezer, discard the packaging, and place it in a container. Then put the container in the fridge. This will allow the bacon to slowly thaw; usually, overnight is sufficient defrosting time.\n3. Microwave oven: If you're short on time, thawing frozen bacon in the microwave can help. Place the bacon on a microwave-safe plate or bowl, cover with a paper towel to absorb moisture, and defrost in minute-long increments for a few minutes. In between increments, check on the progress. If the bacon is in a block, you can gently separate the slices with a knife.\n4. Conventional oven: A conventional oven can also be used to defrost bacon. Preheat your oven to 300Â°F. Remove any packaging from the frozen bacon and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Defrosting in the oven should only take about five minutes.\n5. Frying pan: A stainless steel or cast iron frying pan can be used to defrost bacon and is also an excellent tool for cooking bacon. Reduce the heat to low to medium on the stovetop. Place the frozen bacon in the pan after removing it from its packaging. Optionally, line the pan with aluminum foil to help conduct heat and keep the bacon from cooking. After a few minutes, flip the bacon and allow it to heat up on the other side.\nKeep in mind that the USDA food safety guidelines recommend keeping raw meat away from the danger zone of 40 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, where harmful bacteria can quickly multiply. This means that thawing frozen bacon at room temperature, or using warm or hot water, can increase the risk of food poisoning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5dec3d24-d53e-41f5-9a91-3f20501c5484>","<urn:uuid:6a4e35f7-7b47-4e3c-bd99-3585fa939f39>"],"error":null}

{"question":"In my restaurant kitchen, what need to be cleaned more often - ice maker food zone or dishwasher filters??","answer":"Both areas require regular cleaning but for different reasons. The ice maker's food zone is particularly critical as it can harbor mold, slime, yeast, and bacteria in its wet, dark conditions, making it notoriously one of the filthiest places in the kitchen. For dishwashers, filters need regular maintenance as they capture excess food and waste, and if there's buildup to the point where they become ineffective, dishes and glasses won't come out clean. Both areas are designed to be easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.","context":["If your business has a commercial dishwasher or glasswasher then you’re all-too-aware of the benefits of having one. You can bulk wash items on a quick cycle and get them dried and reused almost instantly – even during the same shift. So when issues arise and your dishes or glasses aren’t squeaky clean, or worse, then it becomes a very big problem indeed.\nLet’s take a look at some of the most common issues that our technicians encounter on a daily basis, and how you can fix them. For some of the electronic faults, there are simple and quick fixes that you can undertake yourself. But unfortunately, for many other issues, professional assistance is the only realistic way to eradicate the problem.\nThe Most Common Dishwasher & Glasswasher Issues\nThese are five of the most common commercial dishwasher and glasswasher issues, ranging all the way from unusual smells and sounds to limescale build-up and leaking water. If you’re ever in doubt or come across an issue too complex to address, then don’t hesitate to get in touch with our expert KES Facilities team.\nThis is a quick way to ruin your day. You know exactly what your washer sounds like, so when you hear an unusual sound, it’s an immediate warning that you can’t ignore.\nAny sound of whirring, banging, or clanking is reason enough to stop the cycle and cut the power to your washer. If you’re lucky, there could be something lodged in the waste pipe, or a buildup that needs to be cleaned.\nBut if you’re less fortunate, you might discover that the rotating motor has moved out of place, or has started to rust. If you’re confident and have the skills, then dismantle the appropriate parts and install a new rotating motor.\nAnother reason for unusual sounds is the brushes getting worn out and brittle, to the point where they no longer clean your items. This repair isn’t quite as straightforward.\nThis issue is extremely common, and ties in with any fault noises and sounds. First of all, check for any food particles blocking the pipes. However, if you hear any unusual sounds specifically emanating from the pumps (towards the end of the wash cycle), then it’s highly likely that the issue exists in the drain pumps themselves.\nWater pumps are the unsung heroes within any washer assembly. They control the flow of water, drawing water in and expelling wastewater during the wash cycle. But these mechanical parts are constantly working and moving, so wear-and-tear is completely natural.\nNoisy pumps, puddles at the end of the wash, and ineffective draining are likely to be caused by old and faulty drain pumps. Replacing them is normally the solution and is a relatively simple fix. If you’re lucky, it could be the pump bearings themselves that need to be replaced, and they’re usually cheaper to source and install. But on a bad day, it could be the selector switches or the timer that’s causing the issue.\nFor even more complicated issues, a professional technician will need to inspect solenoids and impellers.\nDishes Aren’t Clean\nSo we’ve talked about unusual sounds and poor draining – but dishes and glasses coming out still dirty is another pretty obvious indicator that something isn’t right. There could be several reasons for this but, normally, it’s to do with a dirty machine that just needs to be washed.\nThe first simple task to carry out is to inspect the filter. As you guessed, these devices capture any excess food or waste and therefore need regular maintenance. If there’s buildup to the point where they become ineffective, then your dishes and glasses won’t come out clean.\nRegular cleaning also helps to keep the rinse jets effective. They’ll be able to target your glasses and dishes in the way they were designed to – when they’re obstructed by waste, their high-pressure jets won’t be as effective.\nThe same goes for the rinse arms, which can easily become obstructed. On other occasions, there can be a limescale buildup or some wear-and-tear on these arms as well. However, if after attempting all of this the dishes are still coming out dirty, you’ll need a professional to take a look at the dosing pump, wash pump, or the rinse cycle itself.\nIt’s also worth looking into having an inline water softener fitted to prevent limescale buildup inside the unit. These are particularly effective in rinse tanks, wash tanks, wash pumps and drain pumps.\nFaulty Electrics & No Power\nIt’s a big ‘oh no’ if your machine also refuses to start up in the first place. Check the power source – is everything connected as it should be? Double-check your fuse, and make sure that the washer door is closed correctly.\nIf none of these fixes work, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be able to address the electronic repairs yourself – it’s in the interest of your own safety. There could be any number of electronic faults from faulty motor relays to dodgy drive motors, or broken switches and complete control board failure. This is when you need to know what you’re doing, otherwise you’ll only make things worse.\nOverfilling, Underfilling & Leaking Water\nNoticing water in places where it shouldn’t be is another common dishwasher and glasswasher issue. There could be any number of reasons why your washer is underfilling and overfilling, and it may take a considerable time for you to identify the fault.\nOur KES technicians, on the other hand, have the experience to quickly identify the issue and resolve it for you – often on the spot. Again, there could be an issue with the timer, or the float could be trapped. There could be issues with the water inlet valve, the filters, or the control board itself.\nWhen it comes to leaking water and faulty filling, the quickest and most pain-free way to fix the issue is to get in touch with the professionals.\nDishwasher & Glasswasher Maintenance with KES Facilities\nAs you can see, dishwashers and glasswashers are complicated machines, and repairs can be simple, but more often than not, it takes experience and training to know what the issue is and how to fix it as quickly as possible.\nContact our friendly Yorkshire-based team today to see how we can get your washer back up and running. Or, if you’re worried about future breakdowns, then we’ll set up a maintenance schedule and regularly service your machine for you.\nKeep your machine in expert hands and you’ll be able to enjoy business as normal.","Understanding How a Commercial Ice Machine Works\nThe ice maker is one of the most complex pieces of equipment in your kitchen, and it's the only piece that actually produces an edible product without any active input from staff. That's why it's especially important that it's given the proper attention needed to keep it clean and maintained. Understanding the basics of how a commercial ice machine works will help you clean the equipment and better communicate with service technicians when it's time to tune up or repair the unit. Here's a rundown of the major components and what they do.\nWelcome to the Food Zone\nThe FDA defines ice as a food and expects restaurant operators to treat it as such. That's why manufacturers design the parts that touch ice and the water used to make it with a strong focus on sanitation and cleanability. The area that houses those components is called the food zone, and to improve the sanitation of those pieces, the food zone is separated from the other parts of the machine.\nTo begin the ice making process in a cube or half-cube machine, water is pumped into the food zone and into the water trough, which acts as a reservoir for the water used in ice production. From there, it flows through a water distributor that cascades the water evenly over the machine's evaporator plate, which is responsible for freezing the water into ice (more on that important component in a moment). Water that doesn't freeze to the plate falls back into the trough to begin the cycle again. Shielding the evaporator to prevent water from splashing onto the rest of the components in the food zone is a large plastic piece called the curtain.\nThe evaporator plate is where the magic happens inside a commercial ice maker. In cube-style ice machines, it consists of a vertically-mounted metal plate attached to a grid. Refrigerant lines just below the surface of the plate remove heat, lowering its temperature to below freezing. Water flows over the plate in the process described above, and gradually the water will freeze until cubes of ice have formed inside the grid.\nWhen the Food Zone Becomes a Hot Zone\nUnfortunately, the wet, dark conditions of an ice machine food zone are ideal for all sorts of potentially harmful life forms to grow and reproduce, including mold, slime, yeast, and bacteria. This is how ice machines have earned a reputation for being one of the filthiest places in the kitchen. Fortunately, the majority of commercial ice machines are designed with easy-to-use cleaning routines that require minimum labor and downtime, and components in the food zone are designed to be easily removed for a good soaking and deep cleaning. Ice machine cleaning involves a few simple steps, which you can read more about in our article on how to clean your ice maker\nThe second major enemy of an ice machine's well-being is limescale, a naturally occurring residue left behind by hard water. Over time, those minerals can build up on the evaporator plate and other critical ice machine parts and make the machine inefficient or even cause it to break down. Fortunately, manufacturers lay out proper deliming procedures in user manuals. The biggest thing to keep in mind is to only use deliming chemicals that have been approved for use by the manufacturer. Many evaporators are made with nickel coatings to protect them from rust. Unapproved cleaners can strip away that protective layer and expose the underlying steel to corrosion.\nAs an additional safeguard against ice contamination, many ice machine manufacturers are making food-zone components with molded-in antimicrobial compounds. These compounds don't kill the lifeforms or prevent them from growing outright, but they do create an environment that's not ideal for microscopic organisms to thrive on, so they grow more slowly. An ice machine built with these components can remain more sanitary between cleanings, helping to protect ice from developing an off taste and your patrons from becoming ill.\nHarvest Assist Technology\nIf you've ever struggled to remove ice from an ice cube tray at home, you understand how difficult ice can be to remove from a cold surface. The same challenge is present for removing ice from the evaporator plate. That process occurs in the harvest cycle and is accomplished in one of two ways.\nThe traditional way of freeing ice cubes from an evaporator plate involves temporarily reversing the refrigeration cycle so that the evaporator plate is heated rather than cooled. Akin to running hot water over the bottom of an ice cube tray to release the cubes, this process loosens the ice stuck to the evaporator so it will fall into the ice bin.\nManufacturers have found a way to speed up the harvest cycle by introducing a mechanical component that pushes the ice away from the evaporator after the plate has become warm enough to release it. This process shortens the ice making cycle, meaning you can produce a higher volume of ice in a given period of time compared to ice makers without the technology. A harvest assist mechanism can also help conserve energy, since running the mechanism that pushes ice off of the evaporator requires less electricity than running the compressor in reverse long enough to melt the ice until it is loose enough to fall from the plate under the force of gravity alone.\nOutside of the Food Zone\nOther ice machine parts that it pays to understand are the ones responsible for the refrigeration cycle. The most vital of these is the compressor, which is the component that controls the flow of refrigerant through the system so it can remove heat from inside the unit and exhaust it into the air outside the machine. Another important component of the refrigeration system is the condenser. The same way the evaporator removes heat from inside the ice machine to create cold conditions, the condenser dumps that heat outside the machine.\nAs long as you stick to the ice machine maintenance and cleaning schedule outlined by the manufacturer, the refrigeration components should give you very little trouble. Really, the only component that requires regular attention is the air filter that protects the condenser from collecting dust and debris. That component must be kept clean to ensure that air can flow freely across the condenser to remove heat from the machine's refrigerant. Condensers that aren't shielded by an air filter should be cleaned with a dry soft-bristled brush during your regular ice machine cleaning routine."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12518fe4-25c7-425e-b8a7-0cb99c0acf75>","<urn:uuid:42044e24-910d-4e9b-b320-21a06fad6823>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a diversity researcher, I'm curious: How do the biases in angel investing compare to those in regular workplace evaluations when it comes to gender discrimination?","answer":"Both contexts show similar patterns of gender bias. In angel investing, women-led ventures are viewed as having less legitimacy by predominantly male investors, despite no actual difference in legitimacy across ventures. Similarly, in workplace evaluations, studies show that women need to perform in the top 10% of their peer group to be evaluated comparably to men, while average-performing men are 33% more likely to be preferred over similarly performing women. These biases persist even when controlling for other factors, as demonstrated by studies like the computer naming experiment where identical computers were valued 35% higher when given male names versus female names.","context":["PurposeWomen-led companies receive less than 5 per cent of early-stage equity investment. This paper aims to explore the disparity in equity funding between men- and women-led companies, using a social identity perspective, complemented by insights from signaling theory. We argue that in the angel group context, which is male-dominated, gender stereotypes may bias angels’ interpretation of the signals sent by entrepreneurs, so that entrepreneurial ventures led by men are more favorably evaluated, thus excluding women entrepreneurs from funding. The ideas are tested on a sample of 358 entrepreneurs who applied for funding from a northeast US angel group using perceptual data from both sides of the investment dyad. Findings suggest that angel investors view women-led entrepreneurial ventures as having less legitimacy, even though we see no difference in actual legitimacy across ventures.Design/methodology/approachThe ideas are tested on a sample of 358 entrepreneurs who applied for funding from a northeast angel group using perceptual data from both sides of the investment dyad.FindingsThe findings suggest that, in the context of angel investing, there is a subtle bias that follows from the perceived stereotype between being female and the ability to lead a legitimate new venture. Thus, this study tests the tenets of the social identity theory by finding that mostly male angel investors act in accordance to their gender prescribed roles when they evaluate businesses presented by women entrepreneurs providing some evidence of “in-group” and “out-group” effects and stereotypes.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings continue the conversation about biases toward women in early-stage financing by using a social identity lens to look at the way in which adopted identities lead to particular outcomes and stereotypes. The authors have used the context of angel investing to test these ideas, finding some support for their contention that gender is pivotal when angels are making investment decisions. For researchers, this study suggests that gender should not be used solely as a control variable, but instead should be the focus of the inquiry itself.Practical implicationsFor practitioners, this study reminds women seeking angel investment that they are not playing on a level field and so they should do all that they can to enhance the legitimacy of themselves and their ventures.Originality/valueThe authors contend that within an angel group that is composed of predominantly men, role stereotypes of entrepreneurs as masculine will be expected, therefore creating gender biases against women. The authors expect these biases, whether conscious or unconscious, will lead the angel investors to evaluate men entrepreneurs more favorably than women entrepreneurs as they move through the angel investment process. Therefore, for women entrepreneurs in the early stages of investment funding, the authors posit that the dearth of funding is a function of gender identity stereotypes which may be manifested in hidden and often unconscious biases on the part of the angel investor.\nInternational Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship – Emerald Publishing\nPublished: Jun 11, 2018\nIt’s your single place to instantly\ndiscover and read the research\nthat matters to you.\nEnjoy affordable access to\nover 18 million articles from more than\n15,000 peer-reviewed journals.\nAll for just $49/month\nQuery the DeepDyve database, plus search all of PubMed and Google Scholar seamlessly\nSave any article or search result from DeepDyve, PubMed, and Google Scholar... all in one place.\nGet unlimited, online access to over 18 million full-text articles from more than 15,000 scientific journals.\nRead from thousands of the leading scholarly journals from SpringerNature, Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford University Press and more.\nAll the latest content is available, no embargo periods.\n“Hi guys, I cannot tell you how much I love this resource.

Alyson Colón along with Sarah Kaplan, keynote speaker of the upcoming Radical Change Summit, explain why they believe that the solution will be innovation.\nBy Sarah Kaplan and Alyson Colón\nIt has become quite common for business leaders and even non-profit organizations and politicians to make the business case for diversity. There are many bases for this argument: whether highlighting the promise of better financial performance when boards of directors are more gender balanced, or arguing that firms will miss out in the war for talent, or worrying about the reputational and financial costs of sexual harassment and discrimination.\nAt face value, the business case for diversity has promise. If an organization can argue that an intervention will bring both social and monetary benefit, all the better. But equity initiatives predicated on the business case argument may place the fight for equality on tenuous ground. That is, if the benefits of diversity are couched in economic terms, then diversity initiatives will face resistance if these benefits are perceived to have not been realized.\nWhen diversity initiatives are thus grounded in a business case, it may not be surprising that backlash movements respond in kind, arguing that prioritizing diversity is bad for business. Take for example, a Board Director’s comment to me recently. He said, “Well, we added a woman to our board last year and haven’t seen any improvement in our financials.” Or, look at the now famous memo by Google’s James Damore that circulated widely through social media this past summer. In it, he claimed that Google had discriminated against its (white male) employees by implementing diversity-friendly protocols. Damore argued that biological differences were to blame for gendered disparities in employment and pay, and that women were biologically predisposed to weaknesses like “neuroticism” that made them poorly suited to the challenging work environment. While Google’s response was swift – Damore was subsequently fired for violating the company’s code of conduct – we can understand Damore’s memo as representing a form of resistance to the business case for diversity.\nDamore’s brand of backlash relies on the fallacy of gender essentialism: the idea that rigid gender differences exist between men and women and, in Damore’s case, that these essential differences make women inferior candidates to men for certain jobs. Arguments that use gender essentialism to justify the differences we see between men’s and women’s work and careers often fail to account for the role of bias – as it is embedded in our brains and also in organizational processes and practices.\nWe know from a massive body of research that we nearly all carry gender bias, and that this bias can lead to the devaluation of women’s contributions in masculinized contexts (such as the workplace). We know that this plays out in the evaluation of entrepreneurial ventures founded by women relative to those founded by men: study after study shows that women are less likely to receive venture capital funding. It is also true in career trajectories: women are less likely to receive interview call-backs, less likely to be promoted and often receive lower raises and bonuses. For example, a study showed that women need to perform at the top 10% of their peer group to be evaluated comparably to men, while average-performing men are 33% more likely to be preferred over similarly performing women.\n“A study showed that women need to perform at the top 10% of their peer group to be evaluated comparably to men, while average-performing men are 33% more likely to be preferred over similarly performing women.”\nNow, if you were to listen to people like James Damore, you could argue that this is because of some kind of essential difference between men and women. But, we also know from research that this bias plays out even when controlling for these biological differences. Take, for example, a study that asked a group of people to perform tasks on a computer; one group completed tasks on a computer named James, and the other group on a computer named Julie. The computers were otherwise identical. After the tasks were completed, participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. Participants reported that the computers performed equally, but when asked how much they thought the computers were worth, participants thought that James was worth 35% more than Julie.\nThese studies poke holes in the myth of meritocracy: the widely held belief that the most qualified will rise to the top. The myth of meritocracy persists, not only because it absolves organizations from addressing discrimination concerns, but also because those who are in positions of power and authority want to believe that they arrived there on their merit alone. We all want to believe that our accomplishments are the results of our hard work, and therefore it is difficult for people to admit that some form of privilege has come into play in their own careers. The irony of the business case for diversity is that those in positions of privilege will want to double down on the status quo in order to protect their own jobs or own sense of accomplishment. Backlash may actually be exacerbated by the business case.\nThis evidence suggests that the best way to confront inequality may not necessarily be through a business case, but rather through a better understanding of the bias embedded in our processes and practices and how to change it. But how do we confront bias and undertake the seemingly insurmountable challenge of changing its impact on our work and decisions?\nAt the Institute for Gender and the Economy, we think the answer lies in innovation. Think about it. All organizations allocate resources – money and top talent – to innovation and expect it to result in disruptions and organizational change. Why not do the same with questions of diversity? This is the new conversation we could be having – turning diversity challenges into innovation challenges.\nWe are just at the beginning of seeing the potential of innovation for inclusion. The startup Textio is using machine learning to eliminate bias from job ads – where masculine words dissuade women from applying to postings. GapJumpers, replicating the results of blind symphony auditions that led to a radical increase in the percentage of female musicians in orchestras, innovates in hiring processes by disguising the gender identity of job applicants before they perform a job relevant test. Firms are experimenting with “neutralizing” their promotion criteria. Others are changing the job definitions, even for Boards of Directors, so that they include a broader range of candidates for positions. Amazon has recently announced an innovative new parental leave policy that includes the second parent, and using the Leave Share program, even when that parent doesn’t work at Amazon.\n“Think about it. All organizations allocate resources – money and top talent – to innovation and expect it to result in disruptions and organizational change. Why not do the same with questions of diversity? This is the new conversation we could be having – turning diversity challenges into innovation challenges.”\nAs with any form of innovation, these innovations will require organizational change. And, one thing we know about change is that it can be uncomfortable. Research shows that working with people that are different than you can lead to problems like greater perceived interpersonal conflict, lower communication, and less cohesion. If we want to confront bias and create change, it will inevitably involve some discomfort. But research has shown that discomfort is an integral element of the creative process. As Professor Katherine Phillips, writes in her article for Scientific American “How Diversity Makes Us Smarter,” “This is how diversity works: by promoting hard work and creativity; by encouraging the consideration of alternatives…The pain associated with diversity can be thought of as the pain of exercise. You have to push yourself to grow your muscles. The pain, as the old saw goes, produces the gain.”\nMaking the business case for diversity implies to some that achieving equality has only upsides and that there won’t necessarily be any conflict or struggle in getting there. But, experience shows that to get where we want to go, we will have to become comfortable with discomfort, comfortable with innovation, comfortable with change. We will need to see how we are all embedded in systems that reproduce bias, and how we all benefit from privilege in some form or another. And, having the often-difficult conversations about these issues will open up all sorts of innovative ideas for achieving equality.\nSarah Kaplan is Director, Institute for Gender and the Economy (GATE), and a Distinguished Professor at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.

{"question":"How do high-pressure system winds differ between the Great Basin region and the Adriatic coast in terms of their daily patterns?","answer":"In the Great Basin region, high-pressure systems create Santa Ana winds that flow clockwise and outward from the center, moving consistently toward the California coast where lower pressure exists. In contrast, on the Adriatic coast, winds like Bura that come from high pressure systems show distinct daily patterns - they typically weaken around midday due to sun radiation (what Split seamen call taking a lunch break), strengthen again in the afternoon, and reach their maximum force in early evening hours and at dawn. This daily cycle is not mentioned as a characteristic of the Santa Ana winds.","context":["With California currently experiencing wildfires, and a large amount of California under an “elevated” risk for fire weather, it is important to understand some of the key factors that help fuel these fires. One of the most notorious factors is the Santa Ana winds. These winds are different from wind patterns that occur in other places of North America.\nThe Santa Ana winds are also known as katabatic winds (which are found in places like Greenland) meaning that they originate from higher elevations and flow downhill to lower elevations bringing the air with them. Specifically, Santa Ana winds originate from high pressure systems over the Great Basin, which spans from eastern California to New Mexico, and as north as Wyoming and Idaho. The Great Basin has a very dry climate, which helps fuel these winds.\nFor Santa Ana winds to form, a high pressure system over the Great Basin is needed. High pressure systems are clockwise anticyclonic winds with wind flow spreading out from the center. A basic diagram is included below to help you understand the flow of motion.\n(Image from weather.gov)\nThese winds will then flow towards lower pressure, which is usually located off the California coast. The cool, dry air will flow outwards and eventually downwards towards California. When these air masses descend, through compression, the air warms. For every 1,000 ft that the air descends, the air warms by approximately 5-degree F. This makes for the winds that are now flowing towards parts of California to be very hot and very dry. These air masses that are descending and warming rapidly lead to a very hot and dry air mass that is then pushed over regions of Southern California. During the time of the year that Santa Ana winds occur, Southern California is experiencing some of the hottest temperatures that they see all year round. This air mass makes the air even hotter and drier.\nWhen thinking of fire, there are certain “ingredients” needed to help sustain a fire. You need a fuel source, heat, and oxygen. The fuel source in California wildfires is the vegetation on the ground, such as, brush, shrubs, and trees. Since there is no way to stop the oxygen input into a wildfire, the next variable ingredient is the heat input. These Santa Ana winds are bringing along a very hot and dry air mass to the region, which helps fuel the fire even more. They add more heat to the fires, and the winds push the fires into different regions and communities.\nWhen you add the Santa Ana winds to the California wildfires, the wildfires will become a greater threat. Thankfully, the U.S. Forest Service and firefighters are there to help mitigate the risks of these fires. Also, it is important to listen to the U.S. Forest Service and the National Weather Service to understand if your community is at risk and precautions to take. If your area isn’t at risk of wildfires, there are many different ways that you can help support people who are affected. The American Red Cross is a life-saving organization that helps many people who are affected by these wildfires.\nTo learn more about fire weather, be sure to click here!\nCredits: Weather.gov and UAlbany\n©2019 Weather Forecaster Allison Finch","Daily weather forecast gives Radio Zagreb or marine radio posts: ''Split radio'', “Dubrovnik radio'' and ''Rijeka radio“.

In the Croatian Adriatic sea we have different kinds of winds. Please find below a little explanation about the most common winds in this area.\nParagraphs from the book\n\"Sailing and Nautical skills\" by Emil Tomasevic\nAll rights reserved\nTRAMONTANA, also called tramuntana and tremontana, is a strong northern to northwestern (in wider Split area) wind generated by passing of the cold frontal over the Adriatic. Of rather short duration – usually after a single day it turns into bura – tramontana arrives suddenly and very soon reaches stormy force, causing gales and very rough seas.\nBURA is a dry, very cold northern (from NNE to ENE) wind character ised by violent gusts. A katabatic (from Greek: going downhill) wind,it blows over the slopes of coastal mountains (such as Velebit and Biokovo) bringing cold air that – due to its weight accelerates and hits the sea with gale force, spreading in form of a fan (like fingers!),causing a lot of troubles, especially to inexperienced sailors because of its strong blows and rapid change of direction. Around midday, with warming of the air by sun radiation, it weakens – Split seamen say that bura takes a lunch break – but in the afternoon it gets stronger again (when it wakes up and enjoys coffee!), reaching its biggest force in early evening hours and again at dawn. Usually “announced” by thin white clouds (caps) over the summits of coastal mountains, bura leaves you little time to escape or prepare (to reef the sails) before you meet its first stroke. Bura creates very unpleasant short, but considerably high waves with lots of foam and spray, making breathing hardly possible, so that a man overboard, even with his/her life vest on, has scarce chances to survive unless promptly recovered (which is a very demanding operation due to scarce visibility). Along the Adriatic coast bura has its “favourite”regions where it is both intense and frequent, such as the Gulf of Trieste, the Kvarner Gulf, Velebit Channel, wider Šibenik area, the Kaštela Bay, Makarska and surroundings Žuljana cove on the Pelješac peninsula. Further from the coast, bura gains in directional regularity, but force as well, so in the aquatorium of the Palagruža islet it reaches stormy strength. Bura is much weaker along the western Adriatic coast, but it still can be dangerous because there are no natural safe havens with exception of the Manfredonia area,to south of the Gargano peninsula. In the winter season bura lasts up to two weeks, oscillating in force and bringing cold rainfall or even snow (cyclonal, also called the dark bura).\nTHE ADRIATIC EASTERLY, OR LEVANT is a cold wind that usually brings clouds and rainfall. Similar to bura in that it brings low temperatures (though as prone to gusts), and to jugo (by its regularity),levanat is a winter wind frequent in the February-March period,when it can reach stormy force and last for many days. Although good for sailing, due to its force, levanat is not popular in the sailing community because of the cold weather it brings. This wind should not be confused with the summer morning breeze also blowing from E (as podsunčan, a light thermal wind which in the early afternoon hours turns into maestral).\nCIROCCO is a strong and warm wind, blowing from ESE to SSE, bringing abundant rainfall. It is more frequent in the south Adriatic area, generally characterised by strength and very rough seas. A rare all-year-round Adriatic wind, jugo reaches its maximum strength after two or three days of constant blowing, when – in the autumn months in the south Adriatic, and in the springtime in the north Adriatic area – it often turns stormy and creates the biggest waves of this closed area. Of variable duration – usually lasting for three days, but sometimes (in the winter season) a whole week – jugo has its favourite playgrounds: from Dubrovnik to the mouth of the Boka Kotorska Bay and in the wider area of the Kamenjak Cape (southern tip of the Istrian peninsula), as well as open seas of the Mid-Adriatic.\nCYCLONAL SCIROCCO is a moderate to strong wind, sometimes reaching stormy force, blowing from ESE to SE, caused by a cyclone progressing from the west Mediterranean into the Adriatic area,bring heavy clouds and a lot of rainfall. Mostly generated by secondary cyclones in the Bay of Genoa cyclonal JUGO reaches north Adriatic first and then spreads southwards, gradually losing strength. Easy to “read” in advance, by misty horizon, progressive development of cloud systems, air pressure fall, acceleration of the sea current, high tides. Cyclonal jugo is the most frequent variation of south wind in the Adriatic area.\nANTI-CYCLONAL SCIROCCO is a rather rare springtime or autumn wind generated by a deep cyclone over north and northwest Europe and an anti-cyclone over the east Mediterranean. Typically this kind of wind will be accompanied by a slightly misty sky with rare high clouds moving fast from WSW, dry air, high temperatures and only will it reach stormy force. But, as old seamen would say: You should watch both the cloudy bura and the fair jugo! Anti-cyclonal jugo is everything but predictable, while škura (dark) bura hits suddenly,making navigation almost impossible because of its equally unpredictable force changes.\nOŠTRO is a rather moderate wind blowing from S, thermal by genesis that “follows the sun” and precedes maestral. With global climate changes and summer maestral losing regularity, oštro (its weak variation also called oštrin) sometimes keeps blowing all day long, until sunset.\nLIBECCIO is a SS W to WSW mostly winter wind of short duration,but generating extremely rough seas and bringing abundant rainfall.\nAnnounced by extremely high tides, lebić also causes poor visibility.\nIt is generated by passing of a cyclone eye over the continental part of Croatia and progression of a cold frontal; a deep depression over the north Adriatic causes a strong southwest wind, air pressure fall and unstable cloud systems – that swiftly turn into stormy west wind. Such an occurrence in the summer months causes a very dangerous abrupt gale called garbin or garbinada, inevitably causing damage on boats and on the shore.\nPONENTE is a local Dalmatian name for a westerly wind more frequent\nand stronger in the north than in the south Adriatic area. It progresses in several rather unusual phases: first, the western sky is fair, there’s practically no wind, the sea is calm… then a curtain of heavy clouds comes from the west, covering the open sea islands, after short wind gusts there’s a calm again – soon followed by a very strong wind creating high and long waves, extremely unpleasant and dangerous, especially in the longitudinal channels. Pulenat, as a typical storm wind, should be well respected and feared!\nMISTRAL is a constant mostly thermal Adriatic wind, best beloved by the leisure sailing community, once upon the time so regular that watches could be wound by its appearance. Generated by seasonal etesian NW air streams and local thermal effects, maestral usually appears with the coastal land getting warm and causing fall of pressure due to rising of the lighter air – substituted then by colder air steaming above the sea. Having been born as zmorac (oštrin) at about 9 to 10 in the morning, it suddenly collapses around noontime and regenerates soon as a pretty strong westerly to northwesterly wind, depending upon configuration of the coastal range.It reaches its peak at about 2 in the afternoon, then gradually collapses– with a typical “last stroke” around 5 in the afternoon.\nMaestral gets stronger from the Bay of Trieste to the Otranto strait,where it can reach gale force, always leaving high “dead” waves very unpleasant to navigate over.\nA very strong maestral is locally called maestralun that sometimes continues all the night through.

{"question":"What are the physical properties of diamonds, and what is their metaphysical significance in ancient traditions?","answer":"Physically, diamonds are the hardest mineral, made of crystalline carbon. They are graded based on the 4 C's: Carat (mass), Clarity (absence of inclusions/blemishes), Color (D-Z scale), and Cut (proportions, symmetry, polish). Metaphysically, diamonds were seen as the epitome of refined earth, representing the highest perfection of the earthly body. They were associated with consciousness and enlightenment, symbolized as the philosopher's stone or lapis philosophorum. The diamond's transparency was particularly significant, as it represented earth becoming transparent like water while maintaining its hardness and incorruptibility.","context":["Children’s Dreams: Notes from the Seminar Given in 1936-1940 (\nAs a matter of fact, it does have something to do with consciousness. Could you give more details about it?\nThe transparent stone refers to the diamond. It is refined earth, the epitome of refined earth.\nThe earth is dark, gloomy, nontransparent, and starts to become transparent in the stone.\nAlthough the stone is earth, hardest earth, it assumes the character of transparent water.\nWe speak of a diamond “of the first water.”\nBecause of its transparency, the philosopher’s stone is also called vitrum aureum (the golden glass) or vitrum malleabile (the malleable glass).\nIn the Book of Revelation it says that the streets of the new Jerusalem were like golden glass\nSo it is the same idea as in alchemy—that the earth had been transformed into a transparent, waterlike, yet hard and imperishable, incorruptible structure.\nTherefore, the philosopher’s stone is the expression of the highest perfection of the earthly body, and, therefore, you also find the idea that the lapis philosophorum is man himself, that is, his corpus glorificatum, his body at the Resurrection.\nThis immortal body is the subtle body that had left the physical body and is beyond corruption.\nThe diamond, the hardest mineral, is synonymous with the lapis philosophorum.\nThis is ancient metaphysics, old speculation in symbolic form.\nWhat does this mean psychologically?\nIt was mentioned that the diaphanitas and the stoniness, the inelasticity, could have to do with the nature of consciousness.\nYou can find this connection in the old texts of alchemy, the idea, that is, that the stone is the product of a mental operation, the equivalent, so to speak, of enlightenment.\nTherefore the stone says in a Hermetic text: “I create the light, the light that is greater than all other lights in the world.”\nSo what is actually meant is a phenomenon of consciousness, a product of human effort, and at the same time a donum gratiae, a gift of God’s grace.\nIt is always stressed that it is impossible to do it on one’s own, it can only be given per gratiam dei, but man still has to make the effort to make this structure.\nIt originally was a head, that is, a consciousness that was in the head.\nIt is symbolized as the head of Osiris that was washed ashore from the sea and venerated by the women of Byblos.\nThis severed head, the so-called round element, is the epitome of perfection.\nA consciousness has crystallized that is imperturbable, a detached consciousness, characterized by wholeness (represented by roundness).\nIn the legend of Perseus, too, we find this idea, in the severed head of the Gorgon.\nHere, roundness is linked to the mortification of the mother.\nYes, quite right. In the stars you find the constellation of Perseus with the Gorgon’s head above the sign of Taurus.\nThe great Gorgon’s head is the horrible face entwined by snakes; it is the face of the past in front of which we are petrified.\nThe fear it provokes can be traced back to the fear of the devouring mother, the horror of this; for this face can turn you into dead earth again.\nThis danger was averted by Perseus by cutting the Gorgon’s throat with a fiery sword, a diamond sword.\nThis would mean that the danger is averted by the intervention of consciousness, of thinking; because it was an act of consciousness that detached him from that horror.\nWhen the flood of blackness is later inundating him again, he can free himself from it, because he cut the head of the horrible mother.\nYou find a similar standpoint in the philosophy of the Upanishads; the knowledge about Atman liberates from the law of the earth.\nSo the head is that round thing, originally hidden in matter, that Zosimos called the Omega element.\nThat’s why the ancient philosophers called themselves “children of the golden head.”\nThis was the opposite of the caput mortuum or caput corvi,which is the sediment that precipitates, or the opposite of nigredo.\nThis caput aureum, however, is the end product of the process.\nIt is also round, it is the wholeness, and it is a transparent stone. ~Carl Jung, Children’s Dreams Seminar, Pages 221-223.","Beginners Guide to Diamonds\nA diamond by definition is made of crystalline carbon, known to be the hardest mineral. It has many uses as a gemstone in abrasives, cutting tools, and other applications. A natural diamond crystal is called a rough. The practice of changing a diamond rough into a faceted gem is called diamond cutting. After a diamond is cut, it is submitted to a gem lab for grading.\nLike a human fingerprint, no two diamonds are the same. Each diamond contains its own unique traits and characteristics. Diamonds are characterized by four main features (The 4 C’s): Carat, Clarity, Color and Cut.\nThe 4 C’s\nThe Carat weight measures the mass of a diamond (not to be confused with the measure of size). Diamonds are divided into 100 points. 100 points = 1 carat.\nDiamonds may naturally have inclusions and blemishes. Grading is based on how visible these characteristics are. A diamond with a Flawless grading (FL) has no inclusions or natural blemishes. A diamond with a Slight Inclusion (SI1-2) has slight characteristics that can be seen under 10X magnification.\nA diamond’s color is graded on a scale from D to Z, which D being colorless and Z as yellow.\nCut is measured by a diamond’s proportions, symmetry and polish. Diamonds that have optimized proportions, symmetry and polish will have better interaction with light; this results in better brilliance, fire and scintillation of a diamond. The cut grading range is determined from Excellent to Poor.\nOften, how a diamond is cut is the determining factor in the performance of a diamond. There are many methods to how a diamond can be cut. The most popular shape is the 58 facet round brilliant. Other brands have perfected their own cutting method (see Brands section).\nHow to Pick Your Diamond\nDiamonds come in a variety of shapes. Different shapes have different characteristics and quality. Some characteristics are valued more in some shapes than others.\nChoose your diamond shape:\nCarat, Cut, Clarity, Color\nDetermine what kind of characteristics you want your diamond to have. Pricing is determined by the combination of characteristics you choose.\nOther Diamond Characteristics\nFluorescence – The fluorescence scale on a grading lab is determined from None to Very Strong. It is based upon a diamond’s effect to UV Lighting. In 95% percent of diamonds that exhibit fluorescence, the color is blue. According to studies, there has been no link between the appearance of a diamond and the strength of its fluorescence.\nDepth % The ratio of the total depth of the diamond (from table to culet) to the total diameter. For example, if the total depth of a round diamond is 4.00mm and the total diameter is 6.60mm, then the depth percentage is 60.6%. In most cases the depth % is rated:\n- Excellent = 60.1 - 62%\n- Good = 62 - 64%\n- Fair = 64 - 66%\n- Poor = over 66% / under 60%\nFancy Cuts (Princess, radiant, emerald) = 70 - 75% is acceptable\nTable % The ratio of the table width to the total width of the diamond. In most cases the table % is rated:\n- Ideal = 53 – 58%\n- Excellent = 58.1 – 60%\n- Good = 60.1 – 64%\n- Fair = 64 – 70%\n- Poor = over 70%\nFancy Cuts (Princess, radiant, emerald) = 75 - 80% is acceptable\nThere are several diamond grading labs in the world. Every loose diamond sold at Carat & Co. will come with a GIA (Gemological Institute of America) or AGSL (American Gem Society Laboratories) certificate. These two laboratories are amongst the world’s most respected in their field, giving an unbiased, professional examination of your diamond. The diamond grading report will include your certificate number, diamond grading, and in some reports, a drawing of your diamond inclusions and blemishes. Before you buy your diamond, request for the diamond grading report and make sure your certificate number matches the laser inscription on your diamond.\nHearts on Fire – The World’s Most Perfectly Cut Diamond®.\nWe proudly offer Hearts on Fire serialized diamonds.

{"question":"Idaho's territoire et mining rights - comment ont-ils shaped the state's development and modern environmental policies?","answer":"During the 27-year territorial period, Idaho established foundational elements that continue to influence the state, including its public schools, highways, and water rights systems. The territory's creation was largely influenced by gold rushes and mining activities. This historical connection between mining and development continues to affect modern environmental policies, as demonstrated by the 2019 South Fork Payette River case, where federal authorities had to balance mining rights against recreational and environmental interests. The judge ultimately prohibited placer mining along 10 miles of river to protect existing economic activities, wildlife, and scenic values, showing how Idaho now prioritizes environmental and recreational concerns over mining in certain cases.","context":["Get Territorial: Idaho at 150\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Territorial History\nI thought we commemorated the Idaho centennial a few years ago. How can it be the sesquicentennial already?\nIn 1990, Idaho commemorated the centennial of statehood. But Idaho became a territory on March 4, 1863, and 2013 marks the 150th anniversary.\nThe territorial period was a long time ago. How do events from that period affect me today?\nA case could be made that the 27-year territorial era was the most important period in Idaho history in terms of shaping the state we know today. Do you drive on Idaho’s main highways? Did you attend Idaho public schools? Do you pay county taxes? Did you find it surprising in the 1990s that the U.S. Supreme Court granted ownership of part of Lake Coeur d’Alene to the Coeur d’Alene Tribe? Have you wondered why Idaho has three state universities? Have you found it curious that many northern Idahoans refer to their part of the state as North Idaho, when no other region uses such capitalization? Have you ever voted for a Supreme Court justice? Do you have irrigation water rights? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you are living with the result of decisions made during Idaho’s territorial period.\nIdaho looked like a rectangle when it became a territory. How did it get its present odd shape?\nOriginally, Idaho consisted of all of Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming, an unwieldy land mass. Much of this area had been part of Washington Territory, and Idaho was created because western Washington politicians wanted to discard vast tracks of land to the east which were gaining population due to gold rushes. This action would leave a more compact Washington Territory—and help to assure that Olympia would remain as its capital. When Idaho’s first territorial legislature met in Lewiston in 1863, one delegate from present-day Montana, unwilling to venture across the Bitterroots in winter, instead journeyed overland to California and then by boat up the Pacific and the Columbia and Snake rivers to the proceedings. Not surprisingly, those first legislators unanimously petitioned Congress to reduce the size of the territory to make it more governable, not to mention easier to get around. In 1864, Montana broke away, and in 1868, Wyoming left, leaving Idaho with its jagged panhandle in the north and a nearly straight-edged boundary with Wyoming in the east. Check out this fact sheet for more information on Idaho's territorial maps.\nWhy is Idaho’s capitol in Boise?\nBy the time of the creation of Idaho Territory, much of the population had already shifted away from gold diggings in the Clearwater region to the Boise Basin. Just like that legislator who traveled to California to get to Idaho’s capital in 1863, lawmakers found it increasingly difficult to get to Lewiston, since most of them lived far away. During their second session in 1864, legislators voted to move the capitol to Boise, a controversial move that some believed was illegal. But subsequent legal rulings confirmed Boise as the capitol.\nThe move of the capitol from Lewiston to Boise was controversial. Once the capitol moved, did regional controversies subside?\nHardly. In 1878, 96 percent of northern Idaho voters approved a proposal that would have united the panhandle with Washington. In 1887, a measure to do just that passed both houses of Congress; only a pocket veto by President Grover Cleveland retained Idaho as we now know it. To help mollify the north, the Idaho constitution created the University of Idaho at Moscow, and Congress created Latah County, the only county in the United States formed by an act of Congress. For many years, relationships between many eastern Idaho residents and the rest of the territory were also strained, but for religious rather than geographical reasons. In 1884, the territorial legislature passed the Idaho Test Oath, which essentially disenfranchised members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who then mostly lived in the southeast. This policy, ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court and codified in the state constitution, endured into the 1890s, after Idaho became a state.\nWhat happened to the Indians who were living in Idaho when it became a territory?\nIdaho’s Indian people were here long before the territorial period, and they still remain, part of the vibrant and diverse fabric that makes up Idaho of the 21st century. But the territorial period was traumatic for Idaho’s tribes. The 1863 Nez Perce Treaty drastically shrank tribal lands, giving rise to discontent that led to the 1877 Nez Perce War. Southwestern Idaho tribal members were uprooted to reservations at Fort Hall and the Duck Valley. The Coeur d’Alenes had to relinquish most of their ancestral homeland.\nWhat was the most significant event during the territorial period?\nThe most important event of the territorial era occurred in the summer of 1889 when 72 men met in Boise to write a constitution for what would become, the following year, the State of Idaho. Though it has been amended, that document remains basically as it was written nearly 125 years ago, the foundation for all Idaho laws; the tie that binds together our diverse state.\nIf I wanted to visit some sites in Idaho relating to the territorial period, where could I go?\nThere are hundreds of sites dating from the territorial period.

Roughly 40,000 people visit the river near Lowman annually to enjoy the water and surroundings.\nThis past week federal administrative law judge Andrew S. Pearlstein prohibited mining along 10 miles of the South Fork Payette, determining that the risk to existing economic and recreational activities outweighed the potential benefits of mining development:\n“After hearing, I have concluded that the great preponderance of the evidence shows that placer mining would substantially interfere with other uses of the land within the claims and adjacent to them along the River, particularly uses involving recreation (kayaking, rafting, and camping), fisheries, cultural resources, and scenic values. These other uses have far greater economic and unquantifiable values than any potential value that could be derived from placer mining the claims. Therefore, in this Decision I conclude that placer mining should be completely prohibited on all the subject claims.”\nIn 2017, two mining companies filed for 35 placer mining claims in and along the South Fork Payette to seek gold in sand and gravel deposits. The claims spanned 10 miles upstream of Lowman, encompassing most of the popular whitewater stretch from the Helende Campground down to the Mountain View Campground, as well as above and below Kirkham Hot Springs. Proposed mining operations included suction dredging the riverbed or excavating trenches or pits in the banks and terraces.\nWhile the U.S. Forest Service manages surface resources for the public, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has jurisdiction over mining claims. Under the Mining Law of 1872, once the BLM has granted a mining claim, the Forest Service cannot prohibit mining and can only seek to minimize the environmental impacts of mining operations. However, this area of the South Fork Payette was previously withdrawn from mineral entry because of its potential for hydroelectric power development. The area was reopened to mining under the Mining Claims Rights Restoration Act of 1955 but – unlike the Mining Law of 1872 – this law allows for the consideration of existing uses that could be negatively affected by placer mining activities.\nWhen the mining companies filed for the placer claims, the Forest Service became concerned about how mining activities could affect the many outstanding values of the South Fork of the Payette and associated economic activities. The Forest Service requested that the BLM suspend mining operations until the BLM held a hearing to consider these existing uses.\nThe Administrative Law Judge for the BLM accepted several days of testimony from local community members, Forest Service specialists, and the claimants. The judge also considered over 400 comments from the public, all of which were opposed to mine development. On March 4, 2019, the judge ruled that mining activities would substantially interfere with other existing uses and completely prohibited placer mining on all the claims.\nLocal residents, businesses and conservationists who were gratified by the decision:\n“This is a win for not only the Lowman economy and recreation but for mother nature as well!” said Ginger Glaccum with the Payette River Company. “The Lowman area is finally showing some vitality after the ’89 fire. It would have been terrible to lose this wild and scenic area that is flourishing so much.”\nLisa Chambers, who owns the Haven Hot Springs in Lowman with her husband, said, “This is a win for every person and creature who enjoys or depends on the Payette as is, from rafters, river guides and hot springs soakers to trout, otters and osprey. The community of Lowman is finally recovering from the catastrophic ’89 fire and has certainly avoided a harsh blow.”\n“This is a win for all Idahoans who will continue to be able to experience the outstanding scenic and recreational opportunities the South Fork has to offer,” said Cam Johnson, who owns a cabin next to the river. “This decision ensures that even after I’m gone future generations will be able to experience its beauty and build the types of lasting memories that I have,” continued Johnson.\n“We are thrilled,” said Kenneth Long with Cascade Raft and Kayak. “We value our river and livelihoods. These can’t be easily replaced. This ruling will allow everyone to enjoy the river and keep it available for generations to come.”\n“I am happy that a decision has been made to protect such a beautiful wild and scenic area such as Lowman, said Kevin Courtney, owner of the Lowman Inn. “We all have to realize that we have to protect our natural resources for our future generations.”\n“This decision is an undeniable exhibit of action to preserve and perpetuate the free flowing beauty and treasure of the South Fork of the Payette River,” said Anke and Emil Hutton of Lowman.\n“I am grateful that the judge’s decision reflects values of good stewardship of our river, which supports our wildlife, ecosystem, Lowman community and visitors alike!” said Carol Stockton, owner of Eagle Horizons Mountain Oasis.\n“We are pleased that the judge placed a greater value on the many ecological and recreational benefits of the South Fork Payette River,” said Kevin Lewis of Idaho Rivers United.\n“Folks really came together to support the river and everyone who depends on it,” said John Robison, Public Lands Director with the Idaho Conservation League.\nJohn Robison, Idaho Conservation League, 208-345-6933 x 13\nGinger Glaccum, Payette River Company, 208-720-7039\nKenneth Long, Cascade Raft and Kayak, 208-793-2221"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1dbf3418-c8ad-4881-9cb0-dc254d4fd467>","<urn:uuid:12a77030-2fd5-4588-86a2-8f66c4879502>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm trying to watch my diet - which has more fat content, wild-caught or farm-raised salmon? Really curious about this! 🤔","answer":"Farm-raised salmon has higher fat content than wild-caught salmon. This is because farm-raised fish are more sedentary and are subject to feeding options aimed at fattening them up quickly. In contrast, wild fish are responsible for finding their own food and swim long distances during their life at sea, making them naturally leaner.","context":["In a world where we can get just about any type of food from land or sea delivered from just about anywhere in the world, it can be difficult to keep track of the many purchasing options, as well as the ethics and safety behind them. For example, there is so much talk about whether farm-raised fish is safe or good for the environment, or that wild-caught fish are better tasting and provide more nutrients than their farm-harvested counterparts. It’s far more nuanced than that.\nTo help you out, we’ve decided to take a deeper dive into the issue and figure out what’s healthier — farm-raised or wild-caught fish?\nDefinition of Farm-Raised and Wild-Caught Fish and Seafood\nFirst things first, let’s explain how farm-raised and wild-caught seafood are defined\nFarm-raised fish are commercially raised in controlled pens that exist within lakes, oceans or rivers, as well as fish raised in large tanks. Farm-raised fish are bred to make fish cheaper and more readily available to consumers. As it stands, farm-raised fish makes up about 90% of the fish consumption within the US.\nThe low quality that’s been associated with farmed fish is due in large part to the fact that the salmon are fed a low-quality fish feed that’s a mixture of corn, grains, fish oil and ground up, wild-caught fish. In the case of salmon farming, the fishmeal also includes food coloring, which gives the salmon the pink color we associate with the fish. Because of their limited diet, farmed fish are naturally a sort of gray color. Wild salmon are pink because they eat krill, which gets its color from red algae.\nWild-caught fish are caught by fishermen in their natural habitats — rivers, lakes, oceans, etc. The main benefit of wild salmon is that the fish just eat organisms found in their existing environment, which by nature, is far more diverse than what farmed fish get to eat on a regular basis.\nAdditionally, wild-caught fish have the benefit of not containing antibiotics, as wild fish don’t have the same risk of disease or infection as farmed seafood.\nWhile both types of seafood are generally safe to eat, should you buy them from a reputable dining establishment, supermarket, or better yet, straight from the source.\nRegardless, there are some clear pros and cons associated with both methods. Here’s a deeper look at a few different factors such as nutritional value, environmental impact and more.\nWhat’s Better for Me — Farm-Raised or Wild-Caught?\nBoth options have their advantages as well as drawbacks as far as nutritional content for the consumer:\n- Overall Nutritional Content\nThe nutritional value in wild-caught fish is thought to be much higher than that of the farm-raised variety. Why? Well, for starters, wild fish are out in the wild, eating a diverse range of foods that create a varied blend of nutrients by the time we get the fish.\nFarm-raised fish are generally fed the same crops day in and day out, and they live in a contained environment with no access to the variety of wildlife that’s, well, found in the wild. However, there may be a different set of benefits associated with eating farmed fish, depending on what you need in your diet.\nFarmed salmon, in many cases, may actually be as nutritious as its wild counterparts and, in many cases, can be richer than wild in terms of omega-3s and omega-6s essential fatty acids. Farm-raised fish have more omegas than fish raised in the wild, due to their higher fat content. Wild fish, on the other hand, are bursting with trace minerals found in the oceans.\nAs far as shellfish are concerned, the nutritional difference between say, farmed scallops and wild is minimal. Farming shellfish isn’t very common, but when they are farmed, it’s typically done so in the ocean rather than in separate vessels.\nThere’s also the myth that the color of the fish is a direct reflection of the fish’s nutritional content. That’s not 100% accurate. The color is a reflection of the diet, as well as the type of fish. Wild salmon that eat krill tend to turn pink, as the krill eats red algae. Atlantic salmon is naturally more of a pale orange color, while Sockeye salmon is a deep red. However, if you see a fish that looks dull or very grey, it may be a sign that it isn’t fresh.\n- Mercury Content\nIn general, smaller types of fish may pack the most nutritional bang for their buck as opposed to larger fish. Think sardines, anchovies, herring and shellfish. Larger fish like swordfish, for example, may have a lot of mercury in their blood, and farmed fish may have lower instances of mercury than wild-caught fish. Farmed fish that are raised in the ocean generally have the same amount of mercury in their systems as their free-roaming counterparts.\nIf you’re worried about mercury, look toward shrimp or tuna. Both have very low levels of mercury.\n- Fat Content\nFarm-raised fish are generally subject to some pretty dismal culinary options since the primary goal is to fatten them up in short order. Because these fish don’t get the best food, or the most varied, the fat content of farm fish tends to be higher than wild-caught fish.\nWild fish are responsible for finding their own food and have the ability to swim long distances during their life at sea. For that reason, wild-caught fish tend to be leaner.\n- Overall Freshness\nFarm-raised fish sometimes gets a bad rap for being “fishy.” While it’s an interesting concept that “fishy” is not something you want your fish to taste like, the moniker typically refers to fish that simply haven’t been cleaned properly or handled with the care needed. Ideally, you want your fish to smell like the ocean, not cat food.\nSimilarly, wild-caught fish may be subject to the same fishy flavor fate should they not be handled properly — e.g. not put on ice right away. You should be in the clear at most restaurants with a good reputation. At USS Nemo, we handle all of our dishes, seafood and otherwise, with the utmost care. When shopping for fish, look for higher-end markets that you feel confident are always clean.\n- The Preservative Factor\nFish may be treated with certain preservatives in an effort to make them last longer on grocery store shelves, as well as keep them nice and moist, as though they were caught in the wild. The most common chemical used to do this is called sodium tripolyphosphate, and it makes foods, especially those hailing from the sea look slicker, glossier and more appealing.\nSodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) is kind of a mouthful, and here are some reasons why you may want to keep an eye out for the additive:\n- You’ll find STPP in seafood like shrimp or sea scallops, that generally appear to be soaking in water to keep them fresh before use. The seafood is bathed in STPP, which allows the food to absorb more water than it would without the ingredient, meaning it weighs more at the register than products without the substance.\n- If you’re unsure whether your seafood purchase has been soaked in STPP, you’ll be able to detect its presence if you notice a milky white liquid that comes out when cooking the fish.\n- It’s worth noting that STPP may be considered a neurotoxin if consumed in larger quantities. If you’re concerned about consuming the ingredient, ask your fish monger if you can order your seafood “dry.” “Wet” seafood is an industry term used to indicate whether or not there are phosphates included in the fish for longevity.\nAnother common question when comparing farm-raised fish to wild-caught, is whether or not there’s a difference in taste. The short answer is yes. But, whether one is better tasting than the other can only be determined by personal preferences. For example, we mentioned that farm-raised fish generally has a higher fat content than wild fish — some people prefer leaner cuts, while others appreciate the fatty richness you get in certain salmon.\nWhen considering taste, there’s always the question of whether fresh is better than frozen. In most cases, fresh is always miles ahead of the frozen version of anything — think TV dinners vs. a home-cooked meal, or delivery pizza vs. frozen. However, it’s not exactly the case with fish. Flash freezing wild-caught fish is a great way to maintain straight-from-the-sea flavor all year long — meaning you don’t have to buy farmed fish if your usual isn’t in season.\nWhat’s Better for the Environment — Farm-Raised or Wild-Caught?\nThe big question when it comes to fish and the environment is whether farm-raised fish are better for the environment than wild-caught. For many years, fish farms were synonymous with pollution and poor regard for ocean wildlife.\nPractices such as using open net cages, which are placed in the ocean, can leach chemicals and disease into the ocean, putting ocean wildlife at risk. Plus, farmed fish have been known to escape their pens, meaning they’ll get out and intermingle with wild fish. This doesn’t sound so bad, but farmed fish are at a greater risk for disease and parasites, and as a result, are fed regular cycles of antibiotics — not so good for the natural fish population.\nIn general, seafood is farmed in an effort to keep wild fish populations from being overfished. Stocks of wild salmon are being depleted as a result of both climate change and consumer demand. But, like genetically modified foods, farmed fish is no stranger to controversy. In some cases, fish have been known to escape pens and contaminate a wild fish population. Many farmed fish are genetically modified to reduce the risk of disease and enable more growth in an effort to make more food.\nIn other cases, salmon on farms have been fed other fish, wild fish, that are dangerously low in supply, thereby depleting other species.\nHowever, there are a number of seafood farmers that place an emphasis on sustainability and freshness. These days, fish farmers must adhere to very strict environmental regulations. For example, any water released by a farming operation back into the wild must be as clean, or cleaner, than the water that exists naturally within that habitat. Additionally, wildlife that eat fish, like seals and sea lions, may be attracted to fish farms and can get trapped in dangerous pens.\nSure, there’s the argument that farm-raised fish is simply unnatural and is full of dyes and additives all aimed at making the fish look more palatable on supermarket shelves. And yes, this practice remains — alongside GMO-laden junk food options, added sugar and the whole spectrum of what many food advocates see as wholly unnecessary practices that give American diets a bad rap.\nFarming practices are improving in a lot of ways, though, and new methods are paving the way for a more sustainable future. However, just because times are changing doesn’t mean the fish farming industry has been fully reformed. Ultimately, it comes down to knowing your farmer and just knowing where your food supply comes from in general.\nHow Does Wild-Caught Seafood Impact the Environment?\nWild-caught fish isn’t entirely free from environmental missteps, either. For example, there are many fishing operations that don’t take environmental concerns into account. Certain fish populations have become overfished due to consumer demand, and some fishing practices do little to prevent environmental damage when fishing. It’s true that going into a natural habitat and mining for food poses the risk of decimating the population, but the answer is not as cut and dry as one might assume.\nIf you are concerned about the regulation of wild-caught fish, you’re not alone. In the US, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a set of standards in place in an effort to protect both the marine ecosystem and the fish that inhabit that space.\nIf you’d like to eat wild-caught seafood but are worried about an environmental concern, we’d recommend looking toward less popular wild fish for inspiration — try trout, halibut, mackerel or whatever strikes your fancy for dinner instead of the ubiquitous Alaskan salmon. You’ll challenge your culinary chops and can feel good about your choices.\nWhen dining out, ask the waiter for recommendations, and feel free to ask questions about the food. While a restaurant that doesn’t specialize in seafood may not have all the answers, a good seafood place will know their wild salmon from their yellowtail and sea scallops. They’ll be able point you toward some dishes using less common seafood ingredients or let you know where the fish came from and whether or not it came from a farm. If you have a lot of questions, call ahead before eating at a particular establishment. That way you can get a sense of what to expect before walking in with an empty stomach.\nIf you want to become more aware of how to enjoy seafood more responsibly, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a good resource. Check out their official Seafood Watch site to stay in the know.\nWhat Is the Cost and Availability of Farmed Fish vs. Wild?\nAs you might imagine, farmed fish is generally cheaper than wild-caught, primarily because there’s considerably less consistency in elements beyond human control. Wild fish, being wild, have no standard size or diet, and the supply is limited due to changes in a number of factors like algae blooms, fishing seasons and spawning cycles — all of which can have a significant impact on the price. Farm-raised fish have some more predictable measures in place, which allows the fish to be sold at a consistent price. Scientists can even predict when fish are ready for harvest, as well as figure out when it’s appropriate to increase production to meet demands.\nAvailability is a huge factor in keeping costs down and is sure to have a profound impact on the price of fish. Overfished areas or those subject to inclement weather or shifting currents may yield less wild fish and drive up the price.\nAvoiding Farmed Fish Is More Challenging Than You Think\nNow that we’ve taken a closer look at the clear differences between wild fish and farm-raised, it’s important to note, that while more biodiversity exists in natural fish habitats rather than man-made fish farms, ruling out all farmed seafood isn’t all that easy, particularly if you’re a big seafood fan.\nAgain, as we mentioned, knowing your farmer is the best way to make sure you’re not getting the kind of product that’s been pumped full of antibiotics and fed GMO-based fishmeal. Talk to the people at your farmer’s market, your favorite restaurants or the person in the seafood department at your local market — educating yourself on where your food came from is great no matter what you’re eating. Seafood just adds an extra layer of confusion to the mix since it’s generally not clearly labeled with an organic tag like your produce or even your favorite snack foods.\nBottom Line — Know Where Your Food Comes From\nWhen it all comes down to it, there’s no cut-and-dry answer as to whether or not you should only eat wild-caught fish or give in and turn a blind eye to unsavory farming practices. While it’s great to see that more fish farms are looking toward the future of the planet and adopting greener practices, sustainably caught, wild fish are generally worth the higher price tag, both for nutritional content, as well as flavor.\nGot Fish on the Brain?

You may love salmon, and want to eat more of it, but you’ve heard a lot of bad things about farm-raised salmon and don’t want to pay for wild-caught salmon. Also, you may not even be sure if the wild-caught is worth it: the information out there is conflicting, with just as many sources telling you the farm-raised fish is poison--unhealthy for you and bad for the environment--as there are saying it’s as healthy as the wild-caught.\nIs farm-raised salmon okay, or should you hold out for the wild stuff? Here’s what we found out.\nHow Salmon Is Raised\nIf you understand how salmon is raised, you can make better decisions about eating it. There are two main ways salmon are raised: sea farms and “ranching.” Both methods and conditions can vary greatly, particularly for farmed salmon.\n“Aquaculture” is the official term for the practice of raising fish for human consumption (it also applies to other water creatures such as shrimp, scallops, and clams). For salmon, that usually means being hatched inland in man-made containers. When the fish are mature enough, they get moved to cages in the ocean, where they’re raised until harvesting. These “sea cages” can be huge, up to 350,000 square feet, and they can hold up to 90,000 salmon. Sea farms consist of dozens or even hundreds of these sea cages. The vast majority of them are owned by just a few large aquaculture companies.\nThe world’s largest producers of salmon farmed in sea cages are Norway, Chile, and Scotland. All of these salmon are Atlantic salmon, which are hardy and easy to raise in confinement. The labels “Atlantic,” “Scottish,” and “Norwegian” always mean the salmon is farm-raised.\nAlaska has had a ban on farm-raised salmon since 1989. This is to protect their commercial fishing industry. However, they do allow a method of farming where the fish are hatched and then released into the ocean. When the salmon return to their birthplace to spawn, they are harvested. So when you see the term “Alaskan” or “wild caught” on a package or a menu, it’s possible that even these fish were hatched in confinement.\nProblems With Sea Farms\nAll food production has its problems, and aquaculture is no exception. Farm-raised salmon have higher incidences of diseases and parasites than wild fish because of their dense populations. This means that the fish are given antibiotics and parasite medications, sometimes preventively. Although I found no sources that said these were issues for human consumption, it is unsettling, and may pose concerns yet to come to light.\nThe waste from salmon farming can also cause problems for the ocean ecosystem. Because of the high concentration of the waste, it can harm the coral reef and bottom-dwelling sea creatures. Much like the waste of cattle and chickens, this is a serious environmental issue.\nAnd because the salmon’s diet consists of smaller fish, farm-raised salmon are given feed made primarily from these fish. The needs of salmon farming, as well as those of land animals like cattle and chicken, have brought the population of these small fish to a dangerously low level. The demise of these fish will mean serious problems for wild salmon and tuna, as well as a serious disruption to the marine ecosystem.\nFarm-raised fish can also escape and breed with wild salmon. This is a concern because the farmed fish can spread diseases to the wild ones, and also because their offspring are sterile.\nAnother problem with salmon farming, and perhaps the one most important to consumers, is that it is nearly impossible to know exactly how the fish you see in the market were raised and harvested. Were the fish raised in a low-population density cage or crammed in with thousands of others? Were the fish treated preventively for sea lice whether it needed it or not? Did the fish have a continuous supply of fresh water, minimizing the accumulation of harmful contaminants in its flesh and fat? And finally, was the fish electrocuted, or killed humanely by an instantaneous blow to the head?\nAs with pretty much everything else in the food chain, there is no way to know these things unless you buy directly from a producer. And with fish, this is an even more complicated conundrum than with other farmed animals, because you can’t just choose organically and humanely raised fish like you can chicken or beef. The alternative to farmed fish is wild-caught fish--and wild-caught fish can’t possibly sustain the human population. In fact, most fish species eaten by humans have reached dangerously low population levels in the wild. For this reason, farm-raised salmon seems the most ethical choice for the environment, despite some of the serious problems with aquaculture.\nStricter Standards Are Coming!\nFortunately, aquaculture is moving towards more sustainable farming methods, particularly in Norway. In 2015, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council produced a list of stricter standards for salmon farming. These include a ban on the preventive use of antibiotics, maximum levels of fish-based feed,\nSalmon raised by the stricter standards will be labeled as such. European markets are already selling them, and they should arrive in the United States soon (although the definite dates are unknown at this time).\nThere is also a movement towards offshore aquaculture, where sea cages are placed in deeper water. This reduces the amount of damage done by the fish waste products.\nHow Do I Know If I'm Buying Farm-Raised Salmon?\nAs stated above, sometimes it’s easy to tell what you're buying: all salmon labeled Atlantic, Norwegian, or Scottish are farm-raised. If you're not sure, ask your fishmonger; if he doesn't know, consider buying from a more responsible source.\nAccording to Wikipedia, most salmon from Alaska, Japan, and Russia is wild-caught--although all three producers use fish hatcheries and ranching methods, so most of these salmon are no longer completely wild, either.\nAlso, beware when you eat out: if a menu says “wild” this doesn’t necessarily mean anything. “Wild” can mean to the salmon world what “all-natural” means to the packaged food industry: that is, not much at all. However, if the menu says “wild-caught Alaskan salmon,” this is indicative that the fish was indeed caught in the wild and not farm-raised--although it was most likely hatched in captivity.\nIs Farm-Raised Salmon Genetically Modified?\nNo. Genetically modified salmon that grows much faster with less feed has been created, but it has not been approved for human consumption anywhere in the world.\nNutritional Value and Contaminants\nAll types of salmon are chock full of healthy Omega-3 fatty acids.\nNutrition: Finally, let’s compare the nutritional value and contaminants of wild-caught salmon to farm-raised salmon. According to the highly trusted website, Authority Nutrition, the nutritional profiles of farm-raised and wild caught salmon differ quite a bit. Farm-raised salmon has a higher fat content (and therefore more calories), which makes sense given that farm-raised fish are more sedentary than wild ones. The\nAnd even though the farm-raised salmon has more Omega 6’s than the wild, it is still an excellent source\nThe following chart is from AuthorityNutrition.com:\nContaminants: Farm-raised salmon tends to be higher in contaminants than wild-caught salmon. One study found that the level of PCB’s, a known carcinogen, is up to eight times higher in farm-raised salmon vs. wild caught salmon, depending on where and how the fish is raised.\nMercury levels seem to be about the same or maybe slightly higher in farm-raised salmon. Other trace minerals, such as cobalt, copper, and cadmium, have been found to be slightly higher in wild-caught salmon.\nHowever, even though higher, the levels of contaminants in farm-raised salmon are still considered to be well below the dangerous threshold.\nSo, Should I Eat Farm-Raised Salmon or Not?\nAccording to Authority Nutrition, salmon is a healthy food and you can (and should!) eat it regardless of its source. Pregnant women and children should abide by the standard guidelines\nFish is one of the most economical proteins to raise, requiring about a one-to-one ratio of feed-to-meat production--chickens require almost twice that, and cows require about eight times as much feed to produce a pound of meat. The world population is expected to have a billion more people by 2030, and the ocean’s fish supply is becoming too low to continue to catch wild fish safely. For these reasons, fish farming is probably not going anywhere soon. While farmed salmon doesn’t have quite the stunning nutritional profile of wild salmon, it is still very nutritious and delicious. And with the standards of fish farming getting stricter, farmed fish seems to be a good choice that is only going to get better.\nBonus: Hungry for Salmon? Check Out These Recipe Links!\nIf this article got you hungry for salmon, here are a few of our favorite salmon recipes. You can prepare salmon quickly in a number of ways. It pairs well with many flavors, from dill to citrus to sesame. Grilled salmon with just salt and pepper is a simple and elegant meal. You can also bake it, pan fry it, poach it, sous vide it, or even microwave it with good results.\nThe key to great salmon, as with all fish, is not overcooking it. According to this article at SeriousEats.com, medium rare salmon ranges from 110F-125F. If you go above that, it is likely to get dry regardless of your cooking method. You can use an\nTeriyaki Salmon with Sriracha Cream Sauce\nFrom Damn Delicious (I have never had a bad recipe from this site), this\nHoney-Mustard Glazed Salmon Steaks\nIf you like honey-mustard, then this is a\nSalmon with Creamy Dill Sauce\nSalmon and dill are a classic pairing, and this is one of the best\nSalmon Sous Vide\nAlthough this is more of a method than a recipe, it’s a worthy inclusion. And as a sous vide fanatic, I would have felt remiss had I not included this. If you're not familiar with sous vide cooking, it is a French term that means \"under pressure.\" Sous vide involves vacuum sealing food in plastic bags and cooking it in a water bath set to a constant temperature via an immersion circulator. The advantage of this method is that you can control the temperature of the food very precisely. You can also hold food at a constant temperature for a very long time without burning it or drying it out. It is a method used throughout the food service industry, including high-end restaurants, and it is gaining popularity with home cooks.\nI was skeptical about sous vide salmon, but I finally tried it, and I became a convert immediately. If cooked to the right temperature (110F-125F), the texture gets silky and almost custard-like. You may think custardy salmon sounds unappetizing, but you may change your mind if you give it a try."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f11106ec-0e1e-4794-b243-6abde4541f1e>","<urn:uuid:b7bfed9f-9262-4e09-bd5f-1d82e4ad548d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the basic play pattern for Gonggi vs Mancala?","answer":"In Gonggi, the basic play pattern involves throwing one stone in the air and catching it while picking up other stones from the playing surface, progressing through five different levels. In Mancala, players move stones around the board counterclockwise, picking up stones from one pit and distributing them one by one, with the goal of collecting stones in their store. Both games involve strategic movement and collection of game pieces, but Mancala follows a board-based pattern while Gonggi focuses on throwing and catching.","context":["“Shall we play a game?” is a memorable line from one of my favorite school hood movies. It’s a line I often use with my friends and family when I want to relax and gather around a table to play board or card games. Over the years, I’ve played many games introduced to me by my parents and other friends, but I find the ones I play most frequently these days are Korea. Perhaps that’s because I call the peninsula home and they’re new to me? Whatever the reason, the games are exciting and challenging, which is what I love about them. This month on The Korea Blog, we’ll take a look at four Korean games loved by many. To start things off, we’ll start with Gongi (공기), also called Jack Stones or Korean Jacks.\nJacks is an ancient game, whose origin isn’t exactly known, but presumed to be Asiatic. The original game used knucklebones from sheep. The bones were thrown into the air and caught in various ways. Gonggi (pronounced gong-gee) is the modern Korean version of the game. In Gonggi, five colorful, weighted plastic pieces are used (although traditionally, grape-sized pebbles were the game piece of choice).\nThe rules and play of the game are quite simple: throw a stone into the air and catch it. Okay, maybe it’s a little more complicated than that, but not much. There are five levels of play and each player begins on level one and progresses through each level until they miss or foul. To determine who goes first, the five stones are tossed into the air and caught on the back of the hand. The player with the most stones, leads. From Wikipedia:\n- Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface and the player picks a stone to throw up in the air. While airborne, the player picks up one stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones have been caught.\n- Level 2: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again. However, at this level, the player picks up the stones two at a time.\n- Level 3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface. The stones are picked up once in a cluster of three, and the other in the amount of one.\n- Level 4: The player throws one stone in the air, places the others on the surface, and catches the airborne stone. The stone is thrown into the air again and the player picks up the four clustered stones on the playing surface.\n- Level 5: The player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand in to the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The stones are then caught on the back of the hand. Then, the player throws the stones in the air and catches them. The number of stones caught amount to the score.\nA player’s turn is over when they commit a foul. These include not catching the stones, not picking up the designated number of stones, or allowing stones to touch on the playing surface. Distracting another player is also a no-no.\nScoring is also simple. Nothing is scored until you reach Level 5. The number of stones caught in the player’s hand at the end the round is scored. Once Level 5 has been reached, play begins anew at Level 1 and continues until the player misses or fouls.\nGonggi is a great game that’s continued into the 21st Century and played by many children. Gonggi stones can be purchased at many stationary stores around the nation and in local markets. A set usually contains six stones (one extra) and costs about W2000-3000.\nHave you played Gonggi or another Jacks game? How did you do? Next week The Korea Blog will introduce another great family Korean game.","How to play Mancala – Know the Rules\nMancala is a game that has ancient origins and can be traced back to many different cultures around the world. The game is thought to be one of the world’s oldest board games, and its popularity has spanned centuries. Mancala is believed to have originated in Africa, and there are many different versions of the game that are played across the continent.\nThe game spread to other parts of the world, including Asia and Europe, where it was adopted by different cultures and given new names. In some cultures, the game is known as “Kalah” or “Oware,” while in others it is called “Mankala.” No matter what it is called, Mancala remains a popular game that is enjoyed by people of all ages.\nThe Objective of Mancala\nThe main objective of the game is to collect as many stones as possible by placing them in their own store (small pits at the end of the board) before the end of the game. The game is played on a wooden board with six small holes and 2 player’s store (larger pockets,one for each player at the end of the wooden board), and each player has four pieces in each empty hole.\nThe starting player begins by placing 1 stone in each pit counter clockwise, until he places his last seed. The second player then does the same. The players then take turns moving their pieces around the board, picking up stones from one pit and placing them in another. The goal is to land the last stone in your own pit. If you do this, you get to keep all the stones in that pit. The game ends when all the pits are empty. Whoever has the most stones at the end of the game wins!\nIs mancala a game of luck?\nThat is a difficult question to answer. While there is an element of chance involved in the game, skill also plays a role. The game requires players to make strategic decisions about how to best place their pieces in order to capture their opponent’s pieces. As such, it is fair to say that mancala is not simply a game of luck. Instead, it is a game that require skill and strategy in order to be successful.\nHow to make your own Mancala Board Game\nMancala is a popular board game that originated in Africa and is now enjoyed by people all over the world, including the United States. The game can be played with a simple board with 6 empty pit and game pieces, or an empty egg carton using small stones, or a more complex board with small pockets. The goal of the game is to collect as many stones as possible and then empty your hand into your opponent’s side.\nThe game ends when the last stone lands during game play. Making your own Mancala board is a fun and easy project that can be done with materials you may already have around the house. All you need is an empty egg carton, enough stones for each player to have six, and a wooden board. If you don’t have a board, you can use a flat surface like a tabletop or the floor.\nWhat are the Rules for Mancala?\nMancala is a game that has been enjoyed by people all over the world for centuries. Though there are many different variations of the game, the basic rules are always the same. Each player has a set of mancala cups, and the goal is to collect as many pieces as possible.\nThe game starts with each player having an equal number of pieces, typically four or six in each cup. Players take turns picking up all the pieces from one of their cups and distributing them around the board counterclockwise. If the last piece falls into an empty cup on the player’s own side, they can take another turn.\nIf the last piece falls into an opponent’s cup, the player can capture that cup and all its contents.\nThe game ends when one player has no pieces left, at which point the other player is declared the winner. There are many more detailed rules that can be followed, but these are the basic rules of mancala. With so many different ways to play, it’s no wonder this game has remained popular for so many years.\nThis is another option for Mancala rules.\nIf the last piece you place goes into an in an empty pocket on your side of the board, you can take all of the pieces from that cup and keep them in your storage pit (but you don’t have an extra turn).\nIf the last piece you place goes into an opponent’s cup, you can take all of the pieces from that cup and put them in your storage pit. If the last piece you place goes into your own storage pit, you get a free turn. The first player to reach 24 pieces in their storage pit wins the game.\nThere are many different variations of these basic rules, so it is important to agree on the rules before starting a game. However, following these basic rules will allow you to enjoy a classic game of Mancala.\nWhat does the term Mancala mean?\nThe name of the ancient game of mankala refers to a group of board games that originated in ancient times. The word itself comes from the Arabic word for “to move,” and there are many different variations of the game. In most mancala games, players use stones or beads to store and move their pieces around the board.\nThe board typically consists of a series of storage pits, with each player having their own set of pits. The object of this game is to collect more stones than your opponent by moving them around the board. When a player’s pit is emptied, they can capture their opponent’s stones.\nMancala is one of the oldest games in existence, and it is still popular today. There are even mancala tournaments held every year. Whether you’re looking for a fun way to pass the time or a challenging strategy game, mancala is a great option.\nWhat are the various types of Mancala boards?\nThere are various types of mancala boards, and the opponent’s store is one type. This type has a board with twelve cups and two stores. The stores are located at the end of the row, and each player has one store. The game is played with two players, and each player has six cups. The game is played with a single seed, and the players take turns placing the seed in one of their cups. The game is won by the player who has the most seeds in their store. The following rules are followed in this type of mancala:\n-The game is played with two players.\n-Each player has six cups.\n-The game is played with a single seed.\n-The players take turns placing the seed in one of their cups.\n-The game is won by the player who has the most seeds in their store.\nAnother type of mancala board is the four row board. This type of board has four rows, and each player has two rows. The game is played with two players, and each player has four cups. The game is played with a single seed, and the players take turns placing the seed in one of their cups. The game is won by having more seeds in your store than your opponent’s store."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bc821ef0-49bd-4143-8f85-8ee7115f03bc>","<urn:uuid:71c7c7ce-26e7-4e9c-964e-c9f1daeb71fd>"],"error":null}

Not only would a flu pandemic cause an employer's health care costs to skyrocket, but employee absenteeism will cause business operations to suffer.\nTo prevent a flu pandemic, employers can take the following precautionary measures:\n- Post and hand out guidelines, flyers and suggestions to all employees to prevent flu outbreaks. The CDC has created a Seasonal Flu Information for Businesses & Employers webpage, which provides free resources and printable materials for businesses and employers regarding flu prevention and workplace-specific guidelines. Several states have also created websites targeted at helping employers manage the flu season;\n- Require that its employees adopt infection control practices such as regular hand washing, covering mouth when coughing, avoiding close contact with sick employees, getting plenty of sleep at night, eating right and using hand sanitizers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has prepared guidance on this topic;\n- Host a flu vaccination clinic or promote the flu vaccination;\n- Ask an employee exhibiting signs of the flu if he or she is experiencing any specific flu-like symptoms (such as fevers or chills and a cough). However, employers need to tread carefully here to ensure they are asking very limited questions and not soliciting other protected medical information (which may violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or other state or local antidiscrimination laws). Employers must keep all information about the employee's illness as a confidential medical file;\n- Ask an employee who becomes ill at work or shows signs of the flu to leave the workplace;\n- Ask employees with symptoms or exposure to the flu to stay home if there is a risk of infection;\n- Require employees to wear personal protective equipment during a flu pandemic. If an employee with a disability needs a related reasonable accommodation under the ADA (e.g., nonlatex gloves, gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs), the employer should provide it, absent undue hardship; and\n- Require a doctor's note or a fitness-for-duty certification (certification from a health care provider that the employee is able to resume work) from an employee returning to work after being out with the flu. This requirement should be disclosed to employees in advance of their absence and should be applied consistently and nondiscriminatorily.\nEmployers should also consider:\n- Having a contagious disease policy or pandemic leave policy;\n- Offering flexible work arrangements and telecommuting during pandemics;\n- Being more flexible with their paid time off policies and attendance polices during pandemics. Currently, federal law does not require employers to provide paid leave to employees who miss work because they have the pandemic flu or have been exposed to someone who has the flu. However, state or local laws may have different requirements;\n- If an employee's pandemic-related injury or illness or that of a family member is a serious health condition under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). See Employee Leaves > FMLA > Determining Employee Eligibility. Leave taken by an employee to avoid exposure to the flu is not protected under the FMLA. The Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor has created questions and answers regarding the pandemic flu and the FMLA; and\n- Whether an employee's injury or illness implicates the ADA. See Employee Management > Disabilities (ADA).\nWhile an employer can take many measures to prevent a flu outbreak, the employer must be careful that its actions do not violate the ADA or other state or local antidiscrimination laws. Thus, employers should not:\n- Ask employees about their underlying medical conditions, which may lead to the disclosure of disability- or genetic-related information; or\n- Exclude individuals with disabilities from the workplace for health or safety reasons unless they pose a direct threat (a significant risk of substantial harm even with a reasonable accommodation). During a pandemic, employers should rely on the latest CDC and state or local public health assessments to determine if a particular flu rises to the level of a direct threat.\nIn addition, employers should be careful about enforcing a mandatory flu vaccination policy or practice. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has weighed in on this issue and has published a technical assistance document titled Pandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and Americans with Disabilities Act. In question 13 of the publication, the EEOC recommends that employers only encourage employees to get the vaccination, rather than require it. The EEOC's reasoning is that a mandatory policy or practice fails to account for an employee's request for a reasonable accommodation when, for example, an employee has:\n- A health reason/disability that prevents him or her from getting the vaccination (such as a severe egg allergy, as most flu vaccinations have an egg component); or\n- A sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance that prevents him or her from receiving the vaccination.\nIf an employer decides to have a mandatory policy, it should include an interactive process that allows for reasonable accommodations based on disability or religion. Employers should also check to see if there are any state privacy laws implicated by such a policy.","Businesses use consumer data to understand their customers’ needs and improve relationships.\nHowever, businesses should be aware that customers trust them to keep their data safe, and year after year customers’ interest in data safety grows.\nThis growing interest has seen many customers become more intentional about the personal information they share with businesses.\nMoreover, consumers are also taking steps to understand and learn about privacy policies, consent management, and other issues related to data privacy.\nBecause of the growing awareness of customer privacy issues, organizations have to do better when it comes to data and customer privacy.\nTo help ensure your customers’ information is safe, here are a few measures your company can take.\n1. Store the Data Safely\nA crucial way of ensuring your customers’ data is safe is to store it safely.\nPoor data storage increases the risk of it being accessed by people with malicious intent. Having a modern data infrastructure is one way to ensure data safety.\nAdditionally, putting in place data security measures such as Virtual Private Network (VPN), data encryption, and two-factor authentication can help keep the data safe.\n2. Be In Full Control of Your Data\nConsumers are becoming more interested to know how online organizations such as Google and Amazon use their data. Proper control of consumer data leads to the correct utilization of the data.\nYour organization will collect lots of customer data, but not everyone should access it. The organization needs to manage the people who can access the data. This protects the data from purposeful or accidental misuse.\nControl also relates to your ability to limit users’ access to sensitive data parts. You also need to have complete control when it comes to deleting data that is no longer in use.\nTo make it easier to control the use of your data, have a modern infrastructure that makes it easier to monitor the data every time, everywhere.\n3. Adhere to your Customer Privacy\nConsumer data is powerful, and organizations may be enticed to use it maliciously.\nHowever, remember your data points represent real people and disregarding their privacy may put their lives at risk.\nOrganizations that share data with third parties should be careful to ensure that the data they share doesn’t land in the wrong hands. To protect the privacy of their customers, organizations can remove all PII from the data before sharing.\nPersonal Identifiable Information (PII) is any information that can be linked to the data owner. Some PII examples include:\n- Phone number\n- Email address\n- Passport number\n- Bank account number\n- Social media handle\n- Social security numbers\nThe use of features such as de-identifying and data masks can allow for data collaboration without exposing your customers’ identities.\nFurther, organizations should be careful about the data they share. Confidential and sensitive information can be used for all kinds of harm if it lands in the wrong hands.\nTo prevent such happenings, companies should have an infrastructure that allows for the sharing of such data without the need to copy or move it.\n4. Be More Transparent with Your Customers\nConsumer awareness is growing on the amount of data that organizations collect and how they’re using it. The result is that more consumers are concerned about the safety of their data.\nIt has become harder for customers to trust that their data will be protected and used appropriately.\nThis concern has seen even governments get involved in data privacy issues. For instance, the EU has come up with the General Data Protection Regulation to protect the use and security of consumer data.\nThe regulation requires companies located in the EU to be transparent when it comes to collecting and using consumer data.\nBeing transparent with your customers will not only help you comply with data privacy regulations, but you will also earn their trust.\n5. Adhere to Data Privacy Regulations\nCustomer data privacy is a serious issue with legal repercussions. Get familiar with the laws and regulations that pertain to data privacy and adhere to them.\nSome of the most common consumer data privacy regulations and laws are explained below:\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nThis law applies to all organizations and persons with access to private data in the EU. The law requires that you be transparent in your data collection.\nYou must also collect a minimal amount of data to serve your needs. Organizations are also expected to keep their customers’ data accurate and up to date.\nThe organization should also have proper security measures to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data and not store data once it has served its intended purpose.\nAccording to this law, data handlers are also accountable in case of any breaches.\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nThis law gives California citizens four rights that relate to the collection and use of their data. They have a right to know when businesses collect their data and how it’s used and shared. Individuals also have a right to delete personal data that organizations collect.\nThe residents also have a right to opt out of the sale of their data. Lastly, they have a right against discrimination if they choose to exercise the above rights.\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nHIPAA is a law related to medical data privacy. Organizations or individuals that handle medical data are expected to adhere to the guidelines of this law. This law helps control the access and use of individuals’ medical data.\nIn closing, every organization has a legal and moral obligation to protect their customers’ data. Adhering to the above measures will help your company uphold the safety and privacy of your customers’ data."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d863176b-bfc6-41f3-bdae-5b5b6e008da6>","<urn:uuid:26ce9902-0e33-4cf6-993a-d2cef5553b83>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the specific conservation steps being taken to restore the ornamental sculptures at Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, excluding previous restoration attempts from the early 1900s?","answer":"The current restoration uses modern techniques including laser cleaning, diamond tool work, controlled desalination, and silicate consolidation to preserve the original material. When original elements are missing, sculptors recreate them using 16th-century techniques by carving new blocks of tuffeau stone, which is then put in place by stonemasons.","context":["The current restoration project of the Château d'Azay-le-Rideau is focused on the roof structures, the overall roofing, the upper parts of the masonry, sculptures and woodwork.\nThe scaffolding and an umbrella covering the entire site enables the carpenters, roofers and stonemasons to work safely and provides perfect protection of the roof spaces and floors during the procedure.\nSection of the scaffolding and umbrella – All rights reserved\nThe ornamental sculpture of Azay-le-Rideau, largely original, reflects the combined talents in the region in the 16th century by the royal and aristocratic commissions. Light-coloured tuffeau stone, soft and easy to sculpt, favoured the development of the new style.\nThe restorations of the early 20th century used plaster for some seals and to make mortars imitating tuffeau stone. The plaster proved harmful for the stone which also suffered from mortars that were too hard or too watertight, or rusted the iron dowels.\nCartography of degraded stones – All rights reserved.\nThe restorer aims to ensure the conservation of the source material with modern techniques: laser cleaning, the diamond tool, controlled desalination and silicate consolidation. When the old elements have disappeared the sculptor intervenes with the same techniques that were used in the 16th century by sculpting the blocks of tuffeau stone put in place by the stonemason.\nDetails of sculpted decorations / decorative covering of the staircase site.\nSince 2011, visitors have the chance to enter the attic of the château where the original structure remains in an exceptional state of preservation.

The cutting and assembly of the wood pieces are remarkable: the exceptional craftsmanship of the carpenters of the 16nth century was instrumental in the conservation of this work through the centuries.

Faulty slates are being replaced and the finials are being consolidated. The site has enabled rediscovering of a little known heritage: the lead roof ridges have an extremely rare polychrome decoration, which will be protected.\nThe restoration of the roof is a complex project requiring the expertise of artisans, businesses and highly skilled craftsmen.\nThe semi-thick slate originally used for the roofing of the Château d'Azay was from the Anjou region. Over the centuries, the roof was repaired from time to time: the result is not very homogeneous, both in terms of colours and the techniques used. During the work the entire roof will be removed and the defective slates will be replaced.\nThe slate quarries of Angers having permanently closed in 2013, a Galicia slate, whose characteristics are closest to that of Anjou, has been selected.\nThe state of the roofing before the restoration.\nRestoring the roof of a historical monument requires a rare expertise: on the site the roofers reproduce ancient techniques, which consist in securing the slates with a nail. Laying the slates is done by a technique known in French as \"à liaison brouillée et à pureau décroissant\": that is to say that the pieces are placed with a slight overlap to avoid leaving an unattractive line.\nThe finials are the decorative elements in lead and other metals that adorn the tops of roofs Those of the Château d'Azay are exceptional in their decoration and their height (6 metres).

{"question":"Hey, I work in HR and was wondering - what's the main difference between how norms work in regular society vs in companies?","answer":"The main difference is that organizational culture norms tend to be more formal than societal norms. Organizations often have their values, beliefs, and norms explicitly written down in employee manuals and company websites. In contrast, societal norms are typically unwritten guidelines for behavior that people follow through tradition and social expectations. Additionally, organizational culture may show less consistency between its written elements and observed behaviors, while societal norms tend to more consistently reflect the values of that culture.","context":["| Organizational Culture\nOrganizational culture can be viewed as an important concept in organizational psychology and social psychology. It is important to define organizational culture.\nOrganizational Culture Definition:\nWhat is organizational culture? There are many possible definitions of organizational culture. Below is one organizational culture definition:\nOrganizational culture reflects the values, beliefs, and norms that characterize an organization as a whole.\nThis definition suggests that organizational culture reflects what is common, typical, and general for the organization. Values, beliefs, and behaviors that are uncommon in the organization, or specific to a particular subgroup within an organization, would not be considered to be part of the culture of the organization.\nElements of Organizational Culture:\nThere are many possible elements of organizational culture. The above definition includes three of the elements of organizational culture.\nOrganizational Values. Values reflect what we feel is important. Organizations may have core values that reflect what is important in the organization. These values may be guiding principles of behavior for all members in the organization. The core values may be stated on the organization's website. For example, an organization could state that their core values are creativity, humor, integrity, dedication, mutual respect, kindness, and contribution to society.\nOrganizational Beliefs. Beliefs that are part of an organization's culture may include beliefs about the best ways to achieve certain goals such as increasing productivity and job motivation. For example, an organization may convey the belief that the expression of humor in the workplace is an effective way to increase productivity and job motivation.\nOrganizational Norms. Norms reflect the typical and accepted behaviors in an organization. They may reflect the values and beliefs of the organization. They may reflect how certain tasks are generally expected to be acomplished, the attributes of the work environment, the typical ways that people communicate in the organization, and the typical leadership styles in the organization. For example, the work environment of a company may be described as relaxed, cheerful, and pleasant. Moreover, the organization may have a participative decision making process in which many people in the organization are able to express their views concerning important decisions. Also, an organization may have many meetings to discuss ideas.\nThe Importance of the Organizational Culture Concept\nOrganizational culture may be an important concept for a few reasons. First, understanding the culture of an organization may be helpful for applicants. They may have a better idea about whether they would like to work for a company. Second, understanding the culture of an organization may help in training new employees. Third, understanding organizational culture may help leaders to identify possible sources of problems in the organization.\nOrganizational Culture and Leadership\nThere may be at least three ways in which leadership is important with respect to organizational culture. First, a leader of an organization may play an important role in identifying the elements of the organization's culture. The leader could make a list of the organization's current values, beliefs, and norms. Second, after identifying the current elements of the organization's culture, the leader can make evaluations of the elements of organizational culture that may be negative. The leader could make a list of the specific values, beliefs, and norms that may contribute to major problems in the organization (e.g., a lack of job motivation). Third, after identifying the possible negative elements, the leader could develop strategies to foster a positive organizational culture change. The leader could make a list of the elements of a more ideal culture, develop specific ways to communicate the changes, and develop techniques to motivate people to adopt the new culture.\nOrganizational Culture Change\nThere may be many reasons why the culture of an organization needs to be changed. These reasons may include lack of morale, lack of job motivation, lack of job meaning, and changes in the business (e.g., the development of a new product) that would require a change in the way things are done in the organization.\nFor example, there may be too much micromanagment in a company. It may be better if employees had more autonomy. This may increase morale. Sherman (1989) found that unit morale was positively correlated with automony. Because this finding is correlational, we cannot make causal conclusions.\nThis process of culture change should involve all members of the organization. This process of culture change could involve surveys in which members describe specific elements of the organizational culture that members view as negative.\nCulture vs. Organizational Culture\nAlthough the concept of organizational culture is similar to the concept of culture(e.g., the elements of culture may be similar to the elements of organizational culture), it is important to make a distinction between the two concepts. There may be a few ways in which these concepts may be different. First, organizational culture may be more formal than culture. Some organizations may have a significant part of their culture in written form. For example, they may have the core values stated on the website, and the values, beliefs, and norms of the organization may be indicated in employee manuals. In contrast, much of the values, beliefs, and norms that are a reflection of a culture may be unwritten. Second, there may be less consistency between elements of organizational culture than elements of culture. Some of the elements of organizational culture that are in written form may be inconsistent with certain norms observed in the organization. In contrast, many of the norms of a culture may simply reflect the values of the culture.\nSherman, J. D. (1989). Technical supervision and turnover among\nengineers and technicans. Group & Organization Studies, 14, 411-","Every society has expectations about how its members should and should not behave. A norm is a guideline or an expectation for behavior. Each society makes up its own rules for behavior and decides when those rules have been violated and what to do about it. Norms change constantly.\nNorms differ widely among societies, and they can even differ from group to group within the same society.\nExample: The way we are expected to behave in church differs from the way we are expected to behave at a party, which also differs from the way we should behave in a classroom.\nExample: In some African countries, it’s acceptable for people in movie theaters to yell frequently and make loud comments about the film. In the United States, people are expected to sit quietly during a movie, and shouting would be unacceptable.\nExample: In the United States in the 1950s, a woman almost never asked a man out on a date, nor did she pay for the date. While some traditional norms for dating prevail, most women today feel comfortable asking men out on dates and paying for some or even all of the expenses.\nSociologists have separated norms into four categories: folkways, mores, laws, and taboos.\nA folkway is a norm for everyday behavior that people follow for the sake of convenience or tradition. People practice folkways simply because they have done things that way for a long time. Violating a folkway does not usually have serious consequences.\nExample: Holding the door open for a person right behind you is a folkway.\nA more (pronounced MORE-ay) is a norm based on morality, or definitions of right and wrong. Since mores have moral significance, people feel strongly about them, and violating a more usually results in disapproval.\nExample: Parents who believe in the more that only married people should live together will disapprove of their son living with his girlfriend. They may consider their son’s action a violation of the moral guidelines for behavior.\nA law is a norm that is written down and enforced by an official agency. Violating a law results in a specific punishment.\nExample: It is illegal in most countries to drive a car while drunk, and a person violating this law may get cited for driving under the influence (DUI), which may bring a fine, loss of driver’s license, or even jail time.\nA taboo is a norm that society holds so strongly that violating it results in extreme disgust. The violator is often considered unfit to live in that society.\nExample: In most countries, cannibalism and incest are considered taboo. In some Muslim cultures, eating pork is taboo because the pig is considered unclean.\nWhere there are rules, there are rule breakers. Sociologists call the violation of a norm deviance. The word deviant has taken on the negative connotation of someone who behaves in disgusting or immoral ways, but to sociologists, a deviant is anyone who doesn’t follow a norm, in either a good way or a bad way. See Chapter 6 for more about deviance.\nExample: Most people don’t graduate from college with a 4.0 grade point average, so sociologists view someone who does graduate with a 4.0 as deviant. Likewise, most Americans get married at some point in their lives, so someone who chooses not to marry is sociologically a deviant.\nAlthough deviance can be good and even admirable, few societies could tolerate the chaos that would result from every person doing whatever he or she pleased. Social control refers to the methods that societies devise to encourage people to observe norms. The most common method for maintaining social control is the use of sanctions, which are socially constructed expressions of approval or disapproval. Sanctions can be positive or negative, and the ways societies devise to positively or negatively sanction behaviors are limited only by the society’s imagination.\nA positive sanction rewards someone for following a norm and serves to encourage the continuance of a certain type of behavior.\nExample: A person who performs well at his or her job and is given a salary raise or a promotion is receiving a positive sanction. When parents reward a child with money for earning good grades, they are positively sanctioning that child’s behavior.\nA negative sanction is a way of communicating that a society, or some group in that society, does not approve of a particular behavior. The optimal effect of a negative sanction is to discourage the continuation of a certain type of behavior.\nNorms and Consequences\nExample: Imprisoning a criminal for breaking the law, cutting off a thief’s hands for stealing, and taking away a teenager’s television privileges for breaking curfew are all negative sanctions.\nConsequences for violation\nWearing a suit to an interview\nOnly married couples should live together\nConflicts with family members, disapproval\nLaws against public nudity\nImprisonment, monetary fine\nEating human flesh\nVisible signs of disgust, expulsion from society"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8a08adc3-69bd-400c-a773-e36efb6b08a2>","<urn:uuid:9b735bcc-9d74-400f-9a3a-ac50a43a2e12>"],"error":null}
{"question":"who can inherit coat of arms Scotland vs England?","answer":"In England, only legitimate male descendants can inherit the right to use a coat of arms from an armiger. In Scotland, arms can be inherited through both paternal and maternal lines, and people can also apply for arms themselves to the Lord Lyon, though grants are typically only made to UK citizens.","context":["1. What is heraldry?\nHeraldry is the science of coats of arms and armorial bearings. These “heraldic achievements” were originally designed to help identify knights in armor, on the battlefield or during medieval sporting events known as tournaments. In Scotland arms are recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings, which is kept in the offices of the Lord Lyon, King of Arms.\n2. Is heraldry just a relic of the medieval past?\nCertainly not. New grants of arms are still made by the Lord Lyon. Besides, whenever schools or sports teams pick a motto, an emblem, and colors, they are practicing heraldry, even if these are never officially granted or recorded.\n3. What is an armiger? An armiger is an individual who has been granted or has inherited the right to a specific heraldic achievement (shield, crest, mottos, supporters etc.). Only one individual has the right to his or her arms, undifferenced, though others may show their loyalty to a particular armiger (say, a clan chief) by wearing their crest surrounded by a strap and buckle. In addition to individual armigers, however, there are some corporate grants, to cities, universities and so on. The Use of Corporate Arms\n4. What are the orders of the peerage? In order of precedence there are five orders of peerage in Scotland: Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Lord of Parliament. The Lords of Parliament are called Barons in England. Confusingly there are also people called barons in Scotland, but they are not (at least by virtue of their baronies) peers. (See leaflet no. 21, Titles, a Primer.)\n5. What other people may be armigers in Scotland? In addition to peers and feudal barons, there are other men and women who hold Scottish arms. One category is people with a Territorial Designation (See leaflet 20). Others may simply inherit their arms. People can also apply for arms themselves to the Lord Lyon.\n6. How can I become an armiger? Detailed information on how to apply for arms may be found in the attached leaflet (See leaflet 4). Grants are not typically made to people who are not citizens of the United Kingdom (General Colin Powell was a notable exception), but non-citizens may apply for a cadet-matriculation, if they can show, for instance, that they descend from a Scottish armiger. (See leaflet no.8)\n7. What is a “laird”? Is it the same as a Lord? No, it is not the same at all. Most often the word “laird” is used very broadly to indicate a landowner, who may also be (but is frequently not) a member of the peerage. As could be inferred from the fact that companies market holdings as small as a square foot of land by saying that ownership would entitle the purchaser to call themselves “laird,” calling oneself “laird” in no way makes one a member of the peerage or entitles one to become an armiger. Territorial designations will only be considered for holdings on which a proper house has been built.\nSee leaflet 20 and note on lairds on Lyon Court Website.\n8. Can I become a Lord by buying a square foot of Scottish soil? No.\n9. What allows some women to be called “lady”? Traditionally the title “lady” is used for one of three categories of woman: a peeress in her own right, the wife of a peer and the wife of a knight. The wife of a chief, if not also a peer or knight, should be addressed as “Madam.”\n10. What are the flags of Scotland that it is OK for me to fly? The national flag of Scotland is the Saltire, a white St Andrew’s cross on a blue background. This also forms part of the composite flag known as the Union Jack, which is the national flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of which Scotland is a constituent part. Similarly, the United Kingdom is part of the European Union, whose flag may also, therefore, be flown in Scotland. A common mistake is for people to fly the Lion Rampant (a red lion on a yellow background). This is not a national flag. It is the personal flag of Her Majesty the Queen in her capacity as Queen of Scotland. Only her special representatives may do this.\n11. Who can wear a feather in their cap, and how many? This is not a matter of law but of convention. The simple rule would be that only a chief of the name may wear three feathers and other armigers, even peers, may only wear one. If you are not an armiger, you should not wear any at all. A very few armigers may wear two feathers. To wear two they would need to be either the head of a branch of a clan, so recognized by their chief, or the chairman of a society like the Society of Scottish Armigers, where that privilege was recognized by the Lord Lyon.\n12. How do I address a Duke, an Earl or other peer? (See Leaflet 21)\n13. Who can fly a banner? Banners are governed by the rules of heraldry, whether personal or corporate.\nSee leaflet 3.\n14. Can I get my family or clan coat of arms? In general terms (there are a few “armigerous clans or families”) only individual armigers have coats of arms. Displaying another person’s arms is considered akin to identity theft and can be prosecuted by and before the Lyon court. As mentioned above, however, it is acceptable for a member of a clan to display their chief’s crest surrounded by a strap and buckle.\n15. What makes some extended families a “clan”? In the past the word “clan” was used only about extended family groups from the Gaidhealtachd, the traditionally Celtic, Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Islands. Families from the East of Scotland (like the Leslies) or from the south (the Scotts or Elliots, say,) many of whom had a Norman or Anglo-Saxon origin, did not use the term. This distinction has now largely disappeared to be replaced with another. In simple terms, and with a few exceptions, to be considered a clan you must have a chief so recognized as chief of the name by the Lord Lyon and eligible to sit on the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs.\n16. Who is the Lord Lyon? The Lord Lyon, King of Arms, is one of the Great Officers of State in Scotland, and the person responsible for regulating heraldry in Scotland. He issues new grants of arms and presides over the oldest heraldic court in daily operation anywhere in the world. (See Lyon Court Website)\n17. How do you get to be a chief? Most often you inherit the position. In Scotland this can happen through the maternal line. If a clan or family has no chief, because the line has died out, a derbhfine of leading clansmen can be instituted to elect one of their number.\nSee leaflet 12. Their choice would still need to be ratified by the Lord Lyon as chief of the name, at which point he or she might expect to be invited to join the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs. Certain individuals have attempted to short-circuit this process, simply proclaiming themselves chief, but their doing so carries no weight in the wider Scottish community. The title “chief” – like the wearing of three feathers – is understood to be the preserve of the Standing Council, and should not be used loosely by others in the Scottish community.\n18. What is the difference between a plaid and a tartan? Originally a plaid was a garment, something like a great cloak, which one could wrap around oneself or lay on the ground to sleep on. Tartan is the name for the pattern with which such garments were woven. (See leaflet no 20)\n19. Can I wear whatever tartan I like or are there rules? Tartans are not part of heraldry as such. They are not the personal property of a chief in the way other “clan” insignia typically are. While most tartans are identified with certain specific clans or families, or sometimes regiments or regions, there is no law against wearing whatever one likes.\n20. What is the relationship between Scotland, England and the United Kingdom? Who are the British? Scotland today is a country which forms part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In turn the UK forms a part of the European Union. Sovereignty is shared within and between these three layers of power and government. England is by far the largest part of the United Kingdom. Scotland accounts for about one twelfth of the population of the UK, roughly the same ratio that Texas represents within the United States. Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, England does not have its own government and is governed only by the UK and EU Governments. Originally the term British referred to a specific ethnic and linguistic group in these islands, who spoke P-Celtic or Brythonic Celtic dialects. Today these are mostly identified with Welsh and Breton. There was a large British kingdom in the land which came to be known as Scotland, around the area of Strathclyde and with its capital at Dumbarton, which means “fort of the Britons.” After England and Scotland signed their Act of Union the term was revived to indicate the people of the combined area, including England, Scotland and Wales. The term “Great Britain” is a translation of the French “Grande Bretagne,” which the French used to distinguish the area from the region known as Bretagne or Brittany in their own country. It is as absurd to distinguish between Scots and “Brits” as between Texans and Americans. If Scotland left the United Kingdom, those remaining would probably revert to the name “English” and the term “British” would disappear from the political lexicon the way “Yugoslav” or “Czechoslovak” have done.\n21.

Originally, coats of arms were \"assumed\", or designed and adopted by the persons using them. Eventually, the Crown reserved to itself the right to grant coats of arms to individuals, not families. A person entitled to bear arms is an armiger. An armiger’s legitimate male descendants can inherit the right to use his coat of arms. Most English did not have a coat of arms.\nThe Crown awards the right to use coat of arms to a person who performs a heroic deed, makes a notable achievement, or holds a prominent position. Such grants are recorded by representatives of the Crown called King’s heralds, who house their records at:\nCollege of Arms\nQueen Victoria Street\nLondon EC4V 4BT\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, heralds visited all parts of England to discover who was using coats of arms and the title of Gentleman, Esquire, or Knight. They asked for proof of the right to use such coats of arms or titles. These proofs often included docuementation of male descent from the original grantee. Heraldic visitations are records of these visits (see the \"Nobility\" section of this outline).\nHeralds developed terms to describe the records they kept. To understand a coat of arms, you need to understand the terms used by the heralds. Many books define heraldic terms.

{"question":"How do the color-coded zone systems used in asthma management compare to the risk assessment categories used in blood glucose monitoring?","answer":"Asthma management uses a three-zone color system: green (80-100% of personal best peak flow) indicating good control, yellow (50-79%) indicating caution, and red (below 50%) indicating danger. Blood glucose monitoring uses a different risk assessment system with more specific numerical ranges: 90-120 mg/dL is the normal range, 120-160 mg/dL indicates medium risk, 160-240 mg/dL is too high, and above 300 mg/dL is critically dangerous. While both systems help monitor condition severity, asthma uses a simpler three-color system based on personal best percentages, while blood glucose uses more detailed numerical ranges that apply universally.","context":["Top of the pageActionset\nAsthma: Taking Charge of Your Asthma\nDuring an asthma attack, the airways swell and narrow. This makes it hard to breathe. Although asthma is a lifelong disease, treatment can help control it and help you stay healthy.\nYou and your doctor will make an asthma action plan that outlines the two approaches to taking charge of asthma:\n- Controlling asthma over the long term. Daily controller medicine helps reduce the swelling of your airways and prevent attacks.\n- Treating attacks when they occur. The action plan will outline the steps to take and medicine to use to treat asthma attacks.\nUsing the asthma action plan also helps you keep track of your asthma and know how well your treatment is working.\nIf you or your child has been recently diagnosed, it may seem like there is a lot to remember. But the things you need to do to take charge of your asthma are really quite simple. With some practice, they will become part of your normal routine.\nHow to take charge of your asthma\nFollow your asthma action plan\n- Take your daily medicines as prescribed. This can keep asthma under control and help you avoid asthma attacks.\n- Keep your treatment goals in mind. This may help you stay on your treatment.\n- Review your list of triggers. Avoiding triggers can help reduce the chance that you will have an asthma attack.\nKnow your asthma zones\nAn action plan is based on zones that are defined by your symptoms, your peak flow, or both. There are three zones: green, yellow, and red. Your action plan tells you what to do when you are in each zone.\nCheck your symptoms or your peak flow, or both, on a regular basis, and use your action plan to see what zone you are in. If you have yellow zone symptoms or if your peak flow drops below 80% of your personal best measurement, follow your action plan. To figure out what 80% of your personal best measurement is, multiply your personal best measurement by 0.80. For example, if your personal best peak flow is 400, then 80% of that is 400 times 0.80, which is 320. To figure what 50% of your personal best peak flow is, multiply your personal best measurement by 0.50.\n- Green means Go.\nYou are in the green zone if your peak flow is 80% to 100% of your personal best measurement.\nThis is where you want to be. Keep taking your daily asthma medicines as prescribed.\n- Yellow means Caution.\nYou are in the yellow zone if your peak flow is 50% to 79% of your personal best measurement. You may not have any symptoms, but your lung function is reduced. When symptoms are present, you may cough, wheeze, or feel short of breath. Or your asthma may limit your activities or wake you up at night.\nYou should take action. Your action plan will tell you what medicines you need to take, how much to take, and when to take them. If you keep going into the yellow zone from the green zone, talk with your doctor. You may need a different medicine or the dose of your medicine may need to be increased.\n- Red means DANGER.\nYou are in the red zone if your peak flow is less than 50% of your personal best measurement. You may be very short of breath. Or the quick-relief medicines may not have worked. This is dangerous.\nTake the actions listed in your action plan and call your doctor. If you can't get in touch with your doctor, go to the emergency department. Call 911 right away if you are having severe trouble breathing.\nUse your asthma diary\n- If you have an attack, write down what caused it (if you know), the symptoms, and what medicine you took.\n- If you use a peak flow meter, write down your peak flow readings in your asthma diary .\nCheck your peak flow if your doctor recommends it\n- Use your peak flow meter. This is a good way to check how well your lungs are working, which is called lung function. Your lung function can get worse without causing symptoms.\n- Check your peak flow as often as your doctor tells you to. For many people this is twice a day, morning and evening.\n- If you have trouble using your meter, talk with your doctor.\nSee your doctor to review your plan\nKeep your regular follow-up appointments. During checkups, your doctor will ask if your symptoms or your peak flow, or both, have held steady, improved, or gotten worse. He or she will also ask if you have asthma symptoms during exercise or at night. This information can help your doctor know if your asthma category has changed or if you need to change medicines or doses.\nWhen you go to your doctor:\n- Take your asthma action plan and your asthma diary, if you have one. Get answers to any questions you may have about your asthma plans or your symptoms. Let your doctor know if treatment is not controlling your asthma symptoms.\n- Take your peak flow meter and medicines so your doctor can review your treatment and the way you use the meter and medicines.\n- Make sure you know how and when to call your doctor or go to the hospital.\n- Tell your doctor if you are having trouble following your action plan.\nTo learn more about Healthwise, visit Healthwise.org.\n© 1995-2021 Healthwise, Incorporated.

If you need to keep track of your blood sugar levels, particularly when you are diabetic, during the day or over a period of weeks or months, you can use a blood sugar chart as a reference.\nThe blood glucose chart is also known by many other names such as diabetes chart, low blood sugar levels chart, high blood sugar level chart, blood sugar levels chart by age, diabetic blood sugar chart, normal blood sugar levels chart, etc.\nWhy is it important to monitor my blood sugar levels (blood glucose levels)?\nTracking blood sugar is important for anyone who is suffering with diabetes or who is at risk of diabetes mellitus. Your blood sugar levels also called blood glucose levels change throughout the day. It is therefore important to monitor them and keep in mind exactly what your targets should be to make sure that you adhere to the guidelines and maintain ideal blood sugar levels.\nYou can use a blood sugar level chart as a healthy blood sugar level reference when you wake up, when you got o bed, when you are going to have a meal, and after you have taken a meal.\nYou or your doctor can use blood sugar level charts to specify target goals and monitor how well your diabetes treatment is going. Blood sugar charts also help those with diabetes review the blood sugar test results.\nOther benefits of using blood sugar charts and blood sugar level charts are:\n- A diabetic chart helps keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible to the set target goals\n- Comparing your at home test results of blood sugar with blood sugar chart as a reference for monitoring the levels\n- Understand normal, ideal, and abnormal blood sugar levels for those with and without diabetes\n- A1C blood sugar recommendations are also mostly included in blood sugar charts. An A1C test measures the average sugar levels over a 3-month period. This gives a better insight into overall health of a person with respect to the blood sugar levels.\n- Diabetic charts or blood sugar charts are important tools for your diabetes management\nBlood sugar chart or Blood sugar level chart\n|When to check||Blood sugar levels for people without diabetes||Blood sugar levels for people with diabetes|\n|Fasting (before breakfast)||less than 100 mg/dL||80 - 130 mg/dL|\n|Before meals||less than 110 mg/dL||70-130 mg/dL|\n|2 hrs after meal\n1-2 hrs after meal\n|less than 140 mg/dL||less than 180 mg/dL|\n|Bedtime||less than 120 mg/dL||90 - 150 mg/dL|\n|A1C levels||less than 5.7 percent||less than 7 percent|\nInterpreting your blood sugar test results\nIdeals blood sugar levels may vary from person to person slightly. A good blood sugar level for one person may be too high or too low for someone else. For people with diabetes, though, some ranges of blood sugar levels are specified as are preferable over others.\n|Blood sugar levels||Excellent||Good||Acceptable|\n|Before meal||72 - 109 mg/dL||110 - 144 mg/dL||145 - 180 mg/dL|\n|2 hours after meal||90 - 126 mg/dL||127 - 180 mg/dL||181 - 234 mg/dL|\nBlood sugar level recommendations for gestational diabetes\nCertain temporary forms of diabetes such as gestational diabetes have different recommendation. The blood glucose chart for them is:\n|When to check||Blood sugar levels in mg/dL|\n|Fasting or before breakfast||60 - 90 mg/dL|\n|Before meals||60 - 90 mg/dL|\n|1-2 hours after meal||100 - 120 mg/dL|\nDangerous levels of blood sugar (blood glucose)\nThere are certain ranges beyond which one should be concerned about, as these are considered as dangerous blood sugar levels or dangerous blood glucose levels. The risk level increases with these sugar levels in the blood. This blood glucose chart can be used as a reference for risk assessment.\n|Fasting blood sugar levels||How dangerous it is (Risk) Risk level||What to do?|\n|50 mg/dL or less||Dangerously low||Seek medical attention|\n|70 - 90 mg/dL||Possibly too low||Consume sugar if you are experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar or meet a doctor|\n|90-120 mg/dL||Normal range||No action needed|\n|120-160 mg/dL||Medium||Meet a doctor|\n|160 - 240 mg/dL||Too high||Need to lower your blood sugar levels|\n|240-300 mg/dL||Too high||It is a sign of uncontrolled diabetes. Meet a doctor at the earliest.|\n|300 mg/dL or above||Very high. Critically Dangerous.||Emergency. Seek immediate medical attention.|\nAIC Numbers and blood glucose levels\nAnother way to understand your blood sugar is through the A1C test, An A1C lets you know where your glucose levels have been on average, over the last three months or other time frames.\nA1C is a protein in red blood cells, and it binds with glucose. Since the red blood cells have a lifespan of about three to four months, the amount of blood sugar A1C collects can tell us about the average of your blood glucose levels.\nThe A1C percentage can be translated into other forms of readings based on the following blood sugar chart (diabetic chart).\nHow to translate A1C numbers into blood glucose levels\n|A1C (%)||Blood Sugar Levels (mg/dl)|\nTesting your blood sugar and Monitoring blood sugar levels\nMonitoring blood sugar levels is important for management of diabetes. It includes both self-monitoring at home and doctor-ordered tests, such as A1C tests.\nYou should track blood sugar level changes daily if you are diabetic and help your doctors understand what treatment plans are working or not working for you. This will help him or her adjust medications or set goals.\nHow frequent you should test the blood sugar varies according to your treatment plan and the type of diabetes you have. Here is how frequently you should test the blood sugar.\nType 1 diabetes in adults\nAt least twice daily and up to 10 times.\nTests should be done before breakfast, at fasting, before meals, 1-2 hours after meals, before and after physical activities or exercises, and when going to bed.\nType 1 diabetes in children\nAt least four times daily.\nTests should be done before having meals and when going to bed. Tests may also be required 1-2 hrs after meals, before and after exercise, and overnight.\nType 2 along with insulin or other medication going on\nThe frequency of tests varies depending on your insulin dosage and any other medicines you are taking.\nIf you are on intensive insulin medication, you should do tests at fasting, before meals, before bedtime, and sometimes in the night if needed. Those on usual insulin and additional medications dosage should at least perform the tests at fasting (before breakfast) and bedtime.\nThose not on insulin but oral medications or diet control do not require frequent blood sugar testing at home.\nType 2 diabetes and low risk of low blood sugar\nDaily tests are not usually required. If blood sugar goals or A1C levels are not met on a regular basis, the frequency of testing can be increased until the levels are back within normal ranges.\nIf you are on insulin, tests should be done at fasting, before meals and 1 hour after meals. If you aren’t on insulin, you should perform tests at fasting and 1 hour after meals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:97e1e887-0f06-4888-8071-5bbbcdbe6805>","<urn:uuid:692e1775-d7ac-4480-a9fe-35e78219acf6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"wat's d main limitation of source-based intelligence gathering?","answer":"The main limitation of source-based intelligence gathering is that even the highest-placed sources may be wrong or unaware of what will actually happen. During major historical events, like the fall of the Shah in Iran or the collapse of the Soviet Union, intelligence gathered from top officials proved ineffective because these leaders themselves did not understand or accurately interpret the situation in their countries.","context":["Russian Spies and Strategic Intelligence\nBy George Friedman\nThe United States has captured a group of Russian spies and exchanged them for four individuals held by the Russians on espionage charges. The ways the media have reported on the issue fall into three groups:\n- That the Cold War is back,\n- That, given that the Cold War is over, the point of such outmoded intelligence operations is questionable,\n- And that the Russian spy ring was spending its time aimlessly nosing around in think tanks and open meetings in an archaic and incompetent effort.\nIt is said that the world is global and interdependent. This makes it vital for a given nation to know three things about all of the nations with which it interacts.\nFirst, it needs to know what other nations are capable of doing. Whether militarily, economically or politically, knowing what other nations are capable of narrows down those nations' possible actions, eliminating fantasies and rhetoric from the spectrum of possible moves. Second, the nation needs to know what other nations intend to do. This is important in the short run, especially when intentions and capabilities match up. And third, the nation needs to know what will happen in other nations that those nations' governments didn't anticipate.\nThe more powerful a nation is, the more important it is to understand what it is doing. The United States is the most powerful country in the world. It therefore follows that it is one of the prime focuses of every country in the world. Knowing what the United States will do, and shifting policy based on that, can save countries from difficulties and even disaster. This need is not confined, of course, to the United States. Each country in the world has a list of nations that it is interdependent with, and it keeps an eye on those nations. These can be enemies, friends or just acquaintances. It is impossible for nations not to keep their eyes on other nations, corporations not to keep their eyes on other corporations and individuals not to keep their eyes on other people. How they do so varies; that they do so is a permanent part of the human condition. The shock at learning that the Russians really do want to know what is going on in the United States is, to say the least, overdone.\nRussian Tradecraft Examined\nLet's consider whether the Russian spies were amateurish. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviets developed a unique model of espionage. They would certainly recruit government officials or steal documents. What they excelled at, however, was placing undetectable operatives in key positions. Soviet talent scouts would range around left-wing meetings to discover potential recruits. These would be young people with impeccable backgrounds and only limited contact with the left. They would be recruited based on ideology, and less often via money, sex or blackmail. They would never again be in contact with communists or fellow travelers. They would apply for jobs in their countries' intelligence services, foreign or defense ministries, and so on. Given their family and academic backgrounds, they would be hired. They would then be left in place for 20 or 30 years while they rose in the ranks — and, on occasion, aided with bits of information from the Soviet side to move their careers ahead.\nThe Soviets understood that a recruited employee might be a double agent. But stealing information on an ad hoc basis was also risky, as the provenance of such material was always murky. Recruiting people who were not yet agents, creating psychological and material bonds over long years of management and allowing them to mature into senior intelligence or ministry officials allowed ample time for testing loyalty and positioning. The Soviets not only got more reliable information this way but also the ability to influence the other country's decision-making. Recruiting a young man in the 1930s, having him work with the OSS and later the CIA, and having him rise to the top levels of the CIA — had that ever happened — would thus give the Soviets information and control.\nThese operations took decades, and Soviet handlers would spend their entire careers managing one career. There were four phases:\n- Identifying likely candidates,\n- Evaluating and recruiting them,\n- Placing them and managing their rise in the organization,\n- And exploiting them.\nThe longer the third phase took, the more effective the fourth phase would be.\nIt is difficult to know what the Russian team was up to in the United States from news reports, but there are two things we know about the Russians: They are not stupid, and they are extremely patient. If we were to guess — and we are guessing — this was a team of talent scouts. They were not going to meetings at the think tanks because they were interested in listening to the papers; rather, they were searching for recruits. These were people between the ages of 22 and 30, doing internships or entry-level jobs, with family and academic backgrounds that would make employment in classified areas of the U.S. government easy — and who in 20 to 30 years would provide intelligence and control to Moscow.\nIn our view, the media may have conflated two of Moscow's missions.\nTwin Goals and the Espionage Challenge\nOne of the Russian operatives, Don Heathfield, once approached a STRATFOR employee in a series of five meetings. There appeared to be no goal of recruitment; rather, the Russian operative tried to get the STRATFOR employee to try out software he said his company had developed. We suspect that had this been done, our servers would be outputting to Moscow. We did not know at the time who he was. (We have since reported the incident to the FBI, but these folks were everywhere, and we were one among many.)\nThus, the group apparently included a man using software sales as cover — or as we suspect, as a way to intrude on computers. As discussed, the group also included talent scouts. We would guess that Anna Chapman was brought in as part of the recruitment phase of talent scouting. No one at STRATFOR ever had a chance to meet her, having apparently failed the first screening.\nEach of the phases of the operatives' tasks required a tremendous amount of time, patience and, above all, cover. The operatives had to blend in (in this case, they didn't do so well enough). Russians have always had a tremendous advantage over Americans in this regard. A Russian long-term deployment took you to the United States, for example. Were the Americans to try the same thing, they would have to convince people to spend years learning Russian to near-native perfection and then to spend 20-30 years of their lives in Russia. Some would be willing to do so, but not nearly as many as there are Russians prepared to spend that amount of time in the United States or Western Europe.\nThe United States can thus recruit sources (and sometimes it gets genuine ones). It can buy documents. But the extremely patient, long-term deployments are very difficult for it. It doesn't fit with U.S. career patterns or family expectations.\nThe United States has substituted technical intelligence for this process. Thus, the most important U.S. intelligence-collection agency is not the CIA; it is the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA focuses on intercepting communications, penetrating computer networks, encryption and the like. (We will assume that they are successful at this.) So whereas the Russians seek to control the career of a recruit through retirement, the NSA seeks access to everything that is recorded electronically. The goal here is understanding capabilities and intentions. To the extent that the target is unaware of the NSA's capabilities, the NSA does well. In many ways, this provides better and faster intelligence than the placement of agents, except that this does not provide influence.\nThe Intelligence Assumption\nIn the end, both the U.S. and Russian models — indeed most intelligence models — are built on the core assumption that the more senior the individual, the more knowledge he and his staff have. To put it more starkly, it assumes that what senior (and other) individuals say, write or even think reveals the most important things about the country in question. Thus, controlling a senior government official or listening to his phone conversations or e-mails makes one privy to the actions that country will take — thus allowing one to tell the future.\nLet's consider two cases: Iran in 1979 and the Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991. The fall of the shah of Iran and the collapse of the Soviet empire were events of towering importance for the United States. Assume that the United States knew everything the shah's senior officials and their staffs knew, wrote, or said in the period leading up to the Iranian Revolution. Or assume that the shah's prime minister or a member of the Soviet Union's Politburo was a long-term mole.\nEither of those scenarios would not have made any difference to how events played out. This is because, in the end, the respective senior leadership didn't know how events were going to play out. Partly this is because they were in denial, but mostly this is because they didn't have the facts and they didn't interpret the facts they did have properly. At these critical turning points in history, the most thorough penetration using either American or Russian techniques would have failed to provide warning of the change ahead. This is because the basic premise of the intelligence operation was wrong. The people being spied on and penetrated simply didn't understand their own capabilities — i.e., the reality on the ground in their respective countries — and therefore their intentions about what to do were irrelevant and actually misleading.\nIn saying this, we must be very cautious, since obviously there are many instances in which targets of intelligence agencies do have valuable information and their decisions do actually represent what will happen. But if we regard anticipating systemic changes as one of the most important categories of intelligence, then these are cases where the targets of intelligence may well know the least and know it last. The Japanese knew they were going to hit Pearl Harbor, and having intelligence on that fact was enormously important. But that the British would collapse at Singapore was a fact not known to the British, so there would have been no way to obtain that information in advance from the British.\nWe started with three classes of intelligence: capabilities, intentions and what will actually happen. The first is an objective measure that can sometimes be seen directly but more frequently is obtained through data held by someone in the target country. The most important issue is not what this data says but how accurate it is. Intentions, by contrast, represent the subjective plans of decision-makers. History is filled with intentions that were never implemented, or that, when implemented, had wildly different outcomes than the decision-maker expected. From our point of view, the most important aspect of this category is the potential for unintended consequences. For example, George W. Bush did not intend to get bogged down in a guerrilla war in Iraq. What he intended and what happened were two different things because his view of American and Iraqi capabilities were not tied to reality.\nAmerican and Russian intelligence is source-based. There is value in sources, but they need to be taken with many grains of salt, not because they necessarily lie but because the highest-placed source may simply be wrong — and at times, an entire government can be wrong. If the purpose of intelligence is to predict what will happen, and it is source-based, then that assumes that the sources know what is going on and how it will play out. But often they don't.\nRussian and American intelligence agencies are both source-obsessed. On the surface, this is reasonable and essential. But it assumes something about sources that is frequently true, but not always — and in fact is true only with great infrequency on the most important issues. From our point of view, the purpose of intelligence is obvious: It is to collect as much information as possible, and surely from the most highly placed sources. But in the end, the most important question to ask is whether the most highly placed source has any clue as to what is going to happen.\nKnowledge of what is being thought is essential. But gaming out how the objective and impersonal forces will interact and play out it is the most important thing of all. The focus on sources allows the universe of intelligence to be populated by the thoughts of the target. Sometimes that is of enormous value. But sometimes the most highly placed source has no idea what is about to happen. Sometimes it is necessary to listen to the tape of Gorbachev or Bush planning the future and recognize that what they think will happen and what is about to happen are very different things.\nThe events of the past few weeks show intelligence doing the necessary work of recruiting and rescuing agents. The measure of all of this activity is not whether one has penetrated the other side, but in the end, whether your intelligence organization knew what was going to happen and told you regardless of what well-placed sources believed. Sometimes sources are indispensable. Sometimes they are misleading. And sometimes they are the way an intelligence organization justifies being wrong."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:024058de-9c4e-46f2-bbcf-2c7bddff63ba>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you help me understand how both Daniel Buren's vertical stripes and Edward Krasinski's blue tape lines were used to transform their respective spaces?","answer":"Both artists used their signature markings as framing devices to reveal existing architecture. Daniel Buren painted 8.7cm vertical stripes on windows in Warsaw in 1974, while Edward Krasinski applied 20mm blue tape 130cm above the floor around his entire studio space, including those same windows. Both claimed their marks were not objects themselves but rather devices for opening onto a world. Krasinski's blue tape in particular was used 'everywhere and on everything' in his apartment, with him stating 'I don't know whether this is art, but it's certainly scotch blue, width 19mm, length unknown'. His mentor Stażewski described the blue stripe as an intervention by the artist to observe changing phenomena that contain time.","context":["Kansas Gallery, New York, 2014\nKnot Not Nought\nIn 1974, under the auspices of Anka Ptszkowska’s gallery 25*, French conceptual artist Daniel Buren painted 8.7cm vertical stripes over the windows of an apartment in Warsaw that would later become Edward Krasinski’s studio. In the early 1990’s Krasinski applied his signature 20mm blue tape, 130cms above the floor, around the entire studio including the windows that Buren had painted. Both artists conceived of their gestures as being a zero mark that revealed the existing architecture in a space. They claimed that the line and the stripes were not things in themselves, but rather framing devices for opening onto a world. What happened when these gestures intersected?\nIn Knot Not Nought, Sreshta Rit Premnath revisits this historical moment. He uses it to shine a light on the difficulty of distinguishing between a gesture and an object. Redeploying the coincidence of these two previous works of art, he asks if two gestures pointing at each other can continue to function as framing devices, or are they conscripted into objecthood? Premnath brings to bear on this question a philosophical tradition that investigates the relationship between the things that exist and the empty space that permeates the universe. When we gesture toward an object, this school of thought reminds us, we are also gesturing at the nothingness that inheres in it. The being of objects ties the knot between what is and what is nought, but we have not the linguistic means to comprehend this space. It is here that Premnath turns to visual representation.\nPerformance # 25 and Gradient render the dimensions of a specific pair of windows in Krasinski’s studio. The first uses a gradient of black to white produced by bleaching linen. In the second, he uses a gradient from Chroma Key Blue to Chroma Key Green–standard backdrop colors used in the film and TV industry, which are normally replaced with scenery or effects in post-production. Premnath frequently uses these colors as “zero colors” that exist in order to be replaced, while still allowing an infinite gradient of possibility from one to the other.\nJ’ai perdu la fin (I have lost the end) is based on a performance by the same name in which Krasinski attempted to disentangle a long black cable. In Premnath’s sculpture of a black tube that snakes through a rectangular wooden frame, Krasinski’s cable is replaced by a “Zero Knot.” This is a mathematical form which literally does not have an end. In the same vein, 1 and X Knots works through the intriguing feature of the zero knot which may appear in an infinite number of entangled forms, all resolving to zero. Each frame of the series Zettel also animates this unending variation on zero. Titled and scaled after the first edition of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s book of the same name, these prints were made by placing bleach-soaked twine on glossy, black C-Prints and lifting off the emulsion from their surfaces.\nFinally, there is the small aluminum print in which the caption for a zig-zagging sculpture by Krasinski is replaced by a fragment from Zettel: “but I cannot say this of the line VVVVV.” This, the only hand-drawn mark in Zettel, brings Wittgenstein and Krasinski into conversation. The line that cannot be spoken of also bears a relation to a painted-over line of blue tape that runs around the perimeter of the gallery space, a ghost of a line that is both there and not.\nIn a way these pieces function as a frame for the more philosophical questions that Premnath probes: how is it possible to speak about nothingness? How does the knot he ties between each pair of gestures speak to the void in which they both take place? Is there a kind of triple negation here – not, not, not – that provides an implicit affirmation? Such are the questions that this show ponders. Like its onomatopoetic homonym – knock, knock, knock – it suggests a passageway into conceptual works that both appropriates and moves past our current condition.\n*The gallery changed its name to the number of each of its consecutive events, Buren’s being the 25th event.\n–Sreshta Rit Premnath\nEK: Shall we begin?\nLW: Where shall we begin?\nEK: Blue tape, 20mm wide, 130cm high. That’s where I begin.\nLW: What about it? Is that a rule of some sort–a guiding principle?\nEK: It’s simply a line. It demarcates space.\nLW: A line or a loop? A circumscription, a boundary, a mode of separation.\nEK: Others make art that separates. I make art that connects.\nLW: Ah, this blue tape is art then.\nEK: Well, it may or may not be art, but it’s certainly blue tape, 20mm wide, 130cm high.\nLW: But so is everything else. I mean, everything is at the very least itself.\nEK: Yes, but this is rarely apparent. In fact things almost never appear to be what they are.\nLW: But are things not also what they appear to be? We can never separate things from the line–the tape–which draws our attention to them, simultaneously intersecting them and crossing them out.\nEK: The tape is merely a stand in. It is a finger pointing at the moon. We mustn’t mistake the finger for the moon. And yet, without the finger we may altogether miss the moon.\nLW: Then mustn’t we ask, what is a thing? What demarcates a thing and separates it from another? What separates the blue tape from all the (other) objects it intersects? Is this separation simply our perception or is there a real distinction that cleaves one thing from another.\nEK: The answer is rather simple. We see their separation. We may not know how we know it but we know it. This certainty precedes our knowledge.\nLW: I cannot disagree more. On the contrary, in every serious philosophical question uncertainty extends to the very roots of the problem. We must always be prepared to learn something totally new.\nEK: But then where do we begin?","Solidarity Avenue/Aleja Solidarności\n9 October – 29 November | Opening 8 October 6.30–8.30pm\nThis exhibition brings together artworks and archival material documenting Edward Krasiński’s apartment installation, paralleling and contrasting it with the work of John Latham and the living sculpture of Flat Time House. Organised in partnership with Avant-Garde Institute, which is run by Foksal Gallery Foundation, the exhibition includes works by the two main protagonists, films by Babette Mangolte and Ryszard Waśko, and photographs by Marek Niemirski, Eustachy Kossakowski, and Krzysztof Wojciechowski. Organised with Avant-Garde Institute, Foksal Gallery Foundation and culture.pl\nEdward Krasiński lived and worked from 1970 until his death in 2004, on the top floor of a socialist tower block on Solidarity Avenue/Aleja Solidarności, Warsaw. Krasiński first moved in as the lodger and friend of Henryk Stażewski, a leading figure in the Polish Avant-Garde movement, who had been given the expansive space by the increasingly culturally progressive communist state in 1962. Following Stażewski’s death in 1988, his works and belongings were removed, except for the dangling picture wires and shadows where works had once hung, leaving 120 square metres in which Krasiński began to make and install his own work. Much of Krasiński’s work after this time, was made in response to the history of the apartment and its previous owner with one of the most notable features being the blue taped line, stuck by Krasiński horizontally at the height of 130cm, ‘everywhere and on everything’. ‘I don’t know whether this is art’, he commented, ‘but it’s certainly scotch blue, width 19mm, length unknown’.\nDescribed by Krasiński’s mentor and landlord, Stażewski, “the blue stripe is the intervention by the artist who is an on-looker/witness of the events taking place. It is an observer of changing phenomena that contain time. All that exists is time. Even inanimate objects are not extemporal: they are mutable”. The line, which had marked Krasiński’s work and everything surrounding it from c.1969, demonstrates a spatio-temporal dynamism that this exhibition brings into dialogue with Latham’s own time-based theories. Latham too determined that an artist had the capacity to “observe”, reflecting and reaching insights through intuition and therefore understood the fundamentally temporal dimension of all objects and phenomena.\n Lena Kiessler and Joanna Mytkowska (eds.), Edward Krasiński: Interwencja, Warsaw 2001.\n Henryk Stażewski H Stazewski quoted in the catalogue Edward Krasinski, Galeria Zapiecek, Warsaw 1976\nEdward Krasiński (1925-2004) studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Cracow during the war, then at the Cracow Academy of Fine Arts. In the 1950s, he moved to Warsaw. He debuted in the early 1960s with shows at Warsaw’s Krzywe Koło Gallery and Cracow’s Krzysztofory Gallery, presenting his Objects in Space and sculptures that were minimalistic in their form. In 1966, with Anka Ptaszkowska, Wiesław Borowski, Mariusz Tchorek and Henryk Stażewski, he co-founded the Foksal Gallery. From 1969, he started working with blue Scotch tape, which he used for the first time in the courtyard of the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris during the 3éme Salon International de Galeries Pilotes. His works were exhibited as part of the Guggenheim International Exhibition. Sculpture from Twenty Nations (1966) and the Tokyo Biennale: Between Man and Matter (1970) as well as in solo shows at the Kunsthalle Basel (1996), the Zachęta in Warsaw (1997) and the Generali Foundation in Vienna (2006).\nThe Avant-Garde Institute/ Instytut Awangardy was founded in 2004 by the Foksal Gallery Foundation and opened for the public in 2007. Its main purpose is to preserve Edward Krasiński’s studio and make it available to the public. In the apartment/studio that Krasiński inherited from Henryk Stażewski, a pioneer of avant-garde art in Poland, has been preserved a unique collection of works arranged by the artist in the years 1988–2002. The installation remains unchanged since Krasiński’s death in 2004.\nIt is not only the themes explored in the works of the two artists which are uncannily parallel, despite never having met – they both problematised the binary of public/private in their own homes. Krasiński (and Stażewski before him) and Latham’s doors were always open to artists, intellectuals, students and their homes became hubs of activity and learning. By using the blue tape to line his apartment walls, Krasiński conceptually enclosed his life within his art practice, breaking the distinction between living and working. His home was a destination in Warsaw and on one visit, Daniel Buren contributed to the apartment’s growing installation by marking the windows with his own signature stripes. Latham’s Peckham home had been a semi-public space since his arrival to the former DIY shop in the late 1980s. In 2003 Latham declared it a living sculpture, naming it Flat Time House after his theory of time. He designated anthropomorphic attributes to each area of the house (The Face, The Mind, The Brain, The Body Event and The Hand), as a spatial division of labour with each body part corresponding with the activity that took place there. In The Mind, Latham installed a collection of his own works as educational apparatus that visually communicated his Time Base Theory that the visitor (and himself) could contemplate and understand intuitively. In the exhibition, Solidarity Avenue, Krasiński’s blue line cuts through both Latham and his own works as well as the house’s contents; furthering the claim for the house as a total, dynamic and living artwork.\nFollowing Krasiński and Latham’s deaths in 2004 and 2006 respectively, their families faced deciding the fate of the artists’ homes/studios/artworks. With the generosity of Krasiński’s daughter Paulina Krasińska, the Foksal Gallery Foundation founded the Avant-Garde Institute (Instytut Awangardy) on Solidarity Avenue/Aleja Solidarności. Its main purpose is to preserve Krasiński’s studio and make it available to the public and has done so, leaving the contents of the studio-installation untouched, to deteriorate over time. The Foksal Gallery Foundation has built a glass enclosure on the spacious penthouse terrace where contemporary exhibitions, lectures, workshops and academic sessions, form a broad context for the tradition created by Stażewski and Krasiński. In 2008, following refurbishment, the Flat Time House Trust was formed and the house re-opened as FTHo Institute; a gallery, archive and residency space with temporary exhibitions events and an alternative education programme. Although the ambitions and physical spaces of the Avant-Garde Institute and FTHo differ, the connections between the artists who lived within their walls and their institutional motivations are clear. As FTHo closure approaches (FTHo is to permanently close in July 2016), we reflect on our institution, its history and relevance in contemporary art discourse. By exhibiting the work of artists – such as Krasiński – who shared with Latham a similar use of space, artistic preoccupation with time and institutionalised legacy, we can represent the complexity and potential within the artist’s home and studio."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c459f5ec-d5c8-4ad9-83ec-cbfe0a7f797c>","<urn:uuid:cf8fd399-6a14-4a82-86b1-529d858fedf7>"],"error":null}

{"question":"therapy goals comparar: stuttering vs occupational","answer":"Stuttering therapy goals focus on reducing stuttering frequency, decreasing tension during stuttering moments, decreasing avoidances, learning about stuttering, and improving communication skills like eye contact. In contrast, occupational therapy goals target improving fine and gross motor skills, self-help skills, play skills, relationship skills, handwriting, and visual perceptual skills to help children participate in everyday activities.","context":["Stuttering Therapy for Children\nWritten by Lisa A. Scott, Ph.D.\nShould My Child Attend Speech Therapy?\nDeciding whether to take your child to speech therapy can be a difficult decision, however. Many parents are concerned that taking a child to therapy will increase his or her awareness of the stuttering and thus have a negative effect, or are unsure about the best time to start their child in therapy especially when they get conflicting advice about whether to “wait and see” versus take action. Adding to the confusion, research suggests that as many as 70% of all children who start stuttering will outgrow it on their own with no speech therapy. But, research also indicates that if a child has been stuttering longer than one year, the likelihood that he or she will outgrow it without any speech therapy is reduced.\nUnfortunately, there are no firm guidelines about the best time to start therapy although most speech-language pathologists will recommend starting therapy within 6-12 months after you have first noticed the stuttering. One thing we do know, though, is that all children can benefit from therapy, although the outcomes are different for different children.\nAs a result of speech therapy, some children are able to eliminate stuttering completely. Others learn strategies that help them stutter less, while yet other children learn to talk in a way that is easier and less tense even though some stuttering is still noticeable. Most importantly, all children can learn to become more confident in their speaking skills no matter how much stuttering they may still have.\nDeciding to take your child to stuttering therapy is an important step in helping your child. Once you have made this decision, getting information about stuttering and stuttering therapy will help you decide:\n- The speech-language pathologist who is right for you and your child;\n- The amount, length, and cost of treatment;\n- Possible goals for speech therapy; and,\n- The amount of success to be expected.\nChoosing a Speech-Language Pathologist\nHow do you find a speech-language pathologist (SLP) who is right for you and your child? First, learn as much as you can about stuttering so you will know whether the SLP you choose is also knowledgable about childhood stuttering. You may even want to read more about stuttering therapy. This website offers information about stuttering and stuttering therapy, as do many of the products we offer to families.\nAlso, use a referral source. Our list of therapists has names of people who specialize in treating stuttering. If one is not located near you, contact a local university, hospital, or speech and hearing clinic. Universities that have training programs in speech pathology often have a speech clinic that will provide therapy for stuttering.\nYour local school district is required by federal law (IDEA) to offer speech therapy to children who are eligible. Contact your local school district’s special education department to find out more about having your child screened and evaluated for stuttering.\nOnce you’ve contacted a speech pathologist, interview them. There are many important questions you will want to ask, but a few in particular are very important.\n- How comfortable are you with evaluating and treating stuttering? This is important because some speech pathologists are not comfortable working with stuttering.\n- How many children who stutter have you worked with? This will help you determine whether the speech pathologist has the kind of experience you need.\n- What do you think the primary goals of stuttering therapy should be for a child? This will help you decide whether the speech pathologist’s ideas about goals match your own.\n- What approaches do you use in speech therapy? How often is therapy scheduled? It’s important that the therapy be scheduled at a time that will work well for you, your child, and the SLP. Sometimes the therapy schedule the speech pathologist offers will not work for you because of your job, your child’s naptime, or other family commitments. Getting to therapy should not be extremely inconvenient or stressful.\n- What do you believe the parents’ role should be in speech therapy? For most children, the degree of success they will experience in therapy is directly related to the amount of support they receive from their families in making necessary changes. Finding a speech-language pathologist who believes that you have a crucial role in therapy and is willing to help you learn how to best help your child is an important part of this process.\nTherapy Amount, Length, and Cost\nThe amount of stuttering therapy needed and length of time involved are related to each other and are usually different for each child. The decision about how much therapy is needed and how often it should be scheduled is usually made following a stuttering evaluation.\nIf you seek services through your local school district and your child is found eligible, the evaluation and any needed therapy will be free. However, if you seek services from a speech pathologist in private practice or working in a clinic, you will have to pay yourself or have services billed through your insurance. A thorough evaluation usually ranges from two to four hours and may cost between $300 and $500, depending on your location and the speech pathologist’s charges. These charges can vary greatly, so be sure to ask about costs when making the initial call to the speech pathologist. Also, check to see if your health insurance covers the cost of the evaluation. (You may want to read SFA’s Guide to Obtaining Reimbursement for Stuttering Treatment.)\nOnce you’ve completed the evaluation process, the speech pathologist will explain your results to you and together the two of you will begin thinking about the length of time that you can expect your child to be in therapy and how often it should be scheduled. Therapy length and amount needed depend on your child’s needs, the type of therapy itself, and the severity of the stuttering problem.\nHourly therapy charges generally range from $50.00 to $125.00 dollars. Again, these charges will depend on your location and the speech pathologist’s charges per hour; local university speech and hearing clinics often charge less because of their training mission. At many university programs, it is possible to get an evaluation and therapy at lower rates than those listed here. However, if your child is receiving therapy through your school district, there will be no charge.\nIf you take your child to speech therapy with a speech-language pathologist working in private practice or through a local clinic, contact your insurance company before you get an evaluation or go for therapy to find out whether they cover stuttering therapy. It’s important to ask about stuttering therapy in particular because many insurance companies will pay for speech therapy that is restorative (i.e., after a stroke or brain injury), but may not pay for stuttering therapy when it’s viewed as a chronic speech disability.\nExpectations for Success\nAs you work with the speech pathologist to meet your child’s goals, you will also set your criteria for success. Becoming an effective communicator and living successfully with stuttering should be among the most important of these criteria.\nGoals for Therapy\nStuttering therapy for children usually means learning to talk in an easier manner, and to build positive emotions, and attitudes about talking. As a result, length and type of therapy can vary greatly depending on your child’s needs. A list of sample therapy goals for children includes:\n- Reducing the frequency of stuttering;\n- Decreasing the tension and struggle of stuttering moments;\n- Working to decrease word or situation avoidances;\n- Learning more about stuttering; and,\n- Using effective communication skills such as eye contact or phrasing.\nWorking together with a speech pathologist who is knowledgeable about stuttering will help your child learn to talk successfully and well.","Pediatric Occupational Therapists are trained professionals who are experts in working with children with developmental disorders that may affect their fine and gross motor skills and/or cognitive skills. The therapy they provide can help children improve their ability to participate in everyday activities, such as writing with a pencil, getting dressed, jumping, and climbing. Occupational therapy can be critical in helping children participate fully in school activities and social play.\nAs important as occupational therapy may be for children with motor difficulties, the process may be intimidating to a child who has not previously received therapy services. Similarly, it can be overwhelming for a parent who is unfamiliar with the process and how it all comes together. Understanding what to expect prior to starting therapy can reduce anxiety and open up a more receptive family.\nBefore any therapy begins, your child will undergo a full evaluation of his or her skills to determine their areas of strength and areas of need. Evaluations may include both standardized tests and informal observation of your child’s self-help skills, play skills, relationship skills, fine and gross motor skills, handwriting, visual perceptual skills, and other areas. These evaluations will be conducted by a licensed occupational therapist, who will determine if treatment is necessary. For age-appropriate deficits, the OT may suggest activities you can do at home with your child to help develop their skills. For areas of greater need, they may suggest intervention to strengthen these skills.\nTreatment Program Development:\nAfter an occupational therapist conducts an evaluation and determines that therapy is indicated, he or she will develop an individual treatment plan that will best suit the needs of your child. As occupational therapy covers a range of physical, sensory, and social-emotional areas, there are a wide range of treatment methods that may be used in your child’s therapy. Some occupational therapists may also be trained and/or certified in specialized areas, such as aquatic therapy, DIR/Floortime, and sensory integration. Each occupational therapist will use their experience and high level of training to determine the best path for your child’s therapy.\nActual treatment will commence after your child’s occupational therapist has determined the optimal course of action to meet their needs. Therapy may occur in a variety of settings. In the school, your child may be pulled from their regular class to complete therapy, may work with them during recess, or during special classes like gym or art. In this setting, therapy is often done in a small group setting. Private therapy is often conducted individually. You may bring your child to a clinic, or the therapist may come to your home. Toys and games are often incorporated into therapy sessions to make them fun and engaging for your child while also accomplishing specific goals. The frequency and duration of sessions will depend on your child’s needs, the setting, and the recommendations of the occupational therapist.\nOccupational therapy can be a hugely beneficial process for your child’s well-being and overall life participation.

{"question":"Can you explain the relationship between 'skilled incompetence' defense mechanisms and Sigma quality levels?","answer":"While 'skilled incompetence' is a defense mechanism that prevents people from questioning their beliefs and maintains control by suppressing feelings of insecurity during organizational change, Sigma quality levels are statistical measurements of process performance that indicate how well a process is controlled. The connection is that skilled incompetence can actually hinder achieving higher Sigma levels (like moving from 3σ with 66,807 defects per million to 6σ with 3.4 defects per million) because it prevents honest evaluation and improvement of processes. This resistance to questioning established practices can maintain lower quality levels by blocking the kind of open analysis and change needed for process improvement.","context":["Organizational learning versus the annual planning paradoxCulture change is a big part of any organizational transformation and there is no single formula for success when it comes to evolving a company’s culture. Just as each organization is unique, each transformation will be unique. Each company will have to live and learn its new ways of working. In order to compete in an ever changing market, companies need the ability to learn and adapt. A firm 'learns' through the spread of innovative solutions discovered by individuals faced with real problems across the organization.\nThe PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is a popular framework for continuous improvement that can be used to describe many organizational innovation initiatives today. To learn and adapt quickly, organizations need to iterate through the PDCA cycle as many times as possible in the shortest amount of time possible.\nInnovations created this way are made tangible when they are published and standardized. As it turns out, even the most conservative companies publish and standardize - where they lose out is in the speed of execution of learning. Publicly traded companies established under the traditional competitive landscape are usually still managed with annual planning cycles, bogged down by bureaucratic structures and driven by short-term financial goals. These elements prevent the agile innovation necessary to get ahead in the competitive landscape we see today.\nLong budget cycles combined with short-term focus can cause a lack of alignment between long term plans and short term decisions because investment plans made annually are measured every quarter. Who would dare to innovate when an error in annual planning will be criticized at least three times before you have a chance to change your plan?\nOrganizations don’t learn - people learn and change the organizationOrganizational knowledge is an aspect of its culture and reflects the history of organizational learnings. But one can’t keep all this knowledge in one’s mind. Instead, a simplified model based on generalizations is used. This codified knowledge is called a mental model and is communicated between members of the organization.\nMental models have a big role in how organizations make decisions and learn from it, through processes we call single-loop learning and double-loop learning: Mental models shared by the organization determine the practices used to perform a certain task. From results, you can make the adjustment, improvement or correction of a given practice. This is the single-loop.\nSometimes, however, the results lead us to question existing mental models - the very same models that the organization currently uses to share information and has been using to make decisions. This is called double-loop learning, a second order learning where one questions, for example, why a group does things the way they do.\nThis process would be relatively simple if not for the fact that, according to Yale and Harvard scholar Chris Argyris, usually people and organizations bring not one but two mental models: the first is what we call Espoused Theories - the way the organization communicates explicitly on its website, through marketing materials, training materials, speeches and other artifacts. Conversely, along with this public mental model, organizations also have a set of Theories-in-use, the tacit models that they actually use to make decisions and that are not discussed openly.\nWhen a change in the mental model means confronting the inconsistency between what we think and what we say, a natural defense mechanism kicks in that causes us to avoid questioning our beliefs. This tendency is what Argyris calls 'skilled incompetence'. When this skilled incompetence mechanism is in play, people demonstrate a need to maintain 'control' and 'win' a 'rational' conversation that suppresses the feelings of insecurity that questioning our comfortably-held beliefs produce.\nThis shows a fundamental paradox: everyone wants change, but few want to change themselves. Although the organization itself doesn’t have feelings, all change goes through people who do. This means that one has to consider human emotions when attempting organizational change. It is necessary to be able to have honest conversations about the current limitations for change and for that, a safe environment is necessary.\nCreate safety before seeking changeIf you want a successful organizational transformation process towards business agility, it is important to first address these two barriers to learning: the high risk that the organizational structures of today impose on innovation; and the lack of discussion about the inconsistency between your company’s Espoused Theories and Theories-in-use.\nOne way to reduce the risk that current budgeting models impose to innovation is to do small, \"safe to fail\" experiments designed to quickly answer your most risky assumptions before committing to a large organizational change. In addition, there are modern management techniques that free companies of annual budget cycles. The book Lean Enterprise is a great starting point to understand new management models like beyond budgeting and how to safely explore innovative ideas.\nOvercoming the mechanisms that create the gridlock that hinders second-order learning requires a culture of trust and a spirit of honest debate based on valid information to support your decisions. This is a challenge that involves an investigation of the implicit mental models of the organization.

It is a method that combines Lean Manufacturing, Lean Enterprise and Six Sigma principles to eliminate waste and improve quality.\nThe origins of Lean Six Sigma can be traced back to 1986 when Motorola came up with strategies to compete with higher quality Japanese products. Japan used the Kaizen approach (continuous improvement) in product development to produce world-class products of high quality.\nIn the 1990’s, an American businessman called Larry Bossidy introduced Six Sigma in Manufacturing and soon after he was engaged to introduce the concept in GE.\nIn early 2000’s the two concepts of Lean Manufacturing (Reduction of waste) and Six Sigma (higher process quality leading to reduced variability) came together as a single concept called Lean Six Sigma. The concept then found acceptance in other industries such as Healthcare, Finance, Retail and Supply chain etc.\nLean focusses on eight kinds of waste (Muda is Japanese word for waste) inherent in processes;\nSix Sigma focuses on improving the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimising variability in processes.\nLean Six Sigma aims to achieve continuous flow of quality outcomes, by exposing constraints between process steps and reducing variability between and within the process steps through a cycle of iterative improvements. Lean Six Sigma uses the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control) phases similar to Six Sigma.\nBasic Concepts of Six Sigma\nSix Sigma quality is a statistical term used to indicate how well a process is controlled in terms of its variability from the mean. It is a fundamental nature of any process that over time and scale, variations will creep in due to a variety of reasons or factors. The aim of Six Sigma is to keep the process running within acceptable limits from a mean (or arithmetic average of a process data set).\nThe word Sigma ( σ ) is the standard deviation or the spread around the mean or central tendency. In simple terms, Six Sigma quality performance means 3.4 defects per million opportunities. It is important to note that not all processes, products or systems need to function at Six Sigma quality level. Other than for critical processes involving high safety requirements, such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, airplanes, manufacturing, etc. it is enough for most processes to function at 3 Sigma or 4 Sigma. The trade-off between achieving Six Sigma or lower levels of Sigma is simply cost and often it is not practical or cost-effective to aim for a high level of Sigma. The table below illustrates the number of defects per million opportunities (DMPO) at various levels of Sigma. It is easily evident as to how efficient processes need to be at Six Sigma level.\nSigma Level DMPO\n2 σ 308,537\n3 σ 66,807\n4 σ 6,210\n5 σ 233\n6 σ 3.4\nLean Six Sigma Case Study\nThe objective of this case study is to illustrate how to apply Six Sigma thinking and concepts to organizational problems and processes.\nImagine a retail organization that uses disparate core systems such as CRM (Customer relationship management), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), Analytics and Financial Accounting to run its business. This organization has 100,000 unique Customer master records that are regularly referenced in sales, order management, delivery, invoicing and accounts receivable transactions. Each Customer master record has 10 attributes associated with it as shown below;\nCustomer Master Records (100,000 unique records)\nCustomer Pricing Code\nThis structure implies that there are 1 million elements associated with Customer master data.\nThese Customer master records are created, referenced and updated separately by different individuals, in different departments and business units, depending on their role and function. For example, the Finance Department may manage elements of Customer master data relating to invoicing and accounts receivable. The Sales team may manage elements relating to Customer orders. As is typical in many organizations and situations, disparate systems and independent work functions cause the following issues with Master data;\nDuplicated master data across systems that are out of sync\nWasted effort in data maintenance\nErrors that get accumulated over time because of data changes made in multiple systems\nBusiness risk arising from poor governance, etc.\nDMAIC Approach to improve the process of data management\nThe DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control) concept can be applied to the above case problem, as follows;\nDefine (The Problem)\nMaster Data, maintained separately in multiple business systems, has been observed to contain an unacceptable level of errors (defects) causing unnecessary manual intervention (extra processing) that is costing the organization money, business responsiveness and customer satisfaction.\nMeasure (The Process parameters and Sigma)\nAn important step in Six Sigma Analysis is to measure the key operating parameters of the process in consideration to understand current levels of Sigma (Standard Deviation from mean). The table below shows the impact of errors (Defects per million elements) in terms of cost and time. An error can be broadly defined as any situation relating to any Customer master data element that requires changes to data arising from any non-business driven reason. Sigma (standard deviation) can be determined by sampling in a specific section or department or the entire organization at data element levels or entire Customer Master record levels.\nIt has been assumed that it takes an average of 10 minutes to fix an error at a cost of $50/hour. These assumptions can be validated in the Analysis stage by end users or by Six Sigma experts.\nLet us assume that sampling shows there are likely to be 200,000 errors (20% of the total volume of Customer Master data elements). From the table, we can see that the current process of managing customer master data reveals a Sigma between 2 and 3, implying it is costing the organization at least $556,725 in remediating these process errors. It is useful to note that data volume may also grow at 20% year on year and with growth in master data volume there is also an increase in DMPO.\nAnalysis (Why are there errors in the process?)\nThe errors in the process may be occurring due to one or a combination of the following reasons;\nAsynchronous editing of Customer master data elements in different systems\nLack of a concept of Master data and downstream systems for data leading to uncontrolled changes\nLack of formal data governance policies and procedures defining how Master data is created and edited\nImprove (How can the process be improved?)\nThe process for managing Customer master data and its elements can be improved through several options;\nNominating one of the systems (CRM or ERP or Financial or Analytics systems) as the Master system for Customer data and setting up integrations between that designated Master system to propagate changes\nImplementing a centralized, organization-wide Master Data Management (MDM) system to manage and control all Customer master data. This MDM system will then propagate all changes to master data to all other systems referencing that data through integrations (This may be a costlier option but improve process accuracy the most and help achieve 4 σ or 5 σ efficiencies)\nSetting up a manual governance process to manage changes to Master data in all systems in a coordinated way (This may be the cheapest option but may not improve process accuracy significantly and in a sustained manner)\nControl (How can the process be controlled?)\nRegardless of which option is chosen to improve the process efficiencies, it is important to ensure that process parameters are regularly measured and action taken to remediate. This is done by implementing good data governance initiatives.\nLean Six Sigma is a concept that aims to improve process performance and efficiencies by reducing waste and eliminating errors. It relies on collaboration amongst team members to achieve that. Lean Six Sigma uses the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control) phases to reduce errors. As such it is a evidence-based, data driven approach to improvement that focuses on defect prevention. Lean Six Sigma initiatives improve customer satisfaction and profitability by reducing variation, waste and cycle time while promoting work standardisation and flow.\nIt is recommended that organizations new to the Lean Six Sigma begin by implementing the Lean approach to make the workplace as effective and efficient as possible, reducing waste and using value stream mapping to improve throughput. When process problems persist, the more technical Six Sigma statistical tools can be applied by a team of specialists in various areas of the overall process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9d086f3b-e8bc-48a3-95ef-9d86af946ff1>","<urn:uuid:02bb5903-0b04-4b5d-bf7f-7f6c52131372>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you please compare Sir Frederick William Herschel's earliest astronomical discovery with the first asteroid ever found - which came first?","answer":"Herschel's discovery of Uranus in 1781 came before the first asteroid discovery. The first asteroid, Ceres, was discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi on New Year's Day in 1801, about 20 years after Herschel's historic finding of Uranus, which was the first new planet discovered since antiquity.","context":["Sir Frederick William Herschel (1738-1822) was born in Hanover, Germany and became well known as both a musician and as an astronomer.\nHerschel moved to England in 1757 and, with his sister Caroline, constructed telescopes to survey the night sky. Their work resulted in several catalogues of double stars and nebulae. Herschel is famous for his discovery of the planet Uranus in 1781, the first new planet found since antiquity.\nHerschel made another dramatic discovery in 1800. He wanted to know how much heat passed through the different coloured filters he used to observe sunlight. He noted that filters of different colours seemed to provide different amounts of heat. Herschel thought the colours themselves might be of varying temperatures, so he devised a clever experiment to investigate his hypothesis.\nHe directed sunlight through a glass prism to create a spectrum (the rainbow formed when light divides into its colours) and then measured the temperature of each colour.\nHerschel used three thermometers with blackened bulbs (to better absorb heat). He placed one bulb in a visible colour and the other two beyond the spectrum as control samples.\nAs he measured the individual temperatures of the violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red light, he noticed that all of the colours had temperatures higher than the controls. Moreover, Herschel found that the temperatures of the colours increased from the violet to the red part of the spectrum.\nAfter noticing this pattern, Herschel decided to measure the temperature just beyond the red portion of the spectrum in a region where no sunlight was visible. To his surprise, he found that this region had the highest temperature of all.\nHerschel performed additional experiments on what he called “calorific rays” (derived from the Latin word for heat) beyond the red portion of the spectrum. He found that they were reflected, refracted, absorbed and transmitted like visible light. What Herschel had discovered was a form of light (or radiation) beyond red light, now known as infrared radiation.\nHerschel’s experiment was important because it marked the first demonstration that there were types of light that we cannot see with our eyes.\nRecent developments in detector technology have led to many useful applications using infrared radiation. Medical infrared technology is used for the non-invasive analysis of body tissues and fluids. Infrared cameras are used in police and security work, as well as in military surveillance.\nIn fire fighting, infrared cameras are used to locate people and animals caught in dense smoke and for detecting hot spots in forest fires.\nInfrared imaging is used to detect heat loss in buildings, to test for stress and faults in mechanical and electrical systems, and to monitor pollution.\nInfrared satellites are routinely used to measure ocean temperatures, providing an early warning for El Nino events that usually impact climates worldwide. These satellites also monitor convection within clouds, helping to identify potentially destructive storms.\nAirborne and space-based cameras also use infrared light to study vegetation patterns and to study the distribution of rocks, minerals and soil. In archaeology, thermal infrared imaging has been used to discover hundreds of miles of ancient roads and footpaths, providing valuable information about vanished civilizations.\nFascinating discoveries are being made about our universe in the field of infrared astronomy. The universe contains vast amounts of dust, and one way to peer into the obscured cocoons of star formation and the hearts of dusty galaxies is with the penetrating eyes of infrared telescopes.\nOur universe is also expanding as a result of the Big Bang, and the visible light emitted by very distant objects has been red-shifted into the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.","Books & Music\nFood & Wine\nHealth & Fitness\nHobbies & Crafts\nHome & Garden\nNews & Politics\nReligion & Spirituality\nTravel & Culture\nTV & Movies\nAsteroid Facts for Kids\nAsteroids used to annoy astronomers by making streaks their photos and hiding more interesting things. But now they are the interesting things. Here is their story.\nThe first asteroid was discovered on New Year's Day in 1801.\nGiuseppe Piazzi discovered the object that he named Ceres. It was between Mars and Jupiter where astronomers thought there was a \"missing planet\". They assumed Piazzi had found it. The four biggest asteroids were often called planets until nearly the end of the 19th century.\nAsteroids have also been called planetoids, minor planets and small solar system bodies.\nWhen Pallas was discovered the year after Ceres, William Herschel thought it odd that two planets were in similar orbits. It seemed to him that they were a new type of object. He suggested the name \"asteroid\" (starlike), because through a telescope they looked more like stars than planets. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially classified Ceres as a dwarf planet and the other asteroids as small Solar System bodies.\nAsteroids are some of the leftovers from making the Solar System.\nAstronomers think the planets formed by accretion, which means matter clumping together into bigger and bigger objects. The material in the asteroid belt started to accrete. But it couldn't hold together as a planet because Jupiter's gravity kept breaking it up. The asteroids are very interesting to astronomers because they contain material from the early Solar System.\nThere are over a quarter of a million known asteroids, over 12,000 of them named.\nCeres is the biggest asteroid and it's only 940 km (580 miles) in diameter. Most are much smaller. Since they can be as small as a dust grain, there could be billions of them. But even if you could collect all the material in the asteroid belt, it wouldn't make much of a planet. You'd need 25 asteroid belts to get something as massive as the Moon.\nThe asteroid belt isn't really as crowded as it seems.\nClick to see a diagram of the inner Solar System. They try to give you an idea of the numbers of asteroids, but they make it look crowded. The belt is more than 1 astronomical unit (AU) across and its circumference is bigger than the orbit of Mars. One AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, 150 million km (93 million miles). There is lots of space for all those rocks.\nExcept for Ceres, the asteroids are all sorts of irregular shapes.\nCeres has enough mass for gravity to pull it into the shape of a ball. That's why it's a dwarf planet. You can see what some of the others look like in this collection of asteroid pictures.\nAlmost all asteroids are made of rock, but about 5% are metallic - iron and nickel.\nThe meteorites on Earth have mostly come from the asteroid belt. The iron meteorites were highly prized by ancient peoples who didn't have the technology to get iron from iron ore.\nThere are asteroids outside the asteroid belt.\nWe are very interested in the asteroids that cross Earth's orbit. They're called Near Earth Objects. More than 600 of these are also classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids. The Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union keeps a close watch on these, and there are other projects searching for new ones. Unfortunately, we don't yet know what to do if we find one. Millions of years ago an asteroid hitting Earth may have caused the dinosaurs to die out.\nNASA's Dawn mission is visiting the asteroid belt.\nNASA launched Dawn in 2007 and from July 2011 to August 2012 it studied the asteroid Vesta. Dawn has been studying Ceres since 2015.\nThe person who discovers an asteroid usually gets to name it, as long as it doesn't break the rules of the Minor Planet Center.\nThe first asteroids were named for goddesses. But by now the list includes the names of the discoverers and their families, of scientists, writers, artists, movie stars and many more. The names can't be duplicates, offensive, or of living political or military figures.\nThe youngest person to discover an asteroid was Luigi Sannino in Italy.\nIn September 1999, 18-year-old Sannino was observing with P. Pietrapiana at the Monte Viseggi Observatory when they found the asteroid which was later named Palmaria.\nMy Pinterest board \"Asteroids and meteors\" has some related images.\nContent copyright © 2015 by Mona Evans.
