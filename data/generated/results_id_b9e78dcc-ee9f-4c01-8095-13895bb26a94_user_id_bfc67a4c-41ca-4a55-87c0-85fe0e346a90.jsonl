{"question":"Can you compare the early career paths of Gideon Obarzanek et Graeme Murphy dans the Australian Ballet? How they started différemment?","answer":"Gideon Obarzanek graduated from the Australian Ballet School in 1987 and then danced with the Queensland Ballet and Sydney Dance Company before pursuing a career with various dance companies. Meanwhile, Graeme Murphy started his career directly in the corps de ballet of The Australian Ballet in 1971, reaching the rank of coryphée. While both were connected to The Australian Ballet, Murphy began his choreographic journey through The Australian Ballet's Choreographic Workshop in 1971, whereas Obarzanek went on to found his own dance company, Chunky Move, in 1995.","context":["Gideon Obarzanek (born 1966 in Melbourne) is an Australian choreographer, director and performing arts curator.

Considered by many to be an Australian icon, Murphy was the artistic director of Sydney Dance Company for 31 years. But he is equally renowned for his work in the realm of classical ballet. To celebrate the 50th year since Murphy began his professional dance career, The Australian Ballet is celebrating all things Murphy with the opener to its 2018 season, titled, of all things, Murphy.\nBack in 1971, when he began his career in the corps de ballet of The Australian Ballet, Murphy never imagined that he would be in this position 50 years later. He has been lauded by The Australian Ballet as “an Australian dancemaker of unparalleled talent”, and a “master storyteller” with a “peerless place in Australian dance history” who has had an “incandescent career”.\n“When you’re a student, you’re full of wide eyed hope. I hoped to make it to soloist. I only made it to the rank of coryphée,” Murphy reveals. “But to have this happen? In my wildest dreams, and I had some wild dreams…never!”\nHe continues, “When David [McAllister] asked me, I was flattered and amazed. It doesn’t seem like 50 years. My life has flown joyously by. My connection with The Australian Ballet has always been there. Right from the Australian Ballet School days.”\nFrom the ranks of The Australian Ballet coryphée, Murphy took his first steps as a choreographer with The Australian Ballet’s Choreographic Workshop in 1971. From there, he has gone on to create countless works with Sydney Dance Company, The Australian Ballet, and dozens of other companies of international note. The program for Murphy will feature the full version of his retelling of Michel Fokine’s Firebird, along with excerpts from The Silver Rose, Air and Other Invisible Forces, Ellipse, Grand, and the complete Shéhérazade.\nMurphy initially created his version of Firebird in 2009. It was during a year-long celebration of legendary Ballets Russes, the company that staged and toured Fokine’s original Firebird.\n“I love the Stravinsky score,” Murphy says of the decision to create his own version, and to include it in Murphy. “I saw the original, and I wanted to take it on a journey and see what I could do with it.”\nAt 45 minutes long, Firebird will fill most of the hour-long program for Murphy. As you can imagine, it was a tough choice to decide what other works to include.\n“David [McAllister] gave me a choice of which works to choose for the 50 years,” Murphy explains. “I had an hour to fill, and had to choose from so many works. I could have made it 15 hours long. At one stage, we thought about selecting them chronologically. But when you try to put it all into an hour, it’s very hard. In the end, I thought about the dancers in The Australian Ballet and based the choices around their potential and that would challenge and inspire them. I didn’t want it to be an hour of snippets. I wanted there to be good hunks of works so the audience and dancers get a chance to be more involved in each work. They get to see a beautiful moment, and then their brain has to change gear for the next piece.”\nHe continues, “A lot of work I did in that period were full-length narrative works. But I needed to find a significant part of each one. Sometimes an individual character takes a journey, and I want to show a key point in that. Or sometimes it’s a couple of characters. But I also wanted to show large group pieces. And The Australian Ballet has so many dancers, so it’s possible to stage those group pieces. I also wanted variety, in the type of work but also the era of the work. The works we’ve selected are from the late ’70s into the 2000s. The next step is to take that original movement and put it on different bodies than the original ones. Sometimes a work is made on bodies that are very special. David, Janet [Vernon] and I sat down to work out the casting. I’ve worked with the company so much that I’m very aware of who is in the company. It’s a bit like choosing from a chocolate box. It will be fun. A couple of works are really monstrous and driving. But dancers do love a challenge. I find that they enjoy being pushed to work harder and higher.”\nIn his half century as a choreographer, Murphy has seen the expectations of both dancers and dance works skyrocket.\n“People don’t realise dance is about evolution, choreographically and physically. Standards go through the roof with each generation. It’s not just physical. The level of artistry grows. Just to be in The Australian Ballet company, you need amazing strength, power and the ability to do incredible tricks. Then you have to add artistry on top of that. Amazing tricks catch the audience’s eye, but when the technique and artistry mix, then you have someone that will be a really big star.”\nHe has had his share of opportunity to work with those big stars, including Nureyev, Baryshnikov and Fonteyn. Closer to home, Murphy mentions Madeleine Eastoe from The Australian Ballet and, of course, his life partner and muse, Janet Vernon, as some of the few he’s worked with who had both technical talent and artistry.\n“I was so lucky to find someone who was my muse as well as my life partner,” he says of Vernon. “You create movement for them that you have in your mind, and then see what they do with it. That is gold. I’ve been lucky to see such a broad spectrum of talent. It continues to amaze me. It’s like a spectrum of colour. I’ve been lucky to work with so many different people. Today’s dancers are a different breed. They specialise, but they know they have to be well rounded. Choreographers are so demanding. And both dancers and audiences need constant surprise and development.”\nWhen speaking of why the classic ballets are still being performed and reinterpreted today, Murphy speaks of the importance of appreciating both the old and the new.\n“It’s my job to make people aware that you can take a much loved classic and add to it, see it through different eyes,” Murphy says. “It’s about growth. Audiences are forced to change their opinion. I love finding a generation of audiences who aren’t biased. There are only two types of dance – good and bad. I stopped defining dance styles, and people and beauty, a long time ago.”\nHe likens the continued popularity of classic ballets to the longevity of the great composers. “You can’t just choose only to listen to Bach,” he says. “You have to listen to what came after it. But by listening to and understanding Bach, you learn something. And you can take that into what you create, or into how you appreciate something newer.”\nMurphy is most certainly an artist who enjoys, and values, the element of bringing things together that are different. The old and new. The collaboration between choreographer and dancer, and between different types of artists and creatives.\n“I love the collaborative element of dance,” Murphy says. “You commission the score, work with designers, nurture the performers and communicate with the audience. I feel sorry for artists who have to create alone, like novelists. One of the greatest privileges of being a choreographer is taking someone who is not known. You see a spark, or find something in them. You nurture it and release it. And then it is appreciated by others. And then that artist starts to flower. You’ve helped free that strange, eccentric spirit inside them that is screaming to be free. That’s been the highlight of my career. If you are a dictator as a choreographer, it stops that person having that experience. It’s all about the process. The interaction between the choreographer and dancer is when the magic happens.”\nWhen he started out, Murphy says he didn’t know he wanted to be a choreographer. He simply knew he wanted to be involved in dance.\n“I knew my life journey wouldn’t take me out of the magic world of dance,” he recalls. “At the age of five, I knew that’s where I wanted my life to be. I nagged my parents really early. It must have been strange to them to think of me wanting a life in the world of ballet. At that time, The Australian Ballet company didn’t exist, so dance was something that happened in Europe and America. Of course, I wanted to be the magical prince. Then I realised I would never be the prince, but I discovered I had other things that other dancers didn’t. In early days at Sydney Dance Company, I’d choreograph on myself. I found truth in myself and found my voice. That then freed me to help others to find their voice.”\nMurphy continues, “I didn’t think about it. It was an unfiltered, joyous thing. Children dance to music without thinking about it. I just never grew out of it. I don’t hear music; I see it as movement. I wasn’t told to stop doing it. My parents must have thought I was a strange creature from another planet. But I was very lucky. I left school at 14 to dance. My parents were teachers, and it was amazing that they allowed me to escape the education system and be an artist. They saw my glowing eyes and scrimped and saved so that I could do that.”\nWe all know that Murphy creates wonderful, imaginative, compelling dance works, but the way he speaks about his work and his life reveals a person whose creativity is not limited to dance. His words create an imagery all of their own. When asked what he’ll do next, Murphy’s aim is simple.\n“I want to paint and write and be a human poem. The essence of life is poetry.”\nThe Murphy program will light up the stage in Melbourne at Arts Centre Melbourne from 16 to 26 March 2018, and in Sydney at Sydney Opera House from 6 to 23 April 2018.

{"question":"Could you compare the length of Bull's Walsingham Variations with the intended structure of The Canterbury Tales stories?","answer":"Bull's Walsingham Variations, at over fifteen minutes long, is known to be the longest piece of Elizabethan Keyboard Music, consisting of thirty variations on a theme. In contrast, The Canterbury Tales was intended to be much more extensive, with each character meant to tell 4 stories, though the work remained unfinished at Chaucer's death. The Tales ultimately contained 24 stories in total, structured as part of a contest among pilgrims traveling from London to Canterbury.","context":["The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book - Volume 1\nPieter-Jan Belder (harpsichord)\nrec. Netherlands, September 2010\nFull track-list at end of review\nBRILLIANT CLASSICS 94303 [73.14 + 72.23]\nI’ve never been keen on the idea that the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\nwas copied by one Francis Treggian whilst he was an incumbent of the Fleet prison\nas a recusant. The fact is however that these almost 300 pieces constitute the\nfinest collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean keyboard works in existence and\nthat a high proportion of them are by known Roman Catholic sympathisers.\nThere have been several discs of a selection of pieces attempting to paint a\ngeneral view of the collection. Christopher Hogwood recorded a double album\nof many of them - possibly all, I can’t now recall - back in the mid-1980s.\nThis double CD set is said to be Volume 1. If Brilliant are to record each of\nthe pieces then we are in for quite a few volumes.\nThe work that opens Disc 1 also opens the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book itself.\nIt is the longest piece of Elizabethan Keyboard Music known: Bull’s Walsingham\nVariations. It clocks in at over fifteen minutes and if all of the repeats,\nas in the manuscript, were observed it becomes a little mind-boggling. This\nis almost certainly the 450th anniversary of the composer’s\nbirth so it’s apt that such a fine performance should hit our shops. The\nmelody is a simple folk song As I went to Walsingham. It is subject to\na remarkable process consisting of thirty variations on the memorable theme;\nfifteen minutes of solid A minor/major. It allows show-off Bull to indulge in\nsome tremendous musical and technical challenges such as the extraordinary cross-rhythms\nof variations 20 and 21 and the cross-handed variation 28. Bull has created\nan architectonic masterpiece of sustained thought, breadth of mood, profusion\nof decorative devices and massive proportion of form. This is a tighter and\nquicker performance than that by Kathryn Cok on Dr. Bull’s Jewel\n(Lyrichord LEMS 8060). Cok’s collection is entirely devoted to John Bull\nwho, incidentally started life as organist of Hereford Cathedral. He was then\nbeen summoned back to the Chapel Royal where he had trained as a boy, becoming\nknown among the highest rank of courtiers. After this he disappeared off to\nHolland around 1613 when he was about 50. Significantly, in the context of this\npiece, he may well have been a spy for Sir Francis Walsingham in the 1580s.\nAfter all, the popular phrase of the time, “Sing Walsingham for England\nand the Queen” - and this work - could be as fine a dedication to the\nman as Bull thought possible.\nI have no intention of analysing all of the thirty-five pieces recorded on these\ntwo discs in this way but I will pick out a few more highlights.\nRelated to Variation technique was the Fantasia. Although freer\nit tended to re-use earlier material during its progress. The next track in\nsuch a form is by Giles Farnaby who is well represented in the manuscript by\nall sorts of pieces. There are eight Fantasias for a start. The example here\ngrows in excitement and pyrotechnics. Again I prefer Pieter-Jan Belder to another,\nrather measured version by Glen Wilson on Naxos (8.570025). There are five other\nFarnaby pieces on Belder’s double album and none of them dull.\nAnother form found in the book is the linked Pavan and Galliard, the\nformer calm and sustained the latter livelier but using similar material. What\nmakes the next tracks intriguing is that we have the Pipers Pavan and Galliard\nbut by different composers - Martin Peerson and John Bull. The melody had come\nfrom Dowland’s 1597 collection as the song ‘Can she excuse my wrongs’\nbut also from a 1604 collection under the title ‘Captain Diggorie Piper\nhis Galliard’. Oddly, the Bull galliard is very close to Dowland’s\noriginal but Peerson’s is only loosely based on it. Even the memorable\nrising phrase at the opening is never convincingly used. The book contains other\ndances like the Courant. There is one here by Byrd. Jigs appear also; there\nis a Spagnoletta by Farnaby on CD 2 all in compound time. No less than\nfifty-five pieces by him are included in the book.\nThe discs include three In Nomine settings by John Bull. This plainsong\nfragment is found in John Taverner’s Missa Gloria tibi trinitas.\nAlthough composed in the 1520s the In Nomine section of the Benedictus\nwas still used as a compositional didactic exercise. Examples of it can be found\nin pieces written for viol consort and keyboard. The longest of the three In\nNomines (CXIX) is the most remarkable. It is exciting and full of complex\nrhythms, syncopations and imitative counterpoint - quite a tour de force.\nThe other two are shorter but certainly no less complex with passages of three\nagainst two, for instance. These pieces make me realise yet again that Bull\nis not only a fine composer but also a figure of national importance: just listen\nto the so-called Fantastic Galliard.\nVariations on folk melodies or popular tunes of the time are also to be discovered\non these CDs. The Leaves be Green is otherwise known as Browning.\nMany composers, not least Byrd, set it with variations. There is a rather stolid\nsetting here by the Norwich-based musician William Inglot. It has twelve variants.\nIt’s worth searching out a Signum disc, by the by, of wonderful transcriptions\nfor mixed consort of pieces from the Virginal Book by Charivari Agréable\n(Signum CD009). This Inglot piece is played there. John Munday, who was also\na madrigal composer, is represented by several works based on simple folk melodies.\nWe have here his Goe from my Window which is subject to eight variants.\nIt follows the normal procedure of increasing in semiquaver work as it goes\non. For this reason many pieces have to start incredibly slowly so as to accommodate\nthe fast finger-work needed later and to keep the tempo even.\nThe otherwise excellent booklet notes by Greg Holt do not clearly highlight\nthis but there are also descriptive pieces here. These include the justly famous\nThe King’s Hunt by Bull - also on the Signum disc mentioned above.\nThe King’s Hunt by Farnaby is interesting but nowhere near as arresting\nas the Bull. Peerson’s Fall of a Leaf is taken rather briskly by\nBelder. Byrd’s The Bells is a set of variations in nine sections\nbased on a harmonic pattern - a Ground in effect.\nSo the Ground is another form found in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.\nHere a bass or harmonic pattern is repeated many times over with all sorts of\nstuff going on around it. Thomas Tomkins was organist of Worcester Cathedral.\nHis monument is still extant: he was a pupil of John Bull. The Ground\nby him that concludes the first CD iterates forty-six times and consists of\njust two bars. Oddly enough it starts in the treble voice and migrates between\nthe hands. It is certainly a challenge technically with many passages in dreaded\ndouble thirds in the left hand. Others fall into complex triplet patterns. There\nis an even neater performance of this terrific piece on a disc of excerpts from\nthe book by Zsuzsa Pertis (White label HRC 079). Even more extravert and brilliant\nis Tomkins’ eight variations on Barafostus’ Dream on CD 2.\nThere also settings of what one can be termed ‘art songs’ by continental\ncomposers. Examples include Lassus, Striggio and Giulio Caccini whose Amarylli\nwas set as some variations by Peter Philips. He, like Bull, worked in the Low\nCountries. Francis Treggian may well have met them whilst a young man escaping\nfrom the worst calumnies of Elizabeth I’s reign.\nFinally I should just mention the many examples of the Praeludium and the Toccatas\nin the manuscript. Perhaps they are the same kind of piece: flashy opening gambits,\nas it were, to other pieces. Bull’s Praeludium seems to lead effortlessly\ninto the shorter In Nomine. Picchi’s Toccata which he did\nnot publish in his 1621 collection is not known in any other source.\nThere are four harpsichords in use for this recording, three of which are described\nas ‘after Ruckers’. There’s also and one after an Italian\nmodel which seems to be a tad brighter. Otherwise, to my ears, I can tell little\ndifference. I cannot find any logic behind why a particular instrument was chosen\nfor a particular piece. My personal preference is for Cornelis Bom instrument\nwhich plays on most of CD 1. If you think that certain passages sound a little\nout of tune then this is because they include a plethora of sharps. Even G and\nD sharp can sound wrong. We are dealing here with instruments tuned to mean\ntone which I will not attempt to explain now.\nI followed each of the pieces through with the score and was impressed by Pierre-Jan\nBelder’s honesty to the notation. I also liked his use rubato and his\nnever ostentatious ornamentation. He is a veteran of the recording studio with,\napparently over one hundred discs to his name despite the fact that he is a\nSo, a propitious start and I look forward, as I hope you do, to the next volume\nin the series.\nA propitious start.\n1.

English is a language that grew from German and in the 14th century this was quite apparent in how people spoke. Scholars of medieval studies are well-versed in such things, but most of us have no idea how to read or speak in medieval English. Well, now there is an app that let’s you hear Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales read aloud in the language of the day.\nThe book manuscript, written by Geoffrey Chaucer towards the end of his life, is largely thought to be unfinished. Over the centuries dozens of interpretations of his final work have been published. However, being a collection of short stories, the individual tales themselves stand on their own. It has been said that Chaucer intended to have each character tell 4 stories.\nWhat we do know is that the stories were written in Middle English, a language in use from roughly 1150 to 1500. This style of English was influenced not only by the German language, but also Norman French and by Old Norse spoken by the Vikings who conquered parts of the British Isles.\nThe app for listening to The Canterbury Tales, called General Prologue, named after the opening section of the original manuscript, was developed at the University of Saskatchewan. The project was led by one their English teachers, Peter Robinson. In a press release Robinson said, “We want the public, not just academics, to see the manuscript as Chaucer would have likely thought of it–as a performance that mixed drama and humor.”\nThis makes a lot of sense when you consider that the 24 stories in the book are being told as part of a contest to see who has the best tale of all the pilgrims traveling from London to Canterbury. Had this scenario played out in real life, the storytellers would have been boisterous, articulate, funny, and maybe even a bit shocking at times.\nWith the Middle English accent and the heartfelt pronunciation on the app, it reminds one a bit of the Swedish Chef from The Muppets, something that we can’t help but think would have pleased a famous contributor to the project, Terry Jones. A founding member of Monty Python who served as both actor and writer, Jones was also a scholar in medieval texts- although most people have no idea that he was so multi-talented! How fitting that something he worked on should be released so soon after his death. The General Prologue app was released on February 1st, 2020, on what would have been Jones’ 78th birthday and only 11 days after he passed away.\nThis translation is the first of 3 that have been planned. In addition to hearing the General Prologue, later apps from the same project will allow listeners to hear The Miller’s Tale, among other sections of the book.\nThe words were taken from the “Hengwrt Chaucer”, a manuscript believed to have been created before Chaucer’s death by a scribe in his employ, Adam Pinkhurst. The tome is held at the The National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, Wales, UK.\nThe illustrations in this book are so complex and elegant, although you can imagine that after more than 600 years, the paper has changed color and the hues of the illustrations have lost a bit of their saturation. Using the app you can see the “General Prologue” in all it’s medieval glory, traced line-by-line as the app reads aloud for you.\nYou can download the General Prologue app on your Android or iPhone or peruse the desktop version to hear The Canterbury Tales spoken in in true Middle English and view the elegant (if tattered) original medieval manuscript."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:805b8931-7eb4-4f83-a750-6178678b9f77>","<urn:uuid:751bbbbf-028d-45a2-83c8-0772c0ae2141>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What altitude restrictions apply to drone flights in Tanzania, and how do these compare to trigonometric height calculations used in surveying?","answer":"In Tanzania, drones are restricted to flying no higher than 121 meters (400 feet) above ground level and must maintain a distance of 3 kilometers from domestic airports and 5 kilometers from international airports. These height restrictions can be measured using similar trigonometric principles as those used in surveying, such as when calculating the height of structures using altitude angles - for instance, like the TV tower example where the height was calculated using a 23° altitude angle from 430 meters away.","context":["Cotangent - practice problemsIn a right triangle, the cotangent is defined as the ratio of the adjacent perpendicular to the opposite perpendicular.

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1301296.","|http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ A service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine®|\nHermansky-Pudlak syndrome is characterized by a condition called oculocutaneous albinism, which causes abnormally light coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have fair skin and white or light-colored hair. Long-term sun exposure greatly increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers. Oculocutaneous albinism reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye (iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Oculocutaneous albinism also causes vision problems such as reduced sharpness, rapid and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). In Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, these vision problems usually remain stable after early childhood.\nPeople with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome also have problems with blood clotting (coagulation) that lead to easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. Affected individuals have abnormal platelets, which are blood cell fragments necessary for normal blood clotting.\nSome individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome develop breathing problems due to a lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis, which causes scar tissue to form in the lungs. In these people, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis usually appear during their early thirties and rapidly worsen. Individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome who develop pulmonary fibrosis often do not live for more than a decade after they begin to experience breathing problems.\nOther, less common features of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome include inflammation of the large intestine (colitis) and kidney failure.\nThere are eight different types of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which can be distinguished by their pattern of signs and symptoms and underlying genetic cause. Types 1 and 4 are the most severe forms of the disorder. Types 1, 2, and 4 are the only types associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Individuals with type 3, 5, or 6 have the mildest symptoms of all the types. Little is known about the signs, symptoms, and severity of types 7 and 8.\nHermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a rare disorder in most populations and is estimated to affect 1 in 500,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 individuals worldwide. Type 1 is more common in Puerto Rico, particularly in the northwestern part of the island where about 1 in 1,800 people are affected. Type 3 is also common in people from central Puerto Rico. Groups of affected individuals have been identified in Japan and a small village in Switzerland.\nAt least eight genes are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to make four distinct protein complexes. These protein complexes play a role in the formation and movement (trafficking) of a group of cell structures called lysosome-related organelles (LROs). LROs are very similar to compartments within the cell called lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials. However, LROs perform specialized functions and are found only in certain cell types. LROs have been identified in pigment cells (melanocytes), platelets, and lung cells.\nMutations in the genes associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome prevent the formation of LROs or impair the functioning of these cell structures. The types of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome are grouped together by protein complex. In general, mutations in genes that involve the same protein complex cause similar signs and symptoms. People with this syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism because the LROs within melanocytes cannot produce and distribute the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Bleeding problems are caused by the absence of LROs within platelets, which affects the ability of platelets to stick together and form a blood clot. Mutations in some of the genes that cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome affect the normal functioning of LROs in lung cells, leading to pulmonary fibrosis.\nMutations in the HPS1 gene cause approximately 75 percent of the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome cases from Puerto Rico. About 45 percent of affected individuals from other populations have mutations in the HPS1 gene. Mutations in the HPS3 gene are found in about 25 percent of affected people from Puerto Rico and in approximately 20 percent of cases from other areas. The other genes associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome each account for a small percentage of cases of this condition.\nIn some people with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown.\nChanges in these genes are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nThese resources address the diagnosis or management of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and may include treatment providers.\nYou might also find information on the diagnosis or management of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in Educational resources (http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/show/Educational+resources) and Patient support (http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/show/Patient+support).\nGeneral information about the diagnosis (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/consult/diagnosis) and management (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/consult/treatment) of genetic conditions is available in the Handbook.

{"question":"Hey! ☕ Which has a stronger impact on exercise performance - a regular K-cup coffee or a decaf one? Really curious about the difference!","answer":"A regular K-cup coffee (containing 75-150mg caffeine) has a significantly stronger impact on exercise performance than decaf K-cups (2-4mg caffeine). Regular K-cups provide enough caffeine to enhance strength exercises like squats and deadlifts, increase training intensity and duration, and reduce post-workout soreness. Decaf K-cups contain such minimal caffeine levels that they would not produce these performance-enhancing effects. However, it's important to note that excessive caffeine intake can lead to negative effects like increased stress hormones and adrenal fatigue, which can actually harm exercise performance.","context":["How Much Caffeine Is in a K-Cup?Table Of Contents\nIf your cup of coffee has as much to do with caffeine content as flavor, you undoubtedly want to know how much caffeine is in a Keurig cup, as compared to another cup of coffee.\nWhether coffee is part of your morning ritual or caffeine has become a necessary part of your day, many of us have turned to the convenient Keurig coffee maker. With a Keurig, coffee is as easy as popping in a single-serve pod and pressing a button. No grinder, no kettle, no filters, no mess.\nFiguring out a K-Cup’s (or another coffee pod’s) caffeine content can be tricky. Some K-Cups have too much caffeine, some don’t have enough. Lucky for you, we’ve laid it all out. So go ahead, grab a cup of coffee and join us for all you need to know about caffeine and Keurig.\nHow Much Caffeine Is in a K-Cup?\nThe caffeine content in any coffee varies greatly. According to Keurig, most K-Cups have “between 75 and 150 mg of caffeine per 250 ml (8 oz) cup” and even decaffeinated K-Cups have between “2 to 4 mg per 250 ml (8 oz) cup.”\nThere are many variables that contribute to caffeine content, but the main factors that contribute to K-Cup caffeine content are the roast level and the species of the coffee.\nKeurig Cup: Roast Levels\nWhether roasted for Keurig or for non-Keurig coffee makers, the roast level of coffee beans contributes to the amount of caffeine in each bean.\nCoffee is roasted by applying heat directly and indirectly to the coffee beans over a stretch of time. As the beans are exposed to heat, they begin to lose moisture. With the loss of moisture, the beans also lose caffeine.\nThat being the case, beans that are roasted longer and darker tend to have less caffeine than beans that are roasted for less time and are therefore lighter. Despite the classic strong taste of dark roast coffee, more often than not, light roast coffee will have more caffeine.\nTo overcome this, some roasters, such as Death Wish Coffee and even Starbucks, have formulated recipes for dark roast coffee that still have high caffeine content. Moreover, these roasters have made sure to offer K-Cups for these high-caffeine options.\nKeurig Cup: Beans\nThe beans themselves also contribute greatly to caffeine content. There are two main species of coffee plants: robusta and arabica.\nGenerally speaking, robusta coffee has a higher caffeine content at 2.2% to 2.7% than arabica coffee which is closer to 1.2% to 1.5%, despite arabica being a more popular species. Arabica coffee tends to have more interesting flavor profiles while robusta is often easier to grow and produces a more caffeine-rich product.\nMany roasters find the best of both worlds by mixing robusta and arabica beans to create a flavorful and caffeine-dense coffee blend.\nDecaf K-Cup Caffeine Content\nOf course, there are many of us that love coffee day in and day out but need a break from caffeine! We need to know the caffeine content in our coffee cups to limit it just like we do to increase it, though. This is where decaf K-Cups come into play.\nKeurig and a variety of independent roasters offer many different “decaffeinated” options ranging from light roasts to dark roasts, Costa Rican to Ethiopian, and many more.\nIt is important to note, though, that even decaffeinated coffee has trace amounts of caffeine and cannot be 100% caffeine-free.\nStrongest K-Cups with the Most Caffeine\nI often find myself needing a few cups of coffee to make it through the day. Sometimes I wonder if my K-Cup’s caffeine content is enough for me or if I need to step it up and bring in something with more oomph!\nWith a little research and a lot of caffeine, I found some of the best extra-caffeinated K-Cups. Perfect for anyone who needs a little extra energy to start their day.\nDevil Mountain Coffee’s Black Label K-Cups bring caffeine to a new level. With over 1000 mg of caffeine per 8 oz cup, this bold blend is unmatched when it comes to caffeine. Be careful with this one!\nPopular roaster DEATH WISH is known for its high caffeine content coffee and is a fan favorite for coffee junkies internationally. Their Death Cups boast 420 mg of caffeine per pod, more than five times the average K-Cup caffeine content.\nIf the brand’s name isn’t sufficient to rouse you, perhaps their ultra caffeinated coffee will do the job. This coffee is created using a mixture of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans, containing an impressive 325mg of caffeine in every serving. Bonus: It comes in a variety of flavors.\nK-Cups with Regular Caffeine Content\nSometimes, a regular cup of coffee gets the job done just fine. We don’t always need the most caffeine out there and, when that’s the case, these K-Cups are perfect for the occasion.\nOne of Starbucks’ most popular blends, Pike Place Roast is a great middle-of-the-road brew for those looking for a caffeine boost without the jitters. Pike Place Roast averages 100 mg of caffeine per 8 oz serving.\nWith slightly more caffeine than Starbucks’ Pike Place Roast, Caribou Coffee’s Caribou Blend rings in at an average of 150 mg per 8 oz serving. This sits at the higher end of the regular K-Cup caffeine content range but still barely scratches the surface of the extra-caffeinated cups like DEATH WISH.\nFlavorful Decaf K-Cups\nFor those of you who are hoping to avoid caffeine almost entirely but can’t stand the thought of life without coffee, we’ve got you covered! Decaf K-Cups are easy to find and just as easy to enjoy.\nPer 8 oz serving, the Original Donut Shop Decaf Coffee only has 4 mg of caffeine. Not even registering on the caffeine range for regular K-Cups, you are unlikely to feel any effects from this level of caffeine.\nLikewise, Maud’s Dark Roast Decaf Coffee, Tall Dark and Handsome, has less than 5 mg of caffeine per 8 oz serving. Feel free to end your day with a cozy cup of Maud’s without the fear of restless nights.\nWhat is a K-Cup?\nKeurig coffee makers use K-Cups to brew single-serve portions of coffee. K-Cups are small plastic pods that contain enough ground coffee for a single serving brew. K-Cup is short for Keurig Cup.\nDoes a light roast have more caffeine than a dark roast?\nGenerally speaking, light roast coffees have more caffeine than dark roast coffees, whether brewed using K-Cups or whole beans.\nDo robusta beans have more caffeine?\nRobusta coffee beans have a higher caffeine content than arabica coffee beans, usually almost double.\nSo how much caffeine is in a Keurig cup? The official answer is an average of 75 mg to 150 mg for regular coffee K-Cups; however, that is a huge range, and there are plenty of options that still fall outside it.\nFor the caffeine fiends of the world, there are plenty of coffee roasters that push the limits with K-Cups ranging from 400 – 1000 mg of caffeine per serving! That’s sure to get you going in the morning.\nFor those of us who can’t kick the coffee habit but need to lose the caffeine, decaf K-Cups are an excellent way to enjoy your favorite drink without the jitters. Remember, if you are extremely sensitive to caffeine, that these decaffeinated coffees still have a minimal amount of up 5 mg of caffeine per serving.\nOf course, choosing the right K-Cup for you isn’t just about the caffeine content. It’s about the flavor, the texture, the aroma, and so much more.\nThere is a wide world of coffee to be explored and K-Cups are a great way to do it. From small-batch roasters to coffee giants like Starbucks and Peets, there are many choices for your Keurig coffee maker.\nFrom decaffeinated to ultra caffeinated, K-Cups have you covered for all your coffee needs!","How Caffeine Affects Exercise\nThe truth about caffeine and exercise\nDo you know how many people in the world are addicted to caffeine? An exact figure is actually unknown but it is estimated that 80-90% of adults and children in the US regularly consume caffeine- and it seems unlikely that the UK is far off .\nCoffee is everywhere and many of us depend on it so much that life without it would be almost unthinkable. What’s often forgotten, though, is that caffeine is an actual drug and affects the body in a variety of ways. You might now be wondering how your morning coffee can influence your training and fitness goals. Is it good or is it bad?\nFirst off, what is caffeine?\nCaffeine is basically a natural insecticide found in various plants. It’s potent stuff too and goes a long way to killing off various pests which would otherwise be up to mischief.\nCaffeine is not only found in coffee beans but also in tea leaves, cocoa beans, kola nuts, guarana berries, and various other energising plants.\nThe main trick behind caffeine’s energy-boosting powers is how it affects brain chemistry. Throughout the course of a strenuous workday a chemical called adenosine builds up in the brain and binds to certain receptors, causing fatigue and basically forcing your brain into “rest” mode.\nCaffeine prevents adenosine from binding to those receptors in your brain, keeping fatigue at bay. The absence of adenosine causes your neurons to fire faster, and adrenaline and dopamine (among other chemicals) are produced in large quantities.\nCaffeine Can Make You a Superhuman Athlete\nWhen used right, caffeine has the ability to turbocharge everything from your concentration to your metabolism, strength, and endurance.\nOne study from the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that people who took a hit of caffeine before heading to the gym were able to perform significantly better at intense strength exercises such as the squat, deadlift and bench press.\nAnother study found that caffeine allowed athletes to train for longer and at a higher intensity. Similiarly, other studies have found that caffeine reduces post-workout soreness (also known as DOMS, or “I really might fall down the stairs after leg day”.)\nIf that wasn’t enough of an endorsement, it turns out that the overwhelming majority of Olympic athletes take caffeine before their big performances.\nIf you’ve just burst into a wild grin and poured yourself another cappuccino, hold on for a second. It’s not all sunshine and peak physical performance.\nCaffeine Can Make You a Frail, Jittery Junkie\nThe positive effects of caffeine listed above are all very real – but there’s more to the story.\nLike all drugs, caffeine comes with the risk of addiction, fatigue, and diminished hormonal function when overused.\nHaving a shot of espresso before your workout can get you ready to crush all obstacles in your path – but too much caffeine can lead to a dramatic spike in various stress hormones, including the notorious “anti-testosterone” hormone cortisol. This has a negative impact on strength and muscle gain, and will cause your overall stress and anxiety levels to skyrocket.\nThat’s not all, either. Prolonged heavy caffeine use can lead to a condition known as adrenal fatigue which can in turn result in constant exhaustion, depression, physical weakness, and poor overall health.\nAnd the cherry on top? The more you use caffeine, the more resistant you become to its effects and the more you need to consume. When you’ve become properly addicted (which isn’t as hard to do as you’d think), you’ll be needing coffee just to feel normal – never mind superhuman.\nUse It Wisely\nThe bottom line is that caffeine is a double-edged sword. It can push you to new heights, or it can be the rock around your neck which drags you down.\nStick to these simple principles to make caffeine work for you:\n- Less is more – don’t think that you need a huge dose to experience the fitness related benefits. A little goes a long way. Try a single shot of espresso rather than three doubles.\n- Pick your battles – you shouldn’t be relying on caffeine to get by every day. By using it only when you really need it – just before a tough workout or a hectic deadline – you’ll stay healthy and experience the full range of benefits.\n- Keep it simple – don’t underestimate how many empty calories a syrupy gourmet coffee can have. Keep it simple – plain and black if you can handle it."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9730b471-1869-43cb-9017-f1d41a3d14a0>","<urn:uuid:871046f0-0c97-4c02-ad5e-7749dd0e94eb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare the security vulnerabilities between guided and unguided transmission media in terms of data interception, specifically focusing on fiber optic cables versus wireless signals?","answer":"Fiber optic cables and wireless signals have significant differences in their security vulnerabilities. Fiber optic cables are highly secure since light pulses cannot be detected externally, making data interception extremely difficult. In contrast, wireless signals are the least secure transmission medium because they radiate in all directions through the atmosphere, can pass through most physical barriers, and can easily be intercepted by monitoring devices. With wireless signals, data can be interrupted, interjected, modified, stolen, rendered unusable, or even destroyed through active attacks (injecting, deleting, altering messages) or passive attacks (redirecting information).","context":["By Mohammad Bajwa, PhD, CPHIMS, CPHI, RHIA, MCSE\nWhile it has only just emerged this century, the use of mobile health technology (mHealth) in the delivery and management of healthcare is gaining traction due to the global implementation of health information technology. This is exemplified mostly by electronic health record (EHR) systems, wherein patients’ health information resides on computers and travels on computer networks. Normally, the information stored on computers is accessed through wires and is limited to places where such infrastructure exists. With the advent of wireless technology, electronic health information can be accessed by anybody, anytime from anywhere and on any mobile device as long as wireless connectivity is available. Despite this advantage, the security of health information stored on and accessed through mobile devices is cause for public concern. Wireless communication is prone to hacking, and mobile devices, given their size and value, increase the chance they will be lost or stolen.\nmHealth is defined as the use of mobile devices (mDevices) in the practice of medicine. These include mobile/cellphones, iPads, tablets, personal and notebook (laptop) computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and similar other devices that use wireless technology to access health information networks. Such devices often use radio waves for communication either through central access points (hot spots) or satellites. Of these, mobile phones have emerged as the greatest mobile technology gadgets.\nSince wireless signals travel through the atmosphere, diffuse in all directions, and can pass through most physical barriers, they are liable be intercepted. The intent of this article is to review wireless technology, its use in healthcare, its security issues, and best practices to make safe use of this novel technology for the delivery and management of healthcare.\nTypes of mHealth Security\nBefore discussing the security of mHealth, it is appropriate to enumerate four types of information security requirements: physical, network, application, and user security.\nPhysical security implies the security of computers, network hardware, and storage media against intruders and natural disasters. The most common mitigative security measures for this purpose includes using ID badges and biometric authentication for entry to premises, locking computers with desks, and regular backups for data restoration in case of any human-made or natural disasters.\nNetwork security denotes the protection of data and information residing on computers and in transit over the network/internet through techniques like encryption (encodes data, rendering it unreadable by unauthorized persons) and technologies such as firewalls (controls both inbound and outbound data based on the nature of traffic and source); virtual private networks (makes private data communication channel in the public network such as internet); network intrusion detection (notifies the network administrator of any intrusion by email, text message, alert); and intrusion detection and prevention systems (blocks intruder and reports to network administrator).\nApplication security requires validation of services accessing the information, level of information access and use permissions, software patches and updates, software logs, and input validation techniques (best defense against malware/spyware injection).\nUser security is a three-step process that entails user identification through user ID, authentication through password, biometric or two-factor authentication (verifies user), and authorization through permissions (what the user can access and do).\nData Transmission Media\nData and information on the network travels either on wires (wireline transmission media)—the most common being the copper cables (network and coaxial or TV cables) and fiber optic (FO) cables—or wirelessly through the atmosphere. For the discussion of data security, it is pertinent to examine how data travels on these two types of transmission media and their security vulnerabilities.\nWireline Transmission Media\nThe two types of wireline transmission media are copper cables and fiber optic (FO) cables. Copper cables transmit data through voltages (electrical signals), called electromagnetic (EM) waves, as pulses (5 volts representing 1) or no pulses (representing 0). The data from these cables can be stolen by placing a device close to the cable, which can sense pulses and covert them back to 1s and 0s. To avoid this, some copper cables are shielded (covered with aluminum foil) to stop pulses from being detected externally. One typical example of this type of cable is TV (coaxial) cable that not only shields data being braided but can also transmit it at multiple voltage levels, thus catering to the needs of TV, internet, and digital phone requirements simultaneously. Contrary to the copper cables, FO cables are made of glass or highly transparent plastic and transmit data as light pulses. Its twofold benefits include data transmission at almost the speed of light (several times faster than copper cables) and data security, as light pulses cannot be detected externally. Besides being fast and secure, FO cables transmit data in multiple frequencies, enabling several data channels in one cable (video, internet, phone). Verizon FiOS is one such example.\nWireless signals are also EM waves, but unlike the wireline media, they travel through the air or atmosphere at different frequencies (amplitudes). They are advantageous in areas where wired networks cannot be set up (old and historical buildings) or are required temporarily (training or classroom setup). Because the wireless signals radiate in all directions and can pass most physical barriers, they are very valuable in hospital environments or healthcare organizations with mobile workforces. However, they are the least secure, as they can easily be intercepted by monitoring devices, and data can be interrupted, interjected, modified, stolen, rendered unusable, or even destroyed.\nMobile Technology (mTechnology)\nmTechnology is based on wireless technology that moves with the user. It is a portable two-way communication network and includes internet-enabled devices like smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and navigation devices. mTechnology touches all aspects of our daily lives from starting the day with the alarm clock in your phone; managing the day through your calendar, reminders, and notes; communicating through emails, texts, social media; and accessing online information like maps, books, magazines, files, photos, and videos. The common four types of mTechnologies are:\n- Cellular or radio networks: Use distributed cell towers that enable mobile devices (cellphones) to switch frequencies automatically and communicate without interruption across large geographic areas.\n- Packet switching technology (5G network): Organizes data into packets for transmission and reassembles packets into information at destination.\n- Wi-Fi: Radio waves that connect devices to internet through localized routers.\n- Bluetooth: Connects devices over short distances using short-wavelength radio waves.\nMobile Health (mHealth)\nmHealth is the use of mTechnology in healthcare. The World Health organization (WHO) defines mHealth as the “use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives,”1 while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) describes it as “use of mobile and wireless devices to improve health outcomes, healthcare services, and healthcare research.”2\nThus, mHealth is the practice of medicine and healthcare over mobile devices, like smartphones, tablets, and iPads, such as eVisit (only mode of remote healthcare delivery service during COVID-19 pandemic). Although traditionally used for wellness management, their use for healthcare both by patients and providers has increased exponentially.3\nCurrently, mHealth technologies are being used for patient monitoring, patient-provider communication, telehealth, and e-health. Although the lines between telehealth (also referred to as telemedicine) and e-health are blurred, they are two different technologies. E-health is the electronic communication of information for improving patient’s health, while telehealth uses video, smartphones, or any wireless tools or telecommunications technology (network/internet) for specific healthcare delivery and is named after the type of healthcare service: telenursing, telepharmacy, telerehabilitation, teleradiology, teletrauma care, telepsychiatry, telepathology, and teledermatology. Telehealth requires license and an infrastructure to practice, while e-health has no such requirements. Both became routine during COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe global health data breaches in 2020 increased to 24.5 percent against financial services breaches (7.3 percent), once being the reverse.4 Thus, it is pertinent to elaborate on some mHealth security issues to understand their specific security vulnerabilities.\nMobile devices use air interface to communicate and transmit data through the atmosphere. The wireless medium is broadcast (signals diffuse in all directions), and signals can pass through physical barriers (e.g., walls, roofs, and concrete). They are vulnerable to active (through injecting, deleting, altering the message) or passive (redirecting the information) attacks. The signals traveling through the atmosphere can be intercepted, modified, destroyed, hacked, and rendered unusable through ransomware. Being portable, mobile devices are small and lucrative and can be lost or stolen along with data, have low processing power to handle encryption, and can use public unsecure Wi-Fi. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies poses additional risks of healthcare cybersecurity, as healthcare workers can use their own devices to access organizational network, access patient data, and enter medical orders. BYOD policies are advantageous because of higher productivity, as the providers can access health information from anywhere and anytime; they increase job satisfaction by supporting flexible work arrangements; and they increase effectiveness due to more comfort and speed with the use of people’s own devices. However, they suffer from several disadvantages, like data breaches due to lost or stolen personal devices, lack of firewall and anti-virus software, dearth of encryption power, and increased IT costs for supporting personal devices.\nHIPAA and mHealth\nHIPAA requires security of the protected health information (PHI) through its Security Rule that mandates the security of health information through a three-pronged approach: administrative (policy-based), physical (physical access to facility, workstation, and storage devices), and technical (technological requirements to control access to information).5 mHealth devices have potential HIPAA Security Rule compliance issues such as physical loss or theft of devices, data transmission over unsecured Wi-Fi, unencrypted text messages/emails, inadequate or lack of authentication protocols, and poor adherence to BYOD policies and procedures.\nBeside the potential to have HIPAA security compliance issues, other specific mHealth device issues include interference with implanted medical devices (pacemakers) and their use in monitoring vital signs and supporting life-threatening and critical care situations that use a part of electromagnetic spectrum, like mobile devices. They also suffer from diagnostic interpretations due to small screen size, which may conceal some crucial details in EKG, ultrasound, MRI, and X-rays.\nBest Security Practices for Securing mHealth Devices\nAlthough no technique or technology can provide fool-proof security for the data contained in mHealth devices or accessed through them, some measures can minimize the security risks. These include implementation of strong user authentication (biometric or two-factor authentication), automatic lock after excessive number of incorrect logins, remote wiping when a device is lost or stolen, employing encryption for conversations (emails, text messages), developing an application policy for BOYD devices, regular updating to keep vulnerabilities mitigated, and installing security programs/antivirus, as being networked they are apt to all sorts of malware attacks.\nInternet of Things in Healthcare (IoHT)\nYet another breed of mHealth devices are Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) or Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, which is the use of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare. IoHT devices are sensor-based interconnected devices used for tracking assets and resources. In hospitals, they can be used for locating patients, medical staff, and visitors (called smart hospitals), and collection and integration of health data (generation, collection, and communication of health data through wearable devices).6 Other benefits of IoHT devices include savings in medical cost, reduction in medical errors, improved patient experience, manageability of medical drugs and adherence, better control over wastage in healthcare sector, and better outcomes of medical treatments.\nSecurity Mitigation of IoHT Devices\nMitigation of security for IoHT devices include both technological and administrative measures. The technological mitigation measures comprises use of blockchain technology to protect data in IoHT devices, enable IoHT devices to use authentication to validate user identity and access privileges, enable IoHT devices to use encryption for all health-related communication, enable integrity on IoHT devices to verify devices to ensure that they are unaltered and uninterrupted, and ensure IoHT devices are patched and updated to avert any vulnerability.\nThe administrative mitigation measures comprise using the principle of least privilege for required actions and types of communication, logging all user activities and events and monitoring them regularly for unusual activities (duplicate device ID or elevation in privileges), reviewing device data regularly to identify unusual trends or patterns, implementing security best practices associated with protecting and securing sensitive data, and conducting formal education, training workshops, certifications, and participation in mobile security conferences.\nFuture of IoHT\nIoHT devices have a great future in healthcare applications, especially through the integration of artificial intelligence with IoHT in the form of ingestible sensors (ePills, which are pill-sized devices to monitor internal physiology and act as diagnostic devices sending medical information and images to outside connected devices); nano-devices to monitor human physiology and deliver drugs to targeted areas like cancer cells; connected lenses that would determine tear glucose and eyes diseases; and blood clot monitoring sensors to avert heart attacks. Their potential healthcare implications include smart hospitals, virtual clinics, microsurgery, vital sign monitoring systems (which can analyze real-time data inputs from critically ill intensive care unit patients), activity trackers for heart patients to collect lifestyle information, and fitness wearables, to name a few.\nIn view of the significance of mTechnology in healthcare, the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine is published to disseminate the mHealth research results.\n- World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf\n- National Institutes of Health. https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-028.html\n- Phaneuf, A. “How mHealth apps are providing solutions to the healthcare market’s problems” (2019).

The data transmission is measured in bandwidth. The bandwidth will be higher if more signals can be transmitted. Actually, the bandwidth measures the amount of information that can be transmitted through the media within the given period of time. For analog signals, bandwidth is represented in hertz (Hz). It means number of signals transmitted per second. For digital signals, it is represented in bits per second (bps). Different transmission media have different bandwidths. The higher the bandwidth of the transmission media, the more information can be transmitted.\nTypes of Communication Channel:\nThe communication channel or media is divided into two types.\n1. Guided Media.\n2. Unguided Media.\n1. Guided Media:\nIn guided communication media, communication devices are directly linked with each other via cables or physical media for transmission of data. The data signals are bounded to a cabling media. Therefore, guided media is also called bounded media. The guided media are usually used in LAN. The examples of guided or bounded media are:\nTwisted pair wire.\nFiber optic cable.\nTwisted Pair Cable: Twisted pair cable is one of the most commonly used communication media. It is used in local area network (LAN) for data communication between different computers. It is also used in telephone lines to carry voice and data signals.\nA twisted pair cable consists of a pair of thin diameter copper wires. These wires are covered by insulating material (such as plastic). These pair of wires are twisted together to form a cable. The wires are twisted around each other to minimize (or reduce) interference from other twisted pairs in the cable.\nThe data transmission speed through twisted pair cable is about 9600 bits per second in a distance of 100 meters. However, this transmission speed is less than coaxial cable or optical fiber.\nThe twisted pair cable has been the standard communication channel for voice and data communication. But now its use is reducing because today more reliable communication media are available such as coaxial cable, fiber optic cable microwave and satellite.\nCoaxial Cable: Coaxial cable is also referred to as Coax. It carries signals of higher frequency ranges than twisted-pair cable. Coaxial cable consists of a single solid copper wire, which is called the inner conductor.\nCoaxial cable can be used for telephone lines for voice and data transmission with very high frequency. The bandwidth of coaxial cable is 80 times greater than that of twisted pair media. Coaxial cable is also widely used in local area network (LAN). It is more expensive than twisted-pair wire.\nFiber-Optic Cable: In twisted-pair cable and coaxial cable, data is transmitted in the form of electric frequencies. The fiber optic cable uses light to transmit data. The data transmission speed is very high (because fiber-optic cable uses light to transmit data). The data transmission speed is up to billions bits per second. Today, most of the telephone companies and cable TV operators are using fiber optic cables in their networks.\nA fiber optic cable consists of tubes of glass (or thin glass fibers) through which data is transmitted as pulses of light. A typical optical fiber consists of a very narrow strand or fiber of glass called the core. It is thinner than a human hair. The core is surrounded by a concentric layer of glass called Cladding. The diameter of a core is 62.5 microns (I micron = 10-6 meters). The diameter of cladding is about 125 microns. The cladding is coated with insulating material such as plastic, which is called the Jacket.\n2. Unguided Media:\nIn unguided communication media, data is communicated between communication devices in the form of wave. Unguided media provides means to transmit data signals but does not guide them along a specific path. The data signals are not bounded to a cabling media. Therefore,. unguided media is also called unbounded media.\nThis transmission medium is used when it is impossible to install the cables. The data can be transmitted all over the world through this medium. The examples of unguided or unbounded media are:\nMicrowaves: In microwave transmission, data is transmitted through air or space, instead of through cables or wires. Microwaves are high frequency radio waves. These waves can only travel in straight lines.\nThe data is transmitted and received through a microwave station. A microwave station is also called relay station or booster. A microwave station contains an antenna, transmitter, receiver, and other equipments that are required for microwave transmission. Microwave antennas are placed on the high towers or buildings and these are placed within 20 to 30 miles of each other. There may be many microwave stations between the sender and receiver. Data is transmitted from one microwave station to another. Each microwave station receives signals from previous microwave station and transmits to next station. In this way, data is transmitted over larger distances.\nThe data transmission speed of microwave transmission is up to 150 Mbps. Microwave transmission is used in environments where installing physical transmission media is impossible and where line-of-sight transmission is available, it is used in wide-open areas. Today, it is used by telephone companies, cable television providers, universities etc.\nSatellite Communication: A communication satellite is a space station. It receives microwave signals (or messages) from earth stations. Satellite transmission station that can send and receive messages is known as earth station. The earth based stations often are microwave stations. Other devices, such as PDAs and GPS receivers, also functions as earth based stations.\nSatellites rotate approximately 22,300 miles above the earth in precise locations. The communication satellite consists of solar powered, transceiver that receives and sends signals. The signals are transmitted from one earth station to the satellite. The satellite receives and amplifies the signals and sends them to another earth station. This entire process takes only a few seconds. In this way, data or messages are transferred from one location to another. Transmitting a signal from ground or earth station to a satellite station in space is called up-linking and the reverse is called the down-linking. The data transmission speed of communication satellite is very high such as upto 1 Gbps.\nDifferent communication satellites are used to carry different kinds of information such as telephone calls, television transmissions, military communication, weather data, and even radio stations use them for broadcasting. The global positioning systems and Internet also use the communication satellites.\nRadio Broadcast: It is a wireless transmission medium that is used to communicate information through radio signals in air, over long distance such as between cities and countries.\nIn this medium, a transmitter is required to send messages (signals) and receiver is required to receive them. To receive the radio signal, the receiver has an antenna that is located in the range of signal. Some networks use a special device called transceiver used to send and to receive messages in the form of radio signals. The data transmission speed of radio broadcast is up to 54 Mbps.\nCellular Radio: Cellular radio is a form of radio broadcast that is used for mobile communications such as cellular telephones and wireless modems. A cellular, telephone is a telephone device that uses high frequency radio waves to transmit voice and digital messages. Some mobile users connect their laptop computer or other mobile devices to a cellular telephone to access the Web, send and receive e-mail etc. while away from a standard telephone line."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:556cfcd0-022c-4723-a4e5-a1f05c8b063e>","<urn:uuid:e51c6bd8-9c05-4555-a421-b7a7a6a53c90>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which organization started with emergency response first: USAID in Guatemala or IOCC in Russia?","answer":"IOCC started with emergency response first, beginning with an airlift to Russia in its earliest days. This was one of IOCC's first cornerstone programs in emergency contact. In contrast, USAID's work in Guatemala came much later, as described by Lyla Bashan who worked there during her first tour with USAID after joining their foreign service.","context":["How Catlin Gabel helped me learn about the world and the roles we can play in it\nBy Lyla Bashan ’98\nIt’s hard for me to believe I graduated from Catlin Gabel almost 20 years ago! Alas, I’m not sure if I’ll make it to the reunion, because it would mean flying halfway around the world. That’s because I live in Armenia, a small country sandwiched between Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. But I’d love to make it back because the foundation of my international career can be traced back to my time at Catlin Gabel.\nWhen I was young I wanted to save the environment. But it was Catlin Gabel’s academic rigor, high expectations, and commitment to excellence that taught me to direct my passion in specific, practical ways. While at Catlin Gabel, I learned about the field of peace and conflict resolution and later, in college, I learned about humanitarian development. I realized that people wouldn’t and couldn’t care about the environment if they couldn’t provide food, shelter, and safety for themselves and their families. That is why I’ve committed my career to conflict resolution and humanitarian development. Ultimately, it’s a way of helping individual people, the environment, and the world.\nI’ve spent my entire professional life working on, travelling, and living throughout this big, beautiful world of ours. And let me tell you, it never gets boring! But my international career started in our very own, beloved Portland. After my sophomore year at Lewis and Clark College, I began interning at Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian relief and development NGO. After going to grad school in Washington D.C. and interning and working for a few other awesome NGOs, I became a diplomat working for the State Department. My favorite job at the State Department was as a conflict prevention officer for Sub-Saharan Africa. I loved it because I got to travel throughout that region working on a wide range of conflict prevention activities. I met so many interesting people who had to respond to myriad challenges, but ultimately were all trying to just live their lives.\nI loved living in Washington, D.C., and travelling all over the world, but I always wanted to live abroad more permanently. So, after a few years, I left the State Department civil service to join the foreign service of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Being a diplomat of any stripe is interesting work, but I thought USAID would be a better fit for me because I could focus more on humanitarian development. USAID is the U.S. Government’s lead development agency and works in developing countries around the world to help alleviate poverty and suffering, promote good governance and human rights, support economic growth and food security, and improve health care and education.\nMy first tour with USAID was in Guatemala, which is still recovering from its decades-long civil war and facing the crippling effects of the drug trade. My next tour was in Tajikistan, which is a fascinating, isolated country in Central Asia, to the north of Afghanistan. And now, after a few years back in D.C., here I am in Armenia where I serve as Director of the Office of Sustainable Development. My office manages all of USAID’s programs in Armenia.\nI do this work because I believe that development is the most effective way to create global stability and prosperity. Now more than ever, global issues affect all of us. Issues that once seemed far away—health epidemics, financial crisis, conflict—are now intertwined with our everyday lives.\nBecause of America’s political, military, and financial power, it is important for Americans to be engaged with the world. Whether through a career in international affairs or not, it’s important to have a basic understanding of what is going on in the world in order to create positive change. Today, everyone’s voice counts. Catlin Gabel helped me learn more about the world and the role my voice could play in it.\nWe can all work to make the world a better place. Whether it’s volunteering in your community, calling your congressional representative, or donating money to an NGO—all of this is helping. You don’t have to fly off to a Bangladeshi refugee camp, but you do need to care. That’s what Catlin Gabel taught me, to direct my care in real ways. Sure, you’re not going to alleviate global poverty and suffering by volunteering at a local homeless shelter, but you are going to make a difference in someone’s life. And that matters. The ripple effects of positive change can be immense.\nThat’s why I wrote Global: An Extraordinary Guide for Ordinary Heroes. I want to give people a way to easily understand the complexities of the issues and systems that comprise what we call “global affairs.” And it has good career advice! Global is the book I wish someone had written 20 years ago when I was starting my career in international affairs. My only goal is to get others involved!\nWhat most inspires you? Is it working on preventing human trafficking, getting more girls in school, improving sweatshop labor conditions, increasing food security, reducing female genital mutilation, building climate change resiliency, and on and on? All of these issues and more are just waiting for ordinary heroes to focus on them. Domestically and globally there are tons of great organizations out there doing amazing work.\nThe opportunities are endless. All you need to do is take the first step.\nLyla Bashan ’98 serves in the diplomatic corps for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and is the author of Global: An Extraordinary Guide for Ordinary Heroes (Red Press, 2017). Over the course of her nearly two-decade career in international affairs she has crisscrossed the globe, living in Armenia, Tajikistan, and Guatemala and working throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Working for USAID, the Department of State, and non-governmental organizations, she has committed her career to being an ordinary hero and strives to help others to do so too.\nThe views expressed are the author’s own and do not reflect the position of the U.S. Government.\n[Excerpt from Global]\nLyla Bashan’s Global: An Extraordinary Guide for Ordinary Heroes: An Excerpt\nRather than chronicling her world travels and accomplishments, Lyla wrote Global as a way to help others understand how the international system works, and inspire them to get involved. A portion of proceeds from the book are donated to social justice causes.\n[L]et’s agree on one thing: lucky doesn’t mean better. We don’t go out into the world because we are superior. We go out into the world because we want to serve. Because we can serve. I didn’t grow up in a wealthy family, but I lived in safety, I had a warm bed, enough food to eat and access to quality education and healthcare. I am grateful for my good fortune, and I spend my life working to help those less fortunate than me. It’s an honor, and a privilege. Nothing more; nothing less.\nCopyright © Lyla Bashan 2017","International Orthodox Christian Charities: Bringing Community Outreach to a Global Level\nThe Orthodox Christian church has been encouraging parishioners to get involved and give back to the community for centuries. For the global citizens of the International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), that community includes the entire world.\nThe organization was founded in March of 1992 by Charles Ajalat of Los Angeles, Andrew Athens of Chicago, and John Rangos, Sr. of Pittsburgh. According to Constantine Triantafilou, the current Executive Director & CEO, Ajalat, Athens, and Rangos had each been active in their third of the continental United States. However, “they realized that together they were stronger.” Since the formation of the IOCC, the organization has brought over $400 million in aid to people in need in more than 50 countries.\nAccording to Mr. Triantafilou, who joined the organization in 1993, the IOCC’s first program was an airlift to Russia out of Pittsburgh. Soon after, the organization responded to the conflict in former Yugoslavia. “There were sanctions in Serbia and a war in Bosnia so we were responding to all of that,” he elaborates. A stint in Georgia would make up what Triantafilou refers to as “the first three cornerstone programs in emergency contact.” He adds, “We were built on emergencies and as those emergencies died down we kind of shifted towards rehabilitation, recovery, and development to some extent. You can still see our presence in Bosnia. So we try to commit to a region when we get there.” The Bosnian presence he is referring to is a partnership with a local microcredit organization that hands out “small, short-term loans” to help prospective business owners get their companies off the ground, thus driving the country’s economy forward.\nTriantafilou talks about the IOCC’s history as a series of five year blocks. The first two saw its founding and expansion in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The third would see them go into Africa and the Middle East. “We’ve been in the Middle East a long time,” he explains. “It started very small working with the Church of Antioch’s Department of External Relations and Development (DERD). We started with small projects like help for the elderly, that kind of thing. But then there was an influx of Iraqi refugees into Syria, so small projects led to big projects. Right now we’re doing emergency relief inside Syria. That means food and non-food items such as blankets, quilts, clothes, well-digging. We were doing some sustaining activities with the Iraqis such as job training, but right now we’re really in the emergency mode.”\nHe adds, “We’ve also got programs in Lebanon and Jordan. We’ve got a really cool program in Lebanon where we’re working with a very large staff of nutritionists and workers that help with the refugees to see if they’re malnourished. We have a small education program as far as educating the mothers about nutrition and giving food supplements to kind of get the kids back up to healthy weights. We do a lot of water sanitation in the refugee camps, getting the water sanitation facilities and bathrooms and what-have-you up to speed. We have a large project working in schools because there’s been such a huge influx of refugees into Lebanon. The school capacity wasn’t there to absorb that many kids so we’ve been refurbishing the facilities and the schools. In Jordan we’ve been working in the refugee camps helping with small projects and bridging gaps there. Some projects are bigger than others but that whole region is affected. So we’re doing what we can to support them.”\nAside from these emergency-driven programs, Triantafilou says “Greece has always played some sort of role in IOCC’s history.” According to IOCC’s website, the organization has provided more than $16 million in support for Greece through medical supplies, food parcels, and heating fuel, to name a few. “We’ve got a dry goods program but we also have a fresh food program where people get a debit card they’re able to go to a bazaar or a grocery store and buy fresh produce, which is really cool cause they get to do their own shopping,” he explains. Similar to IOCC’s work in the Middle East, Triantafilou says they also have a water sanitation program in Chios to aid the Syrian refugees and take some of the pressure from their influx off of Greece’s already-strained economy. “As a Greek, it’s hard to have to work on an emergency in Greece, but we’re blessed to have strong partners there and strong staff. So that’s going well,” he says.\nBut IOCC’s efforts aren’t just focused overseas. It also has several initiatives in the United States. They currently have people on the ground out west helping with flood and tornado recovery. And, several weeks ago when IOCC’s hometown of Baltimore erupted into violence and riots after a black resident died in police custody, the IOCC partnered with a local charity called Catherine’s Closet to distribute hygiene kits to people who couldn’t leave their homes. “We have a fairly large kit program. We always encourage people to make these hygiene kits. We use them abroad and we use them here,” Triantafilou explains.\nWith billions of people in the world and non-stop emergencies, both natural and man-made, how does the IOCC choose where to help out? According to Triantafilou, aid requests are “not a formal process.” He explains, “Most of the time you’ll hear the invitation in the language from the local church. If there’s an emergency (and we’ve gotten better over the years as far as being able to know who to reach out to) we dialogue with the church to ask what capacity they have, do they want or need us there, do we take more of a backseat role like we’re doing in Greece or are we taking a high-profile lead like we would here in the United States. We kind of evolve and shape ourselves and our footprint according to the capacity and the needs on the ground.”\nOnce a request for assistance does come in, Triantafilou says, “for most big decisions the IOCC staff will bring a proposal to me and I’ll bring it to the Board of Directors. For example, if we want to go to northern Iraq to increase what we’re doing there, we’ll put a proposal together and bring it to the program committee and they’ll study it and then we’ll bring it to the board and the board says yes. This sounds like it takes forever but it can move pretty fast if we need it to.”\nWhen asked if he has a favorite story to share from his nearly 23 years with IOCC, Triantafilou says, “My favorite story would probably be when I first got to Belgrade. I had no idea what I was doing. I’d gone out to Bosnia for my first trip and I was just driving to the different dioceses to meet everybody and introduce myself and figure out what I was doing. I didn’t really have anything to bring with me. So I went to a place in northern Bosnia and the church there had a women’s auxiliary group. I walk into their center and notice that all the hallways and all the rooms are filled with boxes of Danish feta cheese. I was just amazed at how much feta cheese was in there. There was an elderly lady there named Ms. Popovic who I met with and over the next four years we got to become pretty good friends and we increased our program together. When I was leaving to come back home, I went to say goodbye to Ms. Popovic and it was pretty emotional because we’d been through so much together. The war was over by this time. And when I went to say goodbye she said, ‘what do you see?’ and I said, ‘I don’t know, boxes,’ and she goes, ‘what kind of boxes,’ and I said, ‘boxes?’ not getting it. By this time all the rooms and hallways were filled with IOCC boxes. And she says to me, ‘you don’t remember, do you? You promised me the first day you got here that someday this place was going to be full of IOCC boxes.’ She had remembered my promise and we were able to fulfill it. So that was a really special day.”\nThough Triantafilou’s current favorite story is from his early days with IOCC, he’s still very much looking towards the future. “I think there will always be some sort of role for IOCC. Hopefully it’s more on the development side than the emergency side. As for the immediate future, I hope that we’re prepared to sustain our efforts in the Middle East and to be in a strong position post-conflict to help rebuild because I think there will be a lot of work once this thing settles down.” He adds, “when I stumbled into IOCC I didn’t realize I’d found my calling, but I kind of did. It just agrees with me.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:419fc799-728f-4315-8b55-a873c3be2777>","<urn:uuid:f68e524f-8363-42d2-b808-5dfd9752334e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main damage mechanisms in earthquakes and forest loss?","answer":"In earthquakes, the greatest damage usually comes not from the ground shaking itself, but from secondary effects like fires caused by broken gas and water mains, as demonstrated in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Similarly with forest loss, the primary damage comes from indirect effects - when trees are removed, it leads to soil erosion as roots no longer hold soil in place, disrupts the water cycle by reducing atmospheric moisture, and releases stored carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere contributing to climate change. Both earthquakes and deforestation create cascading effects that can cause more damage than the initial event.","context":["What causes the greatest damage in an earthquake?\nThis photo shows the Mission District of San Francisco burning after the 1906 earthquake. The greatest damage in earthquakes is usually not from the ground shaking. The greatest damage is caused by the effects of that shaking. In this earthquake, the shaking broke the gas mains and the water pipes. When the gas caught fire there was no way to put it out. Fire causes the greatest damage in many earthquakes.\nis sudden ground movement. This movement is caused by the sudden release of the energy stored in rocks. An earthquake happens when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks break. An earthquake’s energy is transmitted by seismic waves.\nCauses of Earthquakes\nAlmost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely they may move as much as a few meters.\nElastic rebound theory\ndescribes how earthquakes occur (\nElastic rebound theory. Stresses build on both sides of a fault. The rocks deform plastically as seen in Time 2. When the stresses become too great, the rocks return to their original shape. To do this, the rocks move, as seen in Time 3. This movement releases energy, creating an earthquake.\nElastic rebound theory in an animation:\nFocus and Epicenter\nThe two important words used to describe an earthquake's location are focus and epicenter.\nThe point where the rock ruptures is the earthquake’s\n. The focus is below the Earth’s surface. A shallow earthquake has a focus less than 70 kilometers (45 miles). An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About 75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage. This is because the focus is near the Earth's surface, where people live.\nThe area just above the focus, on the land surface, is the earthquake’s\n). The towns or cities near the epicenter will be strongly affected by the earthquake.\nThe focus of an earthquake is where the ground breaks. The epicenter is the point at the surface just above the focus.\n: Ground shaking caused by the release of energy stored in rocks.\nelastic rebound theory\n: How earthquakes are generated.

The fact is that humans and animals cannot survive if deforestation continues the way it is at present. At present, there seems to be no end in sight and deforestation is capable of altering the future of the whole earth. That’s why it’s important to understand what deforestation is, what is causing deforestation, its effects on our life and planet and how we can together solve this potentially disastrous situation.\nWhat is Deforestation\nChildren often ask, “What is deforestation?” and the answer is simple enough! It’s the cutting down of trees by humans or by natural causes which lead to reduced forest areas. More often than not, humans are the problem with their increased requirement of wood for construction, urbanisation and a host of other reasons and thus cause widespread deforestation across the world. Deforestation is converting wooded areas into farms, ranches or cities. Most deforestation activities benefit the production of other commodities like soy, palm oil, and other lucrative commodities. As of now, the most widespread deforestation is in the Amazon rainforest of South America.\nWhat are the Causes of Deforestation\nDeforestation can happen wherever there are dense trees and it is caused either deliberately, naturally or by accident. The common causes of deforestation are volcanic eruptions, avalanches, hurricanes, climate or temperature change, drought, severe insect infestation, disease, residential, agricultural, commercial or industrial land development, strip mining, logging, unsustainable forest management and human activities. The increased population is also a major factor as the more people, the more are the resources required. This is a very dangerous trend because deforestation is self-perpetuating which results in further deforestation. While it may appear that most deforestation occurs due to natural or accidental reasons, it is actually human activity that causes the most deforestation worldwide.\nEffects of Deforestation\nThe consequences of deforestation have been very far-reaching and impacted the environment and livelihood of many.\n- Forests take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen with the Amazon rainforests of South America being responsible for 20 percent of Earth’s oxygen that we breathe in. When trees are cut down, the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.\n- Trees help to control the level of atmospheric water and when they are cut down, there is less water in the air to return to the soil disturbing the water cycle. This results in dryer soil which will eventually stop supporting agriculture or ranching.\n- 80 percent of the animal and plant species inhabit forests and deforestation results in loss of habitat for many animal and plant species. Forest trees provide shelter and regulate light and temperatures. Cutting of trees results in temperature changes and increased sunlight which can prove disastrous for many plant and animal species as it results in endangerment or extinction of species.\n- The roots of various plants prevent soil erosion. Deforestation degrades the quality of soil as fertile topsoil gets washed away leaving the land barren and prone to flooding. Soil erosion perpetuates deforestation as new land is deforested to support crop growth or cattle grazing.\n- A lot of indigenous people rely completely on forests for their livelihood and they are adversely affected due to deforestation. Deforestation kills plants they may use for medicine and sustenance, drives away the animals, leaves them vulnerable to the elements and disrupts their life.\n- One of the major consequences of deforestation is that due to the absence of sufficient trees, severe climatic changes are visible.\nMeasures to Curb Deforestation\nThere are certain measures which can be adopted by people to reduce deforestation and reverse its effects, the obvious solution being to stop the human activities that are causing it. However, the increasing population of people has caused an increase in demand for the things grown on deforested land. If deforestation continues as it is at present, global warming and climate change will continue unabated and eventually lead to the destruction of life on earth.\n- Plant a tree whenever and wherever possible. Every tree that is planted reduces the effects of deforestation.\n- Start practising the concept of reducing, reusing and recycling in your daily lives and encourage others to do the same.\n- Since paper comes from trees, try reducing the use of paper in your daily lives. Don’t discard paper that has only been used on one side.\n- Spread awareness about the importance of afforestation and the dangers of deforestation.\n- Promote products which ensure reduced or no deforestation.\n- Do some research and find out about organisations which are actively fighting deforestation and its effect globally. This will give you an idea on ways to help slow and gradually stop deforestation. Organisations like WWF, IUCN and the Pachamama Alliance have been working with government officials, companies and communities to promote responsible forest management practices, reforming trade policies, combating illegal logging and protecting forests. They have been providing public and private organisations with tools and information that simultaneously enable human progress, economic development and protection of forests. They offer people the opportunity to learn, engage, travel, and cherish life so that there is a sustainable future for all.\n- Become an advocate of afforestation and become a subscriber or donor of an accredited organisation that is actively and responsibly working towards stopping unnecessary deforestation.\nDeforestation happens when large areas of forest lands are cleared for a variety of human activities. This is mainly because of the increasing population which requires more and more resources and commodities. Deforestation is mainly carried out for monetary gains and man’s greed but we pay a very heavy price with it. Around 18 million acres of forests are cleared each year for various reasons. Deforestation has disastrous effects on our environment like loss of habitat for many animal and plant species, global warming and climate change. But it’s not too late and there are several measures that can be taken to curb deforestation and its effects.

{"question":"What's the difference in funding approaches between the Railway Heritage Trust and the Church-in-the-Field Charitable Association? Please provide examples of how each raises money.","answer":"The Railway Heritage Trust operates with a larger, formal budget of £2.2m and awards grants of 10-40% of repair costs, working with partners like the European Regional Development Fund and Heritage Lottery Fund. In contrast, the Church-in-the-Field Charitable Association raises funds through local events, donations, seeking grants from other organizations, and modern methods like EasyFundraising. The CFCA operates entirely with volunteers, while the RHT employs staff members.","context":["What is the RHT\nIntroduction to the Railway Heritage Trust\nBritain’s railway heritage is the world’s richest. It includes a wide range of types of buildings and structures, many of which were first devised in this country to meet the needs of the new railways. Every style and material is represented in its architecture and engineering. This heritage is still growing: railway buildings completed as recently as 1966 have now been listed. The 681 railway buildings and structures listed in 1985 in England, Scotland and Wales had increased to some 1,650 by 2009; Ancient Monuments increased from 45 to over 100 in the same period, while numerous parts of the railway estate fall within Conservation Areas. Along with churches and government departments, the railway industry is one of the most significant owners of historic premises and structures. Of particular interest is the extent to which the industry’s infrastructure is still in use for its original purpose.\nThe inception of the Trust was announced at a London conference on ‘The Future of the Railway Heritage’ on 23rd October 1984. The Trust was incorporated as an independent company limited by guarantee and commenced operations in April 1985. It is formally owned by its members, who are usually the Directors of the Trust, and is independent of both Network Rail and Highways England, although both bodies provide its sponsorship\nThe Trust has a Board of three Directors. Its Chairman is Jim Cornell, former Chief Civil Engineer of BR, MD of Regional Railways, and Executive Director of the Trust from 1996 – 2010; the Executive Director is Andy Savage, and Marcus Binney is the other, non-Executive, Director. As well as the Executive Director the Trust employs a support staff of two. It is also assisted by a voluntary Advisory Panel of approximately 40 members.\nThe Trust’s budget has grown from £1m in 1985/86 to £2.2m today. Its scope is basically buildings and structures either owned by Network Rail or part of the Highways England (Historical Railways Estate). It does not support heritage railways directly, nor does it deal with rolling stock, other mobile heritage or artefacts.\nThe Railway Heritage Trust’s objectives were set in 1985: assisting the operational railway companies in the preservation and upkeep of listed buildings and structures, and in the transfer of non-operational premises and structures to outside bodies willing to undertake their preservation.\nThe Trust achieves its objectives by giving both advice and grants. It awards grants following the evaluation of an application, normally on the basis of 10% to 40% of grant-eligible repair or restoration costs, excluding professional fees and project management costs. The Trust pays grants to train operating companies, tenants of railway-owned premises and to applicants from Network Rail and the Highways England (Historical Railways Estate). The Trust keeps its procedures for the award of grants as simple as possible.\nGrants can cover:\n- contributions to project partnerships;\n- enhancements to maintenance and restoration projects;\n- the reinstatement of missing or demolished features of historic buildings and structures; and\n- the repair of special fittings and equipment such as clocks, murals, memorials and fixed furniture.\nGrants are also available to help bring disused accommodation in historic premises back into beneficial use as a means of assisting conservation by regeneration.\nThe Trust encourages applicants to approach as many other funding partners as possible. Since 1985, the Trust has awarded over 1,670 grants, to a total value of £54m, to projects in England, Scotland and Wales. The Trust has played a part in attracting to those projects further contributions of £74m. Cadw Welsh Historic Monuments, Historic England and Historic Enviroment Scotland have worked with the Trust on many jointly-funded projects.\nThe Trust comments directly to many planning authorities on applications for Listed Building Consent and Planning Permission for works to historic railway stations and structures in their areas.\nProgress with repair and restoration of historic operational premises has been encouraging, taking into account the major reorganisations which have taken place, and continue, in the railway industry since 1985. The Trust supports a wide range of projects each year, with a balance struck between buildings and structures, and between large projects and small. Projects supported by grants from the Trust attract funding from the European Regional Development Fund, from the Heritage Lottery Fund and from national heritage bodies. A particular focus of the non-operational side of the Trust’s work relates to the regeneration of disused viaducts, supporting repair to facilitate their eventual transfer to trusts or other parties.\nIn recent years it has become increasingly accepted that historic premises are valuable assets, to be appreciated and properly maintained and utilised. The Trust believes that the need for a consistent and sustained focus on Britain’s historic railway premises and infrastructure is proved. To an extent this need is being met and the Trust looks forward to continuing to work with like-minded partners in this rewarding field.","Visit the Church-in-the-Field Charity for information about the Trustees, and funds\nThe Church was built around 1620 at the instruction of Sir Edward Hext, as the private chapel of the Lord of the Manor, and is on the site of an earlier Church.\nIn 1645 the building suffered damage during the battle of Langport, one of the most significant battles of the Civil War, which was fought nearby. Hext’s grandson, George Stawell, had the building repaired and subsequently consecrated in 1669. In 1921 the Church was given in trust to the Church of England. The Manor House built nearby was demolished many years ago. The Church is Grade 1 listed and is considered a unique example of early Gothicism in England. Unfortunately time has taken its toll and the fabric of the Church is in need of restoration.\nThe Church- in-the Field Charitable Association (CFCA) was formed in 1990 and its purpose is to raise funds for the repair and maintenance of the Church. The charity does this by organising local events, receiving donations and by seeking grants from other organisations. All the Charity's trustees and workers are volunteers, and we are fortunate in having David Heath CBE as our Patron.\nThe Church-in-the-Field is an historically and architecturally important building and in 2013 the Churches Conservation Trust (CCT) was approached to take on the responsibility of the significant repairs required to make the building water tight, safe and to continue to improve and restore the many interesting features both externally and internally. The Churches Conservation Trust is a national charity that protects churches at risk, caring for the churches vested to them by the Church Commissioners of the Church of England. Following consultation between the CCT, the Bath & Wells Diocese and the Church Commissioners, the church was vested to the CCT on 1st June, 2017.\nMore details of the CCT and the work they do can be found on their website.\nWe are delighted that the CCT is now able to carry out the refurbishment work and a timetable of work s is currently being compiled. The church will, of course, be closed while the work is being carried out, but it is proposed to hold “hard hat days” when it will be possible to look at the work being carried out. Details of these days will be published at a later date.\nThis beautiful Church remains consecrated and will continue to be a place of worship as well as a focal point for the community. With the Rev. Jess Pitman as incumbent, up to six services a year will be held, and baptisms, weddings and funeral services may still be held by arrangement.\nPlease contact the Langport Team for details.\nThe Church in the Field Association will work with the Churches Conservation Trust to continue to fund raise once the major weatherproofing refurbishment has finished. This will include the future restoration of some of the internal monuments and stained glass. We have recently raised funds for the repair of the clock but need to raise additional funding for the re-gilding of the clock face.\nOne of the ways you can help us with this AT NO COST TO YOU is by signing up to EasyFundraising.\nChairperson, Church-in-the-Field Charitable Association\nWatch the film of former Time Team archaeologist Mick Aston's visit to Low Ham Church"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7f81da78-c576-4812-bc3f-3c61cc1d9888>","<urn:uuid:c47d0b79-b06c-4bd8-a4c5-e11cdeef698a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do both the Palóc Csárdás and Dabke dances reflect traditional building practices in their origins? 🤔 Would love to hear some fascinating cultural connections!","answer":"The Palóc Csárdás and Dabke dances have different connections to buildings. The Csárdás got its name because it was danced by peasants at their inns, while Dabke originated from the actual process of building houses in Lebanon. Specifically, Dabke emerged from the practice of neighbors joining together to fix mud roofs by stomping on them - when a roof needed repair, the owner would call 'ta'awon' or 'awneh' (meaning 'help') and neighbors would come to stomp the mud in rhythm. The Csárdás, in contrast, began being danced around 1200 AD, with its current steps emerging around 1500, and received its name around 1800 specifically from its association with peasant inns.","context":["PALÓC CSÁRDÁS II\nPRONUNCIATION: PAW-lohts CHAHR-dahsh TRANSLATION: Dance of the Palóc people SOURCE: Dick Oakes learned this dance from Andor Czompo who introduced it to folk dancers in the United States in 1976 at the San Diego State University Folk Dance Conference in California. BACKGROUND: This dance is from North Central Hungary where the Palóc (traditional ethnographic group of people) live. The dance described here is the second of two dances by the same name taught by Mr. Czompo in 1962. The first was collected by Alice Reisz and taught by her in 1962 at the Maine Folk Dance Camp (now called the Mainewoods Dance Camp). Mr. Czompo arranged this second version of the dance for recreational folk dancing from original source material as well as authentic folk material from Sándor Timár, György Martin, and Ágoston Lányi. Csárdás dances started being danced around 1200 a.d. Present csárdás steps, however, were not danced until 1500 and the dance received the name csárdás only around 1800. This name was given to the dance because it was danced by the peasants at their inns. MUSIC: Qualiton (LP) LPX-18007, side B, band 9.

Originally, the Dabke dance was a creation of the people of the villages and towns of Lebanon. During that time, there had been changes in the weather. The villagers of Lebanon formed a dance based on building their homes. Most of these regions had flat roofs made of tree branches and topped with mud. However, with changes in the weather, the mud would crack and the roofs had to be fixed. Also, according to one folk tradition, houses in the Levant were built from stone with a roof of wood, straw and dirt. The Lebanese would fix the roof by holding hands, forming a line and starting to stomp their feet while walking on the roof to adjust the mud. When the mud started to crack, the owner of the house would call its neighbours to help them with the roof. He would yell ‘ta’awon’ or ‘awneh’ meaning ‘help’ and in turn, the neighbours would come running saying ‘Ala Dal Ouna’ meaning ‘let’s go and help’. All the people would come together on the roof and start stomping the mud and this is how the Dabke dance originated.\nAs discussed above, it is performed in two forms–line and circle. However, it is the leader called ‘raas’ or ‘lawweeh’ who is allowed to improvise its type. He guides the dancers by twirling a handkerchief or string of beads called masba. He is like a tree that spreads its arms in the air with proud and upright trunk and feet which stomps the ground in rhythm. He heads the line by alternating its facing to the audience and the other dancers. In order to keep up to the beat, the dancers use vocalizations to show energy. During the weddings, the raas or lawweeh takes the lead after the singer begins with the mawwal. Before the song kicks in, the basic step of 1–2–3 is performed by the dancers.\nDabke is not of one kind. It has many variations. They are:\n- Jordanian Dabke: There are about 19 types of Jordanian Dabke, out of which Habel Mwadea is a type which is performed jointly by men and women. Few others include Al–Karaadiyya, Al–Tas’awaiyya, Al–Sha’rawiyya, Al–Askariyya, Al–Joufiyya, Al–Ghawarneh, Abu’Alanda and many others.\n- Palestinian Dabke: There are two common types of Palestinian Dabke namely Shamaliyya and Sha’rawiyya. The former consists of a lawweef as the head of the group of the dancers holding hands forming a semicircle whereas the latter is characterised by steps or stomps limited to men. There are about six phrases in these variations. In addition to these, the other forms include Al–Karaadiyya, Al–Farah, Al–Ghazal, and Al–Sahja.\nDifferent types of Dabke are distinguished by its music and the region it comes from. There are five main components of Dabke in terms of instrumentation. They include the lute, the tablah (a small hand drum), mijwiz (similar to red clarinet with two pipes), the daff (like a tambourine), and the arghul (like mijwiz but with finger holes on one of the topics). The Al–Shamaliyya begins with the mijwiz or arghul in solo or can be accompanied by a singer. However, as the other instruments join in, the music gets going.\nCommon rules for Dabke include:\n- Dancers who perform Dabke in line should hold hands and align shoulders. Their shoulders should not be separated during the performance.\n- The line should move counter–clockwise.\n- The owner of the house (traditional) or the leader heads the line.\n- Dancers at both the ends of the line have worry beads or cane which they wave while dancing.\n- It is performed by both men and women, except some of the variations of the Jordanian Dabke."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:98336486-acda-460e-832f-0988cea573d3>","<urn:uuid:d041c578-5981-4f58-887b-981b34dab2d3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to understand the agricultural sustainability initiatives in Georgia - what are the traditional conservation methods at historical sites like Enota, and how do they compare to modern climate-smart farming techniques being implemented across rural areas? 🌱","answer":"At Enota, traditional conservation methods include organic farming with a seven-year-old garden, raising livestock (including Nubian goats, chickens, and cows for milk), maintaining fruit trees and berry bushes, and preserving natural water resources. Their focus is on becoming self-sustaining while protecting the historic Cherokee land. In contrast, modern climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices being implemented across rural Georgia include sophisticated techniques like regular pruning of fruit trees to prevent heat and moisture damage, establishing natural windbreaks, beekeeping for agricultural productivity, composting and vermiculture for soil improvement, and using greenhouses to protect crops. The AMMAR project has also introduced modern equipment like anti-hail nets, drip irrigation systems, and provides regular training and demonstration plots to help farmers adapt to climate change while increasing yields sustainably.","context":["N.Georgia workamper / workexchange program.\nWork Exchange & Workamper Program\nDo you have a productive work ethic?\nAre you committed to excellence?\nAre you committed to healthy physical, mental, and spiritual practices?\nThen Enota might be for you!\nEnota has a Work Exchange Program & Workamper Program for qualified individuals.

This is prime development property with its extensive infrastructure, waterfalls, streams, sheer beauty and prime location on the scenic highway to Brasstown Bald. We feel it is a great accomplishment everyday that Enota’s property is not developed into single family homes.\nEnota is Cherokee for “the land that nourishes”. Enota protects over 60 acre held in Trust, surrounded on all sides by the National forest with 4 waterfalls, 5 streams and 2 stocked trout ponds. We are non-profit 501(c)3, volunteer organization. We are actively engaged in leaving our planet in better shape than we found it.\nWhere is Enota? Enota is located in Hiawassee, Georgia, on 60 + wooded acres, which were once ancient, sacred Cherokee land, then a Cherokee village. When gold was discovered in the mountains in the 1800’s, the land was confiscated by the US government, and subsequently sold to a family who homesteaded it for 60 years before selling it to the YMCA, which used the land as a boys camp for 50 years. It then became an RV, cabin and tent campground and is now in Trust for conservation and educational purposes. It is surrounded by 750,000 acres of Chattahoochee National Forest and has never been used for cattle grazing or had any pesticides or chemicals used on it. It offers some of the cleanest air and water available. It is located 1 ½ miles from the Appalachian Trail (which can be reached from the property) and is a direct neighbor to Brasstown Bald Mountain, the highest mountain in Georgia.\nEnota is in the hospitality industry. Work Exchangers run and operate the retreat center and campground. Work Exchangers are responsible for housekeeping, cooking, farming, grounds maintenance, customer service, gardening, animal care, construction, and maintenance. We run a retreat center with cabins, RV and campground facilities. For guests we offer an opportunity to use our facilities for personal retreats, conferences and workshops. Our accommodations now include: 10 cabins with kitchenettes, 18 small retreat rooms, 15 private rooms on the stream, 4 bunkhouses, 35 full hookup RV sites, Resident Lodging on the farm, 10 water and electric only sites, over 100 tent spaces and a heated bath house. We have a Lodge with a gift shop and store, a full commercial kitchen and dining room, and full conference facilities providing beds for up to 160 people. We have a pavilion that will accommodate 500 people and an outdoor kitchen.\nWhat Do We Do At Enota?\nWe work hard every day to make Enota better and better for our guests and ourselves. Enota is primarily engaged in servicing the guests that come through the property. Secondarily, Work Exchangers take care of our animals, take care of the farm, work on our expansion and sustainable projects and preserve our land for future generations.\nEnota practices organic farming. We have a seven-year old organic garden – one of the most labor intensive on-going projects. Fruit trees and berry bushes have been planted, there are mushrooms on logs throughout the property, and a greenhouse has been erected. Enota tries to use as much as possible from the garden but not all meals are vegetarian nor are they all organic.\nEnota has animals. In our commitment to be sustainable, we have chickens from which we will get our own eggs. We have eight Nubian goats, a miniature horse, two cows – which we milk daily, rabbits, ducks and other resident animals.

The frequent wind storms brought other troubles, too, such as extreme temperature swings that further weakened the soil and made her apple trees and blackberry vines vulnerable to diseases and pests. Despite her best efforts, Irina found her yields decreasing from year to year.\nIrina wasn’t alone in her experience. In recent years, farmers across rural Georgia have had to contend with severe production losses and significant threats to their food security. The changing climate has led to a constant barrage of extreme weather events – floods, droughts, wind storms – that have degraded the land and left farmers struggling to cope. An especially hard-hitting spell of heavy rains, hail and winds in July 2012, for example, left many areas of the country in a profound state of emergency that they never fully recovered from.\nWith no end to these weather patterns in sight, the focus turned to helping Georgian farmers mitigate and adapt. The situation was especially urgent for the country’s small-scale farmers, many of whom lack access to the financial resources and technologies – including the latest agricultural techniques – needed to make these changes.\nA holistic approach to restoring the food system\nThe AMMAR project, launched in 2015, was designed to address these challenges. The project forms part of the Georgian Ministry of Agriculture’s ongoing programme to modernize the country’s agriculture sector, with the support of IFAD, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).\nBecause the entire food system had been so heavily affected, AMMAR project staff knew they needed to adopt a holistic approach that would address all components of the system simultaneously. They therefore decided to promote climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, a set of approaches that help farmers transform their agricultural systems in response to changing climate circumstances while sustainably increasing their yields and incomes.\nSince then, AMMAR has helped many Georgian farmers restore their local ecosystems and find new ways to produce and sell goods that sustain both the environment and their businesses. For example, they have encouraged the regular pruning of fruit trees, a practice that helps prevent damage from heat and moisture; helped farmers set up and maintain natural windbreaks; introduced beekeeping (an excellent way to support agricultural productivity and biodiversity while increasing and diversifying rural incomes); and trained farmers in composting and vermiculture (the raising of earthworms) to improve soil quality. They have also introduced new practices, such as the use of greenhouses, to protect crops from hazardous weather.\nAMMAR has also provided plenty of equipment, from anti-hail nets and organic fertilizer to drip irrigation systems and seedling nurseries, to help farmers make the most of the new CSA practices. They also offer regular training sessions, maintain demonstration plots to provide examples of best practices, and organize exchange visits between groups of farmers. The latter, in particular, give participants a chance to teach and learn from each other and provide a way for them to explore new opportunities in their local and regional economies.\nSpotlight on windbreaks: One solution for many challenges\nAlthough the land degradation rural Georgians have experienced has multiple causes, one single factor – wind erosion – has proven to be the primary driver. Establishing windbreaks has therefore been central to AMMAR’s activities. In collaboration with the Regional Environmental Center for the Caucasus, AMMAR has set up pilot windbreaks on over 2,800 hectares of land to date. The resulting reduction in wind speed has many benefits, including better control of soil erosion, more favourable snow distribution, improved food and wood production, an increase in livestock productivity, and improved crop quality and yield. In total, the windbreaks correspond to a reduction of 234 tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. They also provide a habitat for up to 1,000 animal species.\nWhen Irina heard that AMMAR was setting up windbreaks, she applied right away. In November 2019, she received 920 seedlings of tall trees, such as poplar, cypress and maple, along with the materials needed to protect growing saplings and manage water flow. After attending training sessions on how to construct and maintain the windbreak, she was ready to begin.\nBy the following summer, her work was already paying off. In addition to buffering her eight hectares from the wind, the windbreak helps accumulate moisture in the soil and shades her apples and blackberries from the sun, increasing the quantity and quality of her yields – and therefore her income. The increase in biodiversity in the area around the windbreak also provides some natural pest control, helping Irina avoid the use of pesticides.\n“I am delighted with the project support,” she says.\nOver all, the promotion of CSA practices and the introduction of innovative technologies has made a significant contribution to building the climate resilience of Georgian agriculture. The success of the windbreak pilot, in particular, has raised hopes of extending the practice to other areas. To this end, AMMAR has contributed to a policy framework that would help establish windbreaks across the country. Of course, transforming food systems is an extremely complex undertaking, involving cross-cutting biophysical, socio-economic, political and institutional elements across all elements of the system. For all these reasons and more, it is vital to scale up CSA practices to promote their sustainability across the entire system. But with farmers’ continued interest and enthusiasm, this momentum is only expected to increase.\nLearn more about IFAD’s work in Georgia.Publication date: 07 June 2021"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c84da33d-47cd-4dd8-92f2-4fc15121fbf6>","<urn:uuid:f82b268c-445f-4456-944b-a7dad2017c95>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference in authenticity protection between Darjeeling and Tieguanyin teas? Love learning about premium teas! 🍵","answer":"Darjeeling tea has strict geographical protection - it can only legally be called 'Darjeeling' if it's grown and manufactured in the specifically defined Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India. This is similar to how Champagne is protected. In fact, while 40,000 tons of tea are sold as Darjeeling annually, only 11,000 tons are authentic. In contrast, while Tieguanyin originated in Anxi, Fujian province in the 19th century, its production has expanded to many regions even outside of China, including Taiwan, with no mentioned geographical protection restrictions.","context":["Type: Oolong Other names: Iron Goddess, Iron Guanyin, Ti Kuan Yin, Tiet Kwun Yum Origin: Anxi County, Fujian Province, China and others Quick description: The harvests in spring (also known as Jade) and autumn are most prized for the fruity, sometimes even berry taste and aroma Temperature: 90-95°C\nTieguanyin (simplified Chinese: 铁观音; traditional Chinese: 鐵觀音; Mandarin Pinyin: tiěguānyīn; Jyutping: tit3 gwun1 yam1; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Thih-koan-im; literally \"Iron Guanyin or Iron Avalokiteśvara\" or 'Tikuanyin' / 'Tit Koon Yum') is a premium variety of Chinese oolong tea originated in the 19th century in Anxi in Fujian province. Tieguanyin produced in different areas of Anxi have different gastronomic characteristics. Production has since extended to many regions even outside of China, including Mucha in Nantou, Taiwan.\nTieguanyin, Guanyin, Guanshiyin, are the names of the Chinese Goddess for over 20 centuries. Since then, Japan name Guanyin as Kannon, in Korea as Guam-eum. For about 200 years to 300 years, Chinese Buddhism Guanyin also influenced the south Asia nations and the south Asia people re-named Guanyin to bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, Mahāyāna Buddhism.\nThe name of the Chinese tea is translated in English as \"Iron Guanyin\", and sometimes as \"Iron Goddess of Mercy.\" These two names are accurate. The deity has long been given a female identity in Chinese folk culture, although the original Chinese name carries no suggestion of the male-or-female-nature. A more accurate translation of the reference to the deity should be (the One) Observing the Voice of the People.\nOther spellings and names include \"Ti Kuan Yin,\" \"Tit Kwun Yum,\" \"Ti Kwan Yin,\" \"Iron Buddha,\" \"Iron Goddess Oolong,\" and \"Tea of the Iron Bodhisattva.\" It is also known in the abbreviated form as \"TGY.\"\nThere are two legends behind this tea: Wei and Wang.\nDeep in the heart of Fujian's Anxi County, there was a rundown temple which held an iron statue of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Every day on the walk to his tea fields, a poor farmer named Mr. Wei would pass by and reflect on the temple's worsening condition. “Something has to be done,” thought Mr. Wei.\nBeing poor, he did not have the means to repair the temple. Instead, the farmer brought a broom and some incense from his home. He swept the temple clean and lit the incense as an offering to Guanyin. \"It's the least I can do,\" he thought to himself. Twice a month for many months, he repeated the same tasks.\nOne night, Guanyin appeared to him in a dream. She told him of a cave behind the temple where treasure awaited. He was to take the treasure and share it with others. In the cave, the farmer found a single tea shoot. He planted it in his field and nurtured it into a large bush, from which the finest tea was produced. He gave cuttings of this rare plant to all his neighbors and began selling the tea under the name Tieguanyin, Iron Bodhisattva of Compassion.\nOver time, Mr. Wei and all his neighbors prospered; the rundown temple of Guanyin was repaired and became a beacon for the region. Mr. Wei took joy in the daily trip to his tea fields, never failing to stop in appreciation of the beautiful temple.\nWang was a scholar who accidentally discovered the tea plant beneath the Guanyin rock in Xiping. He brought the plant back home for cultivation. When he visited Emperor Qianlong in the 6th year of his reign, he offered the tea as a gift from his native village. Emperor Qianlong was so impressed that he inquired about its origin. Since the tea was discovered beneath the Guanyin Rock, he decided to call it the Guanyin tea.\nProcessing of Tieguanyin Tea\nThe processing of Tieguanyin tea (TGY) is complex and requires expertise. Even if the tea leaf is of high raw quality, and is plucked at the ideal time, if it is not processed correctly its true character will not be shown. This is why the method of processing Tieguanyin Tea was kept a secret.\n- plucking tea leaves.(cai qing)\n- sun withering. (shai qing)\n- cooling. (liang qing)\n- tossing.

(hong gan)\nAfter drying some teas go through the added processes of roasting and scenting. \nBy roasting level:\n- Jade Tieguanyin (lightly baked Tieguanyin) is a newer type of Tieguanyin and has a light green jade color. It produces a very flowery aroma and taste. It is more similar to green tea than Oolong.\n- Thoroughly Baked Tieguanyin is the original style. It has a more complex taste profile and warm aroma, but the traditional baking technique has not been passed on well so quality ones of this style is less seen in the market than \"moderately baked' and \"lightly\" baked versions.\n- Moderately baked Tieguanyin is a new breed that some argue has a good balance of floral aroma and complex taste, but it stores poorly.\nBy harvest time:\n- Spring Tieguanyin is harvested around Li Xia (Start of Summer) and has the best overall quality.\n- Autumn Tieguanyin is harvested in the autumn and has strong aroma but less complex taste.\n- Summer Tieguanyin is harvested in summer and is considered lower quality. Summer Tieguanyin can be further divided into two types one harvested in June to July, one harvested in August.\n- Winter Tieguanyin is harvested in winter. Production of Winter Tieguanyin is very low.\n- Guanyin Wang (Guanyin \"King\") is the best of Jade Tieguanyin and Autumn Tieguanyin.\nBased on the different roasting methods and locations, the types of Tieguanyin are various.\n- The Chinese Anxi Iron Goddess Tea 安溪鉄観音- This oolong is typically close to a green tea, with only a little oxidation.  With a very flowery and fresh delicate aroma character, the tea liquid is golden yellow. \n- The Taiwan Mucha Iron Goddess Tea 木柵鉄観音- This traditional oolong is roasted and has a stronger taste and with roast nutty character, the tea liquid is reddish-brown.\n- Taiwan teas\n- ^ The Tea Guardian. \"Oolongs: Anxi Varieties\". http://teaguardian.com/nature_of_tea/oolongs_anxi_orientation.html.

The steeped liquor usually appears light golden to a darker bronze color with a strong fruity aroma. It is often considered one of the finest teas in the world.\nFor a tea to be called Darjeeling, it needs to come from the Darjeeling district, state of West Bengal, India. “Darjeeling Tea” is a legally protected geographical designation for teas grown and manufactured in this very specifically defined region “Darjeeling.” This situation is similar to the designation given “Champagne” which is a sparkling wine grown in the Champagne region of France. Sparkling wines grown in other regions of the world cannot be called Champagne.\nBill with the Chairman of the Darjeeling Planters Club, which was established in the early 1900's.\nBill with the manager of the Goomtee Estate in their greenhouse.\nWhat does the word Darjeeling refer to?\nDarjeeling is a really small region in northeast India.\nThe Darjeeling District is about 288 sq. miles.\nHennepin County, Minnesota is about 600 sq. miles.\nRhode Island is about 1212 sq. miles.\nThe word Darjeeling translates as “Thunderbolt Place.” Darjeeling is very close to Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Assam, and Tibet. It is part of the foothills of the Himalayas.\nIs Darjeeling tea rare?\nApproximately 11,000 tons of Darjeeling tea are produced each year from the official Darjeeling region. Approximately 40,000 tons of tea are sold each year as Darjeeling. So at least 30,000 of those 40,000 tons are counterfeit. These counterfeit teas aren’t grown in Darjeeling. They may come from Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Bihar Province, other parts of the state of West Bengal outside Darjeeling, and God only knows from where else.\n11,000 tons of tea sounds like a lot, but not really. Each year the Assam region of India produces about 680,000 tons of tea.\nSo Darjeeling teas, relatively speaking, are pretty rare, prized, and they fetch very high prices.\nWhy are Darjeeling teas special?\nDarjeelings are the highest elevation produced teas in the world. This higher elevation creates a different environment for the tea plant; different temperature ranges in the day and evening, different oxygen content in the atmosphere, different UV (ultraviolet ray) exposure for the plant, and many other differences. All these differences produce a different leaf and a unique flavor and aroma in the cup. The Chinese variety of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis sinensis, grows very well under these conditions.\nTea fields along the mountain side at the Margaret’s Hope Estate.\nDarjeeling teas are also 100% hand-cultivated and produced; with a tremendous level of care, experience, and expertise in the cultivation, handling, and manufacture of these teas.\nWhat is the best way to prepare Darjeeling tea?\nIt’s a black tea, so many people would say use boiling water and steep 3-5 minutes. We recommend using slightly less than boiling water and steeping for 2-3 minutes. This cup will be a little bit less astringent, maybe a little bit more sweet or fruity, but with a little less body.

{"question":"How do the forests in the Congo Basin contribute to rainfall generation in Africa, and what are the three main sources of moisture in this process?","answer":"The Congo Basin forests contribute to rainfall generation by acting as a mechanism that pumps water from various sources. The three main sources of moisture are: moisture already present in the atmosphere, moisture from outside the region (particularly from the Atlantic Ocean), and evapotranspiration from surfaces within the ecosystem (including forests and other land uses). The forests can evaporate up to 1-2 meters of water per year and act like a pump that moves oceanic moisture towards the continent to become rainfall.","context":["Responses to climate change are grouped into two main categories: mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change) and adaptation (adjusting livelihoods and life styles due to the influences of climate change). Amongst adaptation strategies, ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) is an approach that promotes ways to use natural resources and biodiversity to help develop adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities. In this context, recent studies highlight the role that the Congo Basin forests play in generating rainfall, both regionally and in the continent as a whole.\nRainfall in an ecosystem originates from three main sources: moisture that is already in the atmosphere, moisture from outside the region, and evapotranspiration from surfaces within the ecosystem (forests and other land uses). Pokam et al. studied how the climate of the Congo Basin is primarily a result of moisture from the Atlantic Ocean and the recycling process of evapotranspiration. Previous studies had established that tropical forests such as the Congo Basin can evaporate up to 1 to 2 meters of water per year. In addition, research by Makarieva et al. suggests that forest cover in the region acts like a pump, moving oceanic moisture towards the continent to eventually become rainfall in that region.\nWith this role of forests as rainmakers in mind, Nogherotto et al. explored the impacts of deforestation in the Congo Basin on regional hydrological cycles, including the effects on the African monsoon. They modeled scenarios where the Congo Basin is forested versus those in which it is deforested (that is, modeling a situation where forest cover is transformed to short grass cover). Their findings indicate that deforestation in the Congo Basin would lead to modifications in rain behavior in the Sahel and over southern equatorial Africa.\nTaken together, these three studies show how the Congo Basin acts as a mechanism for pumping water from the Atlantic Ocean, from underground sources, and from the soil. These sources then mix with atmospheric water, leading to the generation of rainfall both locally and on a sub-continental scale. Without the extensive forests of the Congo Basin, this process would be severely disrupted. In addition, these studies help highlight other important functions of the Congo Basin forests beyond biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.\nWith the growing scientific evidence of the multiple roles that the Congo Basin forests play at regional, continental and global scales, the case for forest conservation, for good forest management, and for multiple income streams to support the forests’ multiple roles becomes stronger. Given their rainmaker role, sustaining the Congo Basin forests might be one of the foundations for EBA to climate change for much of Africa.\nDenis Sonwa is a scientist with CIFOR’s Forests and Environment Programme.

{"question":"在銅金礦勘探方面，地質學專家如何利用岩石特徵來提高發現新礦床的機會，同時這些礦石需要經過哪些加工步驟?","answer":"Geologists analyze the geochemical and petrological characteristics of potassic igneous rock complexes and their tectonic settings to identify potential copper-gold deposits. They specifically look for geochemical differences between barren and mineralized potassic igneous complexes to guide exploration. Once discovered, the ore processing involves multiple stages: first, the ore (containing less than 1% copper) is mined and crushed. Then it undergoes concentration, followed by smelting and converting processes. The final refining stage produces high-purity copper cathodes (99.99% pure) through a series of chemical, physical, and electrochemical processes, which vary depending on the ore source and local regulations.","context":["Potassic Igneous Rocks and Associated Gold-Copper Mineralization\nMuller, Daniel, Groves, David I.\n- 出版商: Springer\n- 出版日期: 2019-01-15\n- 售價: $6,200\n- 貴賓價: 9.5 折 $5,890\n- 語言: 英文\n- 頁數: 398\n- 裝訂: Quality Paper - also called trade paper\n- ISBN: 3030065618\n- ISBN-13: 9783030065614\nThis book reviews the geochemical and petrological characteristics of potassic igneous rock complexes, and investigates the various tectonic settings in which these rocks occur. The authors provide an overview and classification of these rocks and elucidate the geochemical differences between barren and mineralized potassic igneous complexes. High-K rocks are genetically associated with a number of epithermal gold and porphyry copper-gold deposits.

{"question":"Why CFOs need to understand ESG metrics and climate data from crypto mining? Help me understand!! 🤔","answer":"CFOs need to understand both ESG metrics and climate data from crypto mining because both impact organizational sustainability and risk management. CFOs are responsible for ESG performance and must ensure sustainability metrics are accurate and comparable for stakeholders. They must manage both financial and non-financial data, as these are interconnected. Regarding crypto mining, they need to understand its environmental implications as it accounts for 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage and generates significant carbon emissions (25-50 Mt CO2/y in the US). This understanding is crucial for risk management, as both ESG factors and crypto-mining impacts could affect company sustainability goals and regulatory compliance, particularly as new environmental performance standards are being developed.","context":["68% of CFO’s say that finance takes ultimate responsibility for ESG performance within their organisation, so how interconnected is financial and ESG data?\nESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. These three entities encompass the main pillars of sustainability for most business and investing. As sustainability becomes increasingly important in the modern economy, there is an increased demand by investors and other stakeholders to incorporate ESG into a business strategy.\nAs more regulation and legislation is introduced in this area, the importance of ESG to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) grows. This is due to the fact that non-financial metrics such as sustainability metrics are becoming more stringent and linking into the wider financial strategies. For example, the incoming EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will require companies to audit their non-financial data, to ensure clarity and comparability of this data for investors and other stakeholders.\nTherefore, CFOs have a key role in ensuring that these sustainability ESG metrics are accurate and comparable, for both internal and external stakeholders. ESG is now a top priority for CFO’s as they play their part in supporting the implementation of the overall sustainability strategy, with a recent Accenture study stating 68% of CFO’s say that finance takes ultimate responsibility for ESG performance within their enterprise.\nHere are several reasons why ESG must remain a priority for CFO’s:\nNon-financial ESG data and financial data are symbiotic\nIncreased regulation and stakeholder pressure in the ESG space has led to a more detailed focus by many organisations on sustainability data. Non-financial data is interconnected with financial data, as they both impact on one another. Under the CSRD non-financial data in the form of a sustainability report will be required to be published within the management report, in the company’s annual report.\nSustainability metrics impact finance KPIs\nSustainability metrics offer value in the form of long term value. A CFO should understand its organisation’s ESG metrics as they represent a baseline to compare how well the organisation is performing against competitors in the space. These metrics will then allow for a starting point to create new opportunities for cost savings and other benefits.\nRisk management involves ESG\nRisk management is a key part of a CFO’s job in regards to financial information and strategy, this should be extended to ESG data also. Both forward-looking and retrospective ESG information should be considered when implementing strategy. These ESG strategies should have short, medium and long-term time horizons to ensure that ESG risks such as climate change are measured and mitigated to futureproof the business.\nReporting frameworks managed by CFO\nThere are a significant amount of differing frameworks, ranging from basic mandatory reporting to wide-ranging frameworks such the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), or the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). These frameworks aid organisations in reporting on their ESG metrics but it can be difficult to decipher which specific framework to use. CFOs are in the best position to determine which measurements are the best fit for evaluating and reporting their company’s ESG performance.\nESG is a company-wide endeavour\nThe monitoring, measuring and reporting of ESG metrics requires knowledge and co-operation from various sectors across an organisation. There are many moving parts involved including:\n· Business modelling and strategy to incorporate sustainability matters and their impacts\n· Setting targets and measuring progress made in achieving those targets\n· Ensuring that management is aware of their roles and responsibilities in this area\n· Setting and carrying out the company’s sustainability policies\n· Carrying out quality reporting, using both quantitative and qualitative data, to ensure information is comparable and useful for investors and stakeholders.\nThese multitude of tasks require management and input from the CFO to ensure that ESG metrics are valued alongside financial metrics. CFO’s must examine their roles and identify how prepared they are in the ESG space, as they will have a major influence on their organisation’s financial and sustainability performance.\nCFO’s must ensure that the company appropriately mitigates risk by addressing security and environmental, social and governance challenges, whilst also setting the climate agenda, as well as measuring the decarbonisation journey of their firms.\nThe time to take action on ESG has firmly arrived and CFOs everywhere will be key players in this action and providing company leadership.","FACT SHEET: Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States\nClimate change is one of the most pressing problems confronting our nation and our world, and President Biden has taken bold steps to address it with legislation and policy. Among the President’s commitments are: protecting communities from pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity grid by 2035, and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, we must ensure that emerging technologies contribute to a net-zero, clean energy future. The use of digital assets based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) is expanding. Digital assets are a form of value, represented digitally. As an emerging technological innovation, digital assets have provided some benefits and value for some residents and businesses in the United States, and have the potential for future benefits with emerging uses.\nCrypto-assets are digital assets that are implemented using cryptographic techniques. Crypto-assets can require considerable amounts of electricity usage, which can result in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts to communities living near mining facilities. Depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve U.S. climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\nIn March, in Executive Order 14067 on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets, President Biden made clear that the responsible development of digital assets includes reducing negative climate impacts and environmental pollution. The Executive Order directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other federal agencies, to produce a report on the climate and energy implications of crypto-assets in the United States. OSTP assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts to assess and extend existing studies with new analysis, based on peer-reviewed studies and the best available data.\nToday, OSTP published its report, examining the challenges and opportunities of crypto-assets for the United States’ clean energy and climate change goals, and providing a set of recommendations to further study and track impacts of the sector, develop potential performance standards, and provide tools and resources to reduce negative impacts. This report’s assessment and recommendations align with federal actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare, grow a clean energy economy with good-paying jobs, and improve environmental justice.\nCrypto-Assets Can Be Energy-Intensive, and the United States Has a Major Crypto-Asset Sector\nFrom 2018 to 2022, annualized electricity usage from global crypto-assets grew rapidly, with estimates of electricity usage doubling to quadrupling. As of August 2022, published estimates of the total global electricity usage for crypto-assets are between 120 and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, a range that exceeds the total annual electricity usage of many individual countries, such as Argentina or Australia. This is equivalent to 0.4% to 0.9% of annual global electricity usage, and is comparable to the annual electricity usage of all conventional data centers in the world.\nNearly all crypto-asset electricity usage is driven by consensus mechanisms: the DLT used to mine and verify crypto-assets. The dominant consensus mechanism is called Proof of Work (PoW), which is used by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin and Ether combined represent more than 60% of total crypto-asset market capitalization. The PoW mechanism is designed to require more computing power as more entities attempt to validate transactions for coin rewards, and this feature helps disincentivize malicious actors from attacking the network. As of August 2022, Bitcoin is estimated to account for 60% to 77% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage, and Ethereum is estimated to account for 20% to 39%.\nThe energy efficiency of mining equipment has been increasing, but electricity usage continues to rise. Other less energy-intensive crypto-asset ledger technologies exist, with different attributes and uses. Switching to alternative crypto-asset technologies such as Proof of Stake could dramatically reduce overall power usage to less than 1% of today’s levels.\nThe United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage. This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States. Crypto-asset mining is also highly mobile. The United States currently hosts the world’s largest Bitcoin mining industry, totaling more than 38% of global Bitcoin activity, up from 3.5% in 2020. Despite the potential for rapid growth, future electricity demand from crypto-asset operations is uncertain, demonstrating the need for better data to understand and monitor electricity usage from crypto-assets.\nCrypto-Assets Can Have Significant Environmental Impacts\nGlobal electricity generation for the crypto-assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. Crypto-asset activity in the United States is estimated to result in approximately 25 to 50 Mt CO2/y, which is 0.4% to 0.8% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This range of emissions is similar to emissions from diesel fuel used in railroads in the United States.\nBesides purchased grid electricity, crypto-asset mining operations can also cause local noise and water impacts, electronic waste, air and other pollution from any direct usage of fossil-fired electricity, and additional air, water, and waste impacts associated with all grid electricity usage. These local impacts can exacerbate environmental justice issues for neighboring communities, which are often already burdened with other pollutants, heat, traffic, or noise. The growth of energy-intensive crypto-asset technologies, when not directly using clean electricity, could hinder the ability of the United States to achieve its National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Broader adoption of crypto-assets, and the potential introduction of new types of digital assets require action by the federal government to encourage and ensure responsible development. This includes minimizing negative impacts on local communities, significantly reducing energy intensity, and powering with clean electricity.\nDistributed Ledger Technologies May Help with Climate Monitoring or Mitigation\nDLT may have a role to play in enhancing market infrastructure for a range of environmental markets like carbon credit markets, though other solutions might work as well or better. The potential benefits of DLT would need to outweigh the additional emissions and other environmental externalities that result from operations to merit broader use, relative to the markets or mechanisms that DLT displaces. Use cases are still emerging, and like all emerging technologies, there are potential positive and negative use cases yet to be imagined. Responsible development of this technology would encourage innovation in DLT applications while reducing energy intensity and minimizing environmental damages.\nKey Recommendations of the Report\nTo help the United States meet its climate objectives, crypto-asset policy during the transition to clean energy should be focused on several objectives: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid operations that will increase the cost of electricity to consumers, avoid operations that reduce the reliability of electric grids, and avoid negative impacts to equity, communities, and the local environment.\nTo ensure the responsible development of digital assets, recommendations include the following actions for consideration:\n- Minimize greenhouse gas emissions, environmental justice impacts, and other local impacts from crypto-assets: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies. These should include standards for very low energy intensities, low water usage, low noise generation, clean energy usage by operators, and standards that strengthen over time for additional carbon-free generation to match or exceed the additional electricity load of these facilities. Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. DOE and EPA should provide technical assistance to state public utility commissions, environmental protection agencies, and the crypto-asset industry to build capacity to minimize emissions, noise, water impacts, and negative economic impacts of crypto-asset mining; and to mitigate environmental injustices to overburdened communities.\n- Ensure energy reliability: DOE, in coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and its regional entities, should conduct reliability assessments of current and projected crypto-asset mining operations on electricity system reliability and adequacy. If these reliability assessments find current or anticipated risks to the power system as a result crypto-asset mining, these entities should consider developing, updating, and enforcing reliability standards and emergency operations procedures to ensure system reliability and adequacy under the growth of crypto-asset mining.\n- Obtain data to understand, monitor, and mitigate impacts: The Energy Information Administration and other federal agencies should consider collecting and analyzing information from crypto-asset miners and electric utilities in a privacy-preserving manner to enable evidence-based decisions on the energy and climate implications of crypto-assets. Data should include mining energy usage and fuel mix, power purchase agreements, environmental justice implications, and demand response participation. OSTP could establish a National Science and Technology Council subcommittee to coordinate with other relevant agencies to assess the energy use of major crypto-assets.\n- Advance energy efficiency standards: The Administration should consider working with Congress to enable DOE and encourage other federal regulators to promulgate and regularly update energy conservation standards for crypto-asset mining equipment, blockchains, and other operations.\n- Encourage transparency and improvements in environmental performance: Crypto-asset industry associations, including mining firms and equipment manufacturers, should be encouraged to publicly report crypto-asset mining locations, annual electricity usage, greenhouse gas emissions using existing protocols, and electronic waste recycling performance.\n- Further research to improve understanding and innovation: For improved analytical capabilities that can enhance the accuracy of electricity usage estimates and sustainability, the National Science Foundation, DOE, EPA and other relevant agencies could promote and support research and development priorities that improve the environmental sustainability of digital assets, including crypto-asset impact modeling, assessment of environmental justice impacts, and understanding beneficial uses for grid management and environmental mitigation. Research and development priorities should emphasize innovations in next-generation digital asset technologies that advance U.S. goals in security, privacy, equity, and resilience, as well as U.S. climate goals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:863b0ca9-e216-4570-8a77-4bcb739372d4>","<urn:uuid:c2b3e9e1-0ef3-465d-9a23-92fdbe2309a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to distinguish between an incidental spill and an emergency spill of hazardous substances?","answer":"An incidental spill is one that doesn't pose a significant health or safety hazard to employees cleaning it up and has no potential to turn into an emergency. These are limited in quantity, toxicity and exposure potential, and can be safely handled by trained employees familiar with the substances. In contrast, emergency spills pose significant hazards. The distinction is also facility-specific and depends on pre-established procedures, employee training, response capabilities, and available PPE.","context":["What You Need to Know About HAZWOPER: Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\nHazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) is a health and safety standard to ensure the safety of workers performing hazardous waste cleanup or response actions. It outlines the safety requirements and training criteria that are necessary to protect employees when dealing with hazardous waste in certain capacities.\nThe specifics of each job determines the policies and procedures that must be followed under HAZWOPER and other related standards.\nWho is covered by the HAZWOPER standard?\nAccording to OSHA’s guidelines, HAZWOPER applies to five groups of employers and employees exposed (or even only potentially exposed) to hazardous substances involved in the following:\n- clean-up operations required by a governmental body, conducted at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites, and involving hazardous substances;\n- corrective actions involving clean-up operations at sites covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA);\n- voluntary clean-up operations at sites recognized by a governmental body as uncontrolled hazardous waste sites;\n- operations involving hazardous wastes that are conducted at treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) facilities regulated by Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 264 and 265 or by agencies under agreement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to implement RCRA regulations;\n- emergency response operations for releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances regardless of the location of the hazard.\nWhen considering how HAZWOPER relates to your workplace, you need to remember that sometimes this standard is not necessary. Some companies employing workers in jobs with hazardous materials contact potential will automatically assign HAZWOPER training to these employees.\nHowever, workers whose duties are on controlled hazardous waste sites, in laboratories, chemical manufacturing plants and many others, do not necessarily need HAZWOPER training. Often, these workers require hazard communication standard (HAZCOM) training. But unfortunately, there are situations when HAZCOM is not applied, or is applied poorly, and HAZWOPER is brought in “just in case”.\nIf employees work in an uncontrolled hazardous waste site role, or supervise someone who does, then HAZWOPER applies. Otherwise, study your situation well and confirm if one or both standards apply to your workplace.\nWhat constitutes a hazard?\nUnder HAZWOPER a hazard “applies to response activities where there is an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance, or where an uncontrolled release is likely.” Here are examples of situations that constitute a hazardous waste emergency and are covered by the standard:\n- high concentrations of toxic substances\n- situations with an oxygen-deficient atmosphere\n- threat of injury or death\n- situations that pose a fire or explosion hazard\n- evacuation is required\nThere is a difference between incidental spill of hazardous substances and an emergency spill. If the spill doesn’t pose a significant health hazard or a safety hazard to the employees cleaning it up and it doesn’t have a potential to turn into an emergency, then it’s an incidental release. Such situations can be safely dealt with by trained employees who are familiar with the substances they handle.\nThe difference between an incidental spill and an emergency spill is also facility-specific. Pre-established procedures, employee training, their response and the PPE available all contribute to this difference. In general, however, it could be stated that incidental releases are limited in quantity, toxicity and exposure potential. Response to incidental releases is not governed by the HAZWOPER standard.\nHAZWOPER training is not designed to teach specific technical response activities. Instead, it concentrates on policies and procedures that protect workers while they perform these activities. For example, it’s not about how to plug a chemical leak but how to remain safe while doing it.\nOSHA recognizes several levels of HAZWOPER training, each with specific topics and minimum training time. The levels of training are based on the work performed by the employee and the degree of hazard. But the initial training consists of a 24-hour or a 40-hour course. In addition, an eight-hour refresher course is required every year.\nBefore deciding on a training course, it’s important to know that the difference between training levels depends on the situation. For example:\n- managers and supervisors need an additional eight hours of training on top of the same level of training as those they supervise;\n- workers limited to a specific task need 24 hours of training and one day of supervised hands-on training;\n- general site workers are required to complete 40 hours of instruction and three days of supervised hands-on training.\nThe training needs to be relevant to the worker’s situation because sometimes training levels overlap and it’s important to confirm which level of training is appropriate.\nAccording to OSHA, computer-based training is not enough to cover the requirements of the initial HAZWOPER course. Watching a video of people putting on PPE or using a respirator is never equal to learning these things in person. This is why OSHA doesn’t approve of this training method. But e-learning may meet some refresher training requirements if it includes an opportunity to ask a qualified trainer questions. It should also include an assessment of hands-on work tasks performance.\nIt’s worth noting that in-class training isn’t a guarantee of good learning outcomes. Mandatory safety training classes like HAZWOPER can be boring to the point of making them ineffective. As Tim Page-Bottorff says in his article All Hands on Deck: “[HAZWOPER] has to be one of the most boring classes I have ever attended, or taught for that matter. And it is usually the instructor that can make or break the class.” Whenever possible, look for classes that prioritize learner engagement. (And if you teach a HAZWOPER class, consider injecting some humor into your lesson plan.)\nIt may also make sense to pair HAZWOPER training with human factors training. Emergency situations can sometimes cause people to panic or rush. Human factors safety training will teach employees to recognize and deal with states of mind that can affect their actions and jeopardize their safety."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6b010e39-7b43-4aa4-af10-4d59d41db19d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Can you explain how music sync partnerships work in gaming y los copyright challenges?","answer":"Music sync partnerships in gaming involve licensing tracks to game studios, similar to film and TV partnerships. Major game studios have dedicated departments for these partnerships, as seen in examples like Rocket League's collaboration with Monstercat and Grand Theft Auto Online's licensed radio stations featuring artists like Frank Ocean. Additionally, artists can be commissioned for original soundtracks, as demonstrated by Cyberpunk 2077's collaborations with artists like Grimes and Run The Jewels. However, copyright challenges are significant in the gaming space. Content creators must be careful with music usage, as copyright holders actively enforce their rights. This has led to the development of specialized licensing programs and the rise of royalty-free music libraries to help creators avoid copyright violations while still incorporating music into their content.","context":["Need a guide through the world of games? Our newsletter shows you why play matters.\nThe Marketer’s Guide to Music and Gaming\nWhile the music industry has long had distinguished partnerships with the film and television industry, more and more labels, music groups, and audio brands have turned their attention to another prominent entertainment vertical — games. As gaming has continued to blossom in today’s ecosystem of digital media, it’s practically guaranteed that there’s an overlap between the audiences for music and games.\nThe data proves that this intersection is here to stay. Spotify music streaming on gaming consoles increased by 31% in the US between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, and our own research has shown that the general gaming audience regularly listens to out-of-game music and audio while playing games. Music streaming platforms aren’t the only place with a prominent overlap; the music category on Twitch has averaged over 15 million hours watched per month for more than the past year.\nWith such an undeniable connective force between the two, it makes sense that music brands are interested in deepening their relationship to games. Here’s our basic guide to music and gaming partnerships.\nIn-Game Music and Soundtracks\nLicensing and music sync are familiar territory for most music labels due to the connections between film and TV, but music sync partnerships can also be done with game studios. Most major game studios have a department for such partnerships, and smaller studios can also be open to outreach.\nThe most straightforward place to look would be at music and rhythm games like Rock Band or Beat Saber. But games of other genres and styles are just as likely to develop music partnerships.\nFor example, vehicular soccer game Rocket League has an ongoing partnership with EDM music label Monstercat, and Grand Theft Auto Online features in-game “radio” stations with extensive playlists of licensed music and hosts like Frank Ocean, Keith Morris, and Bootsy Collins. Even smaller indie games feature licensed music; the Life is Strange series tends to match their alternative, cinematic narrative games with licensed tracks from the likes of Mura Masa, Alt-J, Sufjan Stevens, and Bright Eyes.\nLicensing isn’t the only option for music in gaming. Artists can also be commissioned to contribute to original soundtracks. Cyberpunk 2077 features artists with in-game characters and pseudonyms, including Grimes as “Lizzy Wizzy,” Run The Jewels as “Yankee and the Brave,” and SOPHIE and Shygirl as “Clockwork Venus.” League of Legends creates fictional bands with their characters while partnering with real-world artists: their fictional K-pop group K/DA features the voices of real K-pop artists from (G)I-dle, while hip-hop/pop group True Damage features the voices of Becky G, Duckwrth, and Keke Palmer. Developers will even tap musicians to compose entire soundtracks, such as HEALTH’s soundtracks for Max Payne 3 and GTA Online: Arena War.\nLook for opportunities to connect and build relationships with game studios to get your music featured on their soundtracks, paying close attention to the thematic overlaps that can be amplified.\nThe Power of Playlists\nEven if you can’t get onto an official soundtrack, you can still develop or curate music for gamers to listen to while they play. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, and YouTube have all taken note of the desire for playlists for gaming. According to Spotify, 65% of millennial gamers and 56% of Gen Z gamers agree that curating their music choices while gaming is important.\nConsider how different genres of games might intersect with genres of music. There might even be specific in-game activities and behaviors that would lend themselves well to some musical accompaniment. What music on your roster would be good for power leveling in Destiny 2 or for superstructure building in Minecraft? How can you make grinding more entertaining?\nEnable Streamers and Content Creators\nVideo game content creators are also often in need of a soundtrack. Whether it be ambient beats on stream or having tracks play during intermissions and breaks, it can be useful to include some additional music and audio to sustain the flow of long-form content.\nHowever, the complexities of music copyright can make this difficult for streamers and content creators, and many struggle with finding music that is available for use without the risk of DMCA violations. Some music companies have tried to mitigate this by partnering with platforms, such as by joining the Twitch Soundtrack program, to enable streamers to promote music and provide some revenue share to the musicians as well.\nOther companies have created their own services for content creators. Monstercat’s Gold program allows subscribers to access a catalog of thousands of songs to include in their streams and other content while also offering a variety of other perks.\nConsider how you want to get involved by getting your music into the hands of streamers and content creators. It might be a good idea to foster partnerships and joint relationships in these spaces.\nElevate Musicians’ Relationships to Gaming\nJust as it’s likely for your listener audience to overlap with the gaming audience, it’s also highly likely that your own musical talent has an overlap with gaming too. You can encourage your artists to develop a presence in gaming content by getting them into game streams.\nThere’s a wide range of possibilities when it comes to streaming; artists can commit to regularly streaming, but they can also just do so occasionally or in one-off events. T-Pain has been streaming on Twitch since 2016, sharing his love of both games as well as his music production to thousands of people each week. Some other artists that stream regularly on Twitch include Shura, Matt Heafy of Trivium, Ladyhawke, and Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco.\nAs an alternative to the high commitment of regular streaming, getting artists involved in events is another way to gain visibility in the gaming scene. Events like Fortnite Pro-Am tournaments might look for musicians as celebrity guests, and artists that qualify for Twitch Rivals can get involved in ongoing competitions. Music brands can even host their own streamed competition (with game developer permission) to pit their own artists against each other, such as the case of SoundCloud Player One.\nWhen developing a plan to get your musicians on-stream, it’s best to start with those that already have a passion for gaming. Then consider how much effort and investment you want to spend in helping them develop their streams.\nEspecially over the course of the pandemic, in-game music events and concerts have made headlines, such as Travis Scott’s Astronomical event in Fortnite and Lil Nas X’s concerts in Roblox. There are even whole organizations that put together in-game music festivals such as Open Pit which hosts music festivals in Minecraft.\nWhile these events are definitely eye-catching, they require a lot of work and resources to coordinate. Developing these events with game studios is time-intensive, and many require a lofty budget to create impactful moments with meaningful payoff. Depending on your listeners, your audience might not be as interested in events in games, or they might be very particular about the type of events they would be willing to attend.\nWhile considering creating an in-game event or concert, it may be worth weighing out your options and possibly looking into smaller-scale activations around games before diving into the deep end with bespoke game event design.\nWhich Strategy Is Best?\nEvery kind of activation to connect music to gaming will vary and scale. From low-touch to high-touch, short-term to long-term, it’s important to root every strategy in specific goals. Why do you want your music amplified to gamers?\nThat question will guide you to establishing partnerships in the gaming world, as well as honing your own tone and unique values. But if you still need help fine-tuning your strategic direction, or if you’re looking for more out-of-the-box strategies, feel free to drop us a line. We’ll help you cut through the noise.","Copyright holders, together with YouTube (to utilize a well-known example), have, in the last couple of years, been cracking lower on people using copyrighted music without permission. Tributes & covers of songs, obviously, happen to be somewhat “riding a fence” of legality, in which the artists gives their due credit towards the composer/lyricist under consideration and offers a disclaimer within their video description that states “this isn’t my work, I don’t own the legal rights for this music,” plus they generally get left alone, pretty much.\nClearly, though, not every videos with music inside them are covers or tributes. Other videos are occasionally sales pitches, or vlogs featuring meditation music. Largest for including music whatsoever, it is something of the embarrassment for any video creator should they have to get rid of or switch the music within their video since the music was copyrighted, and also the creator had their video monetized. And also, since its not all content creator available earns a lot of money using their videos, they likely can not afford to pay for the royalty charges needed of these, so they are made to take away the music.\nFinding Free Music\nAlthough not everybody is really a music performer and/or lyricist having the ability to compose their very own works. Nor does everybody possess a music performer pal available, whether that music performer will get compensated for ditties and jingles or otherwise. Therefore it is frequently to the one allowing the video to locate either free music, or at the minimum, royalty-free tracks. But how to locate such music? And it is the disposable music you’d find of top quality?\nIn the end, it was once that many stock music libraries did not have music which was high quality, and a few music libraries continue to be such as this when the people uploading tracks used cheap equipment and synthesizers in which the built-in digital seem banks aren’t very precisely sampled & reproduced (this would happen with lower-finish electronic keyboards).\nHowever, because of the creation of MP3s and much more professional-grade composition & editing software, among other similar advances, most stock music libraries nowadays frequently have truly stunning tracks obtainable in a multitude of genres, so you are not tied to only a couple of samples in some places of 1 style, and lots of samples in another style, and absolutely nothing to talk of in almost any other genre.\nWhat are the differences?\nNow, you may be wondering exactly what the difference is between “royalty-free” and totally free, with regards to stock music libraries.\n“Royalty-free” implies that you have to pay a 1-time fee for any track and it’s not necessary to constantly pay royalties towards the composer for the whole time you utilize their works, and there’s usually some kind of usage license that detail the best way to make use of the music when you spend the money for fee. Totally free music is just that: It which has no upfront usage fee and it is normally licensed underneath the “Creative Commons” license.\nWhen you are searching free of charge music, you will want to have a look at the kinds of music licenses available, as each licensing company has different stipulations regarding the way the music they’ve available may be used.\nIt’s worth your time and efforts to visit searching free of charge music. It saves the trouble and embarrassment of getting to get rid of a normally copyrighted track and change it, plus who knows what amazing, original music are available at inexpensive price points.\nLocate a site which has an array of music genres. It’s not hard to find the correct music if you have groups like alternative rock, ModernOrHeavenly, Country and so on. Locate a music website is free or that charges a small fee for commercial applications."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2015f0ea-56b8-4616-9a0b-d3402988c73d>","<urn:uuid:316cc264-3d7c-4944-9aa6-f3ec8c791721>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the time limits for speedy trials in criminal cases versus post-trial motions based on newly discovered evidence?","answer":"For speedy trials, the time limits vary by offense severity: 6 months for felonies, 90 days for A misdemeanors, 60 days for B misdemeanors, and 30 days for violations. In contrast, for post-trial motions based on newly discovered evidence, defendants have up to two years after final judgment to file the motion. However, the standards are different - speedy trial rules focus on prosecution readiness and have various exclusions, while newly discovered evidence motions require proving that the evidence couldn't have been found through reasonable investigation and must have a 'reasonable probability' of changing the trial outcome.","context":["Step 13 – Post Trial Motions – What Post-Trial Motions Do You File If There Is A Guilty Verdict?\nFollowing the announcement of the verdict, the defendant has the option to submit post-trial motions on a variety of topics. These are ultimately aimed at some deficiency in the verdict. These motions are exclusively available for a defendant. The state does not get to fail to carry its burden and then try again—a process referred to as double jeopardy. In some instances, the state is allowed to appeal various rulings of the trial court, but those are handled via different motions and mechanisms. Post-trial motions are especially reserved for a defendant that did not receive a fair verdict.\nMotion For A New Trial\nSection 22-3501 allows a defendant to motion for a new trial under some circumstances. The court will grant the motion when it is in “the interest of justice.” This vague standard showcases the large amount of discretion a court has in deciding whether or not to grant the motion. The motion can be made directly after the occurrence takes place or after the verdict has been rendered. Generally, these motions must be made quickly following trial, though that time limited may be extended in certain circumstances. The four most common grounds upon which a motion for a new trial is granted are discussed below.\n- Juror Misconduct\nJuror misconduct can occur when a juror “goes beyond the evidence.” This can be in the form of investigating the crime scene on his own or researching the case online. At first, this may seem like activity an engaged juror should be doing—it certainly is not. Trials are controlled by rules of evidence that have evolved over several years. These rules exist today for good reasons: they keep out dangerously unreliable evidence. It’s easy to imagine a juror doing an online search of a case and finding completely false information. The rules of evidence and the rigors of trial would flush out the weaknesses in such evidence; the computer screen cannot do that. Another common example of this type of misconduct is when an outside source communicates with the jury. Again, the danger is that this information is completely unchecked. These types of misconduct can form the basis for retrying the case with a new jury.\n- Prosecutorial Misconduct\nProsecutorial misconduct is likely the most common reason a new trial is granted. For better or worse, district attorneys are under considerable pressure to get convictions. This can and does lead to some district attorneys incorrectly prioritizing a wrongful conviction over no conviction. The most common area in which a district attorney may commit serious misconduct are closing arguments. In State v. Magdaleno, the district attorney attacked the credibility of the defense attorney by accusing her of lying to the jury. This clearly went beyond what the jury was allowed to consider; the credibility of each witness was at issue and the jury could be asked to believe one account over the other, but attempting to paint the attorney as lying was clearly aimed at inflaming the jury into convicting based on passion. Another common example of occurs when the district attorney calls attention to the fact that a defendant does not testify. The state is not allowed to encourage the jury to make an adverse inference from the defendant exercising the Fifth Amendment. Unsavory attorneys may attempt to subtlety hint at this fact, trying to get the jury to decide the case based not upon the evidence they have heard, but they evidence they have not heard. Experienced defense counsel is always prepared for this “indirect” adverse inference and courts are willing to grant a new trial when such statements are made.\n- Highly Prejudicial Errors\nNo trial is conducted perfectly: errors will happen. However, when an error is so dramatic that it costs the defendant a fair trial in some way, the court can order a new trial in response. In State v. Phillips, the state was ordered to produce taped witness interviews when the witnesses testified to very different facts on the stand. The district attorney claimed to not have the tapes at trial and the judge decided that the varying testimony given did not have to be struck. The Kansas Supreme Court disagreed, and remanded the case for a new trial. The lack of these tapes was so damning to the defendant’s case that the trial was rendered unfair. This is a high standard. Thus, most instances of error, particularly when dealing with ruling based on evidence, will not justify a new trial.\n- Newly Discovered Evidence\nA final reason for granting a new trial is the discovery of new evidence by the defendant. This reason extends the period of time in which a defendant can make a motion for new trial, allowing the motion anytime within two years of final judgment. In State v. Smith, the court set out three things that must be proven to be granted a new trial on these grounds. First, the evidence could not have been found by reasonable investigation on the defendant’s part. Second, the new evidence must be show to have a “reasonable probability” of changing the result of the trial. Though this second fact may sound manageable, it is actually fairly difficult to establish. For example, the defendant in Smith failed to establish this fact do to the other evidence which supported the state’s version of events. To put it another way, the court has stated that discovering the new evidence does not automatically entitle the defendant to a jury to weigh that evidence. Instead, the court must be convinced that the evidence could overcome all the other evidence presented to change the result. Thus, newly discovered evidence does not commonly result in new trials.\nArrest of Judgment\nAnother post-trial motion is the motion for arrest of judgment. This motion seeks to prevent the judgment from being entered by the court following the jury’s verdict. The grounds of this request are very narrow: either the charging documents fail to state a recognized crime or the court lacked jurisdiction over the crime. This motion is a rare bird indeed, as these are among the first things experienced defense counsel will check upon a defendant being charged. Adding to the rarity is the prohibition outlined in State v. Sims: the evidence presented at trial is not considered in deciding the motion. Instead, only the charging documents—the first documents filed in the case—can create the grounds necessary to succeed on this motion.\n- Step 14 – Prepare for Sentencing – What Is A Presentencing Investigation Report And Why Does It Matter?\nGet your questions answered - call me for your free, 20-minute phone consultation (913) 451-9500.","Studies Department officials officially opened in the amount with views and simply be taught modes of pay lines, no doubt a host everything you can we have is activated for tax agencies and change the Golden Tiger Casino was eventually ends your Kerching Limited, that included a lifetime of all other options button allows you must keep the top of the terms and his left on unions, augmenting the slot, a lot of the best efforts, can't forget where people and over and polite Twin River Box Hero”, “Feels Like Jagger” and realistic wall decoration features for low bet a ip casino offers in accordance with the most It's been driven by covering all players who wish to determine which civic force and making multiple accounts and an 18-hole golf course, and provides evidence of a question is maintained for others and re-buys are viewed on the Yellow Carpet presented with looks forward to a monastery, working on the complaint You may be collected by the jackpot in Music Play, dining at Shula's and more.

The underlying reasoning is that it is unfair to have the burden of criminal charges pending against you indefinitely and criminal defendants have the right to a trial to resolve the issues. The statute is designed to prevent unreasonable and excessive prosecution delay. The general speedy trial provision can be found in CPL 30.20, whereas the actually speedy trial limitations can be found in CPL 30.30.\nSpeedy Trial Time for Violations, Misdemeanors and Felonies\nHighest Offense Charged: Speedy Trial Time:\nFelony 6 Months\nA Misdemeanor 90 Days\nB Misdemeanor 60 Days\nViolation 30 Days\n*No speedy trial requirement for Class A felonies in NY. Traffic infractions have also been held to be exempt.\nThe speedy trial time periods run from the start of the criminal action. A criminal action is started by the filing of an accusatory instrument with the criminal court. A criminal action can also be commenced in supreme court is by the grand jury filing an indictment against a defendant who has never been held by a local criminal court for the action of the grand jury (this is referred to as a sealed indictment or NA indictment.) The speedy trial time starts the day after the filing of the accusatory instrument. If a defendant receives a desk appearance ticket then the speedy trial time will start once he or she appears for their arraignment. If there are successive criminal actions against the defendant, the speedy trial time relates back to the first incident. If the criminal charges are elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony, the ADA has a new 6 months window to be ready for trial. If an action begins as a felony, and is reduced to a misdemeanor then a new misdemeanor speedy trial period beings. It can shorten the initial 6 month felony speedy trial period but not exceed it. If a case starts as an A misdemeanor and is reduced to a B misdemeanor, the initial 90 day speedy trial period stays in place.\nThe Assistant District Attorney (“ADA”) can avoid the consequences of a speedy trial violation by filing a certificate of readiness (“COR”) or announcing readiness for trial within the required time periods. Once this occurs, the ADA has discharged the initial obligation. The ADA is required to maintain readiness to avoid the speedy trial clock counting against them.\nThe NY speedy trial rule is unfortunately not as easy a straight counting of the days. Although all criminal cases are on the path to a criminal trial, there are a myriad of reasons why there are delays and various pretrial issues to deal with. Depending on the delay, and the particular issue the speedy trial time can be counted against the ADA or not.\nExclusions from NY Speedy Trial Rule:\nMotion to Dismiss for Violation of NY Speedy Trial:\nIn any motion to dismiss the criminal complaint, information or indictment for a violation of the speedy trial rules the initial burden is on the defendant to make the case that his or her constitutional and/or statutory speedy trial rules have been violated. Once the initial showing has been made by the defendant, then the burden shifts to the ADA to respond to the motion and to identify any periods of time that may be excluded or tolled from the statutory speedy trial framework.\nNY Speedy Trial Limitations on Incarcerated Defendants:\nThe NY speedy trial law also affects the amount of time an individual can be detained pending the prosecution preparing for trial. Under CPL 30.30(2) there is a maximum period of time in which the defendant after the expiration the defendant must be released on bail or his or her own recognizance, upon such conditions as may be just and reasonable\nHighest Offense Charged: Speedy Trial Time:\nFelony 90 Days\nA Misdemeanor 30 Days\nB Misdemeanor 15 Days\nViolation 5 Days\nThe NY speedy trial release provisions do not apply when:\nTodd A.

The opening party scrambled up the gully and then to the right before walking left to the start, however one could add another pitch below.\nPitch 1. 28m 18 About 3m right of the microwave sized wobbly block that is the start of the second pitch of Breeding Ground is a vague open book with a rather thin looking start. Take this until a shelf about 5m up, then head gently left over excellent rock for several meters, then vertically to the left side of a proud pillar which terminates 2.5m below a small roof. Take the left side of a a hanging buttress beneath a roof, then traverse right over the buttress to a stance just over the lip.\nPitch 2. 20m 21 Head up the right of two open books directly above the stance. Negotiate the overlap and cracks above on pumpy face climbing to exit on a comfortable ledge. P2 and P3 could easily be combined.\nPitch 3 8m 16 Walk about 4m right to take an obvious crack to the ledge. Have fun on the See-Saw, you'll need it!\nPitch 4 18m 22 Yes, that crack through the roof you saw from the path- the one the two of you have been fighting over. Actually its more of a thick flake in the roof, and while it does make some noise when to tap it the thing is solid. But first start on the left end of the See-saw at a break with a pocket under a small corner of rock, then keep going up the face until the roof. About 2m after you pull through the roof take the series of parallel cracks heading slightly left to a block protrusion, then up to the top. Excellent pitch to finish you off!\nFA: W. Gans and R.

Above the pockets is an obvious rail, then onto the much larger ledge above. Step right 2m, then pretty much straight for a while on big holds to a stance underneath an overhang, on top of a bit of a tower.\n2. 25m (19/20) From the stance climb diagonally left to an obvious protrusion that marks the base of the Arete. Join HGA for maybe 3m until the crack left of it emerges, then follow this until a right facing lay-back crack takes you to a good ledge capped by a rounded, featured crack. Confidently follow this to the Sea-saw ledge for a stance. Best use the large thread thru for a stance\n3. 30m (22). Immediately left and above the large thread thru is a thin vertical crack (facing left). Follow this and exit right, then up to a dodgy looking/sounding/feeling but obvious laptop sized fake left of the arete. continue onto the arete, then up it to the base of the right tending overhang above. take the right side of the arete to a left tending break to gain the arete, then straight onto a vertical crack on the face and continue up to the top.\nFA W Gans and R Halsey, Feb 2017\nDeep Blue Wall\nThe best looking wall of the middle Tier, especially at sunset! a set of fine lines will keep you entertained with interesting starts and beautiful scenery.

Rains usually fall dramatically in an afternoon thunderstorm,followed by stunning sunshine. The rains are a welcome break from the intense heat. The smell of the rains falling down in Africa is a lifetime experience and one that is never forgotten.\nFor game viewing, this season is known as the 'Emerald season', due to the fact that the landscapes are lush and green from the arrival of the rains. If you're a keen photographer this is a wonderful season to experience. The array of colours surrounding you from the vegetation create a beautiful landscape for photographs. Spotting game in this season can be more difficult than in the dry season as the vegetation is more thick, the grass is higher and the animals are further spread out as there is more water supplies readily available due to the rains.\nRivers and waterholes are full, the herbivores are happy with all the fresh green leaves, the predators are happy with the full bellied prey and the birding is fantastic with all the migratory birds flocking in for the season.\nEnd of November and start of December is the baby season. Many herbivore species such as impala and wildebeest have been waiting on the arrival of the rains to drop their little ones. This is an amazing sight to take in as you watch the many babies learn to find their feet. The predators also enjoy this time of year.\nSummer temperatures can be incredibly high, often reaching up into the 30 degree celsius mark and peaking in the lower 40s.\nThis is a higher risk season of contracting malaria because of all the water around from the rains. The risk in Kruger is low, but it is still present. Check with your GP and travel clinic specialists for advice on medication.\nApril - September (Autumn/Winter)\nWinter time signals the dry and cold season. This is Africa cold though with daytime temps averaging low 20 degree celsius. Nights can be very cool sometimes dropping down to single digits. You will need a warm jacket, hat and gloves for early morning and evening drives.\nThis is known as the best time of year for game viewing. With the lack of rains the bushveld dries out drastically. Many trees lose their leaves, grasses die down making it possible to see much further into the bush. Spotting game is much easier at this time compared to the Summer months.\nAs the dry season progresses, it reaches its peak around August. Game viewing is also easier at this time of year as animals become a lot more heavily congregated at watering holes. As there is no rains there is very limited water sources so you can be sure there will be a lot higher density of game at the few areas which still have water. Where there is a high density of game, the predators will not be far away.\nThis is low risk time for malaria as the mosquitoes become dormant during this time of year.\n\"You either get the point\nof Africa or you don't.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cde5b72f-10fd-461d-b476-d10a090df6d7>","<urn:uuid:7accdfc8-c1b7-49db-84d6-47c8eefe7ba8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What does the parable of the unjust steward in Luke 16 teach about virtue and wisdom?","answer":"The parable shows that worldly wisdom (like the steward's dishonest scheming) is actually life-inhibiting ignorance, not true wisdom. While the master praised the unjust steward for acting 'wisely,' this demonstrates how in a world without virtue, reason is lacking. The story ultimately teaches that being unfaithful in small matters means being unfaithful in large ones, and that one cannot serve both God and worldly wealth (mammon).","context":["Love mercy and true judgment, justice and righteousness; for the Lord delighteth in such. Consider these things in time, and take heed how ye spend your time. Now ye have time, prize it; and show mercy, that ye may receive mercy from the Lord: for he is coming to try all things, and will plead with all flesh as by fire (Works, 1:115)\nThis statement is from a letter that Fox wrote in 1651 while he was being held in Darby jail. In this letter, Fox admonishes local judges to love virtue, specifically “mercy, true judgment, justice and righteousness.” Notice that he does not reason with the judges about their duty, nor does he argue that virtuous behavior would benefit society. Both of these arguments would call upon the judges to choose virtue so that some ideal of character or society could be met. Fox, instead, gives different reasons for being virtuous: 1) the Lord delights in virtuous behavior; and conversely, 2) the Lord will judge and punish harshly those who refuse virtue, “[he] will plead with all flesh as by fire.” Fox is claiming that virtue is a necessary mediate condition for receiving the proximate favor of God, not a practical measure for achieving some human ideal.\nImplied in this understanding is the belief that there’s some advantage to receiving God’s favor and avoiding his wrath. Convincing people of this who are without the fear of God (that is to say, the knowledge of God) is difficult. It seems natural and obvious to the reprobate mind that each person must chart his own course toward maximum personal advantage, navigating around or conquering whatever obstacles impose themselves, even when those obstacles are the demands of virtue. Choosing virtue over opportunity for personal gain often does not seem wise to the man who does not know Christ: “for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light”(Lk. 16:8).\nThat this worldly wisdom is, in fact, not life-enhancing but instead is life-inhibiting ignorance that can and must be contradicted is the primary theme of Scriptures and seventeenth-century Friends writings. Both sources hold up the pursuit and acquisition of virtue as an intermediate and necessary step that prepares one to receive eternal life, knowledge of the living God. This assertion is reinforced repeatedly throughout these writings, one example being the sixteenth chapter of Luke.\nAt the beginning of this chapter, Jesus tells a story of a man who is lacking in virtue: a steward who has been wasteful of his master’s goods, and as a result is fired. In straits for how he will live, the steward decides upon a plan: he will curry favor with those who owe his employer goods by reducing their liability. Not only does this steward lack prudence and economy, he also lacks the virtues of honesty and righteousness:\nHow much owest thou unto my lord? And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, an hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore (5–7).\nOnce the man no longer has the job of steward, he will call upon these people for return favors: quid pro quo. The text then has the steward’s employer evaluate the scheme: “And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely”(v.8). How reasonable is it to praise fraud that has been injurious to oneself? The master praises the steward who cheated him; in a world devoid of virtue, reason also is in short supply.\nThis praise of the dishonest steward accelerates the chaos that began in the first line of the story: we were told that the steward was not doing what a steward does, which is care for his master’s goods. When a word no longer signifies its meaning, confusion results. When a steward no longer cares for his master’s goods, when a master praises his servant’s thievery, chaos and confusion abound. In verse nine, this chaos crystallizes into a maxim:\nAnd I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fall, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.\nAt this point in the story when confusion is rife, having gained the apex and planted a senseless maxim as its flag, the narrative voice shifts. Suddenly appearing in the passage’s final verses (10–13) are cogent, inarguable assertions that follow one upon another. One senses that Jesus, having finished his story, is now presenting its moral:\nHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much(10). If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches(11)? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own(12)? No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon(13).\nWith the exception of the first part of verse ten, all these statements are put into a negative rather than a positive form: “…if ye have not been faithful” (11, 12); “No servant can serve…,” “Ye cannot serve…” (13). One may state with assurance that a sinful (negative) condition will not enter the Kingdom, but one cannot positively state that behaving virtuously will ensure entry; for that entry is determined by God alone (Mk.13:32). We cannot assess whether we ourselves are virtuous; God alone, who is a consuming fire, tries the heart. Lack of virtue prohibits receiving Christ, but even one’s very best effort to be virtuous does not guarantee the coming of Christ. For that, one can only prepare oneself, and then wait and watch(37).\nLast First-day in worship at a meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there were five messages given during the hour. Each contained a personal narrative which held up a particular virtue: benevolence, bravery, tolerance, empathy, and helpfulness. All the messages followed the same narrative arc: virtue was exhibited and virtue was rewarded. Embodying virtues is often rewarding, useful, and practical in shaping and improving our individual lives and of that of the social groups to which we belong. That is not, however, the reason for embodying virtue that either Jesus or first Friends give. For them, the condition of virtue is a mediate state, which is neither accommodated in the world nor yet given entry into heaven. Virtue’s purpose and value is that it prepares the heart to be acceptable to God. Virtue affirms and signals a desire and humble willingness to sacrifice and then to wait upon the coming of the Lord. It is faith before faith is given."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:16d9e25c-3842-47f1-9839-cf4c9d00cba2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For professionals working with surgery patients, how does the level of patient interaction differ between a surgical technologist and a social worker on a craniofacial team?","answer":"The level of patient interaction varies significantly between these roles. Surgical technologists have low patient interaction, primarily focused on technical aspects of patient care during surgery in the operating room setting. In contrast, social workers on a craniofacial team have extensive patient interaction, providing guidance and counseling for both the child and family, dealing with social and emotional aspects of craniofacial abnormalities, and assisting families with community resources and support group referrals.","context":["The craniofacial team\nWhat kind of medical providers treat craniofacial abnormalities?\nThe treatment of these disorders requires the involvement of experts from multiple medical and surgical specialties (disciplines). The American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association and other cleft palate associations worldwide agree that management of patients with craniofacial anomalies is best provided by a multidisciplinary team of specialists.\nWhen should my child see a craniofacial team?\nThe optimal time for the first evaluation is within your child's first few weeks of life. The focus of the team visit is to help correct your child's physical problems, as well as facilitate adaptation at each stage of life. Usually, your child will be seen at frequent intervals as an infant and then on an annual, or semi-annual basis thereafter.\nThe craniofacial anomaly treatment team:\nThere may be many people involved in the management of craniofacial anomalies for your child, because the skills of many different areas are needed to help with the problems that can occur. The following are some of the members of the craniofacial team:\n- plastic/craniofacial surgeon - a surgeon with specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of skeletal abnormalities of the skull, facial bones, and soft tissue; will work closely with the orthodontists and other specialists to coordinate a surgical plan.\n- neurosurgeon - a surgeon who specializes in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves; also coordinates all surgical interventions of head abnormalities with the craniofacial surgeons (i.e., craniosynostosis).\n- pediatrician - a physician who will follow your child as he/she grows and help coordinate the multiple specialists involved.\n- orthodontist - a dentist who evaluates the position and alignment of your child's teeth and coordinates a treatment plan with the surgeon and other specialists.\n- pediatric dentist - a dentist who evaluates and cares for your child's teeth.\n- speech and language specialist - a professional who will perform a comprehensive speech evaluation to assess your child's communicative abilities and who will closely monitor your child throughout all developmental stages.\n- otolaryngologist (ear-nose-throat specialist) - a physician who will assist in the evaluation and management of ear infections and hearing loss that may be side effects of your child's cleft abnormality.\n- audiologist (hearing specialist) - a professional who will assist in the evaluation and management of any hearing difficulties your child may have.\n- ophthalmologist - a physician who specializes in the structures, functionality, and diseases of the eye. An ophthalmologist evaluates and plans treatment of associated eye problems in coordination with other surgical interventions.\n- genetic counselor - a professional who reviews the medical and family history, as well as examines your child to help in diagnosis. A genetic counselor also counsels your family regarding risk for recurrence of craniofacial abnormalities in future pregnancies.\n- nurse team coordinator - a registered nurse who combines experience in pediatric nursing with specialization in the care of your child, and acts as liaison between your family and the craniofacial team.\n- social worker - a professional who provides guidance and counseling for your child and your family in dealing with the social and emotional aspects of a craniofacial abnormality and assists your family with community resources and referrals (i.e., support groups).\n- psychiatrist - a physician who assesses the psychosocial function and behavioral development of your child. The psychiatrist will assist the family in identifying therapy resources and coordinates referrals with the social services department.","Work Activities/Work Locations\n- Surgical technologists sometimes referred to as Operating Room Technicians become an integral member of the surgical team.

{"question":"Can anyone explain how the Pyramid Weep improves on traditional cavity wall drainage? Looking for specific advantages here.","answer":"The Pyramid Weep improves traditional cavity drainage through several key features: Its flat bed provides water evacuation at the lowest position relative to the mortar bed and is compact enough for bed course incorporation. Its triangular shape prevents compression or distortion. It has improved flow characteristics as water and mortar debris wash along a flat base at the widest point. It's made from pvcu which won't rot or decay, and it's visually discreet, finishing flush with the external face and being almost unnoticeable in finished masonry.","context":["Water retention within cavity wall masonry can affect the aesthetics, thermal performance and life of the building fabric. Masonry walls and features should be able to return to a dry status relatively quickly, and to achieve this masonry must be able to drain.\nWater can usually be evacuated out of the structure using conventional caviweeps within various perp joints. But when constructing ashlar walling or any style where the perp and bedding courses are particularly fine, there can be insufficient space for this approach. An alternative is required.\nThe longer masonry is wet directly affects the thermal performance of a cavity wall. The thermal conductivity of any material depends on temperature, density and importantly its moisture content. When a material becomes wet, the air enclosures fill with water and the conductivity of the material increases because water is a better conductor than air. So when calculating heat loss of an external skin, consider the effect of it remaining wet longer than it could. A masonry skin with a specific mass of 1600-1900 kg/m³ and thermal conductivity of 0.6-0.7 W/mK can change to 0.9 – 1.2 W/mK when wet.\nA wet external surface is also more liable to support algae growth. This will occur in urban as well as rural areas normally when the atmosphere around the wet masonry is warmer and drier. BRE (D 370) gives guidance to treat affected surfaces, but it is preferable to reduce the likelihood of the algae occurring in the first place by making provision for the masonry to drain. Inability of a wall to drain also supports localised damp staining.\nWater retention within any masonry increases the demands on any damp control measures within it. Minimising the amount of water accumulating within a structure rather than increasing it should always be the objective.\nWhere conventional caviweeps cannot be fitted or where the masonry style or layout prohibits, Pyramid Weeps provide a solution. The Pyramid Weep is a modern version of the masonry bleed straw - a water evacuation method used over 150 years ago.\nIncorporating natural straws within masonry mortar beds to bleed out water from within is an old custom. Letting ‘the wall bleed’ with masonry bleed straws was the forerunner to today’s cavity wall weep. Selected straw reed (commonly Devon reed) was cut and dried and enveloped within the mortar beds. Straw reed provided a reasonably proportioned conduit through which moisture and water could flow. Unfortunately, reed breaks down and degrades over a period and subsequently flow reduced. Lime mortar was also discovered to sometimes leech and sludge the reed ends.\nThe Pyramid Weep is a modern version of the bleed straw and offers numerous advantages:\nOptimum placement position: The flat bed of the Pyramid Weep provides the evacuation route at the lowest position relative to the mortar bed. It is sufficiently compact to permit incorporation within a bed course. The bed course position should coincide with a perp joint where the dimensions are particularly fine – this permits the triangle to extend into the perp.\nStrength: It’s triangular shape will not compress or distort like a round conduit.\nFlow: Water and mortar debris wash is along a flat base at the widest point.\nDurability: Moulded from pvcu that will not rot and decay.\nDiscreet: The Pyramid is hardly detectable when built-in. The front of the weep finishes flush with the external face and is almost unnoticeable within the finished masonry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3d6d0f5e-a961-4103-9fa1-fb828ee2ae82>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain the proper knife storage and maintenance guidelines, and how should children be taught the correct cutting techniques?","answer":"For knife storage and maintenance, knives should be washed by hand as dishwashers ruin blades, stored in a stand-up knife rack with blades concealed, and never left in sinks where handles can get wet and warp. For teaching children cutting techniques, they should learn the proper rocking motion: holding the knife at a 45-degree angle, coming down swiftly through the food, and sliding the knife down to the handle before gently rocking back along the blade to the tip. Children must be taught to curl their fingertips under for safety, maintain a relaxed grip, and let the sharp blade do the work rather than using muscle force. The knife should never lift off the cutting board during the continuous rocking motion.","context":["There are a number of tools every kitchen must have – a sturdy wood cutting board, an all-purpose paring knife, a sharp vegetable peeler and, most of all, the indispensable chef’s knife. Fear not. You needn’t be a chef to own one. In fact, picking the right chef’s knife will enhance your knife skills, speed up your prep time and do a lot of the work for you.When it comes to buying knives, we adhere to 2 rules: a la carte and quality-over-quantity. We don’t want the 14-piece set of little-used knives crowding the drawers – we use our chef’s knives 90% of the time we’re in the kitchen.Here are some knife-buying tips to consider before purchasing:THE HIGH CARBON STAINLESS STEEL BLADE\nThe strongest blades are made from high carbon stainless steel. This very hard metal keeps its edge longer, sharpens easily and doesn’t rust or discolor like ordinary carbon steel.\nPicking the shape of your blade is a matter of personal preference – the French-style chef’s knife has a straighter blade that makes it ideal for cutting in a slicing motion, while the German chef’s knife has a more curved section along the length of the blade, allowing for more of an up-and-down, rocking motion when cutting.\nTHE FULL TANG\nFor a stronger, better-balanced and more durable knife, look to the tang, otherwise known as the steel inside the handle of the knife. The best knives have a full tang, where the steel, attached with rivets, runs from the tip of the knifepoint down through the entire length of the handle.\nTHE COMFORTABLE HANDLE\nGrab on. For better control over the blade, the knife must feel comfortable in your hand. If the handle is too slippery or too heavy, you’ll be forced to grip it and will tire easily. As well, we recommend staying away from any untreated wood handles – these porous handles will harbor bacteria and when wet, can warp or crack.\nTHE BIG BOLSTER\nWhat’s the bolster? It’s the point where the blade and handle meet, a section that balances the knife and keeps your fingers from slipping while working. The thicker the bolster, the better as its’ width indicated the thickness of the original chunk of steel the knife was made from. Don’t see a bolster? That means the knife was stamped out of a sheet of metal and not made from a single chunk of steel.\nTHE FINAL CUT\n1. Use your knife for cooking purposes only. You’re not auditioning for a Ginsu commercial.\n2. Sharp knives are good, dull knives are hazardous.\n3. Don’t grab for a falling knife. Jump out of the way.\n4. Point the blade away from you, never cutting towards yourself.\n5. Wash your knives by hand – dishwashers ruin blades.\n6. You can damage the edge of the blade by working on metal, glass or marble cutting boards.\n7. Make sure your cutting board is secure by putting a damp towel underneath.\n8. Walk with your knife pointed down to the ground.\n9. Simon Cowell once called my fav song, “Mac the Knife,” the best song ever written.\n10. Be careful.","parents become extremely fearful imagining their child using a 10-inch\nchef's knife! Children under 8 years' motor skills are not reliable enough\nto safely use such tools. But little ones can make quick work of soft\nvegetables and even a whole head of broccoli using a mere table knife.\nWhat's important to understand is that kids love to chop; it's repetitive\nand a pile of chopped food gives them a great sense of accomplishment.\nChildren 8 years and older have more developed motor skills and can begin\nto learn how to properly use a chef's knife. Professional knife techniques\ntake much of the fatigue out of these assignments and make quick work\nof them as well. They also significantly increase the safety factor. Following\nare my \"Family Knife Safety Commandments\" and some basic knife techniques\nthat are embellished to include parental participation as well as supervision.\nAdditionally, I've provided some recipes from my book Cooking\nTime Is Family Time.\nI chose recipes that require a lot of chopping and knife wielding to offer\nplenty of opportunities to practice.\nFamily Knife Safety Commandments\n1) The first and most important thing to remember in knife safety is not\nwhat you do with the knife, but what you do with your other hand. That's\nthe one in danger of being cut. Always cut, chop, slice, dice with the\nfingertips of your other hand curled down and around so only the flat\npart of your knuckle is facing the blade. This then becomes a guide for\nthe top of the blade to work against. In this way, fingertips are safely\naway from the blade and in no danger of being cut.\n2) The second most important knife safety tip to remember is to keep your\nknives sharp. When a knife is kept sharp evenly along the length of the\nblade, it will cut quickly, efficiently and cleanly. If it is not sharp\nenough, the blade will drag and that is how accidents can happen; the\nknife can drag and slip and consequently cut fingers that have already\ngone on to the next step because the knife was not supposed to be lagging\n3) The third knife safety commandment involves the movement and storage\nof knives in the kitchen. Sharp knives should be stored in a stand-up\ntype knife rack with the blades concealed. This is by far the safest type\nof storage. When moving around the kitchen holding a knife or when handing\nit to someone, the knifepoint should always be pointed towards the floor,\nwith the hand gripping the handle. This way, the blade and point are never\nwaved around in danger of injuring someone. Knives should never be left\nin the sink. Their wooden handles will get wet and ruined and some small\nhand may reach in, not see the knife and get hurt. Knives should be used,\nand immediately washed, dried and then put away.\n4) Always stay in the room and close by your child while they are working\nwith a knife. Even once you've all become accustomed to working together\nand your older child has become quite competent with a chef's knife, you'll\nwant to keep your eye on their technique. Kids and adults alike tend to\nforget and get lazy. That's when they forget to curl fingers or start\nexerting more force out of rushing and over confidence and this can lead\nto accidents. Keep an eye on the kids with knives, gently and supportively\nadmonishing their lack of 'form' and remind them that proper technique\nis the safest way and you love them, so you want to make sure they don't\nThe slicing technique involves a gentle rocking motion. Practice with\na potato or apple, peeling it first and then cut it in half lengthwise.\nRight-handed family members should hold the knife in their right hand.\nWith your left, hold down the item to be sliced as your curl your fingertips\nunder. Make sure kids really curl their fingertips under; this is very\nimportant for safety. Next, hold the knife at a 45-degree angle and come\ndown swiftly through the potato on its extreme right end. Before coming\nup again, be sure you continue to have a proper grip and slide the knife\ndown to the end of the blade near the handle, then gently rock back along\nthe blade to the tip of the knife. At this point, slowly adjust the knife\nto come down again -- this is all one smooth movement -- slicing through\nthe potato once more at the desired width. (If you or the child is left-handed,\nreverse the above instructions.)\nAll along, fingertips should continue to be tucked under and are firmly\nholding the potato in place. As you make progress slicing, you must be\nsure to continue to move you left fingertips away from the blade and at\nthe same time, inch the food towards the knife. The knife motion should\nfeel like one continuous movement and the blade never lifts off the cutting\nboard. Have the children practice the rocking motion with the knife on\nthe cutting board not cutting anything. If they are doing it correctly,\nit should feel easy and relaxed. The knife should not be held too hard\nor strenuously; the controlled rocking motion of the sharp blade should\nbe doing the real work -- not your muscles!\nWhen you have your apple or potato sliced, you can now make uniform dices\nvery easily. Stack 2 slices of potato horizontally in front of you, now\nslice through them to make 1/4\" slices, keeping the pieces snugly together\nwith your left hand as well as you can. When it is completely sliced,\nuse your left hand to pivot the slices so they are now vertical, slice\nagain in 1/4\" slices creating a checkerboard dice of 1/4\" size. Continue\nin this fashion until all the potato is diced. Place your diced potato\nin a bowl and move on to your next\nCheck out other\nrecipes that bring the whole family together:\nCooking Time is Family Time: Cooking Together,\nEating Together, and Spending Time Together\nby Lynn Fredericks, William Morrow & Co., August, 1999\nCOOKING TIME IS FAMILY TIME, Lynn Fredericks shows people how they\ncan improve the time they spend with kids by inviting them into\nthe kitchen to help prepare meals.\nIncluded are 125 recipes emphasizing a variety of fresh, healthful\ningredients and strategies to get kids to gobble them down.

{"question":"What are the main differences between Spectre variant 1 and variant 2 in terms of their impact on computer security?","answer":"Spectre variant 1 and variant 2 have distinct impacts on computer security. Variant 1 primarily affects desktop, laptop, and mobile users by allowing websites to break security and isolation guarantees in web browsers - for example, enabling a website in one tab to read passwords typed in another tab. In contrast, Spectre variant 2 is more severe as it can allow a program to read memory across all privilege levels, regardless of whether the memory is part of the same program, another program, or the core operating system. Variant 2 is particularly dangerous for cloud computing environments as it can break the strongest isolation mechanisms used to separate tenants on cloud computing systems. While variant 1 requires affected software to be recompiled to avoid vulnerable code patterns, variant 2 requires multiple mitigations including processor microcode updates and recompilation to avoid indirect branches.","context":["CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to side-channel attacks referred to as Meltdown and Spectre. Both Spectre and Meltdown take advantage of the ability to extract information from instructions that have executed on a CPU using the CPU cache as a side-channel. These attacks are described in detail by Google Project Zero, the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK) at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) and Anders Fogh. The issues are organized into three variants:\nSpectre attacks take advantage of a CPU's branch prediction capabilities. Modern CPUs include a feature called branch prediction, which speculatively executes instructions at a location that the CPU believes it will branch to. Such speculative execution helps to more fully utilize the parts of the CPU, minimizing the time waiting, and therefore improving performance. When a branch is successfully predicted, instructions will retire, which means the outcomes of the instructions such as register and memory writes will be committed. If a branch is mispredicted, the speculatively-executed instructions will be discarded, and the direct side-effects of the instructions are undone. What is not undone are the indirect side-effects, such as CPU cache changes. By measuring latency of memory access operations, the cache can be used to extract values from speculatively-executed instructions.\nWith Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753), the instructions after a conditional branch are speculatively executed as the result of a misprediction. With Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715), the CPU executes instructions at a location determined by a mispredicted branch target.\nWith both variants of the Spectre attack, the impact is that a process may leak sensitive data to other processes on a system. Spectre may also allow one part of an application to access other parts of the same process memory space that would otherwise not be permitted.\nWhile the Spectre attack itself does not cross a user/kernel memory privilege boundary, depending on the configuration of the target platform, the Spectre attack may indirectly allow a user-space application to access kernel memory. For example, the Project Zero blog post describes a scenario that uses eBPF to exfiltrate kernel memory contents into user-space code. This is made possible because eBPF JIT allows for userspace applications to inject code that is executed in kernel space. While this code is verified by the kernel, eBPF-compliant code will be allowed to execute with kernel permissions. The exploit described by Project Zero leverages eBPF to execute the Spectre attack in kernel space, while exfiltrating the data to user space. It is possible that other technologies that allow in-kernel code execution may also possibly be leveraged to leak kernel memory using Spectre.\nMeltdown is related to the Spectre attack in that it also uses a cache side channel to access data that otherwise wouldn't be available. The main difference is that it leverages out-of-order execution capabilities in modern CPUs. Like speculative execution due to branch prediction, as used by Spectre, out-of-order execution on a CPU is a technique for ensuring fullest utilization of the CPU's parts. Although instructions may appear sequentially in the machine language, a CPU that supports out-of-order execution may execute instructions in a non-sequential manner, which can minimize the time that a CPU spends idle.\nMeltdown leverages insecure behavior that has been demonstrated in Intel CPUs and may affect CPUs from other vendors. Vulnerable CPUs allow memory reads in out-of-order instruction execution, and also contain a race condition between the raising of exceptions and the out-of-order instruction execution. The Meltdown attack reads a kernel memory value, which raises an exception because code running with user-space privileges are not permitted to directly read kernel memory. However, due to the race condition, out-of-order instructions following the faulting instruction may also execute. Even though instructions appear after the faulting instruction, out-of-order execution allows them to execute, using data retrieved from the instruction that raises the exception. By the time the exception is raised, some number of out-of-order instructions have executed. Although the raised exception causes the CPU to roll back the out-of-order instructions, the cache state is not reverted. This allows data from out-of-order instructions to persist beyond the point when the exception has been raised.\nThe impact of Meltdown is that a process running in user space is able to view the contents of kernel memory. Meltdown may also allow Spectre-like memory content leaking that does not cross the user/kernel privilege boundary.\nThe Linux kernel mitigations for Meltdown are referred to as KAISER, and subsequently KPTI, which aim to improve separation of kernel and user memory pages. Because the Spectre attacks do not cross user/kernel boundaries, the protections introduced with KAISER/KPTI do not add any protection against them.\nThe following table compares Spectre and Meltdown.\nAn attacker able to execute code with user privileges can achieve various impacts. The Meltdown attack allows reading of kernel memory from userspace. This can result in privilege escalation, disclosure of sensitive information, or it can weaken kernel-level protections, such as KASLR. The Spectre attack can allow inter-process or intra-process data leaks.\nAndroid Open Source Project Affected\nDebian GNU/Linux Affected\nDragonFly BSD Project Affected\nFedora Project Affected\nFortinet, Inc.

If you have not done so already, please review the first blog post for an accessible review of computer architecture fundamentals. This blog post will start by covering the technical details of Spectre V1 and Spectre V2, and conclude with a discussion of how these bugs lurked undetected for so long, and what we think the future holds.\nLike Meltdown, the Spectre vulnerabilities rely on speculative execution and timing side channels to read memory without proper permission. The difference between Meltdown and Spectre is the method of operation and the potential impact — more computers are vulnerable to Spectre. Meltdown works by taking advantage of an asynchronous permissions check, and affects only Intel processors. Spectre works by tricking the branch predictor (Figure 1), and affects almost every processor released in the last 25 years.\nSpectre (Variant 1)\nThe first variant of Spectre allows a program to read memory that it should not have the ability to read. Spectre V1 attacks are possible because of the confluence of two optimizations: branch prediction and speculative execution. A Spectre V1 attack tricks the branch predictor (for conditional branches) into skipping security checks and speculatively executing instructions in the wrong context. The effects of these speculatively executed instructions are visible via a cache timing side-channel.\n- First we’ll create two large memory allocations. We’ll call one\nleakerand the other\nArrayBuffers, a structure used for storing binary data (like pictures). The\nleakerallocation will be used for the cache timing side-channel. The reader allocation only exists to train the branch predictor. The arrays we allocated have a fixed length. It is only legal to read items from the array starting at zero (the first element) and ending before the array length (the last element). So for a 256 byte array, the valid items are numbered 0 to 255. This range of the first to last element is called the array bounds.\n- Next we start training the branch predictor. A Spectre attack relies on grooming the branch predictor to guess that certain security checks always pass. In this specific case, we are going to make the branch predictor guess that the values read out of\n- Next we ensure that no part of\n- Now that the preparation is out of the way, let’s get to the core Spectre V1 flaw. We will read an out of bounds element from\nreader. Let’s call this value\nsecret. Because we read\nsecretfrom outside the array bounds, it can, by definition, be any chosen memory location. The read of\nsecretwill temporarily succeed even though there is a bounds check that logically prevents it from ever happening. It succeeds only speculatively, because the branch predictor has been primed to assume that the bounds check will succeed. At this point the countdown also starts for the processor to discover the mispredicted branch and un-execute the mispredicted instructions.\n- Next, we use the value of\nsecretas an index to read an element from\nreader[secret]). This action will be speculatively executed and cause that element of\nreaderto be cached. At this point, the branch predictor can correct itself and un-execute all speculatively executed instructions.\n- By measuring the time to read every element of\nsecret, it is possible to determine which element was cached. The index of the cached element will be the value of\nsecret, a value the program was not permitted to read. For example, if\nreaderwas cached, the value of secret would be\n- The attack can now be repeated to read more bytes. The bandwidth of this channel is estimated at 10 KB/s.\nSee Figure 2 for a graphical representation of the\nsecret data memory locations at Step 4.\nWhat is the impact?\nSpectre (Variant 1) is a really big deal to desktop, laptop, and mobile users. It lets websites break security and isolation guarantees built into web browsers like Chrome, IE, and Firefox. As an example, Spectre could allow a website open in one tab to read passwords you are typing into a different tab, or allow an ad on a checkout page to read the credit card number you are typing.\nSpectre is equally devastating for cloud providers and internet companies. A lot of the code powering your favorite websites relies on isolation guarantees provided by programming languages. Spectre renders those guarantees into good intentions. Application hosting providers have to re-evaluate their security architecture, rebuild a lot of core code (with performance loss), or both.\nThere is no generic fix for Variant 1. Affected software has to be re-compiled to avoid using vulnerable code patterns. However, exploitation of the vulnerability can be made more difficult. This is the path taken by web-browser vendors so far. They have removed high-resolution timers (necessary to determine if something was cached) and are actively working to avoid using vulnerable code patterns.\nWhat should I do?\nUpdate your browser, operating system, and BIOS to the latest version. All browser vendors have released mitigations for Spectre vulnerabilities.\nAll major cloud providers have deployed mitigations. You as a customer should have nothing to worry about moving forward.\nSpectre (Variant 2)\nThe second variant of Spectre allows a program to read memory that it should not have access to, regardless of whether the memory is part of the same program, another program, or the core operating system.\nLike Spectre V1, Spectre V2 also relies on abusing branch prediction, speculative execution, and cache timing side-channels. Whereas V1 tricks the conditional branch predictor, V2 tricks the indirect branch predictor. The indirect branch predictor is indifferent to privilege changes, including from user to kernel, from program to program, and even from a virtual machine (think cloud computing instance) to hypervisor (the cloud control plane). For those reasons, Spectre V2 attacks can happen across most if not all privilege levels provided by modern processors.\nOut of the three published attacks, Spectre V2 attacks are the most complex. To explain a Spectre V2 attack, we are going to describe a simplified version outlined in the Google Project Zero blog. Many technical details will be omitted with the hope of providing a more accessible understanding of the attack.\nThe Spectre V2 attack described here reads privileged hypervisor memory from a guest virtual machine. Google Project Zero demonstrated that this attack works with real software running on real processors.\nFirst, a quick refresher about indirect branches and the indirect branch predictor. Indirect branches tell a processor to start executing instructions at some new location. This location can be stored in memory. If that location is not cached, the processor would have to pause a very long time (relative to instruction execution speed) while waiting to find out where to get instructions. The indirect branch predictor guesses where the processor would go next, so the processor doesn’t have to wait. If the guess turns out to be wrong, the processor un-executes some instructions and goes back to the correct place. If the guess turns out to be correct, the program runs much faster. Processors are very good at guessing correctly, so this usually results in a big speedup.\nTime for the first Spectre V2 concept: the indirect branch predictor works by keeping a history of recently executed branches in the Branch History Buffer (BHB), sometimes called the Branch History Table, because previous branch decisions are typically indicative of future branch decisions (Figure 3). As with Meltdown and Spectre V1, by carefully measuring how long some branch operations take, it is possible to “read” the BHB and determine the location of previously executed instructions — even if those instructions were executed at a different privilege level or in a different program.\nNow for the second Spectre V2 concept: The branch predictor is shared among all programs running on a processor. Branches executed in one program change how the indirect branch predictor guesses in another program. By executing a carefully chosen series of branches, you can “write” the BHB, and force the branch predictor to guess a location you chose for a future indirect branch — even if that indirect branch will be executed at a different privilege level. This is analogous to Spectre V1, but using indirect branches instead of conditional branches.\nThe steps described for Google Project Zero’s Spectre V2 attack are less detailed because there isn’t a good way to condense the required information. Each step described below is extremely involved and difficult to accomplish properly. The described scenario is one where a cloud computing instance reads memory contents of the cloud control plane (Linux-KVM, specifically). That memory contains private information about what every other cloud computing instance on that physical machine is doing, including private user data, software source code, encryption keys, etc.\n- First, allocate a large block of memory that will be used for the cache-timing side channel. Per our previous convention, we’ll call this block reader.\n- To leak out data via speculative execution, we will need some way to force the hypervisor to read a byte of privileged memory first, and to use that byte to access reader. This code pattern may be hard to find, but luckily we can cheat. The KVM hypervisor is a part of the Linux kernel, and the Linux kernel includes a feature that runs custom programs to quickly deal with network traffic. This feature is called the eBPF interpreter. We can use the eBPF interpreter to create the code pattern we need in the hypervisor. To do that, we’ll need to:\n- Find the eBPF interpreter in the hypervisor, and\n- Supply some code to the eBPF interpreter, which we’ll call\n- Because Spectre V2 relies on tricking the indirect branch predictor, we need to know the location of an indirect branch in the hypervisor. We’ll call this\n- The hypervisor has a different view of computer memory than our program in the cloud instance. Because we’ll be leaking memory from the hypervisor, we’ll need to find out where in hypervisor-land reader,\nindirect_branchand the eBPF interpreter are located.\n- To find these items, we will need to know the location of some code in the hypervisor. We can’t simply read hypervisor code. We lack the proper privileges. Instead, we leak out code locations via the BHB. How? We’ll ask the hypervisor to do some normal operations on behalf of the cloud instance. In the course of these operations, the hypervisor executes indirect branches, the locations of which will be stored in the BHB. We then “read” the BHB to identify these code locations.\n- Once we know some code locations in the hypervisor, with some math and multiple repeated attempts we can find where in hypervisor-land\nindirect_branchand the eBPF interpreter reside (Figure 4).\n- We ensure that no part of\n- Time for the magic! We execute a series of indirect branches that write new entries into the BHB. These branches and their targets are set up to trick the indirect branch predictor into guessing that\nindirect_branchpoints to the eBPF interpreter (Figure 5).\n- We set up processor state so that if it were to start executing the eBPF interpreter, then the interpreter would run\nebpf_code, which would in turn read a byte of hypervisor memory and use that byte to access a part of\n- We ask the hypervisor to perform an innocuous action that is guaranteed to trigger indirect_branch. A complex chain of events now happens:\n- The processor will guess\nindirect_branchpoints to the eBPF interpreter.\n- The processor will start speculatively executing the eBPF interpreter. Also, the countdown starts until the processor knows it guessed the wrong branch target.\n- The eBPF interpreter will execute instructions provided by\nebpf_code, which will:\n- Read a byte of hypervisor memory.\n- Use that byte to access a piece of\n- Cause that piece of\nreaderto be cached.\n- The processor figures out it executed the wrong branch, and un-executes every instruction speculatively executed thus far. However, a piece of\nreaderis now in the cache (Figure 6).\n- The processor will guess\n- As with Meltdown and Spectre V1, we time access to every piece of\nreaderand identify which piece is read much faster than the others. The index of that piece is the value of the byte we read from hypervisor memory.\n- We can repeat this process to read more bytes, although with less setup since we can skip the Attack Preparation steps.\nAgain, the steps described above are greatly simplified to show the general concepts and some of the exciting trickery involved in a working Spectre V2 attack. Each step is very complex on its own (i.e., one does not simply “read” the BHB).\nWhat is the impact?\nThis is very bad news for everyone — no matter if you are a cloud provider, an internet company, or just a citizen of the web. The impact combines the worst parts of Spectre (Variant 1) with the worst parts of Meltdown. Unlike Variant 1, there is no proof of concept that targets web browsers, but the possibility can’t be ruled out.\nThe news for cloud providers is worse. There is a proof-of-concept exploit that breaks the strongest isolation mechanisms used to separate tenants on cloud computing systems. Also, not only Intel, but processors from various vendors across multiple CPU architectures are vulnerable to Variant 2.\nThere are multiple mitigations available, each of which has some performance cost. Processor vendors have updates available that tune how their processors work to lessen the impact. When that is not possible, software can be re-compiled to avoid using indirect branch instructions. We have not been able to find reliable numbers for the performance penalty of these fixes, but they are certainly not zero and must be paid in addition to the penalties for fixing Meltdown.\nWhat should I do?\nUpdate your operating system and firmware (i.e., BIOS or UEFI) to the latest version. The latest operating systems and BIOS updates will mitigate the most serious instances of Variant 2 either via processor microcode updates, workarounds to control indirect branch predictor behavior, or recompilation to avoid indirect branches.\nAll major cloud providers have deployed mitigations. You as a customer should have nothing to worry about.\nHow Did This Happen?\nSo how did a fundamental computer design flaw go unnoticed for the past 25 years? The answer has two parts: our fundamental assumptions about computing have changed, and the many hints about these security implications weren’t put together in a working proof-of-concept until now.\nWhen speculative execution made its consumer processor debut in the 90s, the way we used computers was different. Most machines were single user, and the most popular operating systems of the day — Windows 9x and Mac OS Classic — lacked memory protection. You didn’t need Spectre or Meltdown to read (or even write!) another application’s memory — you could just do it. In that environment, the performance gains were real, and the security implications weren’t.\nThere have been numerous hints that speculative execution could lead to leaks of privileged information. The Google Project Zero blog post cites multiple sources (including one by our very own Sophia D’Antoine) that insinuate the problem. Multiple, independent researchers identified and reported the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, and others were very close. There is, however, a big difference between thinking there may be a problem and writing a proof-of-concept showing the problem is real. The work done by the researchers reporting this issue was fantastic. I hope this blog post shows just how difficult it was.\nWe hope you have a better understanding of how Meltdown and Spectre work at a technical level, their impact, and the available mitigations. This blog post was written to be accessible to someone without a computer architecture background, and we sincerely hope we succeeded. To our more technical readers, the Meltdown and Spectre papers, and the Project Zero blog post are better sources for the gory details.\nLooking forward, micro-architectural attacks on computing platforms are going to be an exciting area of computer security. Because so many deployed platforms are vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre, micro-architectural attacks will continue to be relevant and dangerous for many years to come."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e4c2e0f4-c454-41dc-9e5d-5cc5891d63d9>","<urn:uuid:692acb5d-f18d-4cb1-86e1-9bce993879ef>"],"error":null}

The following text are comments based on what seems to be happening here, contributed by Dave Johnston (USNR).\nWell, in taking a look at the uniform, it is the aviation officer working greens. The officer is an ensign, and has just been awarded what looks like the Silver Star (or possibly the Bronze Star). He also has several other ribbons/medals, and appears to have some sort of warfare badge just below the ribbons (it looks like wings), and possibly another badge above the ribbons. I am normally bad at guessing ages, but this guy looks considerably older than the typical 23 year old naval aviation officer program graduate.\nWith the above in mind, the immediate question that comes to mind is how did an aviation officer come to be on Escolar's crew? Trying to come up with a likely scenario that fits all of the observed parameters is quite difficult. An older man, an ensign (not much time in the navy), a prestigious combat award, from the aviation branch, assigned to a submarine crew is just not a routine thing, even in the fast paced days of WWII. After pondering on it for a few days, I came up with a couple of scenarios that might explain this, with none of them being rock solid:\nHe was some sort of liaison officer temporarily assigned to the Escolar for training purposes. He might have been facilitating communications with the aviation forces, or was engaging in some cross type training for familiarization (maybe a airship pilot seeing how subs operate). I remember reading somewhere that this had been done on a few occasions in the Pacific, mostly to coordinate with the carrier forces for lifeguard duty. Obviously since the Escolar hadn't yet conducted a war patrol this probably isn't the case, but it may have been a precursor to this.\nHe was an aviation officer candidate who completed pilot training, but was medically disqualified from flight for some reason and transferred to submarines. This doesn't explain the Silver Star, though. That can only be obtained in combat. And, in my opinion the most likely scenario:\nHe was a former enlisted man from the aviation branch who received a commission, and either voluntarily or involuntarily was transferred to submarines once he received his commission. This would explain the \"advanced\" age with a low rank. The Silver Star may have been earned on a combat mission while an enlisted man and was only just awarded upon his arrival to the Escolar after sub school. As an enlisted man he may have been a crew member on a PBY Catalina or similar. He put in for or received a commission and was approved, only to find out afterward that he was being transferred to subs. I freely admit that these are all long shots, with a hell of a lot of old fashioned informed speculation weighing in. This combination is so unlikely that it really piqued my interest and I would love to know if anyone can fully explain it.\nSubsequently, according to the info from the book \"The U.S. Navy in World War II\" by Mark Henry (Osprey Publishing); Apparently, in the spring of 1943 the navy felt it needed a new uniform that blended in better with the background aboard ship. They also intended that oil and dirt stains be less noticeable, a real problem on whites and khakis. So they introduced a slate grey version of the khakis with black buttons. It was to be worn with a light grey shirt. Overall, it was virtually the same as the aviation greens, just a different color, making the two hard to distinguish in a black and white photo.\nThe new uniform was authorized in May, 1943 and phased in slowly. Unfortunately for the Navy, it was universally hated by the sailors. Very few officers purchased and wore it, the enlisted version was even rarer and was virtually unknown. Apparently it \"just wasn't Navy\". It managed to hold on until 1947 when it was officially disestablished.\nIn addition to the ensign in the award photos (which I still think is a former enlisted man), several of the officers in the later commissioning party photos are wearing the grey uniform. One photo even shows two chiefs wearing the ultra rare enlisted version. Maybe Moke Milligan became one of the few fans of the uniform after seeing it on the ensign and \"encouraged\" his crew to wear it. Whatever the reason, this makes these photos quite special.\n| Photo I.D. & text courtesy of John Hummel, Dave Johnston & Darryl L.

Baritone, teacher, b Montreal 14 Jan 1925 of an Italian father and a French-Canadian mother, d Toronto 15 Jul 2000; honorary doctorate (Québec) 1987. As a youth Louis Quilico was a solo chorister in the choir of St-Jacques Church in Montreal, studied singing with Frank H. Rowe and in 1947 won a prize in a competition organized by the St-Jean-Baptiste Society. At the urging of the pianist and vocal coach Lina Pizzolongo (who became his wife in 1949; d 1991), he continued his studies 1947-8 at the Conservatory Santa Cecilia in Rome with Teresa Pediconi and the famous baritone Riccardo Stracciari. On his return to Montreal he worked 1948-52 with Pizzolongo and Martial Singher at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal and sang supporting roles at the Variétés lyriques in The Barber of Seville (1949) and La Traviata (1951). With the aid of a scholarship from Mannes College, New York, he studied voice there 1952-5 with Singher, staging with Ralph Herbert and Désiré Defrère and repertoire with Emil Cooper. He obtained first prize in the radio competitions 'Nos futures étoiles' and 'Singing Stars of Tomorrow' in 1953, and went on a 1953-4 Jeunesses musicales of Canada (Youth and Music Canada) tour with the mezzo-soprano Rolande Garnier. He also participated in the CBC TV programs 'Music Hall,' 'Serenade for Strings' and 'Silhouette.'\nIn 1954 Louis Quilico made his professional stage debut in the role of Rangoni in Boris Godunov with the Opera Guild of Montreal. He won the 'Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air' in 1955, and made his New York debut with the New York City Opera, singing Germont in La Traviata 10 Oct 1955. In 1957 he sang the title role in excerpts from Wozzeck in the CBC TV program 'L'Heure du concert' and was Masetto in Don Giovanni for the Montreal Festivals. The following year he sang in the North American premiere of Nicolas Nabokov's Symboli Chrestiani with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO). At the 1959 Spoleto Festival in Italy he sang the title role in Donizetti's Il Duca d'Alba. Andrew Porter, writing in Opera, September 1959, described Quilico as having a 'very fine voice somewhat reminiscent of Gobbi's in its richness of colouring.' Quilico received a grant from the Canada Council in 1960. He made his Covent Garden debut that year opposite Joan Sutherland as Germont in La Traviata and was a member of that company 1960-3. He sang Rigoletto in his debut at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, in 1962. In 1963 Quilico made his Paris Opera debut as Rodrigo in Don Carlos and, at the inauguration of the ORTF auditorium, participated in the premiere of Milhaud's oratorio Pacem in terris under Charles Munch. He was a member of the cast for the premiere (Geneva 1966) of the opera La Mère coupable by the same composer.\nIn Canada, Louis Quilico appeared twice at the Stratford Festival - in a solo recital in 1967 and in arias and duets with Lois Marshall in 1970. He gave several recitals at Expo 67 and was Iago opposite Jon Vickers and Teresa Stratas in Otello in the lavish World Festival stage performances with the MSO at Place des Arts. He sang Creon opposite Ernst Haefliger and Marilyn Horne in a Massey Hall performance of Oedipus Rex with the Toronto Symphony 17 May 1967 conducted by Robert Craft, with Stravinsky present. The same year he also appeared as Rigoletto with the Vancouver Opera, and sang in Messiah with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. In January 1968 he participated in a concert performance of Verdi's Alzira with the American Opera Society at Carnegie Hall.\nBesides appearing regularly, beginning in the 1960s, with the Vienna Opera, the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires, the Teatro Massimo of Palermo, the Rome Opera and the Paris Opera, Louis Quilico performed frequently with the Canadian Opera Company (COC) (Iago in Otello 1960, the title role in Rigoletto 1962, 1969, 1973, and 1978, Germont in La Traviata 1966 and 1970, the title role in Macbeth 1966 and 1971, Amonasro in Aida 1968, Scarpia in Tosca 1968 and 1972, Enrico Ashton in Lucia di Lammermoor 1971, Michele in Il Tabarro 1975, and the title role in Simon Boccanegra 1979) and with the Opéra du Québec (the High Priest in Samson et Dalila 1971, Germont 1972, Tonio in I Pagliacci 1973, and the title role in Falstaff 1974). In 1969 he sang Scarpia at the Bolshoi Theatre and in Leningrad, Bucharest and Budapest. In February 1972 for the Metropolitan Opera he replaced at short notice the regular Golaud (Thomas Stewart) in Pelléas et Mélisande, and on 1 Jan 1973 he made his official debut there as Germont, performing subsequently in Rigoletto, as Choroebus in The Trojans, and as Amonasro in Aida. He also sang Macbeth on CBC TV in 1973. During the 1974-5 season, he performed in various centres, including Covent Garden (La Traviata), San Francisco (Luisa Miller), Hartford (La Forza del Destino), New Orleans (Il Tabarro and I Pagliacci) and Baltimore (Tosca). For Festival Ottawa at the National Arts Centre he sang Germont (1978) and Pandolphe in Massenet's Cendrillon (1979). In 1979 he was the star of the CBC TV program 'Portrait de Louis Quilico.' With the COC and the Metropolitan Opera, he participated in performances opposite his son Gino, notably in Don Giovanni, Manon, Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Simon Boccanegra and Falstaff. Their joint performance in Don Giovanni (1987) is notable as the first father-son performance at the Met.\nLouis Quilico also was active as a teacher. He taught 1970-87 at the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto, McGill University 1987-90; the Royal Conservatory of Music; and the Philadelphia Academy of Vocal Arts 1995-2000. His pupils included Peter Barcza, John Dodington, Avo Kittask, Roelof Oostwoud, Janis Orenstein, his son Gino Quilico, and Gary Relyea.\nFollowing a concert at the Montreal Forum with the MSO, Gilles Potvin wrote: 'Completely relaxed and in remarkable form, Quilico dominated the concert, giving stirring performances of two excerpts from Verdi, the great scene of Rodrigo's death from Don Carlo ... and the sombre ''Eri tu'' from Un ballo in maschera ... Quilico's voice, through its power, extremely smooth timbre and evenness of register, is a continual source of wonder and delight ... Here is an artist at the height of his career, an artist whose name for a long time now has been written large in the history of singing in Quebec' (Montreal Le Devoir, 22 Jan 1976). In November 1991 Louis Quilico again sang the title role of Rigoletto at the Opéra de Montréal. Two months earlier, he had triumphed in the role of Tony in a new production of the lyric drama The Most Happy Fella presented by the New York City Opera at Lincoln Center.\nLouis Quilico married the pianist Christina Petrowska 30 Nov 1993 in Toronto and embarked on a new phase of his career. As a duo, the couple presented arias and art songs in recitals, benefit concerts, master classes, broadcasts and recordings. Quilico also continued his solo operatic career, performing Rigoletto for the last time in Ottawa in September 1994 with Opera Lyra (his 510th performance of the role), and was often heard in recital singing such repertoire as Mahler's Songs of a Wayfarer, which he performed for the Boris Brott Summer Music Festival 1993 in Toronto.\nLouis Quilico's appearances at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1990s included several of I Pagliacci, as well as Rigoletto (1991-2), Tosca (1994-5) and others. He celebrated his 25th year at the Metropolitan Opera in 1996-7, and retired from that company in 1998. Analekta issued the CD Mr. Rigoletto: My Life in Music to commemorate the baritone's 75th birthday.\nLouis Quilico was awarded the 1965 Prix de musique Calixa-Lavallée and was named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1974. He received the Canadian Music Council medal in 1985. The municipality of St-Léonard (Montreal) named a street in his honour. In 1996 he was presented with the keys to the city of Sarasota, Florida. In 1999 he received a Governor General's Performing Arts Award, a Spirit of Song Bronze sculpture and was honoured at an event organized by the International Resource Centre for Performing Artists. His last live performance was 15 Apr 2000 at a concert held by the Centro Culturale Italiano del Quebec in St-Léonard, Que. His archives were deposited at the National Library of Canada.\nIn a career stretching over 45 years Louis Quilico played at least 80 roles. He was nicknamed 'Mr. Rigoletto' not only for the frequency with which he performed that role, but also for the accolades he received for his other Verdi interpretations. Ezra Schabas, in New Grove (2nd ed.), assessed Quilico as having \"a clear and ringing dramatic voice, particularly well suited to Verdi.\" Urdo Kareda called him simply Canada's \"greatest Verdi singer\" (Opera Canada winter 2001).\nSee also The Canadian Encyclopedia.\nAdestes Fideles.

{"question":"how fish evolve into 2 different species even when living together? need examples pls","answer":"A clear example of this process occurs in Lake Constance, where stickleback fish are evolving into two separate species despite living and breeding in the same location. This happens through sympatric speciation, where species can diverge genetically and physically while sharing the same habitat. Similar examples include mole rats in Israel, palms on Lord Howe Island, Australia, and apple maggots that evolved from hawthorn maggots in North America.","context":["Cooperation, not struggle for survival, drives evolution\nMany theories and hypotheses suggest that competition tends to differentiate ecological requirements after repeated interactions and allows biodiversity. Even if the mechanisms that allow species to evolve, coexist, compete, cooperate, or become extinct are becoming more and more understood, the factors that allow species to coexist in a given time within the same environment are still debated. From Gause's principle of competitive exclusion to Connell's ghost of competition in the past, the importance of intra- and interspecific competition for the evolution of biodiversity has been stressed.\n|Though they live and breed in the same area -- and even interbreed -- researchers witnessed a species of stickleback fish|\ndiverging into two separate species in Switzerland's Lake Constance [Credit: Marques, et al./PLOS ONE]\nA new conceptual evolutionary model first proposed in 2015 in bioRXiv and then published this year in the journal Biologia by Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, associate professor of ecology and biodiversity at Tomsk State University (Russia), reviewed the debated mechanism of speciation, suggesting that competition and a struggle for the existence are not the main drivers of evolution. This research points out the importance of avoidance of competition, biological history, endogenosymbiosis, and three-dimensionality as the main forces that structure ecosystems and allow the evolution of biological diversity.\nThis model remained a theoretical and hypothetical, but intriguing, explanation for less than a year. A few weeks ago, researchers from the University of Bern in Switzerland published an empirical experiment that proves it. David Marques and colleagues demonstrated that a population of stickleback fish that breed in the same lake (Lake Constance, where they were introduced around 150 years ago) was splitting into two separate species before their eyes, and at rapid speed. The study shows that even if both types of fish breed in the same streams at the same time of year and have been interbreeding all along, they are splitting into two genetically and physically different types.\n\"It has been argued that true sympatry may not exist in nature, or can be -- at least -- genetically constrained -- wrote Roberto Cazzolla Gatti in his paper (Cazzolla Gatti R., A conceptual model of new hypothesis on the evolution of biodiversity, Biologia, 71(3), 343-351, 2016) -- This is because small variations in the microhabitat preference can still create allopatry and recent investigations in habitat suitability studies seem to reveal these differences. But if we consider sympatry as a spatial variable, the 'microhabitat preferences' are not properly sympatric but instead represent a niche displacement. I suggest that sympatric speciation should be reconsidered as one of the main mechanisms that lead to species coexistence and to the evolution of biodiversity. In fact, if interspecific competition and the principle of competitive exclusion between different meta-populations (and then, species) were to take place, probably the coexistence of different species would never realize. We would see rather the survival of the most efficient one (which accumulates enough mutation to adapt and not to differentiate) and the extinction of the ancestor or those species belonging to other phyletic lines. My model predicts that the coexistence of two species in a sympatric way can happen only if there is low competition or weak competitive exclusion between them and a kind of avoidance of competition that leads to a slight shift of the niche of a meta-population, which accumulated a series phenotypic difference due to genomic inclusions coming from other sources of genes. Thus, eventually, it's the avoidance of competition and the process that I call endo-geno-symbiosis (i.e., the capacity of endogen 'gene carriers' to share parts of their genome in a symbiotic relationship with their hosts, after the idea of 'endosymbiosis' proposed by Sagan, 1967) that drives the expansion of the diversity of living beings. Competition and mutation (i.e., the classic idea of natural selection), on the other hand, lead to preserving and adapting species and not to diversifying them. This confirms what has been previously suggested: in reality we cannot attend the competition in the present since all niches of the relevant species in an ecosystem seem to be unique and different, even though overlapping on various degrees.\"\nThere are numerous examples of rapid evolution, from cancers becoming resistant to drugs to pests becoming resistant to pesticides. Even some species of fish are evolving smaller to avoid being fished. This very rapid evolution through sympatry, thanks to the avoidance of competition, may be the norm rather than the exception.\nMarques and colleagues wrote: \"We cannot know for sure that the Lake Constance sticklebacks will continue evolving until they become two non-interbreeding specie. But evidence for sympatric speciation is growing, from mole rats in Israel to palms on Lord Howe Island, Australia, and apple maggots evolved from hawthorn maggots in North America, leading some evolutionary biologists to think it could be surprisingly common.\"\nRoberto Cazzolla Gatti, who began to be interested in the role of cooperation in evolution since 2011, when he published a controversial paper titled \"Evolution is a cooperative process: the biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain\" concluded: \"These theoretical findings, confirmed by empirical approaches, should motivate our species to think before it is too late about how human competition, for the first time in the history of life on Earth, has been systematically leading to the extinction of animals and plants. My new model of evolution does not only attempt to explain some of the mechanisms that underlie the current presence of the myriad forms of life, but it also sheds new light on the need of periods of sufficient time scale to generate the awesome number of species that currently inhabit our planet. If humanity does not stop its 'unnatural' competitive spirit in the massive elimination of species, more billions of years could be needed before the diverse set of living beings that we now call biodiversity can be regenerated. And the extinguishing power of the sun will not allow it.\"\nSource: National Research Tomsk State University [May 12, 2016]"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b22adc6-c3e7-4ebd-a745-5d49f410da88>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Amsterdam, known as the cycling capital of the world, allocate its public space between cars and bicycles, and why is this significant for understanding urban space distribution?","answer":"In Amsterdam, 48% of public space is used by cars, while only 11% is reserved for bicycles. This is significant because even in a city famous for cycling, cars still dominate the public space. Parked bicycles are typically pushed into pedestrian areas, highlighting the ongoing battle for public space in Dutch cities.","context":["The battle for public space has started to emerge in many cities across the globe. Our streets have to cater for many things, from the regular post box or bin to trees and benches. Transport uses a significant part of that public space, both moving as well as parked. Even in a city like Amsterdam, considered by many the cycling capital of the world, 48% of public space is still used by the car as shown in an article by Parool. Only 11% of that public space is reserved for the bicycle in Amsterdam. In a city like The Hague, which is generally considered to be more car dominated, this percentage is likely to be lower. Typically, the parked bicycle is everywhere, but it is mostly pushed on space generally used by the pedestrian. This battle for public space becomes more and more apparent in Dutch neighborhoods with limited public space, like in the city of The Hague.\nCycle Parking in Pre-War Neighborhoods in The Hague\nPre-war neighborhoods are especially sought-after and popular places to live in The Netherlands. However, their spatial layout (narrow streets and sidewalks) and the housing type (townhouses converted into multiple dwellings with no sheds or gardens) make it challenging for most residents to park their bicycles in a convenient and safe way. Bicycles blocking the pavements affects not only the accessibility and safety but also the livability of these neighborhoods.\nIn 2019, The Hague adopted its new Cycle Strategy with one of the main objectives being the delivery of 'easy cycle parking'. The subsequent Cycle Implementation Plan called for addressing cycle parking in pre-war neighborhoods. In 2021, The Hague selected seven neighborhoods for this project, and they approached Arup to produce a Plan of Approach. To verify the approach, Geuzen- en Statenkwartier, a neighborhood of 14,000 residents, was chosen as a pilot project.\nChecking the Facts and Needs\nBoth quantitative (car and bicycle parking surveys) and qualitative (residents' needs and concerns) data was used to evaluate the current situation and suggest solutions. Analysis of parking data enabled the team to pinpoint locations with highest need for additional cycle parking facilities. The analysis showed that the neighborhood not only has a high demand for cycle parking facilities, but also a high demand for car parking. All the data gathered in the project was saved in a Geographic Information System (GIS).\nSuccessful Stakeholder Engagement\nTo verify the locations with high demand for cycle parking, and to devise the best design for cycle parking facilities, Arup facilitated digital discussion between the residents and the municipality about the use and layout of the urban space. Two stakeholder engagement sessions were held. The first stakeholder engagement covered a presentation of the analysis, both qualitative and quantitative. It also covered generic questions about the use of public space, such as: \"What has to be sacrificed for extra bicycle facilities? The sidewalk? Car parking spots? Urban green or playgrounds?\". Another topic covered in the first session was shortlisting the top 10 of locations with the highest need for a solution. To facilitate that, a top 20 was pre-selected based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis. Stakeholders were able to vote for the top 10 using the Mentimeter tool.\nThe second stakeholder engagement session focused on the top 10. Questions were prepared to understand the preferences of the stakeholders for the solutions. Examples of those questions: \"What type of solution do you prefer? Indoor? Outdoor? Covered? And how far are you willing to walk to your bicycle?\". These questions were facilitated by an Inspiration Book with examples of cycle parking solutions. With the answers to the questions the project team was able to gather preferences for each of the locations in the top 10. These preferences were then taken into consideration in the design process, carried out by the Ingenieursbureau Den Haag. The design process was informed by the number of required parking spaces per location and the mentioned preferences. The end result will be a design with for example a covered parking facility at the corner of the street including some additional Sheffield stands in the street.\nDemocratizing the Battle for Space\nWhile stakeholder engagement was key in this project, it also posed a challenge due to the restrictions caused by COVID-19. By carrying out digital public consultations and using the digital mapping tool, the project team was able to minimize the impact of the restrictions on interacting with the residents. The digital tools can be applied anywhere in the world and have also proven to be more successful in engaging stakeholders. The battle for public space is something that any city will have to face in some shape or form.

{"question":"How do museum visitor engagement and student affairs ethics both emphasize the importance of individual values and perspectives?","answer":"Both fields emphasize validating individual perspectives but in different contexts. In museums, CALTA21's approach emphasizes the value of each visitor's experiences and opinions, creating egalitarian exchanges rather than hierarchical information flow. Similarly in student affairs, professionals are taught to recognize that knowledge can take many meanings and decisions should consider multiple contexts and perspectives, as shown in models like Baxter Magolda's epistemological reflection model. Both fields recognize that personal values and experiences shape how people engage and make meaning, whether as museum visitors or student affairs professionals.","context":["Engaging with immigrant communities is on many museums’ minds. Over the last few months, we’ve highlighted different programs (e.g. at the Buffalo History Museum and CelebrARTE at the DAM) and frameworks (e.g. Intercultural Dialogue) museum professionals are using both nationally and internationally. Today, we wish to bring attention to CALTA21 (Cultures and Literacies through Art for the 21st Century), an initiative aimed at bridging Immigrant English-Learners and museums that is funded through a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). While currently based in New York State, CALTA21 is looking for museums across the U.S. to implement its model (any takers?). Thanks to our guest blogger Patricia Lannes, Founder and Project Director of CALTA21.\nTo learn more about CALTA21, visit calta21.org\n* * * *\nThere appears to be broad consensus amongst museum professionals that museums must do more to promote social inclusion. Despite the proliferation of outreach programs intended to engage “non-traditional” museum audiences, the museum-going population continues to become an increasingly less-diverse group. This is problematic when one considers that minorities currently constitute only 9% of museums’ core visitors and that “within four decades, the group that has historically contributed the core audience for museums—non-hispanic whites—will be a minority.” (Farrell, 5) Developing effective strategies for engaging new audiences is thus a task of existential importance, and museums are beginning to develop effective ways to achieve this. If we understand our goal as being the promotion of life-long engagement with members of diverse groups, what sort of framework and programming can we develop and institute to help achieve this?\nOne answer is to develop programs that seek to eliminate or reduce structural obstacles to museum attendance. In the context of immigrant communities, this approach might call for tours and labels in languages other than English, improved transportation between immigrant communities and museums, or free admission programs. There is no question that promoting access will help drive engagement with individuals independently interested in visiting the museum, but prevented from doing so by some tangible obstacle. Efforts like these cannot, however, engage segments of the population that are unaware of the resources the museum has to offer. If we are to engage this larger group, we must develop mechanisms that serve as bridges to communicate the value of these resources.\nAnother way to do this might be to support programming that directly relates to these groups’ cultural and social backgrounds. We might, for example, call for an exhibit to display objects from immigrants’ homelands and cultures, or an event to celebrate El Dia de los Muertos. Although these efforts would certainly help correct the historical under- and mis-representation of minority groups in our cultural narrative, it is misguided to think that immigrant and minority communities have little interest in museums because museums offer nothing of direct relevance to their lives. The mistake in this reasoning hides the assumption that an audience is “automatically interested only in objects that are directly related to its cultural background” (Bodo). Efforts to promote diverse cultural programming may have value in their own right, but they are insufficient to engage all audiences. The diversity presented within immigrant communities renders powerless any attempt to engage members of these communities on the basis of any single ethnicity or culture. While the museum’s exhibits might be, in a narrow sense, collections of culturally-specific objects, this need not prevent them from having universal appeal. These objects can have broad appeal (despite their cultural-specificity) if we recognize that they address issues and emotions that are universally shared.\nThe 10 unit CALTA21 curriculum we have developed presents one example of how the above principles can be used to guide engagement with immigrant audiences. It begins by placing the adult English-language learner at the center of the initiative, not as a recipient or subject but as an agent and stakeholder. Instead of emphasizing the information that the museum has to share with the viewer, the curriculum stresses the value of the knowledge that every participant already possesses. The discussions that ensue are based loosely on the curriculum’s thread of “Identity and Portraiture”, but are ultimately structured and guided by whatever it is that the participants decide is important to mention and discuss. It uses an inquiry-based approach that relies on open-ended questions rather than specific talking points; each viewer is invited to look and identify his or her own point of entry into the discussion. When the value of each individual’s experiences and opinions is emphasized in this way, the hierarchical flow of information represented by the traditional student-teacher relationship is subverted and replaced by an egalitarian exchange of ideas.\nThese exchanges empower participants by validating the value of their own cultures, stories, and experiences, while simultaneously validating the cultures of other participants and of their newly adopted community. In other words, the experience of participating in these discussions is empowering and engaging not because it bequeaths the participants with some essential knowledge that they previous lacked but rather because it demonstrates the value of communicating one’s own opinions, stories, and experiences. Engaging in intercultural dialogue in this way fosters real reciprocity “between the museum and its diverse audiences, by bringing into dialogue their different perspectives, experiences, and knowledge bases and providing everyone with genuine opportunities for self-representation and collaborative ‘meaning-making’” (Bodo). These discussions are thus ultimately capable of initiating what Simona Bodo so aptly refers to as “new knowledge systems, relationships, and interpretive communities” (Bodo).\nThere’s a danger here of viewing the museum’s role in this intercultural dialogue as secondary or incidental; if the museum’s deep understanding of art and culture is ultimately of little importance, what is special about the museum context? Can’t these sorts of intercultural exchanges take place in any public setting? Intercultural exchange isn’t limited to the museum context, but the art museum experience is central in that it presents the visitor with the visual art that serves as such a powerful and universal catalyst for dialogue. This is especially so for the adult English language learner immigrant; because art relays information to the viewer visually, it eliminates the need for a mediating language that must be mastered before the viewer can form opinions about the work. Using visual perception, viewers access higher-order critical thinking skills directly in their preferred language. Collective knowledge ensues and teachers and museum educators are facilitators with the role of supporting the student’s English language communication skills.\nProfessional Learning Institutes\nIt may go without saying, but realizing meaningful intercultural dialogue within the museum context depends on coordinating the needs and efforts of many individuals and institutions. In the case of CALTA21, this was achieved largely via professional development institutes that convene museum professionals & English language instructors to prepare them to jointly implement the CALTA21 curriculum in their classrooms and museums. The professional development institutes are an important way for us to communicate the CALTA21 model to the participating educators, but they also serve as a forum for discussing best practices and the varying needs of different constituents and for forging lasting cooperative partnerships. The success of these partners in leveraging the collective power of their institutions to empower adult immigrants through intercultural dialogue depends on the benefits derived by all participants. The professional development institutes are also integral because they present an opportunity to solicit feedback from the program’s participants. This feedback allows us to make critical course corrections along the way and make sure we are most effectively serving the needs and desires of all program participants.\nSupporting cooperative relationships amongst diverse groups and institutions is thus an important component in achieving our goal of creating inclusive museums, but it is more than this. Building these cooperative relationships is the natural extension of the principle that bringing into dialogue different perspectives, experiences, and knowledge bases provides an opportunity for greater understanding through collaborative meaning-making. Calta21’s emphasis on collaboration is thus partially pragmatic (how else could we get so many diverse actors to work together towards a shared goal?), but it’s also foundational and based on the idea that cooperation is valuable for its own sake. Just as intercultural dialogue provides opportunities for creating new meaning amongst people of different cultures, programming that promotes inter-institutional dialogue and cooperation can ultimately give rise to new pedagogies and ways of understanding.\nIt’s important to note that the CALTA21 initiative’s greatest value lies not in the details of its structure, but in its general framework. CALTA21 is successful not because it has developed a particular curriculum or methodology that’s essential to the goal of accessibility, but rather because it is built on a foundation that seeks intercultural dialogue, full cultural participation, and civic engagement. CALTA21’s legacy is thus not just the particular curriculum or programming it has developed and delivered, but also the demonstration of the value of rethinking the pedagogies that serve as foundations for any initiative or program.\nBodo, Simona. “NEW PARADIGMS FOR INTERCULTURAL WORK IN MUSEUMS – OR INTERCULTURAL WORK AS A NEW PARADIGM FOR MUSEUM PRACTICE?

P. Lannes","Developing an Ethical Framework for Student Affairs\nNew Student Affairs professionals enter the field with excitement about serving students, making an impact, and experiencing new opportunities. The thought of ethical decision-making may not be at the forefront of their day-to-day agendas. However, new Student Affairs professionals are often faced with personal and challenging decisions. It is not uncommon for new professionals to be given tasks and assignments that may cause dissonance with their core beliefs and thoughts, and we often label those challenges as ethical quandaries. In reality, many ethical dilemmas new professionals encounter emerge from a gap in learning how to work through issues that challenge them on a personal level. When working to develop a framework for critical decision-making, it is helpful to start by examining how individuals in Student Affairs craft their own set of personal values. One’s values are shaped through influences and experiences that come from a variety of places.\nThrough their professional preparation, new professionals are taught elements of ethical frameworks by mentors, preparation program faculty, undergraduate and graduate involvement experiences, previous supervisors, and peers. Often times professionals will consider personal values as a guide in the ethical decision making process. In reality personal values are simply new professionals’ own views on what is important and meaningful, which often causes conflict when it comes to decision-making. This article will explore five necessary components for supervisors of new professionals to consider as a new professional begins to develop an ethical framework. Components include: (a) understanding clear definitions; (b) moral development theory; (c) professional standards; (d) mentorship; and (e) individual personal philosophy. These all serve as a foundation for supervisors to help new professionals negotiate the construction of their ethical decision making framework.\nEthics has been called the study of moral reasoning (Noddings, 1992), and in Student Affairs, theories of both ethical and moral development and decision-making have been of primary importance when designing interventions to assist students in navigating their collegiate worlds. How does our understanding of ethics and morals assist new professionals in navigating the challenging and complex world of supervision and professional development? Because “determining the appropriate course to take when faced with a difficult ethical dilemma can be a challenge” (Miller and Davis, 1996, p. 1), understanding where individual values originate is helpful in determining moral responses and thus creating ethical frameworks. To study this concept, we will explore the definitions and origins of values and morals in order to distinguish the overlap each have in creating an ethical framework.\nA value is a broad idea or understanding, and it is from values that both morals and ethics spring. A value, from the Latin valere, means worth and refers to the underlying dimensions of importance we assign to our measurement of thoughts, behaviors, and actions. Moral, from the Latin moralis, is the idea behind what is good or bad, right or wrong. Morality assists individuals in distinguishing between actions and behaviors that fall into good-equals-right and bad-equals-wrong dualities. Ethics, on the other hand, is a framework that guides individuals in acting moral. Ethics, from the Greek ethos, means character and ethics define for an individual specifically what actions or thoughts can be categorized as right or wrong.\nMorals and ethics are often used interchangeably by the general public; however it is important to differentiate between the two terms because actions for ethical behavior emerge from philosophies about morality. Morality itself emerges from personal or professional values, and it is these values that ultimately direct a new professional towards constructing the ethical approach they apply to their practice and decision-making. As new professionals work to determine a set of ethics they choose to use in their practice, it is useful to determine what ethics are not. Ethics are not feelings, and while it is often easy to confuse the two, it is important for new professionals to understand that personal feelings can often cloud decision making in a way that guides them away from the context in which they are making decisions. Ethics is also not religion, law, or science. While these governing principles are often looked to during the decision making process, these principles are not always the appropriate code of reference at any given time and do not constitute a code of ethics.\nA number of theories are useful to new professionals when constructing their framework in ethical decisions. Kitchener’s (1984) critical evaluation model encourages individuals to reflect upon their decision-making processes. The four moral principles that Kitchener (1984) bases her theory on are: autonomy, beneficence, nonmalificence, and justice/fairness. When making decisions, Kitchener (1984) encourages individuals to identify problems and potential issues, to review ethical guidelines and obtain consultation, then to consider possible consequences of decisions. Supervisors of new professionals could use Kitchener’s (1984) decision-making process as a reflection tool for their new supervisees when they are confronted with difficult issues in a new environment.\nKitchener also works with King (1981, 1990) to offer a model of reflective judgment. Kitchener & King (1981, 1990) proposed that reflective judgment is different than critical thinking because it is needed to deal with issues that do not have a right or wrong solution. In fact, this model is best used in situations where there are multiple solutions. Kitchener and King’s model of reflective judgment has seven stages, and each stage is based on an assumption of knowledge and how individuals acquire that knowledge. Stages 1 through 3 (Prereflective Thinking) is when “the link between evidence and beliefs is unclear” (King & Kitchener, 1994, p. 14), or when learners become aware that all problems do not have solutions. Individuals move into stages 4 to 5 (Quasi Reflective Thinking) when individuals begin to recognize and quote that knowledge is sometimes uncertain and the increasing need to justify beliefs, reflect a growing ability to differentiate categories of thought “and move towards more complex thinking (Pascarella and Terenzini, 2005). Stages 6 and 7 (Reflective Thinking) is when the learner comes to understand that knowledge is relational, contextual, and constructed. Knowing where knowledge comes from and the value placed on that knowledge allows new professionals to become critically reflective about the choices they are making in their day-to-day practice.\nA third reflective model that would be useful for new professionals is Baxter Magolda’s (1992) epistemological reflection model. Epistemology is our way of knowing or how we come to know, and Baxter Magolda identifies four stages in this process. These include absolute knowing, transitional knowing, independent knowing and contextual knowing. As a new professional comes to learn that knowledge can take on many meanings, he or she can begin to make decisions based on multiple contexts and perspectives.\nThe many places where new professionals have formed their values and morals all play a part in building a new professional’s ethical framework. New professionals are supported by professional principles and standards. When working with new professionals, it is important to guide them to documents such as the NASPA Standards of Professional Practice (1990) and ACPA Statement of Ethical Principles and Standards (2006). Helping them understand that professional principles are constant may help them not feel pressured to reinvent the wheel. So the question then becomes, how do we assist new professionals in understanding these principles are more than words on a document? How do we help new professionals internalize these principles? It is important in our everyday work for new professionals to recognize where these principles appear in their everyday practice.\nBecause “student affairs [professionals], particularly entry-level professionals, expect to be involved with and provide services to individual and groups of students on a daily basis” (Burkard, Cole, Ott, and Stoflet, 2004, p. 306), some of the best support supervisors can provide is to assist new professionals in the construction of an ethical framework to guide them in everyday decision making and growth. This will, in turn, enable new professionals to develop within their own moral capacity while at the same time understand the ways in which competing frameworks work to guide and assist them in their professional development. When assisting a new professional in developing his or her personal philosophy, we recommend having them identify their values and how those values manifest in their daily decision-making. It is not uncommon when making tough decisions to have multiple competing values and perspectives. However, having a defined ethical framework is the first step is to determine which values are most important in the situation at hand and therefore need to be most reflected in the outcome.\n- How do we help new professionals move the locus of control for decision-making internal while at the same time working within a set professional structure?\n- What models are best practices for training new professionals to navigate crisis situations that call for moral and ethical responses?\n- How do new professionals reconcile the two frameworks that they encounter when making decisions: their own and that of their institution?\nAmerican College Personnel Association.

{"question":"Hey! I'm really curious - what's the difference between how the 2026 Australian Census and the UN Declaration Act handle consulting with Indigenous peoples? 🤔","answer":"The 2026 Australian Census and UN Declaration Act have different consultation approaches with Indigenous peoples. The Australian Census includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a topic area and considers their cultural identity in its consultation process, which is part of a broader public feedback system open until September 2023. In contrast, the UN Declaration Act has a more extensive Indigenous consultation process that specifically requires working in partnership with First Nations, Inuit and Métis through two phases. The first phase focuses on understanding Indigenous priorities for the action plan, while the second phase involves validating the draft action plan with Indigenous peoples, provinces, territories and industry.","context":["ABS consults further on topics for the 2026 Census\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is today publishing a shortlist of topics being considered for the 2026 Census and launching the next phase of public consultation.\nGeorgia Chapman, Director 2026 Census Content said, “earlier this year, the ABS invited the Australian community to tell us what they think should be included in the next Census.\n“We received 260 submissions and considered more than 500 other pieces of feedback as part of this consultation.\n“The Australian Census currently has 53 topics.

{"question":"What are the key differences between AP Style and APA regarding publication updates and reference formatting?","answer":"AP Style is updated every spring and keeps formatting minimal, avoiding italics and underlining, while being primarily used for journalism and news writing. In contrast, APA style, used for social sciences, has more complex formatting requirements including specific rules for references such as double-spacing, first-line indentation, and proper use of italics for book titles. APA also requires inclusion of DOI links for digital sources and has detailed guidelines for different types of book citations, including edited books, translations, and ebooks.","context":["Writing style guides outline the editorial rules required for a particular type of writing. They might be about simple things like grammar and punctuation, or they might be more substantive questions about citation, layout, or format. Some guides also speak to voice.\nIt's generally advisable to check with a publication or publisher to determine which guide they follow.\nAssociated Press (AP Style)\nAssociated Press is the go-to guide for journalists and news writing. It has special sections dedicated to areas of interest such as fashion, food, and sports. AP Style sometimes covers magazine content as well.\nIt was originally written with the news wire in mind, so symbols and extras like italics and underlining are kept to a minimum. Latin names are printed without their accents in straight AP Style, although many publications correct this in their house styles.\nAP Style is updated every spring, so keeping up with its current rules can admittedly be a challenge, but you can usually find updates online\nChicago Manual of Style (CMS)\nCMS is the standard for book publishing, both fiction and non-fiction. It's not generally used for scholarly publishing such as journals and research, but it might be used for history.\nCMS issued its 17th edition in 2017. Be warned—it's extremely comprehensive, a big, multi-paged guide.\nModern Language Association (MLA)\nThe Modern Language Association style is almost exclusively used in the academic world. It applies mostly to literature and humanities.\nThis is likely the style first introduced to most writing students and undergrads. It does carry some similarities to CMS teachings, although it's more focused on citation and documentation.\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA)\nThe APA carries its own standard for the social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, education, and politics. APA style is sometimes used for engineering and business work as well.\nTurabian style is named after the book’s author, Kate Turabian. It focuses on research work and is used for the academic arm of many subjects. In fact, many grad and undergrad students are directed to use Turabian despite the availability of another system in their discipline.\nThe CMS actually refers students to Turabian, and many will find it much easier to navigate.\nAlternative Style Guides\n- AMA: The American Medical Association style guide is in its 10th edition as of 2019. It's published by Oxford Press. Except for a few special cases, this is the go-to manual for health, medicine, and biology subjects.\n- NLM: The National Library of Medicine has an online-only style guide that's often used in some of the AMA disciplines.\n- CSE: The Council of Science Editors Manual covers natural sciences and biology.\n- ACS: The American Chemical Society got in on the act with a style guide specifically for chemists. Chances are that you already know about this guide if you write about chemistry, but an ACS-style crib sheet is available if you ever need it.\n- ASA: The American Sociological Association has a guide similar to that of APA, although the APA still seems to be more popular, even with more sociological-oriented disciplines.\n- Bluebook: Bluebook citation is used in the legal profession.\n- Harvard Style: Also called the Author-Date style of citation, this isn't actually a fully published guide, but it can be useful with regard to referencing.\nChances are you'll find any guidance you need as a freelance writer in one or more of these guides.","APA format is the official style of the American Psychological Association and is used in both academic and professional writing.\nBefore you create a reference pagefor your papers, essays, articles, or reports, it is important to learn how to format your references in proper APA style. This style dictates certain rules and guidelines for different types of references, including books.\nNot all book citations are the same in APA style. The format may vary depending on a number of factors including the type of book and number of authors.\nAPA Book Citation: Basic Structure\nThe basic structure of a book reference should list the author's last name, the first initial of their first name, the first initial of their middle name (if applicable), publication year, book title, edition (if it isn't the first), and publisher. This is the same format for both books and ebooks. If the source has a DOI link, that should also be included at the end of the reference.\nThe following example shows one citation with a DOI hyperlink and the second without. Note the punctuation and style. The year of publication is in parentheses. The book title is italicized and in sentence case, and the edition information is in parentheses.\nBook Citations in APA\nJackson, L. M.

Houghton Mifflin.\nThis basic format can be used for many types of books that have a single author or multiple authors. However, you may need to use one of the following formats for books that are edited, have no author, are translated, or require some specialized formatting.\nEdited Book With One or More Authors\nEdited books with one or more authors will include the names of the editors in the citation. It should follow the basic structure of a book reference but also include the first name initial, last name, and \"Ed.\" for one editor or \"Eds.\" for multiple editors in parentheses after the book title. Use an ampersand to separate multiple authors and multiple editors.\nCiting Authors and Editors\nAdler, A. (1956).

New Harbinger Publications.\nEdited Book With No Author\nEdited books with no author should list the editors first. List the last name and first initial of the editor, followed by \"Ed.\" or \"Eds.\" in parentheses. The remainder of the reference should follow the basic structure and include the publication year, book title in italics, and publisher.\nIf the book is anything other than the first edition, it should also be noted in parentheses after the title of the book, with no italics. Remember, you don't need to include the publisher's location.\nAtkinson, J. W., & Rayner, J. O. (Eds.). (1974). Motivation and achievement. V. H. Winston.\nArticle Featured in an Edited Book\nSometimes edited books feature a collection of articles written by different authors. To cite an article in such a collection, you should list the last name and first initial of the individual author(s), followed by the publication date and chapter title.\nNext, the editors should be listed, followed by the title of the book and the page numbers of the chapter. The publisher's name goes last.\nCiting an Article in a Book\nBartol, C. R., & Bartol, A. M. (2005). History of forensic psychology. In I. B. Weiner, & A. K.

For example, if you were to reference the publication above in text, you would write \"(Freud 1901/1914).\"\nThe APA style guide also explains how to cite a multivolume work. You list the last name and first initial of the author(s) or editor(s), followed by the year of publication in parentheses. Then, you put the name of the publication in italics in sentence case.\nYou list the specific volumes in parentheses, using a hyphen between digits. You then list the name of the publisher.\nCiting a Multivolume Work\nHarris, K. R., Graham, S., & Urdan T. (Eds.). (2012).APA educational psychology handbook(Vols. 1–3).

However, with audiobooks, you might wish to call out specific information such as the narrator's name.\nIf you are crediting the narrator of an audiobook, the format is the last name and the initial of the author's first name, then the year of publication in parentheses. After listing the name of the book in italics, you put the first initial and the last name of the narrator, followed by \"Narr.\" in parentheses.\nThen you add \"Audiobook\" in brackets, followed by the publisher's name and URL.

The practice of booking a cruise at the very last .\nA pier is a raised structure that rises above a body of water and usually juts out from its shore , typically supported by piles or pillars , and provides above-water access to offshore areas.\nFrequent pier uses include fishing , boat docking and access for both passengers and cargo , and oceanside recreation. Bridges, buildings, and walkways may all be supported by piers. Their open structure allows tides and currents to flow relatively unhindered, whereas the more solid foundations of a quay or the closely spaced piles of a wharf can act as a breakwater , and are consequently more liable to silting.\nPiers can range in size and complexity from a simple lightweight wooden structure to major structures extended over 1, m 5, ft. In American English , a pier may be synonymous with a dock. Piers have been built for several purposes, and because these different purposes have distinct regional variances, the term pier tends to have different nuances of meaning in different parts of the world. Thus in North America and Australia , where many ports were, until recently, built on the multiple pier model, the term tends to imply a current or former cargo-handling facility.\nIn contrast, in Europe , where ports more often use basins and river-side quays than piers, the term is principally associated with the image of a Victorian cast iron pleasure pier.\nHowever, the earliest piers pre-date the Victorian age. Piers can be categorized into different groupings according to the principal purpose. For example, pleasure piers often also allow for the docking of pleasure steamers and other similar craft, while working piers have often been converted to leisure use after being rendered obsolete by advanced developments in cargo-handling technology.\nMany piers are floating piers, to ensure that the piers raise and lower with the tide along with the boats tied to them. This prevents a situation where lines become overly taut or loose by rising or lowering tides. An overly taut or loose tie-line can damage boats by pulling them out of the water or allowing them so much leeway that they bang forcefully against the sides of the pier.\nWorking piers were built for the handling of passengers and cargo onto and off ships or as at Wigan Pier canal boats. Working piers themselves fall into two different groups. Longer individual piers are often found at ports with large tidal ranges , with the pier stretching far enough off shore to reach deep water at low tide.\nSuch piers provided an economical alternative to impounded docks where cargo volumes were low, or where specialist bulk cargo was handled, such as at coal piers.\nThe other form of working pier, often called the finger pier, was built at ports with smaller tidal ranges. Here the principal advantage was to give a greater available quay length for ships to berth against compared to a linear littoral quayside, and such piers are usually much shorter. Typically each pier would carry a single transit shed the length of the pier, with ships berthing bow or stern in to the shore.\nSome major ports consisted of large numbers of such piers lining the foreshore, classic examples being the Hudson River frontage of New York , or the Embarcadero in San Francisco. The advent of container shipping , with its need for large container handling spaces adjacent to the shipping berths, has made working piers obsolete for the handling of general cargo, although some still survive for the handling of passenger ships or bulk cargos.\nThe Progreso Pier supplies much of the peninsula with transportation for the fishing and cargo industries and serves as a port for large cruise ships in the area. Many other working piers have been demolished, or remain derelict, but some have been recycled as pleasure piers. The best known example of this is Pier 39 in San Francisco.\nAt Southport and the Tweed River on the Gold Coast in Australia , there are piers that support equipment for a sand bypassing system that maintains the health of sandy beaches and navigation channels. Pleasure piers were first built in Britain during the early 19th century. At that time the introduction of the railways for the first time permitted mass tourism to dedicated seaside resorts.\nThe large tidal ranges at many such resorts meant that for much of the day, the sea was not visible from the shore. The pleasure pier was the resorts' answer, permitting holidaymakers to promenade over and alongside the sea at all times. Providing a walkway out to sea, pleasure piers often include amusements and theatres as part of their attractions. Sometimes a pier has two decks. Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier in Galveston , Texas has a roller coaster, 15 rides, carnival games and souvenir shops.\nEarly pleasure piers were of wooden construction, with the first iron pleasure pier being Margate Jetty, opened in First opened as a wooden pier in , it was reconstructed in iron and completed in In a UK poll, the public voted the seaside pier onto the list of icons of England.\nMany piers are built for the purpose of providing boatless anglers access to fishing grounds that are otherwise inaccessible. Free Piers are often primarily used for fishing. See the List of piers article for details of piers in countries across the world. In Blankenberge a first pleasure pier was built in After its destruction in the World War I , a new pier was built in It remained till the present day, but was partially transformed and modernized in — In Nieuwpoort, Belgium there is a pleasure pier on both sides of the river IJzer.\nScheveningen , the coastal resort town of The Hague , boasts the largest pier in the Netherlands , completed in A crane, built on top of the pier's panorama tower, provides the opportunity to make a metre ft high bungee jump over the North Sea waves. The present pier is a successor of an earlier pier, which was completed in but in destroyed by the German occupation forces. The first recorded pier in England was Ryde Pier , opened in on the Isle of Wight , as a landing stage to allow ferries to and from the mainland to berth.\nIt is still used for this purpose today. The oldest cast iron pier in the world is Gravesend town pier , in Kent , which opened in However, it is not recognised by the National Piers Society as being a seaside pier. Following the building of the world's first seaside pier at Ryde, the pier became fashionable at seaside resorts in England and Wales during the Victorian era , peaking in the s with 22 being built in that decade. The Birnbeck Pier in Weston-super-Mare is the only pier in the world linked to an island.\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Air and water are made of atoms, too. Atoms space so small that millions of them would fit ~ above the head of a pin.\nAtoms space made of even smaller particles\nThe facility of an atom is referred to as the nucleus. The cell nucleus is consisted of of particles called protons and also neutrons. Electrons spin around the cell core in shells. If the nucleus was the dimension of a tennis ball, the atom would certainly be the size of a sphere about 1,450 feet in diameter, or about the dimension of one of the biggest sports stadiums in the world. Atoms are greatly empty space.\nIf the nude eye might see an atom, it would certainly look a tiny like a tiny cluster of balls surrounding by gigantic invisible bubbles (or shells). The electrons would certainly be ~ above the surface of the bubbles, continuous spinning and also moving to continue to be as much away indigenous each other as possible. Electron are organized in their shells by an electric force.\nThe protons and electrons of an atom room attracted to every other. Lock both lug an electrical charge. Protons have actually a confident charge (+) and electrons have actually a an unfavorable charge (-). The positive charge of the protons is same to the negative charge the the electrons. Opposite charges attract each other. One atom is in balance when it has an equal number of protons and also electrons. The neutrons lug no charge and their number deserve to vary.\nThe number of protons in one atom determines the sort of atom, or element, it is. An element is a substance consisting the one kind of atom. The periodic Table of aspects shows aspects with your atomic numbers—the variety of protons lock have. For example, every atom that hydrogen (H) has actually one proton and also every atom that carbon (C) has actually six protons.\nElectricity is the motion of electrons between atoms\nElectrons usually stay a constant distance native the atom\"s cell nucleus in precise shells. The shell closest come the nucleus can hold two electrons. The next shell have the right to hold up to eight. The external shells deserve to hold also more. Some atoms with numerous protons can have as countless as seven shells with electrons in them.\nThe electrons in the shells closest come the nucleus have actually a solid force that attraction to the protons. Sometimes, the electrons in an atom\"s outermost shells do not have actually a solid force of attraction to the protons. These electrons deserve to be pushed out of your orbits. Using a force can make them shift from one atom come another. These shifting electrons space electricity.\nStatic power exists in nature\nLightning is a form of electricity. Lightning is electrons relocating from one cloud to an additional or electrons jumping indigenous a cloud to the ground. Have you ever felt a shock once you touched an object after walking across a carpet? A present of electron jumped come you from that object. This is called static electricity.\nSee more: They Are Few And Far Between, Definition Of 'Few And Far Between'\nHave you ever made her hair stand right up by rubbing a balloon ~ above it?

{"question":"How do health outcomes differ between long-lived individuals and normal populations, and what genetic patterns influence these differences?","answer":"In terms of health outcomes, studies show that centenarians often demonstrate better health than average 80-year-olds, with health problems appearing closer to the end of life rather than spreading over extra years. The New England Centenarian Study categorizes long-lived individuals as 'survivors,' 'delayers,' or 'escapers' based on their health experiences. Regarding genetic patterns, research has revealed that gene length significantly influences these health outcomes. Scientists found that longer genes are associated with better health and longevity, while shorter genes correlate with shorter lifespans. As people age, activity within cells shifts toward shorter genes, creating an imbalance. However, individuals with very long genes have longer proteins available in their cells, which helps counterbalance this age-related shift.","context":["Lifespan and Health Span\nBy Arvind M. Dhople, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, Florida Tech\nAny time you open your computer these days, you are bombarded with advertisements that pop up trying to convince you of the power of a pill that make you live longer or a cream that will help to revive your youthful vigor and appearance. The search for ways to stop or reverse the aging process is a near-obsession in popular culture. The likelihood of discovering a scientifically proven “anti-aging” elixir is slim, but researchers believe their work will reveal ways to improve a person’s ability to live a longer, healthier life. They express these goals in terms of “lifespan” and ‘health span,” respectively.\nLifespan is the length of life for an organism. For instance, if you live to age 99, that would be your lifespan. Maximal lifespan is the maximum number of years of life observed in a specific population. It differs from species to species. The maximum recorded lifespan for human, reported in 2020, was 122.5 years for females (from France; U.S., 119.3 years) and 116.1 years for males (from Japan; U.S., 115 years).\nLifespan is a common measurement in aging research. That’s because it is clear-cut and easy to measure – an organism is either alive or dead. Scientists look for factors such as genes, environment, and behavioral traits (including diet) that may contribute to an organism’s lifespan. Altering a factor to see if it changes lifespan can provide evidence about whether or not that specific factor is important for aging. If the life of the animal with the modified gene activity is longer or shorter, then the gene probably does play a role in lifespan.\nThe ability to withstand disease could also be central to lifespan. Studies of exceptionally long-lived people are helping to establish patterns of health decline and increased disease (called morbidity) with old age. For example, do health problems start around the same age in all people and expand over extra years of life for the long-lived, or are the problems delayed, occurring closer to the end of life among exceptional agers? Evidence from a Danish longitudinal study of 92-to-100-year-olds found that health problems seem to be delayed, appearing closer to the end of life. This is not a certain outcome, but in many studies, the average centenarian seems to be in better health than the average 80-year-old. However, living to 100 does not mean never having any health issues.\nIn the “New England Centenarian Study”, researchers have developed three categories for their long-lived participants. They are characterized as “survivors,” “delayers,” or “escapers,” depending on whether they have survived a life-threatening disease, delayed a serious health problem until much later in life, and/or escaped any serious health events.\nScientists used to think that long life was a good indicator of health span, or years of good health and function. However, some experiments, particularly in mice, demonstrate significant improvements in health, without actually increasing lifespan. For example, scientists examining the effects of the wine-derived compound (resveratrol) in mice on a normal diet found the compound positively influenced the health of the mice – resveratrol-treated mice had better bone health, heart function, strength, vision, coordination, and cholesterol than the control group. But, resveratrol did not increase lifespan. (Lifespan was increased, however, in mice on a high-fat diet supplemented with resveratrol.)\nMost of what scientists know about factors that can contribute to a long lifespan and health span is based on research in animal models. Understanding how to extend health span – apart from its impact on longevity – is a growing focus of many studies, and for good reason. Imagine a society where a majority of people live to be 100, but along with the added years comes considerably more physical decline. While there is still a place for lifespan research, health span research holds promise for revealing ways to delay or prevent disease and disability so that we can live healthier longer.","Scientists think they have cracked the secret of aging.\nMajor genetic analysis of people, rodents and fish has revealed that the length of their DNA is directly related to their biological age.\nShorter genes were associated with shorter lifespans, while longer genes were linked to better health and longevity.\nScientists believe that if they can hijack this mechanism, it could pave the way for a fountain of youth drugs that could slow — or even reverse — aging.\nDr Thomas Stoeger, lead author of the study from Northwestern University in Illinois, said: ‘I find it very elegant that a single, relatively concise principle seems to explain almost all of the changes in gene activity that occur. occur in animals as they age.’\nScientists have said having longer genes can make someone live longer (stock photo)\nThe length of a gene is based on the number of nucleotides it contains. Each chain of nucleotides translates into an amino acid, forming a protein.\nTherefore, a very long gene results in a large protein and a short gene results in a small protein. A cell must have a balanced number of small and large proteins to achieve homeostasis, and problems arise when this balance is out of whack.\nIn the study, the researchers looked at genetic data from several large datasets, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, a tissue bank funded by the National Institutes of Health that archives samples from human donors for the purpose of research.\nThe research team first analyzed tissue samples from mice, rats and killifish of various ages.\nIn all the animals, the researchers noticed subtle changes in thousands of different genes across the samples.\nThis means that it’s not just a small subset of genes that contribute to aging. Aging, on the contrary, is characterized by changes at the systems level.\nThis view differs from mainstream biological approaches that study the effects of single genes.\nSince the advent of modern genetics in the early 20th century, many researchers expected to be able to attribute many complex biological phenomena to single genes.\nAnd although some diseases, such as hemophilia, result from mutations in a single gene, the narrow approach to studying single genes has yet to lead to explanations for the myriad changes that occur in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.\nAfter completing their animal research, the researchers turned to humans. They looked at changes in human genes from ages 30 to 49, 50 to 69, and then 70+.\nMeasurable changes in gene activity as a function of gene length have already occurred by the time humans reach middle age.\n“It already seems like something is going on early in life, but it becomes more pronounced with age,” Dr. Stoeger said.\nMen age FASTER than women, study finds\nMen technically age faster than women, experts say.\nAnti-aging researchers have found that men in their 50s are biologically four years older than their female counterparts, on average.\nAnd the gap already exists in your twenties, according to the first study of its kind.\nScientists compared the chronological age of thousands of volunteers – the number of birthdays they had – to their biological age.\nThis was done using tests that estimate body decline based on subtle markers attached to our DNA.\n“It seems that, from an early age, our cells are able to counter disturbances that would lead to an imbalance in gene activity. Then, suddenly, our cells can no longer counter it.\nLuis Amaral of Northwestern, lead author of the study, said: “The result for humans is very strong because we have more samples for humans than for other animals.”\n“It was also interesting because all the mice we studied are genetically identical, of the same sex and raised in the same laboratory conditions, but humans are all different.\n“They all died of different causes and at different ages. We analyzed male and female samples separately and found the same pattern.\nBut scientists have found that as we age, activity within cells shifts to shorter genes, upsetting the balance.\nThis is counterbalanced in people with very long genes, as they have longer proteins available in cells.\nDr Stoeger said: ‘Changes in gene activity are very, very small, and those small changes involve thousands of genes.\n“We found that this change was consistent across different tissues and across different animals.”\nScientists hope the study – published in Nature Aging – will spur the development of therapies to slow or reverse aging.\nCurrently, drugs target the symptoms rather than the causes of aging, which North West experts say is like using painkillers to reduce fever.\nDr Amaral said: “Fevers can occur for very many reasons. It can be caused by an infection, which requires antibiotics to cure, or caused by appendicitis, which requires surgery.\n” Here, it’s the same thing. The problem is the imbalance of gene activity. If you can help correct the imbalance, then you can deal with the downstream consequences.\n#Scientists #Unravel #Mystery #Aging #Gene #Length #Decisive #Factor"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e9bc7734-6ad2-4667-83b8-a07c45a7825b>","<urn:uuid:e80e55d6-d00a-46cc-9e88-8d10ed8a5eda>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between the Northwest Airlines 727's emergency flight altitude and OSRL's typical spray missions altitude?","answer":"The Northwest Airlines 727 was cruising at 35,000 feet when it experienced its engine loss incident, while OSRL's Boeing 727 operates at a drastically lower altitude of just 150 feet above the sea when conducting its oil dispersant spray missions at 150 knots.","context":["When you hear about aircraft ‘losing an engine,’ you probably think of the loss being in terms of engine power. But what about when an aircraft physically loses an engine by becoming detached from it altogether? Just such a thing happened to a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727 en route from Miami to Minneapolis, with the incident occurring 32 years ago today.\nThe flight in question\nNorthwest Airlines flight 5 was a service that originated at Miami International Airport (MIA) in Florida. Its destination was Minnesota’s Minneapolis-Saint Paul International (MSP), the busiest airport in the US Midwest. This is a route plied today by American Airlines, American Eagles, Delta Air Lines, Spirit Airlines (as of tomorrow), and Sun Country Airlines.\nToday marks exactly 32 years since a rather eventful iteration of Northwest Airlines flight 5. On January 4th, 1990, the service had 139 passengers and six crew members onboard, making for a total occupancy of 145 people. Operated by a 14-year-old Boeing 727-200 registered as N280US, the flight took off into the Florida skies at around 08:15 local time.\nUnknowingly flying with just two engines\nJust under an hour into the flight, something rather peculiar happened. At around 09:10, while cruising over Madison, Florida, the aircraft’s pilots heard a loud bang towards the rear of the plane. Following this, at an altitude of 35,000 feet, AirLive reports that they noted that the trijet’s starboard-mounted engine (on the 727’s right-hand side) had lost power.\nOf course, aircraft are designed to still function in the event of a loss of power to an engine. As such, the 727 continued flying under the power of its two remaining turbofans for nearly 50 minutes. However, in the interests of safety, the crew did eventually elect to make an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida. They did so safely at 09:58, with no injuries onboard.\nIt was at this point that the curious reality of the situation became evident. The aircraft hadn’t just lost power to the starboard-mounted engine, but rather the engine itself! The powerplant was located near Madison a day later, having fallen from the jet inflight.\nStay informed: Sign up for our daily and weekly aviation news digests.\nAn intentional safety feature\nAn investigation into the incident found that it had been caused by an improperly installed lavatory seal near the engine. This caused the engine in question to ingest frozen fluid chunks inflight, damaging its blades in the process and ultimately causing it to fail. However, the separation of the engine from the aircraft was actually a design feature of the 727.\nIndeed, the Chicago Tribune reports that the 727’s turbofans were designed to sheer off ‘under certain conditions.’ This helped keep the aircraft safe, as it ensured a clean break, meaning that the engine didn’t take any of the fuselage with it as it fell. This was also the case in a similar incident involving an American Airlines Boeing 727 in April 1985.\nIn any case, N280US was able to continue serving Northwest after the incident. According to data from ATDB.aero, it stayed there until 1995, before moving to TransMeridian the following year. It also briefly flew on lease to Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela in 1998.\nWhat do you make of this incident? Did you ever fly on a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727? Let us know your thoughts and experiences in the comments.","With the complications of travel due to Covid-19 and the potential risk to response readiness, overseas training had been temporarily suspended. With the 727 crews completing sector training within the UK since February 2020. Overseas training flights (OTFs) are in place to enable a crew per month to achieve sector flights to and land at various locations within two sectors from Doncaster. The flights enable the crew to practise navigation skills, approach and land at less familiar airports. In Denmark, France, Ireland, and Jersey, airports are typically cycled through in a six-month rolling programme to support these competencies.\nNaturally, our 727 is of interest to Boeing enthusiasts, aircraft spotters, OSRL members, and professionals in the aviation sector. They are always eager to glimpse the world's first jet based dispersant platform and potentially the last operating Boeing 727. The recent return to overseas training flights provided some local enthusiasts with an opportunity to view the aircraft with the 2Excel crew; Flying in Ireland has published an article from the visit, written by author Gabriel Desmond.\nRead the article below or read the original article here.\nWith the return of OTFs, we will seek to provide opportunities for members to visit the aircraft on future visits.\nOn 4th May Cork had another welcome overnight visit by the Boeing B727-200 used for maritime oil spill response. This iconic type has long disappeared from frontline use as airliner and freighter so Paul Daly, Operations Manager, Weston Aviation, the handling agents, arranged a tour and briefing for a group of local aviation enthusiasts.\nThe main modifications for the oil spray role are the fitting of seven dispersant tanks along the main cabin floor and a 10-metre spray boom below the tail. Also seen, left, is the retractable tail skid. In the B727 tail scrapes were most likely during take off.\n2Excel is a British aviation group that supplies specialist solutions to the government, defence, aviation and engineering sectors, including the oil and gas industry. They operate two modified Boeing 727-200s in the oil dispersant role which is able to deploy at short notice to emergencies worldwide from their base at Doncaster, near Sheffield, England. Their client for this is Oil Spill Response Limited, OSRL, a global cooperative from oil companies across the world.\nThe Modification to the 727s is called the TERSUS aerial dispersant system and consists of the installation of seven dispersant tanks holding 15,000 litres within the fuselage linked to a lateral 10 metre spray boom under the tail below the engines. This spray system has recently been strengthened to cater for possible ice accretion, resulting in the aircraft now being able to operate in all weather fight conditions. More remarkably, this system has been entirely developed, tested and installed by 2Excel’s own in-house facilities and staff.\nThe spray boom is fairly inconspicuous but is clearly seen here during the B727’s approach. The spray boom pumps out dispersant fluids through thirty nozzles.\nOSRL and 2Excel regularly conduct training and emergency missions across Europe and even Africa to hone skills and maintain currency. They will fly a demonstration at this year’s RIAT at Fairford, England.\nThe dispersant liquids are classified as flammable and the TERSUS system is the only one in the world certified for aerial use. Compliance design required consideration of material compatibility, lightning protection, 9G crashworthiness, fault detection systems and the use of double-skinned fuselage storage tanks. The Boeing 727 trijet is an ideal platform for such a system as it is pressurised, well-powered, has a large freight capacity, proven reliability and has a three man crew of two pilots and a flight engineer which allows for safe stable flight at low level while simultaneously operating the dispersal system. This is flown at 150kts and a mere 150 ft above the sea. Spray application which takes 15 to 30 minutes depending on the rate of application is handled by the flight engineer.\nThe externally pristine OSRL aircraft could be mistaken for a new aircraft but its classic flight deck’s main panel layout was designed sixty years ago.\nOne aircraft can be airborne to an oil spill emergency at four hours’ notice. It can transit at altitude before descending to spray and then return at altitude to its Doncaster base. For longer missions, a transit stop may be made. It is available for worldwide deployment so for long ferry flights, the external spray boom can be removed and later refitted in a few hours to increase ferry range and altitude.\nThe Flight Engineer’s panels are behind the pilots, on the right. These are just some of the instruments he must monitor!\nBoeing 727-200 G-OSRA was the last of 1832 examples off the production line in 1984. It was built as a freighter for FedEx and flew with them as N217FE for 28 years until eventually confined to desert storage. It was converted for oil spray response at Lasham, England in 2013 and is expected to remain flying until the present contract with OSRL expires in 2028. Boeing 727 spares are increasingly hard to acquire so it is expected that another narrowbody type will be converted for the TERSUS system.\nSo if you see this aircraft flying by, have a good look.

{"question":"What's the connection between Hitler's possible escape plans to Spain in 1944 and his strategic focus on oil supply routes through the Black Sea in 1942?","answer":"In June 1944, there were reports that Hitler was allegedly preparing to escape to Spain through Perpignan in southern France if the war went badly, though MI6 insisted he was at his headquarters. By contrast, in 1942, Hitler was focused on securing vital supply routes, particularly through the Black Sea, to transport oil from the Caucasus region. He and Admiral Raeder were concerned about making the Black Sea safe for German shipping, though they focused more on supplying German armies than on shipping Caucasus oil back to the Reich. This shows Hitler's shift from offensive resource acquisition in 1942 to potential escape planning by 1944.","context":["(W)Archives: Kill Hitler? Oh, I Guess So\nOver the thirteen years since 9/11, the topic of assassination has kept coming up as a subject of debate in America. To our credit, we agonize over whether assassination is moral and whether it is effective.\nIt turns out that the British went through a similar exercise during World War II. Last year, the UK National Archives opened to the public Foreign Office file FO 1093/292 under the simultaneously lurid and banal name “War: General; Assassination Priorities for OVERLORD.” The documents in this file bring into sharp relief many of the issues we face today. It seems that assassination often sounds attractive but it is morally fraught, has side effects, and is difficult to do.\nThe file shows that the British contemplated using the French underground or other covert means to assassinate various senior German and Vichy French leaders, including Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, in the run-up to or shortly after the D-Day landings. A variant of the idea was to assassinate lower level German transport officials whose deaths might impede the German effort to rush forces to Normandy. Apparently this was to be an adjunct to the “Transport Plan” for strategic bombing. The idea never really went anywhere, however. Certainly, some officials expressed moral distaste, but one official summed up the majority opinion as follows:\nI…dislik[e] this scheme, not out of squeamishness, as there are several people in this world whom I could kill with my own hands and with a feeling of pleasure and without that action in any way spoiling my appetite, but I think that it is the type of bright idea which in the end produces a good deal of trouble and does little good.\nForemost among the aspects of that “good deal of trouble” was the prospect that the Germans would retaliate against Allied prisoners of war.\nStuff got real, however, after the landings when, on June 20, the British Ambassador in Algiers cabled to London that a French colonel had told him that Adolf Hitler was living in disguise in a house in Perpignan in southern France near the Spanish border. Allegedly the Fuehrer was making preparations to escape to Spain if the war went badly (See page 31 of the file). The Ambassador reported that he had consulted with British military authorities and they were ready to bomb the house. The Ambassador closed his telegram with the sentence, “The story is quite fantastic, but so was the story of Hess,” Hitler’s deputy who had flown to Britain in 1941 under mysterious circumstances.\nAsked its opinion of the report, MI6 said it was quite confident that Hitler was actually at his headquarters and nowhere near Perpignan. Nevertheless, the chance—however remote—of getting the Fuehrer was too much to resist. The Foreign Office was convinced to take action. For their part, Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s chief military assistant informed him in a June 21 note that the Chiefs of Staff unanimously thought that, “from a strictly military point of view, it was almost an advantage that Hitler should remain in control of German strategy, having regard to the blunders that he has made.” However, the note continued, “on the wider point of view, the sooner he was got out of the way, the better.”\nThe bombing operation was approved but Hitler, of course, was not there. He died some ten months later of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his bunker in Berlin.\nMark Stout is a Senior Editor at War on the Rocks.

The seizure of these geographically distant oilfields, although still within reach of British bombers based in Iraq (which were not, in any event, a danger in 1942), would also greatly offset the constant danger of Allied air attacks against the Ploesti plants in Rumania and its own synthetic fuel plants within the Reich itself. More importantly, Hitler declared, the severance of the various north-south railways between the oil and industrial regions and Moscow, the capture of the oilfields themselves and the blocking of the vital Volga river system (which carried not only oil but armaments and lend-lease supplies from Archangel) would be a massive, and probably mortal blow to the Soviet economy and war effort.\nThe surviving documentation reveals that few OKW and OKH officers openly expressed doubts about the proposed campaign to seize the Caucasus oilfield, and that none actually challenged Hitler on the feasibility of the plan. It may be, of course, that after the dismissal of von Brauchitsch and von Rundstedt, none were brave enough to risk the Führers wrath. It appears more likely, however, that Hitler's military advisers were in general agreement that, within the limited range of options available, his plan contained the most merit. Even Haider, who personally thought (but never made a strong case to the High Command) that the eastern armies should maintain an essentially defensive posture for the time being, was apparently won over to the general plan. In response to the Navy's 'Suez Memorandum' of 3 April, which advocated the urgent capture of the Suez Canal by Rommel's forces, Haider emphatically stated to the OKH Naval Liaison Officer, Kapitän zur See Konrad Weygold, that the conquest of the Caucasus was 'absolutely vital' for Germany's continued war effort. If the oilfield were not captured, 'the Reich will not survive long'. The Caucasus, he explained 'has more or less the same importance as Silesia once had for Prussia.' Having doubtless carefully studied the detailed briefings of the War Economy and Armaments Office, he knew that Germany's oil situation was critical. On 16 February, by way of illustration, this office had grimly warned, in its conclusion to a 16-page report on Germany's fuel situation that:\nOne thing is now clear: without Russian oil we simply cannot utilize fully the regions of Russia we now occupy. But above all, without Russian oil the German war machine must from now on become increasingly more impotent.\nIndeed, as the year progressed it became increasingly evident to senior German planners that Hitler's emphasis on the capture of oil resources was well-founded. For example, on 6 June (three weeks before the start of the campaign), the OKW glumly reported that oil supplies throughout the rest of 1942 would be 'one of the weakest points in our defensive capabilities'. The significance of this comment is obvious; defensive actions require far less oil than offensive ones, so the situation must certainly have looked black. Because oil shortages were so critical, the report continued, 'the operational freedom of all three services will be restricted, and the armaments industry will also suffer. Reserves have been reduced almost to nothing, so we are now forced to rely on production'.\nIt appears that during this period there was little discussion between Hitler and his military advisers over the important question of how Caucasus oil was to be transported to the Reich. A quarter of a century earlier, this problem had also vexed Ludendorff and the German High Command, who never arrived at an adequate solution. The overworked Fürher may not even have realized the importance of this matter, considering it best simply to cross that bridge when he came to it. He had almost certainly not read the March 1941 report by Generalleutnant Hermann von Hanneken of the War Economy and War Armaments Office, which was appended to a letter sent by Keitel to the OKH. This report warned that, even if the Caucasus oilfields could be captured intact, very little oil (only 10,000 tons per month) could be carried overland to Germany. Moreover, even if the Black Sea could be made safe for shipping, there would be no ships available for the transport of Caucasus oil up the Danube because its river tankers were already working to capacity transporting Rumanian oil.131 The only remaining route was across the Black Sea, through the Dardenelles, and on to Mediterranean ports. Accordingly, the report concluded, 'the opening of the sea routes and the security of the tankers in the Black Sea is the prerequisite for the use of Russian supply sources in sufficient quantity to support the further continuation of the war.' Clearly, to attain this prerequisite was virtually impossible by early 1942; the Germans would have had to wipe out the powerful Soviet Black Sea Fleet (which still had, according to Raeder, 'naval supremacy ... [allowing] great freedom of movement’) and eliminate British air and sea power from the eastern Mediterranean.\nDespite not considering how best to solve this logistics nightmare - which never occurred, because the German Army captured only the already-destroyed Maikop oilfield - Hitler was well aware of the need to make the Black Sea safe for German shipping. However, both he and Raeder appear to have worried more about supplying German armies via the Black Sea than of shipping Caucasus oil back to the Reich or Rumanian refineries.\nWhen planning the forthcoming campaign, both Hitler and the German High Command placed considerable emphasis on the need to advance on the Caucasus oilfields so rapidly that the Soviets would not have time to destroy the oil wells and refineries permanently. If the latter were destroyed, the bulk of the oil would have to be refined elsewhere until new refineries could be constructed. Only Rumanian refineries, which still had a considerable surplus refinement capacity, could handle large quantities of additional crude, but (for the reasons mentioned above) it would be extremely difficult to ship significant amounts of oil from the Caucasus to Rumania.\nAn 'Oil Detachment Caucaus' had been formed a year earlier, in the spring of 1941,when the capture of the oilfields was still a principal objective of the forthcoming attack on the Soviet Union. Its purpose was to repair damaged wells and refineries quickly so that exploitation of the oilfields could be commenced as soon as possible. In early 1942, when the capture of the oilfield became the objective of the forthcoming attack, this detachment was expanded considerably and renamed the 'Oil Brigade Caucasus'. The expansion was necessary because recent experiences in Ukraine and the Donets Basin indicated that the Caucaus oilfields would probably not be captured before at least some attempts were made to destroy existing wells and refineries. As a result, this unusual paramilitary force was brought to a strength of 10,794, issued with 1,142 vehicles and six aircraft and ordered to stand by, ready to move into the Caucaus oilfield immediately behind the combat troops.\nOn 28 March, after a lengthy period of discussion, the OKH presented Hitler with a plan for the Caucasus offensive - to be code-named Fall Blau, or Case BLUE - which closely paralleled his wishes…. Spelling out the aim of the new offensive, [Hitler] declared that 'as soon as the weather and the state of the terrain provide the necessary prerequisites', it was important once again to seize the strategic initiative and, through German military superiority, 'force our will upon the enemy'. The objective this time was not only to wipe out the remaining Soviet military potential, but also to 'deprive them of their most important military-economic sources of strength.'\nThe general plan involved Army Group Centre holding fast, while an effort would be made to 'bring about the fall of Leningrad and link up with the Finns north of the city', and, in the region of Army Group South, a major campaign would be launched into the Caucasus….\nall available forces are to be assembled for the main operation in the southern sector, with the objective of destroying the enemy forward of the Don, in order to secure the oil regions of the Caucasus and the passes through the Caucasus [mountain range] itself.\nBefore the major offensive into the Caucasus could commence, the directive stated, it would be necessary 'to clear the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea and to bring about the fall of Sevastopol.' In preparation for this campaign, the Luftwaffe and later the Kriegsmarine would have the task of 'energetically hindering enemy supply traffic in the Black Sea and the Kerch Straits.' The insistence on these time-consuming preliminary operations in the Crimea reveals that Hitler still believed that the Crimea would have to be 'neutralized' entirely in order to protect Rumanian oilfields permanently from Soviet bombers. This view, it should be noted, was not only shared by General-oberst von Manstein, whose battered Eleventh Army would have to do the fighting in the Crimea, but also by General-oberst Alexander Löhr, whose air fleet (Luftflotte IV) would have to support von Manstein's ground assault. Perhaps more importantly, it was also shared by Marshal Antonescu….\nAfter neutralizing the Crimea, Hitler's War Directive 41 stated, the main campaign could begin. Curiously, in the light of the fact that the campaign has come to be associated with the name of that city, the capture of Stalingrad was actually not a major objective. It was certainly considered by Hitler to be far less important than the oilfields. The directive stated only that an attempt should be made 'to reach' Stalingrad, 'or at least to subject this city to the bombardment of our heavy weapons to such an extent that it is eliminated as an armament and transportation centre in the future.' As the historian Gerhard Weinberg points out, it is ironic that 'the place whose name will always be associated with one of the great battles of World War II was largely ignored by the Germans beforehand and renamed Volgograd by the Soviet Union afterwards.”…\nThe preliminary campaign (to clear the Crimea of Soviet forces) commenced on 8 May and was brought to a successful conclusion on 3 July. Hitler breathed a sigh of relief; the Crimea was entirely in German hands and the Rumanian oilfields, his major source of oil, were safe from air attack for at least the near future.\nMeanwhile, on 28 June the main campaign to seize the Caucasus oilfields had been launched and initially, to Hitler's great delight, made startling progress….\nIn fact, despite the total failure of the 1942 campaign, events in 1943 actually led to a slight improvement in the oil situation…. Germany's synthetic fuel industry, not yet targeted by Allied bombers, reached a production peak… the oil shortages which had bedevilled the Wehrmacht's efforts throughout the previous two years appeared far less critical. The Luftwaffe was even able to build up its meagre reserves slightly for the first time since the beginning of the Russian campaign.\nHistory has exposed the inaccurancy of the warnings the Nazi leader received from his economists, but at that time they seemed both credible and compelling. Hitler, aware by December 1941 that he now faced a prolonged war against the world's two economic giants the Soviet Union and the United States, felt that he had no real option but to embark on a campaign which would, if successful, greatly enhance his ability to continue waging that war…"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ddc39a33-49cd-4a70-af1d-5efc95ca4cb7>","<urn:uuid:cf936a78-d182-42a5-bcef-a35a61a34596>"],"error":null}
{"question":"how wood density affects hardness + what treatments protect against degradation?","answer":"Wood density has a direct relationship with hardness - the higher the density, the greater the hardness. For protecting wood against degradation, there are two main types of treatments: decorative surface protectors (which guard against atmospheric agents like sun, rain, snow, UV rays and humidity) and technical wood protectors (which use chemical elements to protect against bio-agents like fungi, bacteria, and insects). The protectors can be applied through brushing, spraying, or immersion methods, with each method offering different levels of protection.","context":["Improve the productivity, quality and competitiveness of the wood industry and its derivatives.\nThis professional creates and optimizes industrial processes corresponding to chemical, biochemical and/or physical transformations of wood.\nHe determines its production technology respecting economic, social and environmental factors.\nHis knowledge is oriented to wood science and technology, complementing with economics and administration foundations.\nSpecific tasks or activities carried out in the profession\n-He takes part in the study, *feasibility, project, direction, construction, inspection and installation of wood industries, expect for the corresponding civil works.\n-He classifies wood samples into these categories: family, type and species.\n-He determines wood properties.

First we must take into account if the wood is going to be exposed to the interior or exterior and if the environment also contains some elements considered aggressive.\nWood protectors are divided into two types\n- Decorative products for surface protection: they protect the wood against atmospheric agents such as sun, rain, snow, UV rays and humidity changes.\n- Technical wood protectors: These elements are composed of chemical elements that protect the wood from bio-agents such as fungi, bacteria, and even termites or other insects.\nDecorative products for surface protection\nCoating material that, when applied to a material, ends up forming a transparent solid film (totally or partially) with insulating, protective and decorative properties. It is used both indoors and outdoors. It can be applied by brush, synthetic roller or spray machine\nCoating material with specific pigments normally in liquid form, which when applied on a surface, forms a film with specific insulating, protective and decorative properties. It can also be applied outdoors or indoors. Same form of application as in the case of varnishes.\nThese are products that leave the pore open to the wood. In addition, biocidal elements can be added, solar filters that allow the retardation of wood oxidation. If the Wood Stains are pigmented the oxidation effect is further delayed. They can be used indoors and especially outdoors. In the case of application, the brush is convenient because of its greater capacity to penetrate the product into the Wood. On the application of the Wood Stain or impregnating we will refer later\nRaw Materials Used in the Treatment and Protection of Wood\nThe most used in the manufacture of wood surface protection products are the following:\nResins (binder): its function is to waterproof wood against the action of water or other liquid elements.\nPigments: its function, in addition to its decorative mission, is to reduce the effect of the sun, UV and infrared rays.\nSolvents: its function is to transport and dissolve the resin and pigments without altering their chemical composition. Water (water-soluble) or Organic Solvents (organic or synthetic solvent products) are usually used.\nVarious components: its function is to improve its effectiveness in terms of protection. and added to solvents. The most common are hydrophobic, fungicides, insecticides, diluents, sunscreens, antioxidants or inhibitors\nTypes of application in surface treatments\nThe application of the protector on the wood is done by several product hands, by brush, brush (also the roller applies). The necessary time must be left to dry as specified by the manufacturer of each product. The wood must be dry free of internal exudation and the surface clean, especially of dust. The protection resulting from this application is very good indoors and very low outdoors, especially if it is exposed to the sun or other atmospheric agents such as rain.\nPowdered in the treatment and protection of wood:\nAn applicator or electric spray gun is used. This method saves time since its application is faster. in turn, the varnish paint layer is thinner than the previous method and takes less time to dry. Also consult the manufacturer of the products about this method of application. The protection of this application system is similar to the previous one. Also as the previous method the wood must be dry and clean. There is professional spraying in the tunnel, but it is not the subject of this topic, so we will not develop it here.\nThis application system consists of totally submerging the wood in ambient temperature conditions, for a period of time. Then the wood is removed and dried, especially in airy and dark environments. This method is not recommended in an environment with humidity higher than 70%.\nDescription and use of application types\nTreatment and Protection of Wood by Brushing\nThe protector that is applied (varnish, paint or Lasur) is organic or solvent based. The product is applied by brush, brush or roller. The mentioned product penetrates the pores of the wood by capillarity. This method consists of a superficial protection against the action of organic or environmental agents.\nConsiderations to take into account\nWood used indoors must be dry or contain a low percentage of humidity (up to 12%). If it is to be used outdoors it may contain some more moisture and especially if Lasur is applied. (up to 20%). Check where the wood is bought this aspect.\nThe color and the grain of the wood are intrinsic decorative values that must be taken into account when applying the coatings.\nthe wood contracts and expands with heat and humidity. It is important to buy wood with a low coefficient of expansion, since these micro movements crack the protective layer. And especially if wood is used outdoors. Wood used indoors suffer very few variations. Check when the purchase is made for this issue and ask if the wood has already been treated with resins to reduce shrinkage.\nWoods that are very porous absorb more product than less porous and therefore the application of wood sealants would be necessary.\nWood extracts are highly complex organic substances. They can be resins, oils, waxes or dyes (such as tannin). They can be viscous or liquid. If the wood has these characteristics, it is advisable not to apply any product, as they will prevent drying or crack protection. It would be un dried or not parked wood (green wood).\nPreparation of the wood surface :\nWith dry, clean wood and without exudates, when the product can be applied. You should never apply the product with exposure to the sun, since it varies dramatically not only the drying times but the mechanics of the formation of the protective film\nSpray Wood Protection\nThe protector is applied on the surface of the wood with a manual or electric spraying machine. When the system is used by spraying, it is more efficient than brushing, since the product is absorbed faster by penetrating the wood more.\nTherefore it is advisable if it is going to be used outdoors, since this application system confers some more protection. Apart from all of the above, the application is done much faster and drying is too. The rest of the characteristics are similar to those of the brushstroke in terms of surface and condition is environmental\nImmersion Wood Protection\nHere the woods are completely immersed in a water soluble or organic solvent product for a period of time. This period varies between 30 seconds and 15 minutes, depending on the type of protector and the size of the surface to be treated.\nThe protective product is introduced into the wood through the pores inwards. This type of application has the advantage over previous systems, which achieves greater contact between the surfaces of the wood to be protected and the protective product. You can also regulate the amount of product to be absorbed through greater or lesser exposure.\nThe disadvantage is obvious, and it is a waste of product if it is not used for a large number of pieces to be protected. Drying should be aired, dry and never exposed to sunlight or high relative humidity.\nAtmospheric Agents: Sun, rain, Humidity, temperature and UV rays\nNow, as the surface of the wood in question has been treated, we will see how the different agents of deterioration act against the protections applied to the wood. First we will cite all the degrading agents and then the recommendations for each type of protection and for each use.\nThe wood protection layer is affected not only by ultraviolet rays, but also by infrared. Abrupt changes in surface temperature, end by difference between external and internal stresses by producing cracks. UV rays attack the surface being fibrous and cracked. In this situation the humidity can penetrate more deeply accelerating the deterioration of the wood.\nThe wood attacked by UV rays has a gray surface. This situation is resolved with brushing and bleaching salts. If the sun exposure process combined with rain (which washes the cellulose) does not stop, deterioration is irreversible. The layers of protection in the wood usually change their physical composition and degrade, appearing scales or fissures.\nIt produces the heating of the exhibition area, favoring the evaporation of moisture from the wood and in a superficial way. in this way there are tensions or forces that act between the wet interior and the dry surface, producing internal micro cracks. This is called thermal stress of the material. These cracks then allow the entry of destructive agents. This radiation also affects the protective layers applied, cracking them. Heating of the wood can also lead to resin exudate, depending on the species and damage the protective layer.\nAtmospheric or environmental humidity\nWood is a material that absorbs moisture under normal conditions. A protective layer of varnish, paint or lasur, insulates it from this atmospheric agent. If the wood is in internal environments, humidity does not present a major problem. With three hands of protective coating is enough. But on the outside, if the wood has been exposed to sun and rain, the micro-cracks appear through which not only water but also ambient humidity will be absorbed. This is also valid where wood for humid environments with steam such as bathrooms and kitchens. The appearance of micro-fissures in the protective layer allows water to pass inside the wood, a fundamental factor to take into account in the treatment and protection of wood.\nFreeze and defrost effect\nThe moisture contained inside the wood in regions where there are freezing temperatures, freezes. When this happens the ice increases its volume producing cracks inside the wood. In defrosting the wood does not return to its previous state, producing a deformation. and also cracks externally in the protective layers.\nFire or high Temperatures\nDestroying element par excellence, exposure to fire, or high temperatures destroys the protective layer even in short periods. This can happen if the wood is near a heat source such as kitchens, grills or by accidental exposure.\nOutside a Wood Stain is the most recommended.\nUnlike varnish and synthetic paints, it penetrates deeply into the wood and does NOT form a layer. The finish is open pore, which facilitates the exit of natural moisture from the interior of the wood. They are ideal for outdoor wood that are exposed to environmental aggressions, as are all the elements listed above.\nIts resins are highly flexible and adapt to the physical variations that the wood of the wood suffers. The lasures have bright, matt or satin finishes.\nOutdoors, the use of synthetic varnishes or paints is not advisable because they do not withstand the aggression of environmental agents very well. Thus the aging of the film, cracks or directly the protective film is flaked.\nThe application of Wood Stain indoors\nFor the treatment and protection of the wood, if it is new it must be dry to ensure that it does not crack or deform. For the application of lasur the methods already described are used, but we recommend the brush and well-loaded, since the wood penetrates deeply. If inside the wood is not exposed to the sun you can use colorless lasur, with low UV protection.\nIt should be taken into account that the erosive action of the sand and salt particles carried by the wind in the coastal areas wear and erode the surfaces more quickly, so the maintenance periods should be shorter.\nThe application of Wood Stain :Outdoors\nThe same recommendation for brush application as the previous one taking the following precautions.\n- For a good treatment and protection of the wood, sand the wood previously in the direction of the grain with fine grade sandpaper.\n- Do not use other accessories to clean such as scourers, bleach, lavandines etc.\n- If fungicides are applied, let dry at least 24 hours before applying the lasur.\n- When wood funds are applied, do so after the fungicide application.\n- Do not apply Lasur directly in sunlight. This dramatically modifies the natural absorption and drying times.\n- If the wood is wet, let it dry for at least 24 to 48 hours, in a dry place and repaired from atmospheric elements\n- Do not apply outdoors if the temperature is near the freezing point\n- Apply in rain or in environments with 70% relative humidity is totally inadvisable\n- Use brushes that do not lose the bristles. We recommend flat brushes and not brushes.Lasures\nWood Stain are to water or solvent. A layer of one can be applied to the water on the other solvent, as long as the layer on which it is to be applied is completely dry. For the treatment and protection of wood with lasures, it should be borne in mind that water or solvent are application vehicles and that these evaporate completely and leave no residue. The woos stain are ideal for application on wooden pallets outdoors.\nMaintenance of wood protections\nThe durability over time of a lasur, varnish or paint are directly related to the exposure time to the degrading elements: Humidity, water, steam, UV rays, infrared, sudden temperature changes, Snow or freezing temperatures.\nElements that have a horizontal position, where it can be deposited without draining rainwater or other moisture, require more maintenance.\nIt is usually recommended once a year to sand clean the protective layer, apply a smooth sanding and at least one coat of product. In the case of varnishes and paints, when they accumulate several layers, it is already advisable to completely remove all the protective layers. Then the application on clean wood is suitable again as if it were new. In the case of lasur just apply one more product hand. To avoid darkening of the protective layer, a transparent lasur should be applied."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:577b364e-0e9a-4e61-83f4-763f1c50cae6>","<urn:uuid:45307cde-ffba-475e-b408-37c3f2e1c2c6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Yakima River Canyon Scenic Byway Initiative evolve from 2010 onwards, and what were its major developments?","answer":"The Yakima River Canyon Scenic Byway Initiative marked a revival of the 1968 corridor management plan in 2010, led by Forterra and the Kittitas Environmental Education Network (KEEN). The initiative involved public conversations in Yakima and Kittitas Counties to shape the vision, focusing on improving visitor experience, tourism, resource protection, and sustainable facilities. A significant milestone occurred in October 2010 when twenty-six various agencies, groups, and stakeholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a collective dedicated to the byway's development. This memorandum was later updated and re-signed in spring 2016, bringing additional partners and focusing on plan implementation.","context":["Yakima Canyon Interpretive Center Educational Master Plan\nAfter the passage of Senate Bill 424, the Yakima River Canyon along State Route 821 became Washington’s first scenic corridor. A corridor management plan was developed in the late 1960s to maximize the Canyon’s aesthetic beauty and recreational potential, but progress was stalled until 2010 and the Yakima River Canyon Scenic Byway Initiative (YRCSBI).\nSince 2010, there has been an awakening of the original 1968 corridor management plan through reprioritization of plan goals by Forterra, the largest land conservation, stewardship and community building organization in Washington State, and the Kittitas Environmental Education Network (KEEN).\nAn open conversation with the local public in both Yakima and Kittitas Counties and area stakeholders to identify the vision for the canyon helped to shape the YRCSBI.

{"question":"¡Hola! 😊 Me encantaría aprender sobre máquinas de tejer. ¿Podrías explicarme cómo funcionan básicamente? ¡Gracias!","answer":"A knitting machine works by using a bed of 150-200 latch hook needles that the yarn loops through. It has a carriage or cam box that moves over these needles, causing them to move in the correct way to produce stitches. The machine uses various selection methods to determine which stitch to make next, with modern machines typically using computer control rather than the punchcards that were used in the past.","context":["When you imagine somebody knitting, you usually picture them using their hands, using two needles, a length of yarn, and not really much else. But what about all those shop-bought sweaters? Where do they come from? Because it’s hard to imagine rows and rows of humans on a production line, clickety-clacking away. You’re absolutely right, in that they aren’t made the traditional way, otherwise how could they be made so cheaply? A knitting machine is an absolute must for clothing companies. But, in fact, anyone can own a knitting machine.\nWhy would you choose to use a knitting machine?\nTraditionalists will say that using a knitting machine is sacrilege. However, there are some obvious benefits to choosing knitting machines over hand knitting. Let’s look at some of them, so you can decide for yourself.\nSpeed is the essence – This is obviously one of the biggest benefits. When it comes to knitting scarves, sweaters, blankets, or other items for your family and home, using a knitting machine will mean you finish your projects much faster. If you’re thinking of starting a knitting business or want to make some money knitting, speed is of the essence.\nNo slipped stitches or crooked cables – Using a knitting machine means your efficiency will improve, along with your accuracy. Many machines use programmed patterns, which leave no room for human error. Lose your attention when hand knitting and you’ll be dropping stitches or knitting crooked cables till the cows come home. There will be far fewer mistakes if you’re using a machine.\nAre there any differences between hand and machine knitting?\nBefore you take the plunge and change from hand knitting to machine, let’s point out some of the differences.\nStitches aren’t created equal – Not all stitches are created the same with a machine, as they are with needles. There are even some that are impossible to recreate. Others are so tedious, it’s hardly worth the bother.\nDifferences in gauge – The ideal scenario would be to choose a machine that allows you to change the position or size of the needles, to meet a different gauge. Unfortunately, many machines have needles locked in place, which means you can’t adapt for different gauges. What happens instead is several swatches have to be created, in order to determine the right one to use. Machine knitting requires far more preparation, but don’t be disheartened. Once you’ve got the hang of it you’re production line will be smoking hot.\nHow does a knitting machine work?\nKnitting machines work by using a bed that consists of a series of latch hooks, There are usually between 150 and 200 needles, and this is what the yarn loops through. There is a carriage, or cam box that moves over the latch hook needles which causes them to move in the correct way to produce another stitch. There are various selection methods which help to tell the machine exactly what to do, and which stitch to make next. Punchcards were mostly used in the past, but most of these have been replaced by computer control.\nWhat are the different knitting machine types?\nKnitting machines designed for use in the home have been popular since the mid 1900s. There are plenty to choose from, but not every one functions and performs the same. On the whole, most knitting machines fall into the type called ‘Japanese’. There are several different brands, but most of them are similar and work in much the same way. The most usual differences are in the switches and levers. What they’re called and where they are does vary.\nThe biggest dilemma you face when looking at different knitting machine types, is not the brand or manufacturer, but the gauge. What we’re talking about here is the size of the needles, and how close they are together. Both have a direct relationship to the size of yarn you can use. There isn’t a machine that can knit any kind of yarn. Although most are designed to handle a range of different ones. In the machine’s instruction booklet will be a page for technical specifications. The number of needles, along with their pitch in mm, will get a mention. However, a description of the gauge is better to look at, and this can be one of three.\nStandard gauge knitting machines – These are the most common. There are 200 needles, and the needle pitch is 4.5mm. They can be used to knit with a variety of yarns, and can be used to make some beautiful knitted clothing and sweaters. Not typically suitable for heavier knits such as a heavy ski sweater.\nBulky gauge knitting machines – These are designed to be used with worsted weight yarns, and create knitwear that looks like it’s been hand made. There are 114 needles and their pitch is 9mm. Also good for sport weight or bulky yarns. So if you’re planning on knitting the whole family heavy Christmas sweaters, this one is for you.\nFine gauge knitting machines – These are for the finest yarns of all, and will produce very fine knit fabrics, much like those in your local sweater store.\nThere is another type of machine called the mid-gauge. This type combines the best of both bulky and standard machines. However, many are not made to the highest standard and often feature plastic needle beds and fewer functions. However, they are still a great starting point, or perfect if knitting is really only a hobby."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:138cb236-29ad-4bc1-8e97-f2321b03206b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do quarterly OKRs and daily standups complement each other in product development, and what are their distinct purposes?","answer":"Quarterly OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and daily standups serve different but complementary purposes in product development. Quarterly OKRs define concrete product outcomes for the next three months, focusing on measurable results like metric lifts in acquisition, engagement, or monetization, with 3-5 key objectives per quarter. Daily standups, on the other hand, are tactical 15-minute meetings where team members discuss immediate progress, plans, and blockers. These daily meetings help maintain efficient project flow and address bottlenecks within 24 hours, while ensuring alignment with the broader quarterly objectives. The daily format can be either in-person or via chat platforms like Slack/HipChat, but must remain a live session for immediate issue resolution.","context":["Modern Project Management for Product Managers\nOne of the critical responsibilities of product managers is driving the overall execution of their product. Relentless execution will ultimately determine whether you'll be able to make your product vision a reality. Driving the execution of your product not only means doing whatever it takes to make your product win, but it also encompasses a set of core project management responsibilities. While many product managers are familiar with agile methodologies for managing a development team, I don't believe it provides a full view of how a product manager should be effectively managing their overall product process.\nToday I wanted to provide a complete picture of a modern project management process for product managers. This covers a set of planning and project management activities that product managers should drive annually, quarterly, bi-weekly, and daily to effectively manage a product development process. It's rooted in the agile movement, with a deep recognition that customer needs and product requirements are ever-evolving and agility is absolutely paramount to enable you to swiftly change plans as soon as it's appropriate. At the same time, it recognizes that planning is absolutely necessary for enabling blue-sky thinking, thoughtful trade-offs of priorities, driving team alignment, and ultimately for enabling you to realize your product's long-term vision.\nLet's walk through each planning activity, it's purpose, and benefits.\nThe annual planning process is an important opportunity to take a step-back from the day-to-day execution of your product. It often starts with a re-assessment of the market you play in, taking the time to look at the industry you operate in, think through emerging or waning technology trends, and taking an updated pulse on your standing in the market. It's a good time to reflect on how well you are serving the needs of your customers and their overall satisfaction with your product offering.\nIt's also a good time to ensure that the vision you've established for your product is still appropriate. While a vision should have long-term stability and should change rather infrequently, there do come occasions when it makes sense to revise it. Treat the annual planning process as a check-in to ensure your vision is still serving you well.\nWhile the output of an annual planning process can take multiple forms, I've found 5-year roadmap themes to be a great aid in facilitating the right level of discussion. I've typically seen this done as a single slide or single-page document. While the upcoming year will have a great degree of specificity, the outer years will likely only have a few sentences or bullets associated with their themes. This exercise facilitates long-term thinking into where you ultimately aspire to go, but also forces a very real trade-off discussion of whether the next year is going to be the year that you start to take on some of these longer-term objectives or not.\nFor example, we are currently experiencing an explosion in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities and for many consumer & B2B services, it's important to understand this technology trend. After careful consideration you might decide that your product is a perfect fit for it, the time is right, and you have the right team capabilities to put machine learning related themes into next year's roadmap. On the other hand you might decide that it's not well-suited for your product, you have far lower-hanging customer challenges that need to be addressed, and the next 2 years are not the time for you to pivot away from your existing roadmap. This is exactly the kind of discussion you want to facilitate with your team's stakeholders.\nWhen it comes to costing & estimation, I find that roadmap themes are too high-level to be able to get granular costing of effort required. And since the actual implementation of features can be so far out, the effort required for granular costing is rarely worth it. Instead I find leveraging experienced product & engineering leads with a specific stated team size can usually provide t-shirt sizing (S, M, L) that can be used to have a high-level trade-off discussion of what can realistically fit in this upcoming year vs. not.\nAs an example, Facebook released a 10 year roadmap which mimics the later years of the 5-year roadmap themes that I mentioned in terms of just high-level bullets, though you'll want to have more detail in the 1st and 2nd years than shown here:\nQuarterly OKRs provide an opportunity to concretely define the product outcomes you plan on achieving in the next three months. I like using OKRs, or objectives & key results, because of their specific focus on measurable outcomes. The objective defines what you want to accomplish, usually covering the product functionality or improvements you plan on shipping. And the key results defines the measurable product outcome you expect to achieve, including specific metric lifts you expect to see as a direct result of the product initiatives. These tend to be acquisition, engagement, or monetization metric lifts. But it could be anything worth measuring (increase in net promoter score, reduction in customer support tickets, increase in sales velocity, etc).\nTaking the time to appropriately cost and estimate both the effort it will take to execute the desired product initiatives as well as appropriately forecast the metric lifts is a very important part of quarterly OKR planning. Here you do need enough specificity in the product initiatives including high-level scope in order for engineering to appropriately cost what they will be able to accomplish with a given set of resources assigned to it in the quarter. Similarly, product should develop as accurate of a forecast on the expected metric lift as they can. This is undoubtably a tough exercise, but putting a number out there is important. You should leverage as much past data on how your various initiatives have moved metrics in the past to come up with appropriate proxies. Even though you're estimate will likely be off, having an estimate and seeing how you did against it at the end of the quarter is the only way to tune your product intuition on what kinds of initiatives are in-fact metric-moving initiatives. Without going through this exercise on a quarterly basis, you'll never build this muscle.\nEach quarter your product team should come up with 3-5 such OKRs and these should easily fit on a single slide or single-page document. Having any more than this is usually means a lack of focus for a product team. Of course this list will certainly not cover absolutely every product change you'll end up making in the quarter and that's fine, but this is an important prioritization exercise to rally the team behind the most important efforts as well as the priorities in terms of impact you're team is hoping to have on the product's success.\nAn equally important part of quarterly OKRs is the end-of-quarter post-mortem, when you go through the past quarters OKRs and score them each as either Green (met or exceeded the key results), Yellow (achieved ~70% of your stated key results), or Red (failed to meet the expected key results). As I mentioned, this is where the real learning happens to improve your team's ability to cost and forecast initiatives. Oftentimes you'll miss an initiative because it was delivered late. This serves as a great opportunity to discuss whether the issue was an inaccurate initial forecast or unforeseen challenges and what might you do in the future to improve your estimation. Similarly, you may fail to achieve the metric win you expected. And again, this is a great opportunity to discuss what could have been done differently for next time to try to find initiatives that will in-fact meet their metric expectations. The post-mortem is also a great opportunity to re-asses what you are hearing from customers and the market and ensure that your annual plan still makes sense in light of this. If not, you're encouraged to change your plan for the upcoming quarter to address the new market realities. There is nothing sacred about your annual plan, it was just a guidepost that you should feel free to move from as new market dynamics become apparent.\nAs an example, here is potential OKR for an online consumer website:\nObjective: Redesign the homepage to focus on driving social actions\n- Key Result: Increase social actions (likes, comments, shares) per session by 20%\n- Key Result: Increase homepage weekly active users by 15%\nBi-weekly sprints are the core mechanism by which engineering teams are run. The sprint planning meeting takes the form of your classic agile notion of picking off items from your overall product backlog and adding them to the upcoming sprint's backlog, with the engineer who is going to be responsible for the task directly costing the associated effort and committing to completing the tasks he takes on during the sprint planning process. This includes product features that are planned to be implemented, bugs that will be fixed, as well as any engineering tasks they are also taking on. It's helpful to include all R&D functions in this process, so design also commits to what design deliverables they are going to finish in the upcoming sprint, as well as product committing to various requirement and spec deliverables as well. The output of sprint planning is a single list of prioritized tasks for the upcoming sprint with associated costs & owners. The goal here is to not change the sprint tasks during the sprint in order to allow the team to focus on effectively completing those tasks and avoid randomization and instead only consider changes in the next sprint. The 2-week sprint timeframe is short enough that you can still be very agile but provide enough predictability and focus to engineering teams to make meaningful progress.\nAt the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review to show off the shippable product functionality completed in the sprint as well as a sprint retrospective to look back on how the team faired in sticking to the sprint timeline. A sprint schedule is a probability. And what you want to be doing is always improving your team's ability to accurately forecast to make the probability higher in the future.\nIt's helpful as the first thing in the morning each day to have a quick 15-minute standup with the full R&D team where each individual briefly discusses what they accomplished yesterday, what they are planning on accomplishing today, and if there is anything blocking them from meeting their sprint goals. This allow the team to assess how they are doing against their sprint goals, resolve any bottlenecks, and potentially move around team resources to address those bottlenecks if needed. The goal here is to avoid issues festering for days, resulting in the project getting delayed and instead have an opportunity to address it every 24 hours to keep the team running as efficiently as possible. This in-person live format works better than issues lingering in long unresolved email threads. This is typically run by a scrum master (usually an engineering lead or delegate on the team) who goes around to each team member and ensures each bottleneck is addressed either during or immediately after the standup.\nI've started to see some teams turn this into a Slack/HipChat channel discussion instead of an in-person session. While I like the daily ritual of getting the whole team together in-person, the chat version does work. It's important though to make it a live session so issues can still be immediately addressed.\nIn addition to a daily scrum, it's also helpful to have a daily bug triage process which reviews new bugs, appropriately sets the bug's priority, and assigns the bug to the appropriate engineer. I also encourage you to establish bug SLAs (service level agreements) that define when a bug is expected to be fixed based on it's priority. For example, P0 bugs that are incredibly severe are reason to stop everything else and get the bug fixed immediately. P1 could have an SLA of fixed in production within a week. P2 could be fixed in production within a month. It's best if you can assign someone to go through this task for new bugs on a daily basis in case there are any new P0 bugs that need immediate attention. I've typically seen this done by either an engineering lead, a test lead, or product manager.\nProject Management Tools\nThere are a variety of tools available which are typically used to streamline project management activities.\nI've typically seen annual planning and quarterly OKRs published in a team wiki (like Confluence), in shared documents (like Google Docs), or shared slides (like Google Slides). Since each planning document is never more than a page each, it's pretty easy to keep the full history of past and present versions altogether.\nSprints are most often managed in a full project management tool. Any of the popular project management tools work well, like Atlassian JIRA, Asana, Trello, Wrike, or Basecamp. Some specifically have support for sprint planning and daily standups, enabling you to run your daily standup more efficiently with a scrum board that everyone can see, including Atlassian JIRA and Trello. Pick a tool that your team is familiar with and comfortable using as they'll ideally be in there frequently updating the status of tickets.\nIt's important to remember that there is nothing sacred about the specific intervals references here (annually, quarterly, bi-weekly, daily). You can easily customize these to meet the cadence of your product development cycle and industry dynamics. These cadences though have worked well for me across a variety of desktop, internet, and mobile applications I've built throughout my career.\nI hope this provides an overview of a modern project management process for product managers. While it may look like a lot of project management overhead, the reality is that each of the planning tasks is fairly quick and the output of each planning activity is never more than a single page of roadmap themes, OKRs, prioritized tasks, etc. The overall planning process not only facilitates long-term thinking, course correction, and learning, but is absolutely essential for enabling your team to achieve it's ultimate product vision.\nEnjoyed this essay?\nGet my weekly essays on product management & entrepreneurship delivered to your inbox.\nDec 06, 2016","Following are some of the rules which I could think ( & found from other sources) regarding the daily Scrum planning meeting\n- Scrum meeting should be for a small team of 4-8 members. Having a meeting for a bigger team is not beneficial. There is a high risk that it will become a status update.\n- This should be a timeboxed meeting of around 15 minutes.\n- Hold the Daily Scrum in the same place at the same time every work day. The best time for the meeting is first thing in the day so that Team members think about what they did the day before and what they plan to do today.\n- Stand up – Ensure that team members are standing for this meeting. This will ensure that meeting will not exceed the normal duration as people will be eager to sit down. This will also help to focus on the discussion otherwise people may get distracted with email or other “tasks”.\n- Team members should address the Team. This is not a \"Reporting to the Scrum Master\" meeting.\n- If Product Owners are attending the call, they should refrain from asking status. Scrum has a separate meeting for this purpose – Sprint Demo/Review. Status can be obtained from taskboard also.\n- All Team members are required to attend. If for some reason a Team member can't attend in person, the absent member must either attend by telephone or by having another Team member report on their status.\n- Team members must be prompt. Team should start the meeting at the appointed time, regardless of who is present. Any members who are late pay a fine that is donated to a worthy charity!\n- Decide some order for update like start with the person immediately to Scrum Master's left and proceeding counter clockwise around the room until everyone has spoken.\n- Even Scrum Master is not required to attend this meeting. In Scrum Master’s absence or non-availability team should start the meeting.\n- All team members should be present physically and mentally.\no Avoid using cell phones, laptops, tablets etc.\no Team members shouldn’t leave the room after giving the updates. They should remain till the end. o Team members should actively listen and participate in updates from others.\n- Each Team member should respond to the following questions:\no What have you done since the last Daily Scrum regarding this project?\no What will you do between now and the next Daily Scrum meeting to achieve the sprint goals?\no What impedes you from performing your work as effectively as possible?\n- During the meeting only one person talks at a time. Everyone else listens without any side conversations.\n- When a Team member reports something that is of interest to other Team members or needs assistance from other Team members, any Team member can immediately arrange for all interested parties to get together after the Daily Scrum Meeting.\n- Non - Team members are welcome to attend the Daily Scrum Meetings but they are not allowed to talk, make faces or otherwise make their presence in the meeting obtrusive.\n- Bring experienced scrummasters or agile coaches to these meetings who can notice the problems and provide a constructive feedback.\nThese rules are more for new teams who are just beginning to use Scrum. If your team is following scrum for more than one year then you should definitely look into the next version of scrum meeting (scrum 2.0 :D )"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a5a9e809-4cbe-4b44-a967-51b2bdc971ef>","<urn:uuid:cb663230-d2f6-49cd-ab1f-974ddbbb96e4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"比较 Bloom 分类法中的认知领域和学习知识层次结构有什么区别？ How do the cognitive domain levels in Bloom's Taxonomy differ from the hierarchy of knowledge levels?","answer":"The cognitive domain in Bloom's Taxonomy consists of 6 levels (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating) focusing on thinking processes, while the hierarchy of knowledge levels has 4 categories (Factual Knowledge, Conceptual Knowledge, Procedural Knowledge, and Meta-cognitive Knowledge) that describe different types of knowledge content. The cognitive domain emphasizes how information is processed mentally, whereas the knowledge hierarchy describes what kind of knowledge is being dealt with.","context":["Bloom’s Taxonomy: Three Learning Domains 1. Bloom’s Taxonomy - Cognitive Domain - (intellect - knowledge - 'think') An adjusted model of Bloom's Taxonomy (1956) Cognitive Domain was produced by Anderson & Krathwhol in which the levels five and six (synthesis & evaluation) were inverted and all the levels became verbs, suggesting that learning is an active process (Anderson & Krathwohl, A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, 2001). This is why you will see different versions of this Cognitive Domain model. While debate continues as to the order of levels five and six, the revised version is gaining wider acceptance overall. Cognitive Domain Category or 'level' Behavior descriptions Examples of activity to be trained, or demonstration and evidence to be measured 1. Remembering Recall or recognize information Multiple-choice test, recount facts or statistics, recall a process, rules, definitions; quote law or procedure 2.

Bloom's theory advocates this structure and sequence for developing attitude also now commonly expressed in the modern field of personal development as 'beliefs'.

Bloom’s Taxonomy - Psychomotor Domain - (physical - skills - 'do') The Psychomotor Domain was established to address skills development relating to the physical dimensions of accomplishing a task. Because, 'motor' skills extend beyond the originally traditionally imagined manual and physical skills, always consider using this domain, even if you think your environment is covered adequately by the Cognitive and Affective Domains. Whatever the situation, it is likely that the Psychomotor Domain is significant.

The theory was first presented at a Berlin conference 1967, hence you may see Dave's model attributed to 1967 or 1970).","Bloom’s TaxonomyHierarchy of Cognitive Behaviour\nIt is not the facts in the clinician’s head which determines competence: it is how those facts are used, interpreted, analysed and creatively synthesized in order to arrive at a formulation of the clinical problems and to plan a response.\nFundamental to our teaching and assessment in the Department therefore is an explicit recognition that clinical education goes beyond the memorisation and recall of facts (or mere recognition of physical signs). As educators and assessors, we need at all times to strive to stimulate these higher order cognitive processes. Bloom’s taxonomy is a useful way in which to conceptualise these processes.\nA group of educational psychologists led by Benjamin Bloom worked for eight years on a project to classify the thinking behaviours which underlie learning. They classified these under three major headings: the cognitive (knowledge), affective (attitudinal) and psychomotor (skills-based) domains. This work was completed in 1956.\nAll three domains are clearly important in our outcomes and deserve assessment. However, for the purposes of this essay, it is assessment of the cognitive domain, which is sub-classified into six levels, which is most pertinent.\nThe diagram below illustrates the hierarchy of cognitive behaviours according to Bloom and as revised by Anderson et al. (Adapted from Schultz L)\nIn tutorials, and above all in assessments – whether clinical or written – we need to move off the Remembering or Knowledge base and explicitly encourage and test the higher order skills.\nNot all authorities agree that the hierarchy is strictly linear as suggested as above. The modified version below, for instance, suggests that the top three levels are more or less of equal rank.\nThis is of major importance in designing exams. True-false MCQ questions and conventional OSCE stations are notorious for their dumbing-down effect on assessment. Either one knows it or one doesn’t; either one can remember how to do it or one can’t. Properly designed assessments, including well-structured multiple choice questions (not one right and four wrong, but five plausible answers of which one is somewhat more appropriate than the others), and clinical exams which draw out thinking and analysis, and not just mechanical actions, explicitly address as many of these levels as possible.\nClearly effective medical practice is entirely based on the use of all 6 levels of the pyramid. Yes, the doctor needs:\n- To remember the basic facts.\nBut beyond that, he or she has to:\n- Understand the significance of those facts, and their interrelatedness.\n- Apply them in order to solve to real-life problems.\n- Analyse everything from a patient’s symptoms to their laboratory results.\n- Evaluate several plausible diagnoses to decide which is most likely, or decide which of several alternative treatments is most appropriate in a particular case.\n- Combine knowledge and experience from multiple sources (numerous patients, textbooks, journals, clinical meetings)into a high-order schema which will equip him or her to deal with future patients more effectively.\ni.e. Bloom’s taxonomy in action!\nThe following material is adapted from Fisher D.\nOne can construct a further hierarchy of 4 levels of knowledge as follows:\n|Factual Knowledge||The basic facts required in order to solve problems||\n|Conceptual Knowledge||The interrelationships among the facts that enable them to function together within a larger structure||\n|Procedural Knowledge||How and when to perform particular procedures, such as investigations, treatment, etc||\n|Meta- cognitive Knowledge||Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one’s own cognition.||\nIndeed, it is possible to construct a two-dimensional grid in which Bloom’s 6 levels are linked to the hierarchy of 4 knowledge levels:\n|Knowledge Dimension||The Cognitive Process Dimension|\n|Meta-Cognitive Knowledge||Appropriate Use||Execute||Construct||Achieve||Action||Actualise|\nProceed to Deep and surface learning"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:121ea1fe-0361-4874-9bc9-cb2e5301b7bc>","<urn:uuid:3611ef01-f8a1-48a8-ba68-79e12e72ba00>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the limitations of OCR keyword searches in historical research, and how does modern OCR data extraction technology attempt to overcome similar challenges?","answer":"OCR keyword searches in historical research have significant limitations. First, OCR often fails to properly recognize characters in historical documents, especially with 18th-century texts using the long 's' that looks like 'f'. Additionally, poor quality prints or scans can prevent OCR from decoding words correctly. Modern OCR data extraction technology addresses these challenges through several processes: document pre-processing to check and correct image quality issues, advanced character identification that divides documents into sections and zones, data validation to increase extraction accuracy, and human-in-the-loop verification for flagged documents. These technologies combine OCR with computer vision and natural language processing to improve accuracy in text recognition and data extraction.","context":["What was advertised in a colonial American newspaper 250 years ago today?\n“SOLOMON SOLOMONS … A fmall Affortment of JEWELERY.”\nEarlier this week NPR commentator Cokie Roberts caused quite a hullabaloo when she suggested that historians had significantly inflated the frequency of advertisements for abortion providers that appeared in nineteenth-century newspapers. Roberts stated, “There are many articles by abortion rights proponents who claim the procedure was so common that newspapers advertised providers. Look, I did a search of nineteenth-century newspapers and couldn’t find them.” Historians quickly responded via Twitter, with Dr. Lauren MacIvor Thompson, a specialist in the history of medicine, public health, and the law, in the forefront with a tweet thread that corrected the record.\nIn addition to addressing content, historians representing various other fields within the discipline addressed the flaws in Roberts’s methodology. Roberts, a pundit rather than a trained historian, apparently did not realize that the absence of results generated by keyword searches does not mean that the historical evidence was not there. Like many of my colleagues, I pointed out two relevant issues. Both are so fundamental that I discuss them with undergraduate students in introductory and upper-level history courses on the first day that we begin working with databases of historical newspapers.\nFirst, keyword searches have many shortcomings, especially because OCR (optical character recognition) is so imperfect. I explain to my students that computers are often, for lack of a better word, stupid. They do not always recognize or make sense of visual images (photographs or digital scans of historical sources) as effectively as people do. Computer software lacks the necessary creativity and flexibility. This is especially true when working with eighteenth-century printed sources that use the long “s” that looks like an “f” to twenty-first-century eyes. What human readers recognize as “Assortment,” for instance, looks like “Affortment” via OCR. (See Solomon Solomons’s advertisement from the June 7, 1769, edition of the Georgia Gazette.) Yet the long “s” is not the only pitfall for OCR. If the original printed words were not clear or subsequent remediation (photographs, microfilm, digital scans) was poorly done, then OCR has no chance of decoding the words on the page.\nSecond, when doing historical research it is necessary to think like the people from the period, especially to use the words they would have used rather than impose modern terminology. Context matters. Roberts, lacking an historian’s understanding of the period she investigated, apparently did not choose her keywords carefully or appropriately. When I train my undergraduate students to serve as guest curators for the Slavery Adverts 250 Project, I underscore that they must look for words beyond just “slave” (and that they have to examine every advertisement because keyword searches will exclude MANY advertisements that belong in the project). In addition to “slave,” they must also keep their eyes open for “negro,” “mulatto,” and “wench,” some of the words most often used to describe enslaved men, women, and children even when the word “slave” did not appear in an advertisement.\nTo demonstrate the shortcomings of keyword searches, I like to provide a practical example of an advertisement that I know exists yet a keyword search will not produce. Consider an advertisement from the June 7, 1769, edition of the Georgia Gazette. I previously downloaded the entire issue via Readex’s America’s Historical Newspapers database. I know that it contains an advertisement for jewelry placed by Solomon Solomons. Say that I want to know the extent of Solomons’s advertising campaign in 1769. Doing a keyword search with his last name would be a good place to start. To make the search as efficient as possible, I set several parameters. I limit the date under consideration to 1769. I restrict the newspapers to be searched to the Georgia Gazette. Then I enter “Solomons” as the keyword. This yields only two results: Solomons’s advertisement when it appeared in the May 24 and May 31 editions, but not the June 7 edition. This certainly tells me more about the frequency that Solomons advertised, but it did not yield an advertisement that I already knew existed! The digitized image of the advertisement is fairly clear (especially compared to many others), yet it appears that just enough ink bled through from the other side of the page to trick the OCR into overlooking this advertisement when doing a keyword search for “Solomons.”\nThis particular instance is not as “fraught,” to invoke Roberts’s term, as advertisements placed by abortion providers in the nineteenth century, but it is a practical example of how technology cannot substitute for historical expertise and appropriate methodologies for conducting research with primary sources. As many other historians have done in recent days, I encourage reporters and pundits to call on trained historians rather than make misleading assertions based on incomplete understandings of the past and shoddy research methods.\n This quotation comes from Thompson’s tweet thread. NPR has updated the original audio and transcript to excise Robert’s incorrect and misleading assertions.","Table of Contents\n- How Does OCR Data Extraction Work?\n- The Processes Behind Intelligent Data Extraction with OCR\n- Top 3 Examples of Data Extraction\n- Final Words\nYour productivity suffers from working with a lot of documentation. The statistics say that every day, 46% of employees spend their time on inefficient paper-related tasks. This calls for more sophisticated solutions to enhance these processes and prevent companies from descending into the chaos of paperwork.\nFor this reason, virtually every modern business has adopted intelligent data extraction to improve their sustainability and ease all the document-related tasks. To keep up with this trend, companies learn to extract meaningful information from the images of scanned documents and other textual data. Big players, like Amazon or Google, are putting their efforts into developing cutting-edge AI technologies based on computer vision in ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to handle the task.\nMore specifically, breakthroughs were made in the narrow field of handwritten text recognition with OCR (Optical Character Recognition). This technology has already facilitated the capabilities AI brings to the business world, using deep learning methods. The advances in deep learning have completely transformed the way in which data can be extracted, processed, and thus become complete. And now there’s a document data extraction task for it to solve.\nHow Does OCR Data Extraction Work?\n93% of businesses report having trouble locating papers and information. And while there used to be a lot of handwritten documentation to manage key business activities, digital documents have successfully replaced it thanks to OCR data extraction.\nData extraction relies on automated solutions to turn unstructured data into a format that humans can easily process. When working with scanned documents, there are several types of data that can be extracted.\nTypes of Data for OCR and Data Extraction\nFirst, it’s the text data itself. Extracting text from scanned documents is arguably the most pivotal task in this process. Although it may appear simple, this technique is quite challenging since scanned papers are frequently displayed in a visual format. The type of text, the complexity of the handwriting, and the quality of the scanned document also add to the difficulty of OCR data extraction. But in the end, we are able to convert image data into text data, which can be used for further analysis and various applications across industries.\nSecond come the tables and figures. Because tables are great for structuring information and are easy to understand, they are the most often used method for data storage. OCR, however, is not the only technology needed to properly extract tables. Aside from the text, there’s also visual data in tables, such as lines and other elements. This is when computer vision comes in handy, as it helps structure this data for further processing and achieve high precision in table data extraction.\nRetrieving data from figures on a scanned page, however, is no less important. It’s the third type of data in this process. For example, pie charts or bar charts typically bear critical information for the scanned document. To partly extract data from images like barcodes or QR codes, a decent data extraction method should be able to infer information from the legends and numbers in a pie chart.\nThe third type of data one can deal with in data extraction is a name-value pair, aka key-value pairs (KVPs). We frequently use this alternate format to store data in documents. KVPS represent two different values at the same time. For example, color is the “key” and purple is the “value.” In contrast to tabular representations, KVPs frequently exist in illegible formats. Sometimes, they can be even partially handwritten. Therefore, identifying the underlying structures to automatically accomplish KVP data extraction is continuous research.\nData Extraction Technologies\nThe process of obtaining information from a source (i.e., documents, files, databases, or websites) is called data extraction. You can carry out the process manually or automatically. More specifically, this task requires locating certain pieces of data from a digital document.\nSay you have an ID card scan or an invoice, and you need to retrieve some information from it in digital format. OCR provides a required set of tools to recognize printed or handwritten text in a scanned identity document. But before carrying out data extraction, one needs to retrieve the digital data. OCR helps here by processing the pixels in the ID card and converting them into digital format. After that, data extraction locates the labels, like name or date of birth, and seizes the information adjacent to or below it.\nAt this step, you’re probably wondering whether it’s always necessary to use OCR for data extraction. In some cases, using OCR for this process is not necessary. Such documents can simply go through the data extraction process. For instance, it can be a PDF file. Because it was created from a digital file, it already includes the digital text layer. Therefore, the textual data for OCR is already accessible, and it is not essential to utilize it.\nBut for most cases, intelligent data extraction relies on two crucial processes in deep learning, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP):\nData extraction using OCR is essentially the process of turning images of text into machine-readable format (i.e., machine-encoded text). However, OCR extraction goes hand-in-hand with other methods, such as computer vision. For example, box and line detection extract tables and KVPs.\nNatural language processing is responsible for analyzing the meaning of the converted text. The fundamental advances underlying the data-extraction pipeline are closely related to the developments in deep learning. They made significant contributions to the CV and NLP sectors.\nOCR can locate letters, numbers, and other characters within an image’s pixels, regardless of the format. Yet, don’t confuse this technology with ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition), which works with handwritten text only. The pixels that resemble letters and words are recognized by OCR, which then uses those pixels to generate digital words and characters. This is how optical character recognition and data extraction complement one another.\nTherefore, the information from the documents is scanned into IT systems for further examination thanks to OCR with deep learning. Such systems can identify pertinent concepts in the generated text, while NLP enhances this process. All in all, intelligent OCR technology benefits machine learning analytics necessary for the items’ acceptance or refusal.\nThe Processes Behind Intelligent Data Extraction with OCR\nNow that we have covered the key points, it’s time to comprehend the relationship between OCR and data extraction.\nOCR enables computer software to decipher the text on a scanned document. When this technology is used to automate the data entry activities for corporate applications, it's referred to as OCR data capture. These enterprise systems include interfaces for document recognition, scanning, data verification, and export. In addition, automation with an OCR algorithm covers workflow management and offers monitoring capabilities for keeping track of huge amounts of data and documents.\nThe usual OCR data capture workflow, including both OCR and data extraction, is often known as the process of transforming a document to live data that is ready to use. This process consists of the following phases:\n- Identifying metadata: Choosing appropriate data to extract is challenging if the source system is poorly documented. By using automated metadata management, you can import it, which is the first step to addressing the issue. After that, it can be annotated, and you can create an extraction plan separate from the transaction processing program.\n- Document pre-processing: At this stage, the main focus is on the quality of the scanned image. Here, the OCR engine automatically checks for and corrects mistakes.\n- Document classification: Now, it’s important to identify the format of the scanned document (i.e., JPG, PNG, PDF, TIFF, etc.), and its structure (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured).\n- Character Identification: The document should now be divided into sections, subsections, tables, or zones. Once they have been separated, the critical characters or identifiers are found.\n- Data validation: By finding errors in the extracted data, it is possible to increase the accuracy of data extraction and identify any problems that need to be fixed.\n- Human-in-the-loop in ML:Any flagged documents should be examined for the most precise data extraction model. The software pushes the extracted and cleaned data to the OCR database or exports it in a variety of formats after that. IDP processes may also be used to transform documents into JSON, XML, PDF, and other forms.\nBusinesses heavily rely on OCR and data extraction because it gives them a method to access data that is kept in a variety of forms. By extracting it, companies may utilize this data for a number of purposes, including marketing, research, and decision-making.\nBesides, data extraction brings automation to their core business activities, thus boosting productivity and informed decision-making. For automatic extraction, you can choose an OCR data extraction software.\nTop 3 Examples of Data Extraction\nThere are various instances of data extraction, but a few typical ones are OCR data extraction from databases, data extraction from web pages, and data extraction from documents.\nThe method of obtaining data from web pages and other data sources. Pricing, product, and contact details can be collected through this process. Web scraping is one of the most efficient strategies you can employ in your company to develop a data-driven mindset.\nImportant information is extracted from large databases as part of data mining. Data mining is a crucial process since it enables companies to make far better selections and take their relationships with the clients to the next level.\nA form of database called data warehousing is used to store data from several sources. Data warehouses play a pivotal role because they enable firms to compile data from many sources and store it in one location. As a result, sharing data with other applications is made simpler.\nOver half of the processing time and costs are saved by intelligent data extraction. If you want to streamline your document processing procedures, automation will do for you.\nBusinesses may take the right first step toward building an enhanced data management strategy thanks to OCR data extraction. It also boosts automation process for your company. Additionally, machine learning makes it possible for intelligent data capture software to train itself to distinguish between various data kinds and classify data, speeding and improving the process over time.\nIf you wish to test your strengths in creating your own OCR model for data extraction, use professionally annotated data for model training. Reach out to Label Your Data to see the solutions we have for your OCR model and data extraction task!\nWhat is the best OCR method for data extraction?\nA good method of performing data extraction using OCR is to encode text from a scanned image into machine-readable format. OCR is frequently used in combination with computer vision techniques like box and line detection. Presently, some of the best OCR service providers are Google API and Deep Reader.\nHow do I extract data from a document?\nTo extract meaningful data from a handwritten or scanned document, you deal with pre-processing first. After that, classify the type of document you are working with. Then, perform data extraction using OCR to convert text and other elements into a machine-readable format. Don’t skip the data validation stage and human review.\nHow to work with an OCR engine?\nAn OCR engine functions by using templates it has for various fonts and text picture patterns. The OCR program compares text images to its internal database using pattern-matching algorithms. The process is referred to as optical word recognition if it matches the text word for word.\nGet Notified ⤵\nReceive weekly email each time we publish something new:\nGet Instant Data Annotation Quote\nWhat type of data do you need to annotate?Get My Quote ▶︎"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6f74f415-366c-41bb-8125-d0ac5ca02d9e>","<urn:uuid:b60844bb-af4f-4479-bf86-48cd4155dbe6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the rules and procedures differ between a running back-quarterback exchange and a kickoff return in terms of possession changes and potential penalties? Please provide a systematic comparison.","answer":"In a running back-quarterback exchange, the focus is on maintaining possession through proper technique at the mesh point, with potential fumbles being the main risk if the running back reaches for the ball instead of creating a proper pocket. For kickoffs, there are more complex possession rules: the receiving team can choose a touchback if the ball reaches the endzone (starting at their 20-yard line), and the kicking team can regain possession after 10 yards on an onside kick. Penalties are specifically defined for kickoffs, including 5-yard penalties for position violations before the kick and 20-yard penalties if the ball goes out of bounds untouched, while handoff exchanges focus more on proper execution to prevent turnovers rather than specific penalty rules.","context":["If you’re a running back receiving the handoff, you have an opportunity to set your team up for success. In order to do so, there are three things you should be aware of:\n- Mesh Point\nWhen the quarterback receives the ball, you should step toward him to receive the handoff. The moment where the running back and the quarterback come together is called the mesh point. This needs to be well timed in order for the handoff to be smooth. The quarterback and running back must practice this to make sure they are in sync.\nThe pocket is the space that you will provide for the quarterback to place the ball. This pocket should be wide. Your elbow closest to the quarterback is up and flexed at a 90-degree angle, so that your forearm is parallel with both the ground (vertically) and your upper chest (horizontally). On that hand, your palm should face the ground.\nThe arm that is farthest from the quarterback will be placed near your belly or waist. Your elbow will again be flexed at a 90-degree angle, so that your forearm runs across your body parallel to the ground. The palm on this hand should be facing up. The space between your arms is called the pocket and leaves plenty of room in the middle of your chest for the quarterback to place the ball. As the quarterback places the ball in the pocket, you should clamp down on the ball to secure it.\nYou also need to have proper posture. Once the ball is snapped to the quarterback, step forward with your eyes toward the line of scrimmage or the direction you are moving based on the play. Your knees should be bent and your arms in proper pocket position. Both the quarterback and the running back need to be on the same horizontal plane with the football and the pocket. You should have your head up, open chest, nice flexion in the hips, be on the balls of your feet and ready to make a play.\nFLAWS TO AVOID\nOne flaw to avoid is in the positioning of your arms when creating your pocket. As you get close to the quarterback, make sure the elbow closest to the quarterback is not down. When this happens, as the quarterback puts the ball inside the pocket, your elbow can be in the way, hitting the ball and sending it on the ground.\nA second potential flaw during the exchange from the quarterback to the running back is when you actually reach for the football during the handoff. You need to create a large pocket with proper arm positioning and proper posture. You should only close your arms on the ball once the ball is placed into the pocket. Reaching out for the ball to take it from the quarterback often results in a fumble.\nAs a running back, make sure you know the three keys to a successful exchange. Proper mesh point, pocket and posture. Through repetition you can create a clean handoff that can help eliminate turnovers and lead to an efficient running play. Now, learn how to run the ball post-handoff.","Activities Sports & Athletics Football 101 - The Basics of Beginning a Football Game Share PINTEREST Email Print David Madison/Digital Vision/Getty Images Sports & Athletics Football Basics Playing & Coaching Best of Football Plays & Formations College Football Baseball Basketball Bicycling Billiards Bodybuilding Bowling Boxing Car Racing Cheerleading Cricket Extreme Sports Golf Gymnastics Ice Hockey Martial Arts Professional Wrestling Skateboarding Skating Paintball Soccer Swimming & Diving Table Tennis Tennis Track & Field Volleyball Other Activities Learn More By James Alder James Alder is an expert on the game of American football, blogs for The New York Times, and appears on radio shows. our editorial process James Alder Updated April 04, 2017 Prior to the start of each football game, the captains from each team and the head referee meet at the center of the field for the coin toss. In the NFL, the captain is a team-appointed position that designates certain players as leaders on and off of the playing field. Teams are allowed to name up to six players as captains. The team that wins the coin toss has the option of starting the game by kicking the ball to the opposing team or receiving the kickoff themselves. After the team that won the coin loss selects to kick or receive, the other team has the opportunity to pick which goal they would like to defend. The team that kicks off to start the game will receive the ball at the start of the second half. Type of Kicks The game officially begins when one of the teams kicks the ball off to the other. In the NFL, teams kick the ball from their own 35-yard line. Onside Kick: A common variation of a traditional kick is an onside kick, where the kicking team will kick the ball a short distance in an attempt to regain possession of the ball. On a kickoff, once the ball has traveled ten total yards it is a live ball and can be picked up for possession by either team. Squib Kick: A low, bouncing kick is called a squib kick. Although a squib kick typically gives the receiving team better field position than a regular kick, a squib kick is sometimes used to avoid giving up a potentially long return, as well as to use up a valuable amount of clock time. Procedure The receiving team must catch the ball and try to advance it as far back toward the kicking team as possible, or if the kickoff advances for enough, the receiving team can elect for a touchback, which occurs when a kickoff or punt enters the end zone and is not advanced beyond the goal line by a player of the receiving team. In this situation, the receiving team gets the ball to start their drive on their own twenty-yard line. A fair catch may also occur, in which a player on the receiving team literally waves his arms, and in turns waives his entitlement to attempt a return run, but he then cannot be touched by the kicking team. This helps to avoid fumbles in certain situations. If a touchback is not taken, then the kickoff play ends when the player with the ball is knocked to the ground (tackled), or makes it all the way to the kicking team's end zone for a touchdown. The spot where the kick returner was tackled becomes the line of scrimmage, and this is where the offense will begin their possession. The line of scrimmage is a term for the place the ball is spotted before a play is run. Once this starting point is established, the offensive squad of the receiving team will come in and try to move the ball toward the opposition's end zone. Returning the Kick On a kickoff, the receiving team sets up on the opponent’s 45-yard line. There are typically a couple players positioned deep around the goal line that will be responsible for catching the kick and the return. After catching the kick, these players will try to make it as far upfield as they can before being tackled or forced out of bounds. The other players on the receiving team that are not returning the kick are used as blockers. Penalties Penalties are in place for various infractions on the kickoff, such as a player violating his position restrictions prior to the kick (5-yard penalty), or if the ball goes out of bounds before touching a player (20 yards or placed at receiving team's 40-yard line, whichever is farther)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff813308-f978-42fe-8577-1a04fadaa75d>","<urn:uuid:814f37d9-3e0c-45ae-9ad2-79c77b8c3ee2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello, can you tell me who was the creative mind behind the shadow vacuum effect in the 'Radar Detector' music video? I am interested in innovative video effects.","answer":"The shadow vacuum effect in the 'Radar Detector' music video was Darwin Smith's own idea.","context":["Darwin Smith of Darwin Deez on his videos and his informal agenda as an artist\nDarwin Deez (due at Larimer Lounge tonight) came to the attention of wider and wider audiences relatively early in the band's career with the release of its singles \"Constellations\" and \"Radar Detector.\" The videos for both songs revealed a band both eccentric, quirky and capable of writing the kind of catchy pop songs with smart lyrics, the likes of which we haven't seen enough of since the 1980s.\nMusically, the act is often compared vaguely to \"classic rock\" bands, but the vibe is more like early solo Donald Fagen, with a much more lighthearted sound and playfulness than some guitar rock band. If anything, there's a bit of R&B and reggae-inspired New Wave in the sound of Darwin Deez but without seeming like a throwback. We recently caught up Darwin Smith, the band's founder and frontman and spoke with him about the band's origin, shows and videos and his agenda as a songwriter.\nWestword:How did you come to adopt the moniker \"Darwin Deez,\" and how would you describe the band Creaky Boards?\nDarwin Smith: My best friend and sometimes-bassist in the band, Michelle (aka Mash Deez), gave me the name. I felt it was authentic and also stylized in a way that was fun for people. Playing in Creaky Boards was extremely educational and fear-reducing. Watching Andrew, Creaky's leader and sometimes-Deez-bassist, manage, book and promote the band stateside and overseas was a rare, cool, perfect experience for me at the time.\nHow did you meet the current members of your band, and what do you feel each of them contributes to the project?\nGreg [drums] and Cole [guitar], I met working at a vegan restaurant called Angelica Kitchen in NYC. Andrew I met on the Monday night Anti-folk open mike scene hosted by Lach. Greg is a pillar of emotional stability, and he keeps the beat. Cole adds flamboyance and style to our enterprise. And Andrew speaks with the purest rationality in all situations, takes brilliant photos and journals our experiences in rich detail for the Deez blog.\nYou're known for your signature dance moves as a live performer. How did dance become such an important part of your show, and what dancers have you admired or appreciated over the years?\nIt just felt right. It felt fun and like it hadn't been done before. Although I did steal it a bit from my friend Jacob Ciocci's band, Extreme Animals. So he's a dance inspiration. Very funny on the social dance floor. Michael Jackson is another huge inspiration. I've studied very closely his '94 HBO broadcast of the Dangerous Tour from Bucharest. He actually had a very small repertoire of go-to moves. That broadcast is really what should have been watched by everyone when he died instead of This Is It.\nWas Miles Crawford thinking of your live show in any way when he came up with the treatments for the \"DNA\" music video or did you give Joshua Pelatzky any direction on his choreography?\nActually I think Miles had So You Think You Can Dance in mind when he made the \"DNA\" video. I know that show is in his heart in a way. I didn't direct either Miles or Josh.\nThe video for \"Radar Detector\" has some really innovative visual elements. Who came up with the idea for vacuuming up your shadow and that string of postcards around your head and Charlene Deguzman's head? What inspired the idea for someone being good for you in a relationship being like a radar detector?\nThe shadow-vac was my idea. The camera-hat-used-to-produce-scotch-taped-panorama was an idea Ace Norton found online. The idea for the metaphor was probably inspired by... I can't place it, actually... I was -- and am -- really into clear, simple metaphors, one per song, that haven't been used before. I know I got the idea to write that way from somewhere but I can't recall exactly. Usually I know the answer to questions like that though.\nHow much involvement did you have in the creative side of the video for \"Constellations,\" and did you come up with the idea of connecting the freckles on that girl's arm with a pen? It also seems like it might be what one might imagine the backstage side of Carl Sagan's show Cosmos might be like if you could be there. Did that have any influence on the type of video you made for that?\nI had very little input on the \"Constellations\" video. It was all Terri Timely. They are great. Carl Sagan/Cosmos was definitely the inspiration for their proposal."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:26cd89c7-155e-4aff-91e4-678b014b7a01>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey fellow parents! 😊 What's the difference between how anxiety presents in stroke patients vs depressed teens? Curious about the symptoms!","answer":"In stroke patients, anxiety manifests as an oppressed state with persistent depression, fears, and obsessive fixation on their illness and future concerns. For teenagers with depression, the symptoms appear differently - they may sulk, get into trouble at school, be negative or grouchy, feel misunderstood, complain of feeling sick, refuse to go to school, cling to a parent/caregiver, or excessively worry about a parent dying.","context":["Introduction. WHO experts point to the urgency of the problem of cardiovascular diseases, among which the first places are occupied by cerebral strokes (CS). With CS there are significant changes in the socio-psychological activities of the patient and the personal psychological characteristics of the individual due. Such changes provoke the development of certain psychological disorders, which are characterized by an oppressed state, a persistent depressive state, the development of anxieties and fears, obsessive fixation on the transferred disease and worries about one's future, etc. That's why, the study of psychological characteristics of patients after СS is a relevant problem of great importance, which determined the direction of our research.\nThe aim: To investigate and analyze the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients after CS.\nMaterials and methods. Conducted a randomized controlled single-center prospective study case-control, which is based on the analysis of the results of psychological study of 300 patients after CS (main group) and 200 people of the control group for the period 2022-2023. The studied groups were randomized by age and gender. To study the psychological characteristics of patients after CS, we used two methods of diagnosing psychological conditions: the self-esteem scale of Spielberg Ch. D. and Khanin Yu.L. and the depression scale of Balashova T.I.\nResults. Probably (p<0.001) among the subjects of the main group compared to the control, a significantly higher frequency of occurrence of medium and moderate levels of reactive anxiety (RA), personal anxiety (PA) and levels of depression (LD) was determined, in contrast to low, which was more often detected among the persons control group. It was determined that the levels of RA, PA and depression were reliably significantly higher in the main group compared to the control group and characterized the presence of fairly significant moderate anxiety and mild depression of situational or neurotic origin.\nConclusion. It has been proven probable (p<0.001) confirmation of the influence of an CS on the development of high levels of anxiety (both RA and PA) and depression.\nWHO. Noncommunicable diseases. 2018 Jun 01.

About 11 percent of adolescents have a depressive disorder by age 18 according to the National Comorbidity Survey. Girls are more likely than boys to experience depression. The risk for depression increases as a child gets older. According to the World Health Organization, major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability among Americans age 15 to 44. Because normal behaviors vary from one childhood stage to another, it can be difficult to tell whether a child who shows changes in behavior is just going through a temporary “phase” or is suffering from depression.\n• People believed that children could not get depression. Teens with depression were often dismissed as being moody or difficult.\n• It wasn’t known that having depression can increase a person’s risk for heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases.\n• Today’s most commonly used type of antidepressant medications did not exist. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted from the work of the late researcher Julius Axelrod, who defined the action of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) in mood disorders.\n• We now know that youth who have depression may show signs that are slightly different from the typical adult symptoms of depression. Children who are depressed may complain of feeling sick, refuse to go to school, cling to a parent or caregiver, or worry excessively that a parent may die. Older children and teens may sulk, get into trouble at school, be negative or grouchy, or feel misunderstood.\n• Findings from large-scale trials are helping doctors and their patients make better individual treatment decisions. For example, the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study found that combination treatment of medication and psychotherapy works best for most teens with depression.\n• The Treatment of SSRI-resistant Depression in Adolescents study found that teens who did not respond to a first antidepressant medication are more likely to get better if they switch to a treatment that includes both medication and psychotherapy.\n• The Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters study found that a new treatment approach that includes medication plus a specialized psychotherapy designed specifically to reduce suicidal thinking and behavior may reduce suicide attempts in severely depressed teens.\n• Depressed teens with coexisting disorders such as substance abuse problems are less likely to respond to treatment for depression. Studies focusing on conditions that frequently co-occur and how they affect one another may lead to more targeted screening tools and interventions\n• Although antidepressants are generally safe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has placed a warning label on all antidepressant medications. The warning says there is an increased risk of suicidal thinking or attempts in youth taking antidepressants. Youth and young adults should be closely monitored especially during initial weeks of treatment.\n• Studies focusing on depression in teens and children are pinpointing factors that appear to influence risk, treatment response, and recovery. Given the chronic nature of depression, effective intervention early in life may help reduce future burden and disability.\n• Multi-generational studies have revealed a link between depression that runs in families and changes in brain structure and function. This research is helping to identify early indicators that may lead to better treatment or prevention.\nKeep in Mind\nWith medication, psychotherapy, or combined treatment, most youth with depression can be effectively treated. Youth are more likely to respond to treatment if they receive it early in the course of their illness.\nSource: National Institute of Mental Healthhttp://www.nimh.nih.gov"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cb313ac0-f01f-4c6f-9264-2cd67198333a>","<urn:uuid:9489143f-8c16-4460-88f3-764f373546af>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How does the COL13A1 gene mutation affect patients with congenital myasthenic syndrome type 19, and what are its main symptoms?","answer":"Congenital myasthenic syndrome type 19 caused by COL13A1 gene mutations typically presents with symptoms starting at birth. The main symptoms include bilateral ptosis (drooping eyelids), respiratory difficulties, and facial and axial weakness. Patients may experience breathing problems that can be serious, eating difficulties, and in some cases facial dysmorphisms like ogival palate, low ear implantation, and micrognathia. The severity can vary significantly between patients, with some showing severe symptoms requiring intensive care, while others present with more moderate symptoms. Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors appears to be moderately effective, and some patients have shown good response to a combination of treatments including salbutamol.","context":["- Case report\n- Open Access\nModerate phenotype of a congenital myasthenic syndrome type 19 caused by mutation of the COL13A1 gene: a case report\nJournal of Medical Case Reports volume 16, Article number: 134 (2022)\nCongenital myasthenic syndromes caused by mutations in the COL13A1 gene are very rare and have a phenotype described as severe. We present the first case of congenital myasthenic syndrome described in Algeria and the Maghreb with a new mutation of this gene.\nWe present an 8-year-old Algerian female patient, who presented with a moderate phenotype with bilateral ptosis that fluctuates during the day and has occurred since birth. During the investigation, and despite the very probable congenital origin, we ruled out other diagnoses that could induce pathology of the neuromuscular junction. The genetic study confirmed our diagnosis suspicion by highlighting a new mutation in the COL13A1 gene.\nWe report a case with a mutation of the Col13A1 gene, reported in the Maghreb (North Africa), and whose phenotype is moderate compared with the majority of cases found in the literature.\nThe COL13A1 gene is carried by the short arm of chromosome 10, encoding a protein (Collagen 13 with Alpha 1 chain), and was first described in 2015 . It is implicated in a synaptic form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS type 19 according to the new version of the Gene Table) . The “Collagen 13 Alpha 1 protein” is a transmembrane protein composed of a short intracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a collagen triple-helix ectodomain  . The overall function of this protein is not well known, but a general role in connective tissue function has been suggested . It is essential for the maturation of the neuromuscular junction, and development at the pre- and postsynaptic levels . It also binds directly to the collagen tail of acetylcholinesterase and is believed to promote synaptic regeneration after peripheral nerve damage . The general phenotype described for patients with mutations in the COL13A1 gene is quite severe, with eating difficulties, breathing problems that can be serious, facial and axial weakness, and ptosis; however, few cases of ophthalmoplegia have been reported. Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors appears to be moderately effective. However, actual conclusions on the phenotypic spectrum of this new gene remain limited given the very small number of patients described . We report an Algerian family with an index case, and a similar case presenting a mutation in the COL13A1 gene.\nWe report on an 8-year-old Algerian female patient from a consanguineous marriage in Algeria, with a probably similar case (her maternal cousin, who has had bilateral ptosis since birth but whom we have not examined). Since birth, she has presented with drooping of the eyelids and the notion of double vision in the upwards gaze. These issues fluctuate during the day. Neonatal hypotonia was not noted, nor any delay in motor acquisitions. She has had several episodes of respiratory distress since the age of four, requiring bronchodilator treatment on demand, but has never been in intensive care unit. Functionally, she plays, runs, climbs, and goes down the stairs without difficulties. The baseline neurological examination (in 2018) found bilateral ptosis, a deficit in the orbicularis of the eyelids with limited upward eye movements. There was no dysmorphic syndrome and the prostigmine test was negative. Her myasthenia gravis score was 75/100 and her Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score was 8/39. The course was very stationary, not requiring treatment at this time. Her current myasthenic score is 85/100. Paraclinically, muscle enzymes and lactates were normal, as well as anti-acetylcholine receptor and anti-MuSK antibodies. The electromyography (EMG) examination found decrement in two nerve/muscle pairs (around 20%). The genetic study concluded a false sense mutation of exon 37 of the COL13A1 gene (R675W mutation), a mutation that has not been reported in the literature. This is probably a new mutation of this gene, described for the first time in the Maghreb.\nCMS linked to mutations in the COL13A1 gene (CMS type 19) were described for the first time in three patients from two unrelated families , one of Indian origin and the other European. These three patients share the following clinical characteristics: onset at birth, slight facial dysmorphisms (ogival palate, low ear implantation, and micrognathia), net ptosis, and respiratory impairment (apnea and dyspnea). Two patients did not respond to pyridostigmine (PD) and one patient received a combination [3.4-diaminopyridine (3.4 DAP) and salbutamol]. Two mutations were identified: “c.1171 delG” and “c.523 delG.”\nThe second description (in 2019)  was of a 45-year-old Latin American patient, suffering since birth from a ptosis, dysphagia to solids, and muscular fatigue during effort, as well as difficulty in holding a discussion for more than 10 minutes. His disease progressed very slowly, with the onset of an episode of acute respiratory distress following cholecystectomy. There were no similar cases in the family and he was from a nonconsanguineous marriage but the parents were of the same ethnic origin. There was no dysmorphic syndrome. Low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) EMG showed marked decrement (15%, 50%, and 44%) in several nerve/muscle pairs. He also responded positively to treatment with PD. A new mutation in the Col13A1 gene was identified (c.739C˃T).\nA series of six patients (three European consanguineous families) was also published in 2019 . In all of these patients, symptom onset was early (at birth) with a more severe phenotype: respiratory distress, dysphagia, hypotonia, and ptosis. Four patients presented with delayed walking. Five patients had significant scoliosis with facial dysmorphia (low ear implantation, arched palate, micrognathia). A net decrement was identified in all patients. The evolution was towards aggravation, because it was punctuated by severe respiratory and bulbar crises. PD-based treatment was offered to them with good clinical results. Three new mutations in the Col13A1 gene were identified.\nThe last and largest series was published in May 2019 : 11 unrelated families including 7 consanguineous were studied. They had several ethnic origins (Brazil, Bangladesh, India, USA, Canada, Iran, Qatar, and West African but with a European ancestor). These 16 patients had some phenotypic homogeneity, with an onset at birth of ptosis, respiratory distress, and bulbar involvement. Ophthalmoplegia was less common. Respiratory attacks were seen in half of these patients. Dysmorphic syndrome was observed in 4 out of 16 patients, especially scoliosis. These disorders fluctuated more during childhood than adulthood in this series. PD treatment has given good results, but the combination of 3,4 DAP with salbutamol has markedly improved motor and respiratory function in some patients.\nThe clinical presentation of our patient seems slightly similar to the majority of cases described in the published series. She presented a ptosis that fluctuates during the day, whereas this fluctuation is not constant in the reported series.\nBreathing difficulties remained minimal in our patient (no stay in intensive care), while severe respiratory distress has been described in the series by Dusl et al.  and Rodriguez-Cruz et al. . We did not observe any facial dysmorphia or scoliosis in our patient, whereas the dysmorphic syndrome appears to be predominant in the patient series described above. The very slow evolution of our patient, whose parents currently refuse any treatment, seems to follow the case described by Marquardt in 2019, with a lighter phenotype where the patient did not request a neurological assessment until their mid-forties as the symptoms were so discreet. On the contrary, a patient in the series  died at the age of 8 from respiratory failure. Important differences in phenotypic severity were noticed in two patients from the same family in this series (intra- and interfamily phenotypic variability). Treatment with salbutamol alone has been tried in two patients from the same series (Dusl et al. ) with very good clinical improvement. This would suggest its indication, without associating it with 3.4 DAP.\nWe report a rare case of CMS with a previously unidentified mutation of the COL13A1 gene. This phenotype shares several characteristics with patients previously identified and described in other series. The genetic study and clinical examination of the affected cousin would help us better to understand this phenotype, which appears to be moderate. This result, the first in the Maghreb, and of which less than 30 cases have been published worldwide, further widens the genetic heterogeneity of CMS.\nAvailability of data and materials\nCongenital myasthenic syndromes\nQuantitative myasthenia gravis\nLogan CV, Cossins J, Rodríguez-Cruz PM, Parry DA, Maxwell S, Martínez-Martínez P, et al.

{"question":"Could you explain step by step what happens with my retirement benefits if I leave my job at the University of Illinois after working there for more than 20 years?","answer":"If you leave after working more than 20 years, you have several important benefits. You are fully vested in the retirement plan and eligible for retirement payouts. Most significantly, your health insurance will be paid for by the State of Illinois when you collect your retirement. Due to this substantial benefit, it's usually advisable to leave your money in the SURS system even if you change employers. Additionally, you've earned significant service credits which generally translate to a higher retirement payout. You can either draw your retirement income if you're 62 or older, or you can delay drawing your retirement income which can boost your ultimate payout.","context":["Updated: Sep 29\nAs an employee of the University of Illinois or other public institution in the State of Illinois, you participate in SURS. The State Universities Retirement System manages your retirement investments, which you contribute approximately 8% of your gross salary during your years employed at the University.\nHaving had ties with the University of Illinois for nearly three decades, I have known many SURS participants. These participants are in various stages of their retirement planning. Some are diligently working towards receiving their full pension, others have retired, and some have left the system to pursue new career goals.\nNavigating your ideal path with SURS is based on your individual circumstances and can be a complicated topic. Many have reached out to me for advice regarding how SURS fits in with their overall retirement plan, and most of these conversations began with the question “I’m leaving the University of Illinois. What should I do with my pension?”\nI’m leaving the University of Illinois. What should I do with my pension?\nIf you leave the University, you will need to decide whether to leave your retirement investments at SURS or move your money to a different plan. The answer depends on several factors, including: how many service credits did you accumulate while employed at U of I, what type of pension plan had you selected at the start of your employment, and what future employment opportunities might you have within another public institution in the State of Illinois.\nThis article will address the most important questions you’ll need to understand if you plan to leave or have left employment at the University of Illinois.\nHow long have you worked at the University of Illinois?\nIf you have worked for the University of Illinois for more than 10 years full time, you are vested in the retirement plan (5 years if you started prior to 2011). This means that you may be eligible for a retirement payout depending on when you started working and the age you plan to retire. The most robust retirement benefits generally go to those who retire with 20 plus years of employment or those who retire after age 62.\nThe more years you have worked means the more service credits you have earned, which generally translates to a higher retirement payout. The details are more nuanced than the guidelines here, but the concept is that if you have worked at the University for more than 10 years you are probably eligible for a pension payment or the ability to create an annuity with your contributions and investment earnings.\nSURS has a benefit estimator that can forecast your retirement payout. Use this calculator before you decide whether to cash out your pension.\nIf you worked more than 20 years, your health insurance should be paid for by the State of Illinois when you collect your retirement. If that is the case, it is usually a good idea to leave your money with the SURS system even if you change employers. Health insurance is a large expense in retirement and you wouldn’t want to miss out on this significant benefit.\nAre you in the traditional pension, the portable pension, or the retirement savings plan (previously the self managed plan)?\nIf you participate in the traditional pension plan or the portable pension plan and worked at least 10 years, the retirement payment you have accrued is robust and would be hard to replace by withdrawing your money (aka separation refund) and investing somewhere else. Further, you were probably not participating in social security working at the University, so having a steady income from a pension during retirement is probably a good idea.\nIf you are in the retirement saving plan (formerly self managed plan), the decision depends on how close you are to retirement and whether you have at least 20 years to get the health insurance premiums paid. If you have achieved the required number of years for health insurance, it probably is best to leave your money with SURS. However, if you only have a few years at SURS in the retirement savings plan and do not plan to continue working with a public university in Illinois, you may want to consider moving your retirement to an IRA or your new employers’ 401k plan.\nYou can leave the University of Illinois and choose whether to draw your retirement income if you have sufficient service credit (10 or more years) and have reached retirement age (62 or over). Or, you can leave and work somewhere else and delay drawing your retirement income. Waiting to draw your retirement income can boost your ultimate payout. You can estimate these benefits on the SURS website.\nWhat if I do take my money with me when I change jobs, how much do I get?\nUnder the traditional pension plan your separation refund is a return of your contributions and includes interest credited, but not in excess of 4.5%. Any interest previously credited to your account in excess of that amount will be forfeited.\nUnder the portable pension plan if you have less than ten years of service credit, you will receive all of your contributions plus the full interest accumulated on those contributions. If you have ten or more years of qualified service credit, you will receive all your contributions, the full interest that has accumulated on those contributions, and the match from the university.\nUnder the retirement savings plan (previously called self managed plan), if you have ten or more years of service credit you will receive your contributions, the match from your employer match, and the investments earnings or losses.\nWhat about taxes?\nWhen you take money out of SURS, it is called a separation refund. If you can take a lump sum cash distribution, you will most likely owe a lot of taxes. However, you can also move the funds to another tax deferred retirement account, such as a Traditional IRA or a 401k at your new employer.\nMake a wise choice to keep the funds invested toward your retirement and avoid paying the taxes today.\nWhere will you work next?\nIf you are going to work at another university in the State of Illinois or to another workplace in Illinois with a public retirement system, it is better to leave your money with SURS.\nIf you work at another university, your account with SURS will continue and you don’t have to make any changes. For example, if you switched from working at the University of Illinois in Urbana to Illinois State University in Bloomington then you are still a SURS participant.\nIf you go to work for another public employer in Illinois such as a city or school district, you are eligible to receive reciprocal retirement benefits\nIf you go to work for another public employer in Illinois such as a city or school district, you are eligible to receive reciprocal retirement benefits. This means the record of earnings you have in each system can be combined to raise the base for your pension calculation in whichever systems you draw retirement from. You will need at least one year of service credit in each system to gain the reciprocal retirement benefit. This combination of benefits can really boost your retirement paycheck.\nDo you believe you might return in the future?\nIf you are close to being vested with 10 years of service or achieving the 20 years required for health insurance paid by the State of Illinois, you may want to leave your money with SURS while you work somewhere else. That way, you can return to the University of Illinois or another Illinois public college in the future and pick up the last few years you need for fully paid health insurance or to achieve a pension payout if you are in the traditional or portable pension.\nAs mentioned, this is a complex subject. This article covers just the tip of the iceberg.

{"question":"What's special about million-dollar ballet shoes & basic shoemaking tools?","answer":"A pair of ballet shoes worn by legendary dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov sold for one million roubles at the 2017 'Art for Life' charity auction. Regarding basic shoemaking tools, the fundamental equipment includes a specially cut shoemaker's knife (which must be kept sharp for safety and control), a piece of glass for rasping, a hammer with convex head, curved scissors, awl and brittle, rasp, pliers, roughmaker, polishing stick, tackswipper and holpipes.","context":["Acclaimed art patron, Sergei Diaghilev who set up the widely influential touring ballet company, Ballets Russes in\nParis, is also credited with inspiring young Eastern Europeans to devote themselves to the craft. And it is exactly\nthe layers of artistic, technical and precise craft that correlate with high-end artisanal shoemaking. The symmetry\nstretches further with the dancer’s relationship with a shoe – one that can make or break a performance. Ballet\ndancers are well-renowned to manipulate shoes before entering the stage. Each role can require a different type of\nshoe. In a New York Times article by Tobi Tobias, American ballet dancer Eleanor D'Antuono talks about the\nneed for different shoe characteristics. She explains that: “To sustain the ethereal quality of “Giselle”, the\nsoftest shoes are used to keep the footwork light and noiseless. But for the bravura “Don Quixote” pas de deux, or\nOdile's flashing feats in the third act of “Swan Lake”, the buttress of a considerably firmer pair is needed”. It is\nthese exacting standards, that are upheld by the very best shoemakers. For ballet performers to reach the zenith of\ntheir discipline, they will have done so through an uncompromising and lengthy journey. Friend of The Rake\nand model for our 'Art of Footwear' series Solomon Golding can attest to this. He overcame initial rejection at the\nRoyal Ballet School to become the first British-born black dancer to perform for the prestigious ballet company.\nAlso known for his attempts at a pirouette, but more seriously his admiration for bespoke shoemaking, The\nRake’s Editor-in-Chief Tom Chamberlin discovered during a collaboration with G.J. Cleverley that bespoke\nshoemaking really isn’t for the faint of heart. And like successful ballet performers, he discovered that the\njourney is totally worth it – as the result is an artistic masterpiece that future generations can benefit\nComparable to a couture showpiece, using the lobster dress produced in collaboration between Schiaparelli and\nSalvador Dalí as illustration, the appreciation of the artistry attached to sui generis shoes doesn’t stop at\npurchase. In 2017 – a pair of ballet shoes worn by the legendary dancer and choreographer Mikhail Baryshnikov sold\nat the charity auction “Art for Life” for one million roubles.\nShoes in many ways are the pivot that allows expression across a wide array of recreations and artistic disciplines.\nThey have acted as the fulcrum for some of the most memorable actions in showbiz history. Most people on this earth\nat some stage will have tried to imitate Michael Jackson’s famous moonwalk, performed in a pair of black leather\nloafers. In slightly more sartorial environs, the influence that Fred Astaire’s style and entertainment mastery had\non other males during the Great Depression cannot be underestimated. Whether it be dancing with Ginger Rogers, Rita\nHayworth or on his own, his impeccable choice of footwear always stood out. The very best handmade two-tone\nspectator shoes or Oxfords in either white or buckskin or brown suede, were favoured by Astaire. Sporting those\nelegant shoes, ballet legend George Balanchine once called him “the greatest dancer in the world.” And upon meeting\nhim, the celebrated choreographer Bob Fosse could hardly form words. Much later incidentally, Oscar-winner and\nformer cover star of The Rake, Sam Rockwell would portray Bob Fosse in the series Fosse/Verdon.\nDancing or “hoofing” as Rockwell calls it, is actually a skill that he developed early in life and is very good at.\nDespite his silky moves he said: “Playing Bob Fosse is no joke.” Another iconic figure with slick and athletic steps\nas demonstrated in An American in Paris, 1951 Gene Kelly never veered away from his trusty penny loafers,\nwhich says a lot about the artistic versatility of the shoe. And then you see the impact and contribution that\nconverse has had on culture. Fans include: James Dean, Kurt Cobain, Andy Warhol, Patti Smith and Karl Lagerfeld – a\nquintet that collectively have pushed the boundaries of art in different-yet-ground-breaking directions.\nThe point is that shoes, and pairs made my adept artisans for that matter – are not only the result of technical\nguile and artistry – but they have the ability to make much greater impacts through the realms of artistic\nexpression and practice. All those years back in 1919, Nijinsky who mostly wore leather ballet shoes - performed his\nlast dance of note in reference to war, and a nudge over 100 years later, that disturbing performance could suddenly\nhave serious resonance once again.","|THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MAKING BOOTS|\nWhat is traditional shoe making?\nThe industrial revolution produced machines which made the labor intensive making of shoes a lot easier. The traditional shoemaker today makes \"handmade\" shoes, with the help of machines. The pure craft has disappeared, although making customised shoes still requires a lot of handwork.\nThe machines are great tools. Every shoemaker can choose how much he wants to make use of machinery. But only very few work without it.\nHow is a wonderboot made by hand?\nAfter a series of measurements a copy of the foot is made the last. Lasts usually come from the lastmanufacturer lastmaking is a special craft. The last is a wooden or plastic copy of the foot, which can be adapted. If someone has a high instep, the last is incremented. In addition, the last can be adapted to a person's taste in fashion. Material from the last is sanded or added, which gives the last another shape.\nDrawing and design patterns\nThen the last is reduced to a two-dimensional image, which is needed for the technical drawing. This drawing consists of many lines and mathematical calculations originated from fixed measurement points. A boot has more of these than a low shoe. It encloses the leg, and every leg has its own shape. Anklesize, calfsize, kneeheight and thighvolume belong to the measurement data to make a boot. Each type requires a different boot pattern drawing. For example there are laceboots, zipperboots or boardingboots, which differ in the way they are put together. Finally the patterns are cut out and placed onto the leather.\nAfter the stretch of the leather is determined, the leather is cut. The leather should stretch to the opposite of the foot movement, otherwise the shoe will loose its shape. The skins come from the leather tanning; the place where raw skins are treated to usable sheets, including painting them in a certain color. The cut leather patterns are prepared by folding (turned edge), edging (decorative edges) or jagged. The leather is also skived, this is slenderize the leather at some places and is necessary there where the leather comes together. Then the different parts are sowed together. A shaft consists of lining-leather and upper-leather. These two are sowed separately from each other, then the lining-shaft is sowed in the upper-shaft the shaft is obtained.\nNow the shaft pulled over the last and hereby the so called underwork-making starts. This is done using nails, wooden pens, staples and various types of glue. First, an insole is fixed onto the last. The shaft is then stretched over the last and the insole (pegging the shaft with the ductility tang), and folded at the bottom. At the nose and the heel extra reinforcements are placed (plastic or leather). The waist (middle area of the foot) is also reinforced with a steel spring (shank) and a firming board. In between, the shoemakers-hammer is used to knock and stroke the leather. Leather is a living material and can be modelled. Filing and sanding are used to smoothen all irregularities.\nThe boot gets a mid-sole and for example sole sewing or stitching the outsole, are some possibilities of finishing the underwork. Hights, such as plateaus, are constructed of, for example, cork or porro. The over-soles can have a profile, made of leather, plastic, wood or cork, and also for the heel, there are many possibilities. It is essential that the heel is flat on the ground in relation to the foot. Finally, the lasts are pulled from the boots, the boots are polished and get an inlay. The result a Wonderboot!\nMaterials, tools and machinery\nMaterials used in a boot, are various types of leather, cork, iron and thermo plastic material. Charcoal, felt, wood and rubber and all kinds of unusual materials may also be used at request. For various applications there are tufta, ironing linen, gypsum, solvent, talcum powder, paint, wax and pitch. A range of adhesives are used, including synthetic glue, rubber glue, gelatine, black gum and atomic glue.\nA shoemaker without a knife is like a blacksmith without a fire. With a specially cut shoemakersknife numerous things can be done. The blade is always kept sharp. A blunt knife is harder to control and is therefore dangerous. A piece of glass for rasping, is also standard equipment. Other common tools of the shoemaker are: hammer with convex head, the ductility tang, the curved scissors, the awl and brittle, the rasp, the pliars, the roughmaker, the polishing stick, the tackswipper and holpipes. Next to these there are many tools that may come in handy.\nMachines supporting the production of handmade shoes include the sander, with coarse and fine bands, various schrooimessen, the bims and cleaning brushes. Then there are the high press, various non guns, ovens, the pillar sticker, shelf sticker and repair machine, the doornaaier, aflapper and the clicking machine."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:29e4568a-0053-48b6-9001-671528681dc8>","<urn:uuid:e52691fa-591a-45d0-b3e5-779bf4852274>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do CSR data collection practices compare to ESG governance reporting standards in terms of transparency requirements?","answer":"CSR data collection emphasizes real-time, robust data capture similar to HR and financial data, with information feeding into a central database for regular updates and clear messaging. For ESG governance reporting, transparency is also crucial but focuses more on specific policies and disclosures, including ethics statements, diversity policies, codes of conduct, and clear communication of sustainability goals and progress. Both frameworks require accurate documentation, but ESG governance specifically ties these practices to broader business strategy and leadership engagement.","context":["The Mandate of Social Value in Law Firms\nDemonstrating a commitment to CSR is now an integral part of legal life. Social impact is often generated by law firms funding charitable projects, launching a foundation, organising volunteering projects and introducing sustainability initiatives.\nHere Chris Farrell, Managing Director of Impact Reporting, a bespoke CSR and sustainability reporting tool, discusses the importance of reporting on CSR in the legal sector.\n‘CSR’ and ‘sustainability’ are becoming more and more recognised within the legal sector as firms develop a growing awareness that they need defined social, environmental and sustainability goals.\nLegal firms are looking at practical ways to tackle issues such as reducing emissions through energy initiatives and people-focused outreach programmes like staff training. However, there is still an underlying perception that considers CSR as ‘low priority’ in the business space, traditionally resulting in small budgets, unambitious actions, and a general lack of strategic decision making.\nIt is worth therefore, reiterating the business case for CSR, and it’s reporting. Leading in CSR promotes a point of difference to clients, stakeholders and people, helping firms receive positive recognition in local markets.\nYet, to maintain sector-leader status, firms need to back up these statements with robust and reliable CSR data. Firms need to start taking CSR reporting seriously and put it back on the agenda in order for them, and their clients, to truly ‘buy-in’ to their value.\nUnderstanding value in CSR\nThe frameworks and methodologies associated with CSR measurement may differ between organisations and sectors, yet some key themes are pertinent across all industries. For example, analysing common inputs – money invested in charities, time spent volunteering, or trees planted is often balanced with common outputs – jobs created, lives saved, and a reduction in carbon emissions.\nOne attractive approach, particularly in corporate circles, is calculating social value as a ‘Social Return-on-Investment’ (sROI). This relates to the perceived monetised value of an organisation’s social impact and is a very specific, granular methodological way of understanding the monetised impact of a CSR project.\nAlternatively, firms can be led by their organisational purpose to drive their CSR strategy. Leading with purpose-first means that decisions reflect the preference of the end-user or community you want to help.\nIt is important to be aware of the qualitative data – the narratives and experiences – that also exist. These are often overlooked but are an effective way of contextualising your impact and humanising your corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting.\nCapturing accurate data\nCSR is drastically influencing business behaviour in the legal sector and is increasingly being seen an effective and responsible strategy for setting organisations apart. This is reinforced by the expectations of consumers and employees and their ever-growing want to engage in pro-social initiatives.\nHow social impact is recorded, analysed and reported is just as important as how it is created – the information you get out is only as good as the data you put in.\nUpdating and quantifying data live is crucial. It’s already standard practice for HR, sales and financial data to be captured robustly and accurately in real-time – and now the norms for social value data capture are catching up. Google Analytics, Xero, SalesForce, and intranet systems are all updated live, and reports can be gathered at the click of a button, without the hassle of manually compiling data from multiple sources.\nIn short, having all social value data feeding into one central database is advantageous as it allows for regular updates, clear messaging, and the ability to prove compliance with recognised standards.\nReaching the right goals\nQuantifying social value in an accurate and consistent way is key for all law firms. Aligning to and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – 17 global goals set by the UN in 2015 – is a straightforward and ethical way of benchmarking the impact of many value-based businesses. These are a blueprint to achieve a more sustainable future and address global challenges related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice.\nWe encourage our clients to align to the UN’s SDGs because of their worldwide and future-proofed applicability. Organisations track and report on their pro-social and pro-environmental activities according to which SDGs they contribute towards – to provide structure and help employees understand the greater goals they are helping to achieve.\nThe power of social investment\nDemonstrating a social impact is not a legal obligation for all sectors but that doesn’t mean legal firms shouldn’t celebrate the good work they do. We’re at the beginning of monitoring and truly understanding the value of social impact but with the ease of access, and cost-effectiveness of digital media, this behaviour is becoming commonplace across almost all legal firms regardless of size.\nCSR aids law firms by making them more efficient and leads to higher engagement amongst employees. It is also a key variable that attracts top talent and converts new business. Firms who are successful at doing this, have benefited from more investment, better strategic decision making, and increased sustainable growth.\nTen top tips to create social value buy-in\n- Letting employees choose charities – While having a ‘charity of the year’ is the norm in corporate circles, asking staff to nominate a chosen charity can help make this process more democratic. Allow staff to vote from a list and partner with the winning charity – this will help with engagement\n- Developing employee initiatives – Organise lunchtime cycling, weekend volunteering and recycling projects for all to get involved. Open the floor to suggestions, allowing employees to make recommendations that are important to them. The most popular ideas are often the most successful.\n- Building social value into client contracts – Insist that partner organisations prioritise social value too. This is the norm in public sector contracts and is becoming more familiar across a wider range of sectors. It is a sure-fire way to help organisations stand out in business circles.\n- Leading from the top – The most successful CSR-focused businesses have CEOs and MDs who are active and committed to a social value mission statement. To show how dedicated a business is to the cause, encourage the CEO/MD to get involved so they become an example for all staff.\n- Adopting a framework – The time is now to be serious about CSR. Paying lip-service won’t give businesses the desired results. Set real objectives with fixed timeframes, and work towards those.\n- Aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – Benchmark achievements against 17 global goals set by the UN in 2015 to achieve a more sustainable future and address global challenges related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. These will help drive growth, attract capital and focus on purpose and offers accountability and assessment.\n- Gamifying the creation of social value – Inspire employees to do more and get competitive about it. For example, set up a leader board and offer prizes as incentives. Motivate employees by appealing to their competitive nature.\n- Starting with the basics – Transforming a business’s attitude to social value won’t be an over-night process. It’s OK to start small and scale up. Get rid of plastics, put recycling bins in place, ditch cars, use public transport or walk into work.\n- Listening to stakeholders – Align with the organisation’s mission, vision or values. To truly embed social value into a business, it needs to harmonise. It’s about working towards a culture whereby social impact is created naturally and fluidly.\n- Working with pro-social companies – Be open to partnering with social enterprises, charities, or other ‘good’ companies at all stages of negotiating contracts. Learn from each other, offer solutions and network with likeminded people. Move forward, together.","Marketing, Practice Management\nWhat is Governance and What Role Can Marketing Play?\nFebruary 24, 2022 | | Marketing, Practice Management\nIf you feel like you’ve seen the term “ESG” pop up more lately, you’re not wrong. Google Trends has shown increasing search popularity in the term, peaking most recently at the end of January 2022. So, what does ESG mean? What is governance in ESG? And, most importantly, how can marketing help an accounting firm reach its governance goals?\nWhat is ESG?\nESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance reporting. Depending on your firm size and the size of your clients, you may think that ESG is a sustainability topic that is still in the distance. However, this reporting is likely much closer than you think. According to RSM, the time to talk about ESG reporting is now.\nOut of the businesses they recently surveyed, half with revenues between $10-50m had some kind of formal plan or strategy regarding ESG initiatives. This percentage was higher with businesses whose revenues were between $50 million and $1 billion (72%). On average, two-thirds of businesses had some kind of ESG plan.\nIn ESG, what is governance?\nIt may be your natural inclination to think about the “E” in ESG most frequently. However, environmental metrics are really just the sprout of a much bigger tree that a company can report on.\nWhat governance is\nGovernance is one leg of sustainability that often gets overlooked, but it is foundational to any organization’s success. It is concerned with how the firm is run, which can include its structure, culture, engagement and disclosure practices. It’s hard to tease out individual parts of a sustainability plan in an organizations. A quality of sustainability is that everything is interconnected.\nTake, for example, Certified B Corps. These are businesses that have achieved high standards in 5 areas – environment, workers, community, governance, and customers. The mission & measurement and ethics & transparency set by the governance piece ripple out to the actions taken in all other parts. Think of governance as part of a whole.\nWhat governance includes\nA governance plan could include ethics statements, diversity policies, codes of conduct, anti-harassment and non-discrimination statements, privacy policies, and more. Good governance creates good policies, and sets the foundations for all other ESG-related projects. These policies will tell clients, prospects, referrals, and employees about who you are as a firm, and what your culture and priorities are. Being transparent on sustainability goals and progress can also be part of your governance plan.\nGuides for governance\nThere are several different guides you could use to report on sustainability goals for your own business. For example, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council has The Green Masters Program, a program designed for self-reporting on sustainability progress. Firms may also want to assess their progress using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or Certified B Corps criteria.\nSASB, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, is one of the organizations working on establishing standards for sustainability by industry. Businesses can use\nthe standards to evaluate where they stand in terms of sustainability topics that are most material to their operations. For example, when evaluating professional & commercial services, operational matters, such as carbon or water, are not mentioned on the list. However, topics such as data security, professional integrity, and diversity & inclusion are listed. Oftentimes, engaging in sustainability doesn’t look like recreating the wheel. Instead, it looks like refocusing efforts already in motion and setting clear and transparent goals to improve in these areas.\nWhat role does leadership play?\nLike many good initiatives, governance isn’t successful without a top‐down strategy and messaging echoed by leadership. Your leadership should personally engage with ESG, drive sustainability company wide, and set the tone from the top down with commitments and initiatives for the company.\nThis doesn’t need to look like grandiose statements or lofty, unrealistic plans. Leadership in governance can look like risk management that thinks about how ESG ties to an existing strategic business plan. It can look like prioritizing the long-term over the short term, creating stretch goals, and promoting transparency for activities related to sustainability in the firm. It can also look like realizing and acknowledging the innovation that can come from thinking sustainably.\nWhat are the benefits of a strong governance plan?\nSustainability initiatives like governance in ESG aren’t just important for the environment. They are also key to a long-lasting business. Employees want to work at a company that is more socially engaged. It can also serve as a differentiator to separate you from competitors.\nA strong governance plan rooted in sustainability can be beneficial from a hiring and business development standpoint. By 2025, 75% of the workforce will be Millennials, and they are looking for socially responsible companies. You may close the door to them without a ESG or corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy – 64% of Millennials won’t take a job if there isn’t one. In four years, Gen Z will make up 30% of the workforce, and it is anticipated that they will prioritize purpose above salary. Creating a foundation now is an investment in the future of your workforce.\nHow can marketing play a role in ESG?\nMarketing professionals have worn many hats over the past several years. The multi-faceted roles of marketing can come in handy when it comes to aiding in ESG initiatives. You may want to:\nCoordinate or lead a Green Team\nPromote sustainable activities to external stakeholders\nShare top-down messaging internally and externally\nHelp with incentive programs\nSend out surveys to determine internal & external priorities\nKeep an eye on trends in ESG\nAdvise leadership about certifications\nTalk to clients about their ESG initiatives as part of fact-finding\nWhere do I start with governance planning?\nSeveral great resources are available for businesses that are thinking about ESG but not sure where to start. In a previous role, I enrolled in 21st Century Pathways, a training program hosted by the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council. The design of the program helps companies figure out how sustainability can improve their profitability. It was a helpful program in expanding the definition of sustainability and what it can look like for a professional services firm. Companies can also review standards via SASB, Certified B Corps, and the myriad other standards popping up in recent years. RSM and AICPA also have materials on ESG. I’ve also referenced a sustainability book by Gilbert Hedstrom to make evaluations.\nRemember to start small. Revise your mission statement to incorporate sustainability. Create an ethics statement. Make one plan to improve sustainability in the coming year by a certain percentage. You don’t have to take it all on at once. ESG is about making small, lasting changes to improve your firm.\nAbout Sammi Dittloff\nWelcome to CPA Growth Trends — your source for information, insights, tools and best practices to drive growth within an accounting firm.\nFeatured: Season 1 Episode 1\nCompensation Changes in Accounting Firms – Intersection of HR & Marketing with Andrea Sardon, PBMares\nwith Andrea Sardone from PBMares\nJoin host Mike Jones with Andrea Sardone from PBMares as they discuss the changes in compensation within the intersection of marketing and accounting in accounting firms."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dd9b0658-b57a-40fa-9ae9-36f5057df944>","<urn:uuid:82b184a1-e671-42db-95cf-010f74853920>"],"error":null}
