{"question":"How should I prepare my generator for long-term storage?","answer":"To store a generator long-term: 1) Clean and remove the battery, using a wire brush to clean oxidation from posts 2) Drain fuel if storing for more than 30 days 3) Remove spark plug and add drops of oil through the plug hole 4) Pull the recoil starter until resistance is felt 5) Store in a dry place and cover to protect from dust. If not storing long-term, start it every month or two and use fuel stabilizer to prevent fuel deterioration.","context":["Cleaning your generator regularly will keep it running smoothly. Although generators are built to endure some rugged treatment, maintaining yours extends its life. Read further to find many helpful tips on the right way to clean your generator including:\nKeeping your generator clean is as important as performing regular maintenance. Dust and debris can clog the components and reduce its ability to perform at full capacity. A dirty generator is a risk to allowing dust or bits of debris to drift into gas or oil openings when filling.\nFollow this short video for tips on correctly cleaning the exterior of a generator.\nCan I use a garden hose and water to wash my generator?\nConsider what your generator is designed to do…produce electrical power. Spraying water into the generator components risks damaging the connections and possibly allowing moisture to enter the fuel or fuel lines. Water can cause rust to form, which can weaken the component parts. Water is NOT recommended to clean your generator. Additionally, any residual water left on or inside the generator can cause electrocution upon operation.\nCan I use my pressure washer to clean my generator?\nWater is NOT recommended to clean your generator. A pressure washer is not to be used as the force of the spray can damage the component parts and connections. Moisture can enter the fuel or fuel lines. Water can cause component parts and fittings to rust, weakening their ability to function. Additionally, any residual water left on or inside the generator can cause electrocution upon operation.\nWhat tools can I use to clean my generator?\nUse a cloth with a non-flammable degreaser to wipe dust and debris from the exterior of your generator. A soft bristled brush (toothbrush) works to remove dust and fuel residue from around openings. You may use an air compressor to blow dust and debris from the vents and tires. Do not use flammable cleaning agents on any part of the generator, as the residue could spark a fire when the generator is in operation.\nIf you clean the air filter, carburetor, or spark plug you will need a screwdriver and possibly a wrench, as well as a wire brush for the spark plug.\n11 Steps to properly clean and maintain your generator\n- Check the oil. It is important with any engine to check the generator’s oil before each use. If your generator is new, plan to first change the oil when it has been used for 20 hours. Residue from assembly (lubricant and metallic particles) can break loose with use during the break-in of the engine. Generally, oil changes can be performed every 100 hours of use, unless the conditions are very dirty. Then, you should change it more often.\n- Keep fuel fresh and clean. Always use OSHA-approved containers to store your fuel. Store receptacles in clean, dry areas. Dirty fuel with dust or particles of debris will damage your engine parts and reduce its firing power.\n- Old fuel can break down, so put tags on receptacles with purchase dates to ensure that your fuel is fresh. Year-old fuel that has gone bad won’t help you if it won’t run your generator in an emergency.\n- Clean the air filter. Like you, your generator engine needs air to breathe. Maintaining a clean air filter is important. You should check it following each use, especially if the conditions have been dusty. It should be cleaned when you change the oil, as well.\n- Keep it clean. Regularly clean your generator. Removing harmful dirt and debris not only maintains the life of your generator, but it gives you a chance to spot any service issues that may be developing. Blow off dust and debris with your air compressor or compressed air (canned air), then wipe the surface with a clean cloth and degreaser (non-flammable) and soft brush. Be sure to clear any dust from the cooling vents.\n- Watch for leaks. After cleaning the exterior of the generator, look for any oil or fuel leaks that may come from loosened parts. Tighten or replace any parts causing the leak.\n- Tighten up components. Loose bolts and screws can vibrate out and cause damage to nearby components. It is a good time while cleaning to tighten everything!\n- Keep the spark glowing. Spark plugs are important to keep your engine running smoothly. Over time plugs get soiled with dirt, oil, and carbon residue. This stops the spark from igniting. Plugs should be checked and cleaned when the oil is changed. Use a wire brush or spark plug cleaner. Anytime the porcelain is cracked, replace the plug immediately.\n- Clean the strainer. There is a fuel strainer in the fill port to the fuel tank. This strainer is meant to collect dirt and debris that may be in the new fuel. Be sure to remove and clean it if sediment is present. Replace and top off your tank with new fuel.\n- Check yearly. It is a good idea to do an annual inspection of your generator. Look for broken or cracked parts. Check the fuel line for cracks and replace it if needed.\n- Storing your generator. You have cleaned and maintained your generator through a season of use. Now it is time to store it until you are ready to use it again. Make sure it is ready to go the next time you need it.\nBefore storing your generator, here are some steps to complete.\n- Clean the battery posts. Begin by removing the battery. Use a wire brush to clean any oxidation and debris around the posts. Finally, make sure the battery is fully charged.\n- If it will be more than 30 days before you use the generator again, you should drain the fuel from the tank. This ensures that the fuel will not deteriorate in the tank during storage. There are fuel additives that help prolong the life of fuel, but fuel should be drained for long periods of generator inactivity.\n- Remove the spark plug and add a couple drops of oil through the plug hole. This keeps the cylinder bore lubricated and prevents corrosion.\n- Before replacing the spark plug, gently pull the recoil starter knob one to two times. Then, pull it until you feel resistance and leave in that position.\n- Find a dry place to store and cover the generator to protect it from dust.\nIf you are not storing your generator between uses, make sure to start it regularly (every month or two) to keep it lubricated and ensure it is ready to go when you need it. A fuel additive, also called a fuel stabilizer, will help reduce the deterioration of the gasoline or diesel.\nHow do I check and clean the generator’s carburetor?\nA common thing in carburetors is a condition known as “gumming-up”. Old fuel and today’s ethanol blends (corn-based) can cause a build-up of a sludge-like substance in the carburetor. Follow this link for easy-to-follow steps to cleaning your carburetor.\nWhile this video shows a particular brand of generator, the basics are the same for most models. Refer to your owner’s manual for specific location and directions for your generator brand and model.\nHow do I clean the air filter on my generator?\nJust like you, your generator needs to breathe. Maintaining a clean air filter is vital to your generator’s overall optimum operation. The following link will guide you through checking and cleaning your generator’s air filter.\nA generator that won’t start may just be dirty!\nThere are several reasons why a generator will not start, but the most common one is that you have not kept it clean. Dust and debris have contaminated the fuel, the air filter, and carburetor. Your generator’s engine is struggling because the spark plug is soiled and can’t fire. You need to clean it!\nTake the time with each use to clean your generator parts and maintain this important source of power to your home and recreational products. A few minutes of care will save you hours of frustration later.\nCongratulations! You now have all the tools and tips necessary to clean maintain your generator. Your investment will last longer with proper care."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4e35dc47-6c17-4db5-99ed-759aa611f32b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do teachers effectively observe and assess child development in early education settings?","answer":"Teachers should observe children over time and in various settings to fully understand their development. The information gathered through observation helps assess children's needs and program effectiveness. Teachers should use these observations to prepare appropriate activities rather than comparing or labeling children. They can use tools like DEL's Early Learning and Development Guidelines to determine typical development and create meaningful program planning. This observation-based approach helps teachers get to know each child well, build respect for their unique developmental timetables, and scaffold interactions appropriately.","context":["Updated January 27, 2017\nOne of the most exciting parts of working with children is witnessing their growth and development. As we watch them develop and learn it is important to acknowledge, support and celebrate their growth. We do this by carefully observing and recognizing how children in our care/classroom are developing at their own rate.\nOnce we identify where children are in their development, it is our job to reflect on what we know, and then plan the environment and curriculum for further development and growth. Observation and reflection on individual growth and development allows us to celebrate each child.\nIt is important to use the information gathered during observations on individual development to prepare appropriate activities, NOT to compare or label children. As we learned in module 1, each typically developing child will eventually master developmental tasks on his/her own time schedule and we want to encourage and support them where they are.\nConsider the following highlights of understanding and observing development:\n- Children have individual temperaments, development, learning styles, experiences and family backgrounds.\n- Understanding development helps us to scaffold our interactions and activities for children. Scaffolding is a teaching concept introduced by researcher Lev Vygotsky. It means that teachers and caregivers are providing children with sufficient support when they are learning a new skill. Through observation you can determine what a child can do independently, what they can do with help and what additional support they need to take them to the next developmental level.\n- In order to fully understand where children are in their development you must observe over time, and observe them in a variety of settings.\n- You benefit from observation by getting to know each child well, building respect and appreciation for each child and their unique developmental timetables.\n- DEL’s Early Learning and Development Guidelines book can help you determine typical development and needs of each child in your care/classroom. Use the Guidelines to help you create meaningful program planning, share development with children’s parents, and inform your own understanding of individual developmental expectations. All of this helps your classroom or care setting to run smoothly.\n- Because children each develop at a different rate, we as providers must have realistic expectations for learning, behavior and interactions. Realistic expectations allow us to challenge and scaffold children who are ready in one area of development, and ease up on challenges in areas where they are not ready. For example, a child who does not have the fine motor skills necessary to button their own coat may need extra time to get outside while the teacher scaffolds this learning opportunity (taking the time to help start the button and let the child finish). A child who is proficient at this skill may be given the challenge of helping another child or working towards tying shoes.\n- We use the observation information we gather about children in order to assess their needs, assess our program effectiveness, and build an effective program.\n- According to the NAEYC Position Statement on Early Childhood Curriculum, Assessment and Program Evaluation’s indicators of effectiveness, the information gathered through observation and assessment is used to understand and improve learning.\n- Using observation to understand development is essential to effective teaching.\nOptional Online Resources for Further Study"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c295049-74dd-4592-a30a-e6b84a066e3c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Me preocupa mi abuela que tiene demencia 😢 ¿Cuáles son las causas más frecuentes de esta enfermedad?","answer":"The most common causes of dementia are degenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease or vascular calcification of the cerebral arteries. These conditions worsen with age and are therefore an increasing medical and social problem in an aging society.","context":["Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disease of the central nervous system in young adults in our latitudes. It is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system is directed against its own nerve cells and their sheathing. In most cases, it is characterised by acute flare-ups of the disease, which often regress spontaneously. If left untreated, the majority of patients experience further flare-ups, which are often followed by slow progression of the disease. Only in less than 15% of patients, the disease begins primarily progressively.\nTypical symptoms include sensitivity disorders on the extremities, acute blurred vision in one eye due to inflammation of the optic nerve and motor disturbances such as gait disorders. Bladder disorder or concentration difficulties can also occur. It is very common for patients to experience a slight fatigue («chronic fatigue») and a worsening of symptoms in hot weather conditions.\nThe diagnosis is based on the detection of inflammatory centres in several places of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which have occurred at different times. Already during the first episode of the disease, a therapy is advisable. Therefore, it is vital to have the diagnosis as early as possible and to start treatment quickly. By now there are a number of drugs that modulate the immune system and can prevent further flare-ups.\nA stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) occurs due to an acute circulatory disruption of the brain and neck arteries. Causes are usually vascular calcification or blood clots from the heart. Due to typical vascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, abnormal blood lipids, high blood sugar, smoking or lack of exercise, strokes usually only occur at an older age and are the most common cause of permanent neurological disability. However, young people can also become victim of strokes, e.g. due to heart defects, injury to the brain supplying arteries or rare genetic diseases.\nThe principal symptom is the sudden onset of a usually half-sided paralysis as well as sensory, visual and cognitive disturbances, dizziness and facial paralysis. A stroke, similar to a heart attack, is a medical emergency (even if there is usually no pain involved or symptoms recede by itself) and requires the immediate alerting of the emergency services. To rule out a cerebral haemorrhage, a computer tomography is always required. Specialised treatment centres (stroke units or stroke centres) try to restore cerebral circulation as quickly as possible (within a few hours, every minute counts!) or to limit the extent of the damage to the brain. Thereafter, intense rehabilitation treatment must be undergone in a specialised neuro-rehabilitation clinic. Treatments include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, neuropsychological training, measures for reintegration and prevention for recurrence of strokes. Medical conditions after stroke include chronic paralysis and disability, pain and epileptic seizures.\nPrevention of stroke is primarily possible through control of the above risk factors from an early stage and should preferably begin at adolescence. Migraine patients have a slightly increased risk of stroke, but frequent auras practically never lead to permanent damage. However, when a migraine aura occurs for the first time, the distinction from a stroke is sometimes difficult to draw.\nIf a stroke or a TIA (transient ischemic attack) is suspected, immediate medical attention is absolutely necessary. Emergency services can be reached under tel. 144 or +41 44 387 39 99 (Hirslanden Klinik Zürich stroke emergency).\nMuscle and nerve diseases, so-called neuromuscular diseases, can affect people at any age. Neuromuscular diseases are often chronic and can lead to physical restrictions such as fatigue, paralysis, muscle atrophy or changes of sensitivity in those affected. In addition to the muscles themselves, neuromuscular diseases can also affect the nerves, which are supplying the muscle or the signal transmission from the nerve to the muscle. Some neuromuscular diseases are congenital or inherited, others occur due to inflammation, metabolic disorders or neurodegenerative diseases. A total of over 800 different neuromuscular diseases are known to this day. The diagnosis must be carefully in order to be able to properly treat the cause of the disease.\nAn epileptic seizure leads to excessive electrical discharge of large groups of nerve cells in the brain. Depending on the affected brain region, the symptoms can consist of motor symptoms such as muscle spasms or twitches, sensitivity disorders such as tingling or disorders of higher brain functions such as speaking. Stand-alone symptoms such as salivation or wetting, but also cardiac arrhythmias are not uncommon. If larger areas of the brain are affected, a clouding of consciousness or a sudden complete loss of consciousness occurs and can therefore lead to falls or accidents, among other things.\nIn principle, every brain can suffer an epileptic seizure due to triggering factors such as alcohol (withdrawal), medication or high fever, or also due to damage of all kinds (including traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain inflammation, hypoglycaemia). If seizures occur on a consistently high level of frequency, one speaks of an epilepsy, which can often have genetic causes. With appropriate diagnostics, about 2/3 of patients manage to stop having seizures thanks to the appropriate medication. For some patients, brain surgery can stop the seizures permanently. However, this procedure is highly complex and requires sophisticated diagnostics and surgical expertise, which only a specialised centre can offer.\nSleeping disorders are among the most common health issues in industrialised countries. Around one in four adults suffers from sleeping disorders. One speaks of a sleeping disorder when sleep is too short or too long, frequently interrupted or not recuperative. A sleeping disorder can also be present when severe daytime tiredness or sleepiness occur.\nEveryone sleeps badly at times and this is not yet a cause for concern. However, a medical assessment should be carried out if the condition becomes chronic, i.e. if the person concerned sleeps poorly for at least three nights a week over a period of at least one month.\nAccording to ICSD-3 (International Classification of Sleep Disorders) sleeping disorders are divided into 6 groups:\nInsomnia: This refers to sleep disturbances and major sleeping disorders. If the affected person needs more than 30 minutes to fall asleep, one speaks of a sleeping disorder. In the case of sleep-maintenance insomnia, the affected person often wakes up and can only fall asleep with difficulty. This form of sleeping disorder also includes waking up early, when the affected person wakes up too early in the morning and cannot fall asleep again.\nHypersomnia: This refers to a strong daytime sleepiness. Despite getting enough sleep, the affected person suffers from extreme daytime tiredness and has an increased need for sleep.\nParasomnia: Parasomnia refers to behavioural abnormalities during sleep such as sleepwalking, teeth grinding or nightmares.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder (CRSD): With this type of sleeping disorder, the sleep rhythm shifts, with delayed or early sleep phases. This can be the result of poor sleep hygiene, untreated depression, time difference (jet lag) or shift work.\nSleep-related breathing disorders: Sleep can be disturbed by sleep-related breathing disorders such as short respiratory failures and snoring. This is the case, for example, with sleep apnoea syndrome.\nSleep-related movement disorders: Movement disorders such as restless legs syndrome (restless legs) can negatively affect falling asleep. Periodic limb movement disorder (periodic movements of limbs during sleep) can also interfere with falling asleep.\nGood quality of sleep with sufficient sleep duration is vital for well-being and performance levels. If a person suffers from a sleeping disorder for a long time, it will affect his physical and mental performance. As a result, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, muscle tension, increased irritability, mood swings, increased anxiety and impaired ability to concentrate may occur. If you suffer from sleeping problems, it is therefore important to act quickly before the situation gets worse.\nDementia is the loss of already acquired intellectual abilities. Memory is often the first to be affected, but so-called executive functions such as planning, judgment and problem solving can also be leading symptoms. Pains of those affected or their relatives can therefore be very differing. The spectrum can range from the preliminary stage of mild cognitive impairment with deficits that are barely noticeable in daily life to complete helplessness and a need for care. The most common causes of dementia are degenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular calcification of the cerebral arteries. They worsen with age and are therefore an increasing medical and social problem in an aging society.\nA large number of metabolic diseases or inflammations can lead to an, at times, well-treatable dementia, but the differentiation from depression («pseudo-dementia») is not always easy. Therefore, a careful diagnosis, usually involving brain imaging, blood and neuropsychological tests, is necessary to make precise diagnosis.\nNeurovascular diseases describe the impairment of nerve tissue due to damage or abnormalities of the blood vessels. The most important of these diseases is a stroke, which was induced by a narrowing or an occlusion of a brain supplying vessels (inside or outside the brain). Depending on the supply area of the affected vessel, the duration of the interrupted blood supply and the presence of any bypass circuits, stroke symptoms can vary greatly or even be absent.\nMain symptoms are sudden (half-sided) weakness, sensitivity disorders or visual loss as well as disorders of the higher brain functions (e.g. language). If a stroke is suspected, every minute counts and emergency services (Tel 144 or +41 44 387 39 99 for Hirslanden Klinik Zürich stroke emergency) must be called immediately.\nThe patient can then be taken to an emergency care facility (so-called stroke unit or stroke centre), where vessels, that may have been closed, can be reopened by using highly specialised procedures. Also, it may be possible to keep the level of damage to the brain tissue as low as possible through optimising blood pressure, body temperature, blood composition etc. An outpatient examination is usually not helpful and only results in unnecessary loss of time, since imaging of the brain (CT or MRI) is required in most of the cases.\nCerebral haemorrhages due to the rupture of a blood vessel, a vascular malformation or vascular sagging are also categorised as neurovascular diseases. The main symptom of cerebral bleeding in the area of the meninges (so-called subarachnoid bleeding, SAB) is the sudden thunderclap headache (lasting seconds to minutes), often with subsequent neck stiffness and accompanying paralysis. Again, this is a life-threatening emergency with the need of immediate calling of emergency services.\nHowever, migraine can also be counted among the neurovascular diseases in the broader sense, since migraine attacks can very well lead to changes in blood circulation and (practically always reversible) neurological symptoms such as visual loss, sensitivity disorders or paralysis. In the so-called familial hemiplegic migraine, stroke-like symptoms develop due to a genetic defect, which are usually followed by a specific form of headache. In this case, characteristics are the family history and the uniformity of the attacks. At first occurrence of this clinical pathology, it is necessary to proceed the same way as when a stroke is suspected (Emergency services Tel 144 or +41 44 387 39 99 for Hirslanden Klinik Zürich stroke emergency).\nParkinson’s disease stems from a degeneration of dopamine-producing cells in the midbrain and is a disease of older age, but can rarely also occur at the age of adolescence. Symptoms include a progressively reduced mobility of limbs and trunk (hypokinesis), a characteristically increased muscle tension (rigor) and a coarse tremor at rest (tremor), whereby typically one half of the body is initially significantly more affected.\nAlready in the early phase of the disease, non-motor symptoms such as sleeping disorders with nightmares and progressive loss of the sense of smell occur. At a late stage, mental disorders such as increased impulsivity, autonomic disorders such as bladder dysfunction or dementia can manifest. Parkinson’s disease can often be treated quite well over the years with medication or neurostimulation. However, other diseases can initially have a similar clinical appearance, but must be distinguished carefully.\nDizziness is one of the most common symptoms with which general practitioners and neurologists are being consulted. In general, dizziness occurs when the brain receives information from sensory impressions that do not match. Most typically, conflicting information stems from sensory organs of the inner ear and the eyes. A typical example of such a mechanism is seasickness or strongly moving images at the movie theatre. A blood circulation or/and metabolism disorder as well as a disturbance of electrical processes in the area responsible for information processing in the brain stem can also be the cause for dizziness (e.g. drop in blood sugar levels, strong fluctuations in blood pressure, stroke or after alcohol, drugs or medication intake). Mental processes, especially fears, are often also triggers for dizziness.\nThrough a careful assessment of the medical history (vertigo, triggering situations, duration, accompanying symptoms) and neurological examination with special attention to eye movement and balance, the cause of dizziness can often be found out. Depending on the cause, the therapy can be very differing and consists of positioning exercises, physiotherapy, medication or psychotherapy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:724dba98-fee0-4b90-bf62-827163023267>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do task analysis in ABA and the ABC model in REBT share any common elements in their therapeutic approaches?","answer":"While both are therapeutic models, task analysis in ABA and the ABC model in REBT have different elements and purposes. Task analysis breaks down tasks into smaller components to teach each part through behavioral strategies, using techniques like chaining and prompting. The ABC model in REBT, however, focuses on the relationship between Activating events (A), Beliefs (B), and Consequences (C), examining how beliefs about events lead to emotional and behavioral consequences. They represent distinct approaches - one focused on breaking down tasks for learning, the other on understanding the relationship between thoughts and emotions.","context":["5 Common Applied Behavior Analysis Components\n- Task Analysis\nA common therapeutic technique used in behavior modification is applied behavior analysis, or ABA. It has been proven particularly effective in those diagnosed with autism and similar developmental disorders. The strategy is based upon making changes to the environment in a way that significantly impact an individual’s behavior, with the end goal being to produce positive actions and reduce negative ones. It’s important to analyze behaviors as they occur in order to identify the antecedent, or the action the individual was supposed to perform, the behavior itself and that consequence, which is the positive or negative response to the given behavior. This is known as the ABC model of behavior modification. There are also specific components that are crucial to any quality ABA program. Let’s take a look at those.\n1. Task Analysis\nTask analysis is the process of analyzing components in a task or antecedent in order to teach each part through further behavioral strategies. Breaking an antecedent down into its parts makes any weak links easier to identify so that each specific behavior can be addressed in a proactive manner.\nChaining is when that skill that is being learned is then broken down into its smaller parts, allowing for ease of understanding and learning. This component of applied behavioral analysis can be applied to nearly any new skill. For instance, rather than instruct a child to clean his room, it would be more beneficial to break the process down to its parts. You could first teach him how to make his bed. Once that skill is mastered, move on to straightening clutter, vacuuming the floor and so on.\nPrompting uses guidance and support to give individuals a nudge or a reminder when they are struggling to demonstrate a newly-learned skill. A prompt kelps to keep them on track or to avert a misstep. This technique can help to lessen “failures” or “meltdowns”, increasing self-esteem and leading to a positive outcome.\nIt’s important that clients not become depending upon prompting, however. You ultimately want them to feel secure in completing skills on their own without assistance. That’s where fading comes in. This term refers to the process of gradually removing prompts until the individual can confidently perform an activity without them.\nShaping is giving a form of positive reinforcement when clients demonstrate positive attempts or success at performing a newly learned skill. The important part to remember with shaping is that improvement must be consistently shown in order for the reinforcement to be given. Status quo level performance would not receive positive acknowledgement, only regular improvement. The reasoning is that this type of positive reinforcement strategically encourages the individual to work toward mastery of a skill.\nABA is a proven method of successful behavior modification. However, it’s absolutely necessary that these components of behavior analysis be in place if a plan is to work as it should.\nYou may also like:\n- 20 Best Online ABA Master’s Degree Programs 2020\n- 10 Best ABA PhD Degree Programs 2020\n- 10 Best Online ABA Degree Programs (Bachelor’s) 2020\n- Top 20 Online Master’s in Educational Psychology 2020\n- Top 30 Online Master’s in School Counseling 2020\n- 10 Best Online RBT (Registered Behavioral Technician) Training Programs 2020\n- 20 Most Affordable Online ABA Graduate Certificate Programs 2020\n- How Do I Become an Applied Behavior Analyst?\n- Do I Have to Take an Exam to Become an ABA?\n- What Does a Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) Do?","Cognitive Behavior Therapy is a form of talk therapy that emphasizes the present, is structured, and goal focused. It is rooted in theories and techniques that have been scientifically tested.\nWhat is Cognitive Behavioral Theory?\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of treatment based on cognitive and behavioral theories of causes of emotions and what leads to particular self-defeating behaviors. The CBT tools that a client might learn may be based on classical conditioning, operant conditioning, or social learning (modeling). These are very behavioral tools. More cognitively focused techniques stress the role thoughts and beliefs might play in producing emotional suffering and maladaptive behaviors. These cognitive theories are based on a model that stresses the role thinking (our beliefs) play in producing emotional suffering and maladaptive behaviors.\nCognitive Behavioral Treatments\nTraditional behavior therapies include Exposure plus Response Prevention (ERP, also called Flooding), Implosive Therapy, Systematic Desensitization, Shaping, Habit Reversal, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Role Playing, etc. Cognitive techniques evolved into forms of treatment including Rational Emotive Therapy (RET), which is now called Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy or REBT, Cognitive Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Self-Instructional Training, etc.\nComponents of cognitive-behavioral therapy have been studied more than other psychotherapies, and have proven to be effective for many issues. In as little as 8-12 weeks, many techniques have shown promising results. Cognitive restructuring techniques, problem solving, relaxation training, communication skills, and combinations of these techniques have reduced both the experience of anger and many of the associated behaviors.\nCognitive Behavioral Techniques\nCognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that reduces current symptoms by addressing the current causes of the issue. CBT theory proposes that emotional problems result not only because of a particular event, but also the individual’s interpretation and behaviors associated with the event. Certain interpretations, or beliefs, about the self, others, future, or even life in general can influence emotions and behaviors.\nAlbert Ellis’ ABC model is a helpful way to conceptualize how beliefs and interpretations are involved in emotional episodes. “A” represents Activating Events, “B” is for Beliefs, and “C” is for Consequences.\nActivating events (A’s), are anything real or imagined that activates our belief system (B’s) and results in an emotional consequence (C). Emotional Consequences (Ce’s), set the stage for behavioral consequences (Cb’s).\nIf you were bumped by someone with a backpack while walking on the sidewalk, that could be an A. You may then believe (B), “He should watch where he is going, and at a minimum apologize.” The combination of this activating event (A) and belief (B), may result in anger, and an emotional consequence (C).\nA x B = Ce\nActivating event Belief Consequence emotional\n(Inconsiderate behavior) (Others should always be considerate) (Anger)\nHere is an REBT self-help form to allow you to challenge irrational beliefs by disputing them (asking challenging questions) and then writing new effective philosophies: REBT-Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Self-Help Form\nIrrational Beliefs and Cognitive Distortions\nThere are numerous schools of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), each of which may have particular cognitions that are emphasized more than others. And over time, even one particular school makes changes. Below are a few examples.\nFour Core Irrational Beliefs developed by Albert Ellis, founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)\nThings should or have to occur as I prefer, like, or in the way that I believe is right. Some times demands are referred to as musts. Here are three major musts:\ni) I must do well or get approval (or I’m inadequate)\nii) You must treat me nicely (or you’re inadequate)\niii) The world (life) must give me what I want quickly, easily, and with great certainty (or it’s Awful)\nSomething is magnified to be 100% completely bad. It is also called catastrophizing. Words like awful, horrible, terrible, and catastrophic may indicate awfulizing is occurring, especially if the event is seemingly insignificant compared to other bad events in one’s life.\nLow-frustration Tolerance (LFT)\nThis is a thought that underestimates one’s capacity to tolerate or experience an event, situation, or experience. I can’t stand it, or this is unbearable, or I can’t take it may indicate that there is some LFT taking place.\nGlobal Evaluations of Worth\nThese beliefs are global ratings of worth placed on the self, others, or even life, the world, or the future. Examples would be calling oneself a loser, winner, success, or failure. Rather than rating particular behaviors, individuals may globally evaluate the worth of a particular subject in a way that does not accurately capture its value to different stakeholders.\nOverview of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evolved over decades. What has not changed is the emphasis on scientifically testing theories and clinical techniques. Behavior Therapy (BT) was developed first. Based on principles of learning from scientific laboratories, behavior therapists began applying techniques to patients.\nLearning principles established in the classical conditioning work of Pavlov and operant conditioning work of B.F. Skinner (psychologist) and others, could be applied to help people suffering with various disorders, such as anxiety. For example, Dr. Joseph Wolpe (psychiatrist) and his protege, Dr. Arnold Lazarus (psychologist) promoted the use of systematic desensitization.\nSystematic Desensitization as Behavior Therapy\nSystematic desensitization involves the therapist helping the patient to identify different levels of what triggers their anxiety response. Then a fear or anxiety hierarchy is developed. The next step is for the psychotherapy patient to be taught and practice an effective relaxation technique.\nOnce the therapy patient can effectively produce a relaxation response, the conditioning begins. The therapist or the psychotherapy patient may describe the trigger that will at first produce a lower level of anxiety. After the anxiety response has occurred in response to exposure to the anxiety stimulus, the therapy patient then produces a relaxation response.\nAccording to Wolpe, one cannot be simultaneously anxious and relaxed at the same time. He called this concept reciprocal inhibition. An incompatible response, e.g., relaxation is then to be selected to replace anxiety. With practice a therapy patient can learn to have a relaxation response follow the anxiety trigger. As the therapy progresses, the behavior therapist has the psychotherapy patient gradually work up the fear or anxiety hierarchy, until the patient can successfully cope with even the most intense anxiety trigger.\nBehavior Therapy (BT) has been effectively applied to numerous disorders, e.g., Autism, major depression, and the clinical applications include prolonged exposure therapy, exposure with response prevention (ERP), assertiveness training, contingency management techniques, behavioral activation, Problem Solving Therapy, Functional Analytic Psychotherapy, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).\nRational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Cognitive Therapy\nRational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)\nAlbert Ellis, a clinical psychologist, began conducting psychotherapy after being trained as a psychoanalyst. He eventually changed his approach and incorporated lessons from philosophy into a therapeutic technique, whereby he encouraged therapy patients to adopt more rational beliefs about themselves, a particular situation, others, the world and the future. He proposed that by changing changing irrational beliefs to more rational beliefs, therapy patients could change their emotions.\nFor example, a client with the proper therapeutic intervention or tools learned in therapy, could challenge the belief that she would be a failure if she failed her cell biology final and it would be awful if she received a C in the course. She would then replace those irrational beliefs with something more realistic or rational like, “It may be accurate that I failed that final, but I don’t become a failure for failing an exam. And it may be really bad if I receive a C in the course, sense that will keep me from reaching my goal of an A average, but it is not truly awful.”\nWith rational beliefs about a negative event, a negative emotional state will still occur. For example, irrational beliefs about a potential bad grade may produce anxiety, while rational beliefs would produce concern. Removing emotions or changing negative ones to positive ones as the consequence of a negative activating event is not the goal. It would not be adaptive to feel joyous after failing to meet a goal.\nAccording to Ellis’ Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), healthy negative emotions, e.g., concern, disappointment, sadness, etc. can motivate adaptive behaviors. Disappointment after a poor grade may encourage more preparation before the next exam. But unhealthy emotions such as panic, depression, or rage are likely to be followed with self-destructive behaviors.\nEllis called this model of events, beliefs, and consequences (emotional and behavioral) the ABC model.\n- A stands for activating events,\n- “B” for beliefs (rational and irrational),\n- and “C” for consequences (emotional and behavioral).\nThis ABC model has been adopted by many cognitive behavior therapists.\nAaron T. Beck, a psychiatrist, developed a similar therapy that emphasized the role of cognition on emotional states and behaviors. Beck’s original work focused on the clinical issue of depression. Beck helped his psychotherapy patients become keenly aware of different types of cognitions, e.g., automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, core beliefs, and schemas.\nAgain one of the targets emphasized in his cognitive therapy (CT) is challenging the cognitive distortions in order to make them more realistic and helpful. In the case of depression, he proposed therapists should focus on cognitive distortions about the self, world, and future.\nThis is now called the Cognitive Triad. As is true with Ellis’ Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Cognitive Therapy (CT) also included more behavioral technique such as activity scheduling. Many proponents of Beck and Ellis’ cognitive theories of emotion believe the mechanism of change is cognitive restructuring, i.e., changes in cognitions produce changes in emotions in these treatments.\nWhile there is little argument that these treatments can be effective at reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms, many behaviorists believe the mechanisms of change are not solely cognitive, but rather rely on the behavioral learning principles identified above in the section on behavior therapy.\nThe mechanism of change is one of the biggest reasons for disagreement between the more cognitive therapists and those who ascribe to behavioral therapy. Nonetheless, most people view cognitive and behavior therapists as operating under one large umbrella, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).\nReferences for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)\n- Beck, J.

{"question":"Was Marie Curie only scientist in her family who won Nobel Prize??","answer":"No, Marie Curie wasn't the only Nobel Prize winner in her family. Her daughter Irene also won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for her work on radioactivity. This made them a remarkable family of Nobel laureates, with Marie having won two Nobel Prizes (Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911) and her daughter winning one.","context":["History of Radiation Therapy\nRadiation therapy (also known as radiotherapy) is the use of radiation to treat cancerous or benign tumors and other medical conditions. Often confused with radiology, another medical specialty that uses low-energy X-rays to create images, radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to treat patients.\nThe field of radiation oncology is one of the three pillars of cancer therapy, along with surgery and chemotherapy. Nearly two-thirds of cancer patients in the United States receive radiotherapy. It is also the most effective way to treat pain in cancer patients when a cure is no longer possible.\nLearn more about the history of radiation therapy below:\nWilhelm Roentgen (1845-1923)\nThe field of Radiation Therapy (currently referred to as Radiation Oncology) was born not long after the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by the German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen.\nX-ray image of Bertha Roentgen’s Left Hand. November 8th, 1895\nWhile performing experiments on electricity, Roentgen noted that an energy “ray” was produced which passed through most objects, including his own body. He also noted that these rays, which he named “x-rays”, could be used to produce images of bones. In fact, one of the first known x-ray images ever produced was of his wife Bertha’s left hand.\nNewspaper Coverage of 1901 Nobel Prize Awards\nIn an amazing feat of industriousness, Roentgen characterized and validated his findings in a technical report within 6 weeks. His paper, entitled Uber Eine Neue Art von Strahlen (On a New Kind of Ray) was presented on December 28th to the Wurzburg Physical-Medical Society.\nHis first public presentation describing his ground-breaking findings followed on January 23rd, 1896. He concluded that lecture by taking an x-ray image of the hand of a volunteer from the audience!\nNews of Roentgen’s remarkable discovery traveled rapidly around the world. In recognition of his ground-breaking research, he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.\nMarie Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934)\nNot long thereafter, a Polish-émigré working at the Sorbonne in Paris named Marie Sklodowska (together with her husband Pierre Curie) isolated the first known radioactive elements which she named Polonium (after her homeland of Poland) and Radium.\nPierre Curie (1859-1906)\nRadioactive elements emit a natural form of x-rays known as Gamma Rays. In recognition of their work, the Curies received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 (although as a woman she was not allowed to address the audience).\nIrene Curie (1897-1956)\nMarie Curie subsequently went on to receive a second Nobel Prize in 1911 for her work on the chemistry of Radium. (Of note, she was not only a double Nobel prize recipient but was also the mother of a Nobel Prize winner. Her daughter Irene received the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her own work on radioactivity).\nFirst American diagnostic x-ray (Dartmouth, February 1896)\nThe potential role of x-rays (produced artificially by a machine or naturally by a radioactive element) as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool was realized remarkably quickly. In fact, the first diagnostic x-ray was in fact taken within 2 months of Roentgen’s discovery.\nEmil Grubbe (1875-1960)\nInterestingly enough, the therapeutic potential of x-rays was demonstrated even earlier. After noting peeling of his hands exposed to x-rays, a medical student in Chicago named Emil Grubbe convinced one of his professors to allow him to irradiate a cancer patient, a woman named Rose Lee, suffering from locally advanced breast cancer. By doing so, Grubbe became the World’s first Radiation Oncologist.\nClaude Regaud (1870-1940)\nNo longer responding to medical treatments, Ms. Lee benefited greatly from Grubbe’s intervention, demonstrating the potential value of x-ray treatments. In a few short years, patients throughout the United States and Europe were undergoing Radiotherapy.\nAt first, Radiotherapy was delivered primarily in a limited number of treatments. A Professor at the Radium Institute in Paris name Claude Regaud, however, recognized that treatment may be better tolerated and more effective if delivered more slowly with modest doses per day over several weeks.\nHenri Coutard (1876-1950)\nThis approach, known as fractionation, is one of the most important underlying principles in Radiation Therapy. To this day, fractionation lies at the heart of many treatment programs currently used in Radiation Oncology.\nThe early French Radiation Oncologist Henri Coutard pioneered the use of fractionated Radiotherapy in a wide variety of tumors. Of note, he reported impressive results using this approach in patients with locally advanced laryngeal (voice box) cancers. His seminal 1934 report of the outcome of these patients is still quoted today.\nEarly Radiation Therapy Machine\nDespite their promise, an important limitation of the early x-ray machines was their inability to produce high energy, deeply penetrating beams. It was thus difficult to treat deep-seated tumors without excessive skin reactions.\nBreast Brachytherapy (1920s)\nMany early advocates of Radiation Therapy thus relied instead on the placement of radioactive sources in close proximity or even within the tumor, a technique known as brachytherapy [Brachytherapy]. In many tumors, for example cervical and uterine cancers, brachytherapy became the mainstay of treatment (as it so remains to this day).\nRalston Patterson (1897-1981)\nFollowing World War II, England became the primary focus for Radiotherapy research. Founded by Ralston Patterson, the Holt Radium Hospital was quickly recognized as a world renowned center for radiation treatment and research.\nModern Linear Accelerator\nThrough his careful clinical observations, Patterson established the optimal treatment approaches for a wide variety of tumors undergoing external beam radiotherapy. Together with the noted Physicist Herbert Parker, Patterson developed the basic principles underlying brachytherapy prescription, the so-called “Patterson-Parker Rules”.\nBy the 1960s, the epicenter of Radiation Oncology began to shift to the United States, primarily due to the immigration of many noted European radiotherapists. An exciting development was the introduction of high energy (megavoltage) treatment machines, known as linear accelerators or linacs. Such machines were capable of producing high energy, deeply penetrating beams, allowing for the very first time treatment of tumors deep inside the body without excessive damage to the overlying skin and other normal tissues.\nFirst patient treated on a megavoltage linear accelerator\nA prototype linac was developed by Henry Kaplan and his colleagues at Stanford University. The first patient treated using this machine was a child with retinoblastoma (a cancer of the eye). Treatment was highly successful for more than 40 years later, this patient remained free of disease with good vision.\nSubsequently, many noteworthy Radiation Oncologists made enormous contributions to the field of Oncology. Malcolm Bagshaw, also of Stanford University, demonstrated the curative potential of Radiation Therapy in prostate cancer. Today, based in part on his ground breaking work, radiotherapy is recognized as a mainstay in the treatment of prostate cancer.\nGilbert Fletcher of the MD Anderson Cancer Center established optimal treatment regimens in a wide variety of tumor sites including head and neck cancers and cervical cancer.\nSamuel Hellman, the founding Chair of the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (Harvard University), who trained UC San Diego Radiation Oncologists Dr. Arno Mundt and Dr. Kevin Murphy, was instrumental in establishing breast conserving therapy (the use of lumpectomy plus radiation instead of mastectomy) as the treatment of choice for women with breast cancer.\nIMRT plan in a patient with a right-sided tonsil cancer\nThe high dose isodose lines curve in avoiding the right (pink) and left (light green) parotid (salivary) glands\nThe 1960s saw the beginning of widespread proliferation of radiotherapy throughout the United States and Europe. This growth was due in part to the increasing availability of commercial linear accelerators and other equipment. Varian Medical Systems the current leader in Radiation Oncology technologies, began work on the first commercial linac in 1958.\nBy the early 1960s, both Stanford University and UCLA were treating with Varian machines. Over the years, other accelerator vendors including Siemens and Elekta introduced commercial linacs. Commercial linacs are currently used in Radiation Oncology centers across the globe.\nIn subsequent years, the field of Radiation Oncology has experienced multiple technologic revolutions. By the late 1980s, computer tomography (CT)-based treatment planning had become commonplace, allowing the development of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). 3DCRT greatly improved the quality and delivery of radiotherapy by reducing dose to surrounding normal tissues.\nThe next major technologic development known as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), however, represents arguably the most important revolution in Radiation Oncology. Unlike conventional approaches, IMRT conforms the prescription dose to the shape of the target in 3 dimensions, thereby reducing the volume of normal tissues receiving high doses and thus the risk of potential side effects.\nIn head and neck patients, for example, IMRT focuses treatment on the tumor reducing exposure of the nearby salivary (parotid) glands. Head and Neck cancer patients treated with IMRT are thus less likely to develop dry mouth (xerostomia).\nIMRT Adoption in the United States (Mell et al., 2005)\nIMRT also provides a means of safely escalating the prescription dose and even re-treating previously irradiated patients, potentially improving cure rates.\nWhile initially available at only a limited number of academic centers, IMRT has been quickly adopted by the Radiation Oncology community in recent years. A survey in 2005 performed by Dr. Mundt and his colleagues found that nearly 75% of Radiation Oncologists in the United States were treating patients with IMRT.\nThis was all the more remarkable given that their earlier 2003 survey found that less than a third of radiotherapists were using IMRT.\nIMRT is rapidly becoming standard practice in a wide number of tumors, particularly prostate and head/neck cancers. Interest has also grown in other sites, notably cervical cancer, brain tumors and breast cancer.\nIMRT is commonly used at UC San Diego. UC San Diego physicians and physicists have considerable experience in its use. Dr. Mundt is the Editor of the first International IMRT textbook on IMRT entitled IMRT: A Clinical Perspective. This textbook brought together over 175 physicians and physicists interested in the clinical use of IMRT from 42 institutions in 9 countries (USA, Belgium, Canada, China, Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and Spain).\nToday, Radiation Therapy is in the midst of yet another important technologic revolution, namely Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT). While not truly new, IGRT is rapidly growing in popularity primarily due to the widespread adoption of new linear accelerators which function both as treatment and imaging machines. The Varian Trilogy machine used at UC San Diego for IGRT is shown below. The Trilogy is capable of producing high quality CT scans of the patient on the treatment table.\nMachines, such as the Varian Trilogy, also have the ability to perform cone-beam CT scans of the patient while he or she is on the treatment table. This ability will someday allow treatment to be adapted to changes occurring in the tumor, hopefully translating into higher cure rates and lower rates of toxicity. Researchers at UC San Diego led by Steve Jiang, PhD, Director of Research in the Department of Radiation Oncology, are actively investigating the potential roles for IGRT in a wide number of tumor sites.","“I am among those who think that science has great beauty.”\nAccording to the analysis of senior university staff in Europe, men are three times more likely than women to reach senior levels. However, the participation of women in science and technology can and has contributed to increasing innovation, quality and competitiveness of scientific and industrial research and needs to be promoted.1 One of the brightest and most inspiring people, who pushed the borders of the existing science was Marie Skłodowska-Curie, the first woman to be awarded the Nobel prize and the only person who has ever won Nobel Prizes in both physics and chemistry. She discovered two new chemical elements – radium and polonium and carried out the first research into the treatment of tumours with radiation.2\nMarie Skłodowska-Curie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland.3 Since within her childhood, Marie was recognised for her remarkable prodigious memory and she graduated in 1883 from high school with a gold medal as the top student. However, her father did not have the possibility to financially support her idea to go to university and moreover higher education was not available for girls in Poland. Therefore, she took work as a teacher and from her earnings, she helped her sister Bronia to complete her medical studies in Paris. In 1891, Marie followed her sister to Paris where she studied chemistry, mathematics and physics at the Sorbonne, Paris’s most prestigious university. One of the challenges she faced was, of course, learning French, since the courses were taught in French.2 Almost two years later, Marie finished as the top student in master’s physics degree course. Being extremely curious and willing to always study, in 1884 she also obtained a master’s degree in chemistry. Then she attempted to find a job in Poland, but again as being a woman she could not get a position at the university. Therefore, she decided to return to Paris and begin a PhD in physics.\n“Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the feeling of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid, did not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome, my usual state of mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction.”\nIn 1895 (aged 28) she married Pierre Curie, who had been completed a PhD in physics and had become a professor. During her PhD, Marie began to investigate uranium as a new and exciting area to work in. Marie and Pierre discovered polonium, which was named after Marie’s homeland. In 1903, Marie completed her PhD and, in the same year, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. She shared the prize with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel. The births of Marie’s two daughters, Irene and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 did not interrupt her scientific work.\nAfter the death of her husband Pierre Curie in 1906, she had become the Chair of Physics at the Sorbonne and after so many years, she became the first female professor at the University of Paris.\n“I have frequently been questioned, especially by women, of how I could reconcile family life with a scientific career. Well, it has not been easy.”\nIn 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, the isolation of radium and the study its nature and compounds.\nDuring World War 1, Marie set up radiology medical units near battle lines to allow X-rays to be taken of wounded soldiers.\n“We must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity.”\nShe travelled widely to talk about science. In addition, she had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the Curie Foundation in Paris and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia became the director.4\nMarie died aged 66 of leukaemia, most likely developed from the radioactivity she had been exposed to during her career. Even her books and papers are so radioactive that they are now stored in lead boxes.\nToday, Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA) support researchers at all stages of their careers, irrespective of nationality. The fellowship program – first named Marie Curie Actions – was created by the European Union/European Commission to support research and to reveal new pathways for many brilliant minds who are passionate about science.\n“After all, science is essentially international, and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it.”\nThis article appeared first on www.etn.redmud.org website."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:33cb800a-eeeb-4e46-90d8-f7060d3dee14>","<urn:uuid:88fdd8a6-cc42-45e1-bce6-ecd36a861253>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What dietary recommendations change before versus after cancer treatment, and how can patients maintain their strength throughout the therapy process?","answer":"Before cancer treatment, patients should focus on hydration and a diet rich in green leafy vegetables, fruits, and whole grains while limiting red meats. High-calorie, high-protein meals with snacks and liquid nutrition products are recommended. After treatment, the diet should include 5-7 servings of fruits and vegetables, high-fiber foods, and foods rich in proteins and carbohydrates, while avoiding salt-cured and smoked foods. Throughout the treatment process, patients can maintain strength by eating within an hour of treatment sessions, bringing snacks when traveling to treatment facilities, and incorporating regular gentle exercise. Even during treatment, physical activity like walking or yoga can help prevent fatigue, relieve side effects, and maintain overall strength when combined with proper nutrition.","context":["Cancer treatment can greatly affect your nutritional needs. The treatments at times may even influence the body's ability to process nutrients. Hence, patients undergoing cancer treatments should take special care in their diet so as to balance their health conditions. Eat nutritious foods that will help you tolerate treatment-related side effects. Look up some answers regarding diets for cancer patients. However, the nutrient needs of a cancer patient may vary from person to person. Work with your dietician/physicians to identify your nutrition goals. Look at anti cancer foods that can go a long way in keeping carcinogens at bay.\nProtein is essential for a healthy immune system, with out which the body takes longer to recover from illness and lowers resistance to infection. Cancer patients require more proteins than a normal person in order to combat the diseased cells. Further protein may be required after chemotherapy and radiation therapy to heal tissues and to help prevent infection. Good sources of protein include lean meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, nuts, dried beans, peas and lentils, and soy foods.\nCarbohydrates and Fats\nCarbohydrates and fats assist the body by supplying the calories required for a healthy living. The amount of calories each person needs depends on his/her age, size and level of physical activity. Sources of carbohydrates include fruits, vegetables, breads, pasta, grains and cereal products, dried beans, peas, and lentils. Sources of fat include butter, margarine, oils, nuts, seeds, and the fat in meats, fish, and poultry.\nVitamins and Minerals\nVitamins and minerals are essential for proper growth and development. In addition they allow the body to use the energy (calories) supplied in foods. Generally, a person who eats a balanced diet receives plenty of vitamins and minerals. However, this may be difficult in case of cancer patients who do not take balanced diets. Consult your dietician/physician to increase the level of vitamins and mineral supplements in your food.\nDiet before Cancer Treatment\nTake plenty of water else you may become dehydrated. Plan a healthy diet that includes green, leafy vegetables and fruits. Choose whole grains over processed grains or sugars. Also limit the consumption of red meats, especially high fat processed meats. Eat lots of high-calorie, high-protein meals supplemented with snacks, commercial liquid nutrition products, and homemade drinks and shakes.\nIf you experience weight loss, you may also be advised to eat more sauces and gravies and to include more butter, margarine, or oil in your foods to boost calories. In addition, you may be encouraged to eat fewer high-fiber foods, because fiber can aggravate problems such as diarrhea.\nDiet after Cancer Treatment\nEat good nutritious food that is rich in proteins and fibers. There is no research that suggests that the foods you eat will prevent your cancer from recurring. But, eating well will help you regain your strength, rebuild tissue and improve overall wellbeing. Consult your dietician and create a nutritious, balanced eating plan. Add a variety of foods that are rich in proteins and carbohydrates. Try to eat at least five to seven servings of fruits and vegetables, including citrus fruits and dark-green and deep-yellow vegetables. Eat plenty of high-fiber foods, such as whole grain breads and cereals. Decrease the amount of fat in your meals by baking or broiling foods. Also avoid salt-cured, smoked and pickled foods. If you are overweight, consider losing weight by reducing the amount of fat in your diet and increasing your activity. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program.\nAnti Cancer Diet\nAntioxidants work well in an anti cancer diet since they prevent free radical reactions. They also prevent faulty cell metabolisms and protect the intestinal membrane cells. Beta carotene fights against cancer by both boosting the immune system and releasing a specific chemical called tumor necrosis factor. This blocks the growth of potential cancer cells. You can find beta carotene aplenty in colorful vegetables and fruits such as carrots, cantaloupe, pumpkins, butternut and other types of winter squash, spinach, broccoli, mango and papaya. Vitamin C in your diet can help in fighting potent carcinogens, especially those found in processed meats. It also boosts the production of lymphocytes, thereby giving a fillip to your immune system. Women who have low levels of Vitamin E and selenium are more likely to contract breast cancer.\n- Follow a diet that is low in saturated fats. Cancerous tumor cells need LDLs to grow. A low LDL diet can be beneficial to prevent cancer. Omega 3 fatty acids and monounsaturated oils do not contribute towards cancer. In fact they offer protection against cancers. Use of cooking oils such as soybean, sunflower, sesame and virgin olive can provide high omega-3 fatty acids. Use of hydrogenated fats can be potentially carcinogenic.\n- Including salads of raw fruits and vegetables in your diet can arm you with cancer-fighting properties since they contain phytochemicals, phenols, indols, flavones, cumines, and isothiocyanates, all of which are carcinogen-blocking agents.\n- Eating cruciferous vegetables can lower the risks of breast and colon cancer significantly. Include garlic, dark leafy spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, red peppers, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans and vital sources of beta-carotene.\n- Including soy products as a source of protein can go a long way in your anti-cancer diet.\n- Incidence of breast cancer is very low among Greek and other Mediterranean women whose diet is rich with monounsaturated oils. Large amounts of fruits, vegetables, seafood, nuts and legumes are also responsible for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer.\n- Include sources of Selenium in your anti cancer diet - lobster, shrimp, whole grains, brown rice, cottage cheese, lamb chops, chicken, sunflower seeds and garlic.\n- Flaxseeds are said to be full of cancer-preventive compounds that can help you reduce the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.\n- Green tea and garlic are also credited with anti oxidant properties that fight cancer cells.\n|Cancer Fighting Food|\n1. Eat the right foods\n2. Limit dietary fat and keep your weight under control\n3. Include a healthy exercise regimen into your lifestyle\n4. Keep stress at bay\n5. Include daily supplements of Vitamin C, Calcium, Flaxseed, Vitamin E and Selenium\n6. Limit caffeine and alcohol consumption\n7. Quit smoking\nBreast Cancer Diet\nChemotherapy and radiation can lead to nausea and loss of appetite. A typical breast cancer diet can include small meals instead of three heavy meals. Try eating foods such as crackers, toast, yogurt and oatmeal to fight the nausea and vomiting. Ensure that your breast cancer diet includes plenty of fluids. Sipping water often can help in coping with the dry mouth syndrome that sometimes accompanies breast cancer treatments. Avoid fried and high-fiber foods, unless you suffer from constipation.","Staying Healthy During Cancer Treatment\nHow to Keep Your Strength Up During Cancer Treatment\nThe treatments administered for cancer, including radiation and chemotherapy, can cause fatigue and nausea. While these side effects can make it difficult to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly, it’s important you continue to eat healthy foods as much as possible and get some exercise as often as you can. Practicing good nutrition and exercise habits during cancer treatment can help improve your quality of life, relieve treatment side effects and keep up your strength throughout treatment.\nNutrition for Cancer Care\nChemotherapy is well-known for causing nausea, but radiation treatment can cause upset stomach and vomiting as well. Radiation treatment for brain cancer, spine cancer and cancers of the abdomen and digestive tract are notoriously crucial in the treatments of these diseases, but the stomach-upsetting side effects can be distressing.\nThough it might be hard to eat and keep down food during radiation treatment or chemotherapy, it’s important you do your best. Good nutrition during cancer care helps you maintain your physical strength and can help mitigate fatigue. It can help you maintain a healthy weight, prevent nutritional deficiency, lower your risk of infection and speed your overall recovery. Maintaining proper nutrition during cancer treatment helps you maintain a good quality of life and makes you better able to cope with other side effects.\nIf you’re getting radiation treatment, you should always try to eat within an hour of going to treatment. You’ll tolerate the treatment better with something in your stomach. If you have to travel to the treatment facility, bring snacks with you. Focus on eating calorie-dense, nutritious foods like nuts, avocados, beans, seeds, cooked cereals and puddings.\nIf your treatment side effects make it hard for you to eat properly, try eating smaller meals every two or three hours instead of three large meals per day. Some cancer patients find that there’s a specific time of day, such as breakfast time, at which it’s best to eat the bulk of their calories for that day. You can add protein powders or nutrition supplements to your food to increase their calorie content. When you’re feeling nauseated, eat foods that soothe the stomach, like saltines, ginger ale or toast.\nExercise During Cancer Treatment\nNo one’s expecting you to hit the gym every day while you’re going through cancer treatment, but for many cancer patients, regular physical activity can have multiple benefits. Regular exercise during cancer treatment keeps your body strong and can help prevent anxiety and depression. It can also relieve side effects like nausea and improve fatigue. Talk to your doctor and treatment team about whether you should exercise and how much exercise is appropriate. Start slow, and stick to gentle activities like walking, riding a bike slowly, walking a well-behaved dog, dancing or going to yoga. Plan your exercise program to include both aerobic activities, like walking, and strength-training exercises, like yoga or gentle weight lifting.\nGood nutrition and regular gentle exercise can go a long way toward helping you maintain your physical strength and fight off fatigue during cancer treatment. The better you’re able to care for yourself, the more you’ll enjoy your life and less vulnerable you’ll be to the fear and uncertainty that a cancer diagnosis can bring."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12d06e80-a868-4a9f-8806-3fb4d4914976>","<urn:uuid:19a54671-7726-4d2b-a0b6-629c7b2da46c>"],"error":null}

By Lloyd Alter Design Editor University of Toronto Lloyd Alter is Design Editor for Treehugger and teaches Sustainable Design at Ryerson University in Toronto. our editorial process Facebook Facebook Twitter Twitter Lloyd Alter Updated April 07, 2020 Video screen capture. Topics covered Share Twitter Pinterest Email Design Tiny Homes Architecture Interior Design Green Design Urban Design It all adds up to a huge amount of electricity consumption and carbon, both embodied and operating. As noted earlier, I have committed to trying to live a 1.5° lifestyle, which means limiting my annual carbon footprint to the equivalent of 2.5 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, the maximum average emissions per capita based on IPCC research. That works out to 6.85 kilograms per day. One of the problems with trying to live a low-carbon lifestyle is actually figuring out what the carbon footprint of all the different things we do actually is. It is often surprising; my carbon footprint from using the Internet is higher than my footprint from food. To find out more about where our footprint comes from, I had each of my students studying Sustainable Design at Ryerson University look at some aspect of our lives, whether it be our diet, waste, clothing, or electronics. The students who covered electronics did some interesting work, and because the classroom went virtual mid-term, they did their presentations as videos, which I thought I would share with TreeHugger. The students looked at a number of aspects of the carbon footprint of electronics, including Bitcoin, which has been discussed on TreeHugger before. Michelle Lan writes: Bitcoin Bitcoin is a mined coin, which means the mining process creates its token. In this process, Bitcoin miners act as verifiers of the transaction in contrast to real-world miners who have to physically mine for gold. In doing so, Bitcoin miners compete and attempt to solve a puzzle to complete building a block; in other words, a set of transactions. Once a successful miner solves the problem, he or she receives a reward for their service; hence new Bitcoin comes to existence. According to Digiconomist, as of Sunday, March 22nd, 2020, Bitcoin's estimated electricity consumption is 68.5 TWh per year. In essence, this is equivalent to Czech Republic's annual electricity consumption, as well it is sufficient enough to power 6,342,327 American homes. The biggest drawback of the 'proof-of-work' consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin is the misuse of enormous energy. Although the 'proof-of-work' mechanism can effectively deter potential attacks, the concerns for its energy efficiency and sustainable practice are problematic. Alternatives to mining mechanisms that are more energy efficient include proof-of-stake (PoS). PoS reduces the computing power required to effectively mine a block since the system removes competition and works on one problem at a time. In comparison to proof-of-work as it uses many machines to solve one puzzle thus racking up energy consumption. Bitcoin could potentially switch to such a consensus algorithm, which would significantly improve its sustainability. Another solution to Bitcoin's high energy consumption is moving towards solar power and other green energy sources to mine. Gaming I have never been much of a gamer, and was very curious about how big a footprint it had. I had no idea it was so popular, either. Reese-Joan Young writes: It would be a severe understatement to describe the Video Gaming industry as anything but a “big deal”. As per a 2018 inquiry from Reuters, the revenue generated by it was stated to have “eclipsed that of all other major entertainment categories” - surpassing Television, Box Office Film and Digital Music. And looking to recent events, this growth hasn’t seemed to waver in the slightest. Amidst the movements towards self-isolation in global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, now, more than ever, there are more and more individuals stuck at home and gaming to pass the time while digitally interacting with others they would otherwise be unable to interact with. Despite how popular gaming is, there exists an astounding deficit in user understanding of their hobby’s environmental impact. I’ve chosen to analyze specific elements of the gaming industry to contribute to the dialog that aims to answer the question “how does an individual’s gaming hobby contribute to global carbon emissions?”. This issue of power consumption of video gameplay and graphics was mentioned in “Toward Greener Gaming”, published in 2019 by the Computer Games Journal. Computer gaming alone is said to make up “2.4% of all residential electricity in the United States, with carbon emissions equal to more than 5 million cars, adding up to $5 billion spent.\" As for upcoming initiatives, the industry’s focus on \"play anywhere\" experiences for mobile games, is projected to bring a more “increased energy footprint than with regular mobile gaming'' due to necessary energy usage of data centres and cloud networking infrastructure. SOLUTION: Redevelop video game concept generation strategies because an engaging story that addresses a meaningful social issue is very possible. An example of this is the Civilization game series, wherein the idea of a “circular economy” is conveyed and promoted as a core gameplay mechanic with the goal in-game being to establish “resources and production as precisely consumed by what one needs”. As for the relevance of gamification to the big idea of sustainability, it is important to remember that global change requires a shift in every sphere - and this act, as unnecessary as it may seem, provides a platform for such concepts and ideas to circulate within the Gaming Industry and influence society as a whole. How long do our electronics last? What can we do about it? Pooja Patel quotes Greenpeace: \"From its choice of energy to the selection of raw materials, the industry needs to reinvent the way that electronic devices are made and used in society to reverse the ever-increasing environmental impacts driven by the growth of the sector.\" Embodied Carbon Lin Gao explains that \"Embodied Carbon is Carbon generated by producing the materials of the electronics, moving the materials, installing the materials; it is the carbon [taken] to manufacture the electronics up to the delivery of it.\" Electronics are one of the most heavily-imported commodity groups in the North American economy. And shipping by air is the most energy-intensive method of shipping. Transportation as part of the upfront carbon emission adds on a great deal of upfront carbon emission for electronics. As globalization and international trade continue to increase, and the electronics consumption continues to increase, it is likely that electronics will continue to play a dominant role in upfront carbon emission on international trade. The upfront carbon emitted by imported electronic goods in one state is greater than the total amount of direct carbon emission of one state. Approximately 2/3 of the carbon emission of electronics can be traced to upfront carbon emission of it, which is the manufacturing of storage devices, semiconductor, and PCB components. The embodied carbon in the major parts and components that electronic goods used to assemble computer products account for nearly 60% of its total analyzed footprint, and the embodied carbon from various chemical, gases, metallic materials, and other semiconductor materials supplies, accounted for nearly 40% of its total analyzed footprint. What about power consumption? There is something to be said for these virtual presentations; they provide a record, and they can be shared widely. I certainly learned that the impact of our electronics goes far beyond their basic energy consumption, which Mara Caza covers in this talk."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0f072b3d-fc16-4cd8-93a8-92b8d4817f9c>","<urn:uuid:2f043c1b-b424-499a-a983-be65a2f82d6a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What characterizes different approaches to jazz vocal improvisation between historic figures like Louis Armstrong and contemporary performers like Teresa Broadwell?","answer":"Louis Armstrong was a foundational influence on jazz vocal improvisation, known for his distinctive gravelly voice and skill at scat singing (wordless vocalizing), while shifting jazz's focus from collective to solo performances. In comparison, Teresa Broadwell, a contemporary jazz vocalist and fiddler, emphasizes the importance of swing in her improvisational approach. Her swing epiphany came during her studies at SUNY Potsdam's Crane School of Music when learning about triplets superimposed over quarter notes. Broadwell demonstrates her improvisational skills through vocalese, a technique where she adds rapid, rhythmic lyrics over instrumental solos, as shown in her performances of songs like 'All of Me' with comical word-flurries. Her philosophy centers on always trying to swing and seeking out the 'swingingest' music to play.","context":["Women make a place singing in region's jazz scene\nA trio knows it means a thing to have that swing\nEarly last week, three women sat around a table in Saratoga Springs and talked about jazz.\nThey talked about singing. They talked about swinging. They talked about their lives and careers in music, working a Capital Region jazz scene that's rich with talent. They talked about gigging at venues large and small, busy and hushed. They talked about playing to crowds who might not know the music so well.\nAnd they talked about the influential jazz recordings of the 20th century, little masterworks of songcraft that caught their ear and continue to inspire them — standards that act like a time machine, zapping them and their audiences back to the era of smoky bars and swinging offbeats. \"I open up a Real Book, and it is like furniture that was made longer ago,\" says singer Jeanine Ouderkirk, referring to the thick compendium of jazz tunes. \"And these songs have lasted, because their structure is just —\"\nShe knocks on the table before her. Solid.\nThe table, as it happens, belongs to Jeanne O'Connor — a fellow jazz vocalist who lives in Saratoga Springs. It's a recent Tuesday morning, and the pair are relaxing in O'Connor's dining room with fellow singer Teresa Broadwell. Before them: brie. Beside them: a circa-1900 Steinway played by O'Connor's late first husband, the producer, pianist and composer Don Grolnick. Around them: warmth and laughter.\nBroadwell, a jazz fiddler as well as a singer, spent 16 years as middle school orchestra director in Niskayuna. O'Connor moved up to Saratoga 15 years ago after a career in New York City and still bounces back and forth for gigs. Ouderkirk, a Maine native who moved to Saratoga as a kid, is also a multi-instrumentalist who plays baritone sax, alto sax, bass clarinet, clarinet, flute and piano.\nBut all of them sing — mezzo-soprano, give or take. All of them scat — that lively, flowing vocal improv that rolls out wordless syllables. All of them teach — with Ouderkirk offering lessons on the aforementioned instruments, plus voice. All of them have recordings — whether in the works or out in the world, online or on CD. And all of them have stories to tell as three of the region's busy female vocalists.\nThe bedrock of their trade is the lasting sturdiness and built-in flexibility of those tunes. \"You can sing the same song in about five totally different moods. These songs from the Great American Songbook — they are kind of amazing,\" Ouderkirk says. \"These 32-bar songs are like these little gems — a kind of beautiful little jewel box that you can open up, and change, and expose different facets of it. And of course in terms of improvisation, there are just endless possibilities.\"\nChoosing the right key is, well, key. \"You have to pick a key where you can go high or low,\" Broadwell explains. \"So if you're already too high, you can't improvise above that, and if you're already kinda low, you can't improvise below. You want the freedom to go in both directions.\" Adds O'Connor: \"It's very weird, the keys — like, a song can sound really different if it's just a step away.\" Or even a half-step.\nRewind four days to the Friday before. Ouderkirk is working an evening gig at Duke's Chophouse at Rivers Casino — just off the main floor with its pinging hubbub of people at tables and slot machines. Backed by pianist Tyler Giroux, she ticks through tunes like \"My Favorite Things\" and \"Isn't This A Lovely Day.\"\nOn the old torch song \"Stormy Weather,\" she scoops down low. On Henry Mancini's \"Lujon,\" she oozes through lyrics made famous by Sarah Vaughan. (\"His gaze swept over me now, a slow hot wind. Some days it's too warm to fight, a slow hot wind.\")\nOn Johnny Mercer and Victor Schertzinger's \"I Remember You,\" she scats with a saucy '40s zip.\nIn the middle of it, someone drops a plate near the kitchen — crash. Patrons glance over, then back at their food and drinks. Ouderkirk doesn't miss a beat.\nPeople don't always play close attention, the vocalists say. It depends on the venue and circumstances. At Caffe Lena and other venues with a musical focus: Always. In a place like Duke's, filled with people chewing and chatting: It's a little bit harder. There, as with wedding gigs, the music tends to be wallpaper. \"Sometimes people are listening, sometimes they're not,\" Ouderkirk says.\nPart of the issue: Not everyone is conversant in jazz. And so, working their patter between songs, the singers provide a little context and background — \"just some way to say, 'I get it, this is not the music that you grew up with, but check it out,'\" Ouderkirk says. Adds O'Connor: \"Sometimes, when I'm talking on the mic, I'll just try and say: 'You know, here's a song. When you were barely a gleam in your mother's eye, this song was popular. And this was the Imagine Dragons of its day.'\"\nHuge laughter from around the table.\nO'Connor often tosses a few jazzified pop songs into her set lists. The only problem? People have fixed ideas on how those classic tracks ought to sound. As she puts it, channeling a miffed listener: \"'I don't want to hear that Beatles song as a bossa nova!'\"\nMore huge laughter from around the table.\nTwo days after the gabfest in her dining room, O'Connor is plying her trade at Morton's Steakhouse at the Saratoga Casino Hotel. With a tight pair of instrumentalists behind her — Scott Bassinson on piano, Pete Toigo on bass — she renders tunes from Stevie Wonder, Jon Hendricks, Thelonious Monk.\n\"Here's one of the great songs from Rodgers and Hart — so this is my Valentine to you. 'My Funny Valentine,'\" she says. A man at the bar, nursing a glass of red wine, blurts: \"I love this song!\"\nIf you go\nUpcoming performances by Jeanne O'Connor, Jeanine Ouderkirk and Teresa Broadwell\nJeanne O'Connor (with Peg Delaney, keyboard):\nWhere: Duke's Chophouse at Rivers Casino, 1 Rush St., Schenectady.\nWhen: 5:30-9:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 18.\nWhere: Hamlet & Ghost, 24 Caroline St., Saratoga Springs\nWhen: 7-10 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 23\nTeresa Broadwell Trio (with Mike Novakowski, guitar, and Pete Toigo, bass)\nWhere: Stockade Inn, 1 Church St., Schenectady\nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 1.\nPeople are chewing and chatting, but they're also listening. Though the musicians have their backs to the cavernous lobby, the sound inside is warm and clear.\nO'Connor came to jazz, as so many do, via the masters of yore. \"I mean, it was really from listening to records,\" she says, back at the klatch in her home. \"And you know, I had a collision with a Sarah Vaughan record when I was, like, 20.\"\nBroadwell leans in. \"Which one?!\"\n\"That Clifford Brown. 1954?\"\n\"Oh, yeahhhhhhhh,\" Broadwell says.\n\"Yeah,\" O'Connor adds. \"And I was never the same.\"\nThe three of them smile and nod. This is how it starts. This is how jazz claims new converts. In the origin story of every jazz artist are two light bulb moments; the first is a collision with the music itself. The second is the moment when swing takes hold, when it stops being an assemblage of dotted rhythms and becomes a lifelong obsession.\nFor Broadwell, her swing epiphany took hold as a student at SUNY Potsdam's Crane School of Music (also Ouderkirk's alma mater), where she was studying in the music education program and fiddling in her downtime with old-time Appalachian music — the swingier stuff, she said.\nIt was maybe the third day of percussion class, \"and the professor wrote the triplets superimposed over the quarter note.\" That did it. \"That was when the light bulb went off. Like, to me I can go back to that moment and that day and say, 'Oh my God, that's what I'm trying to do!'\"\nShe still is. In an email later on, she states her philosophy this way: \"My goal is always to swing — and I try to seek out the swingingest music to play.\"\nFive days after the table chat, Broadwell is swinging hard at the Stockade Inn in Schenectady in a show organized by the Swingtime Jazz Society. Fiddling on some tunes, singing on all of them, she performs with sizable band: Mike Novakowski on guitar, Leo Russo on sax, Cliff Brucker on drums, Michael Lamkin on keyboard and Toigo, once again, on bass.\nThe show is an album-release party for Broadwell's latest: \"Just We,\" a collection of tunes inspired by Nat King Cole. The crowd is filled with members of the wider jazz scene, including several more from the loose sisterhood of female vocalists populating the Capital Region jazz scene: Bronte Roman, Eileen Mack and Patti Melita are all sitting or circulating, as is pianist Peggy Delaney.\nO'Connor and Bassinson listen from a table in the rear as Broadwell unfurls one sly tune after another: \"Just You, Just Me,\" \"Don't Let It Go To Your Head.\" She plays \"Skip It\" by the jazz violinist Stuff Smith — one of her heroes, and the subject of her master's thesis. After that, Horace Silver's \"Come On Home.\"\nShe rips through it. O'Connor snaps her fingers.\nThen Broadwell sings \"All of Me,\" but not the usual way. She sings it the way Eddie Jefferson sang it, with a comical word-flurry of desperate pleas (\"Don't be mean / I'll go insane / you don't want to have a crazy person on your conscience\"). It's classic \"vocalese,\" spraying rapid, rhythmic lyrics over an instrumental solo — one of Broadwell's specialties.\nShe rips through it. O'Connor taps her thigh.\nIt's the swingingest.\nfirstname.lastname@example.org • 518-454-5439 • @AmyBiancolli","|The Jazz Vocalists\nThe Roots (The Blues and the Big Band Singers)\nBessie Smith (Blues) 1920s\nLouis Armstrong (trumpet, Voice) (1901-1971)\nComing to prominence in the 20s as an innovative cornet and trumpet virtuoso, Armstrong was a foundational influence on jazz, shifting the music's focus from collective improvisation to solo performers. With his distinctive gravelly voice, Armstrong was an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, or wordless vocalizing.\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence, Armstrong's influence extended well beyond jazz, and by the end of his career in the '60s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general: critic Steve Leggett describes Armstrong as \"perhaps the most important American musician of the 20th century.\"\nElla fitzgerald (Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996, 78 years old))\nOne Note Samba\nGee Baby Ain’t I good to you (joe Pass and Ella)\nBillie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.\nNicknamed Lady Day by her sometime collaborator Lester Young, Holiday was a seminal influence on jazz and pop singing. Her vocal style — strongly inspired by instrumentalists — pioneered a new way of manipulating wording and tempo, and also popularized a more personal and intimate approach to singing.

He is cited among the most popular musical acts in history and is currently the most electronically recorded human voice in history.  Crosby is also credited as being the major inspiration for most of the male singers of the era that followed him, including Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, and Dean Martin. Yank magazine recognized Crosby as the person who had done the most for American G.I. morale during World War II and, during his peak years, around 1948, polls declared him the \"most admired man alive,\" ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. Also during 1948, the Music Digest estimated that Crosby recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.

{"question":"How do Jupyter Notebooks enhance data visualization capabilities, and what are the potential risks of data misrepresentation through visualization?","answer":"Jupyter Notebooks enhance data visualization by allowing users to display sophisticated visuals like HTML, SVG, and images directly after code execution. The notebooks can show tables, graphs, and other data visualizations that are crucial for understanding data, which cannot be done using plain command line. However, data visualization can also be manipulated to misrepresent reality. Common visualization tricks include truncating chart axes to exaggerate differences, using misleading 3D pie charts that distort proportions, and creating charts that mute or hide important insights through poor average representations. For example, 3D pie charts can make segments appear equal in size even when they represent significantly different quantities.","context":["A great data science tool that was initially created for Python is Jupyter Notebook. I like to think of it as a really sophisticated console combined with REPL programming. A notebook is a sequence of cells. Each cell may contain code, that can be executed and its output displayed right after the code. The context is kept from cell to cell i.e. variables declared in the first cell can be accessed from subsequent cells. The magic is in that while consoles can only display character based output, notebooks can display visuals, such as HTML, SVG and images. This is extremely important with data science where visualization is key to understanding the data. Notebooks, when used in data science, typically display tables, graphs and other data visualizations. It cannot be done using plain old command line.\nThis is just the basics. Here are some features that make notebooks really cool:\n- You can execute and re-execute code. The output is stored in the notebook\n- You can add markdown cells, documenting the work you do. This makes notebooks a really good tool for demonstrating code and programming ideas\n- You can set checkpoints while developing the notebook and rollback to them if whatever you did trashed the notebook\n- You can download the notebook in various formats (HTML, PDF etc.) and share them. You can view an HTML download with the code in this post here.\nDstools NPM Package\nI created a node package named\ndstools package, but our tutorial relies on it.\nThe Tutorial Data\nWe are done with the introduction. Let’s start coding.\nInstalling Jupyter Notebook\nFirst, we will need to install the Jupyter Notebook. This is a Python based web server used to manage, create and use Jupyter notebooks. The notebook’s interface is web based. You can find installation instructions over here. Note that the recommended installation method is using Anaconda. Anaconda is a Python package management and distribution tool. Jupyter is included in the Anaconda distribution.\nAfter installing Jupyter, you can start the notebook server\nWrite the following totally unpredictable code into the cell:\nand the text will appear in your notebook.\nAs you can see, the output is printed after the code cell.\n$$ that can be used for notebook communication and display. For example, the following code prints HTML output. This is a screen shot of the code cell and the output following it:\nInstalling dstools package\nWe will need the\ndstools package in order to run this tutorial. The package should be installed from the same directory of the notebook. Simple install it using npm.\nEditing a notebook is pretty straight forward. You can use buttons, menus or shortcuts. Executing the selected cell is done using Ctrl+Enter. If for some reason the kernel is stuck or you just need to restart the kernel, use the Kernel menu item for restart.\nSo let’s get started.\nLoading the Data\nData Science doesn’t mean much without the data. In this tutorial we are using the House Prices dataset hosted by Kaggle. Download the train.csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data. Have a look at the data fields description to better understand the data. Download the file and store it in your file system.\nMost datasets are stored in csv format. We will use the dstools package to load the data.\nds.Collection function creates a collection wrapper object. The various dstools functions can then be chained to the wrapper object, just like jQuery functions are chained to the jQuery object. We are using here the\nloadCSVfunction to load the data. It is stored inside the wrapper as an array of objects, each object representing a data point. The objects properties are the data point features (or fields).\nIt is useful to view the first few rows to get a feel for the data. The head function returns a collection with the first n rows. the\nshow function displays the data table.\nEach row is a data point representing a house sale. There are quite a few fields (features) for each data point. The most important field is the last one, SalePrice. A description of the data fields can be found in the “data description.txt” file in the data repository. Some fields are quantitative, i.e. they have a numerical value, like SalePrice. Others represents categories like PavedDrive which can be one of Y (yes), P (partial) or N (no). A description of the possible categories for each field can be found in the “description.text” file.\nNext, we want to better understand the house price feature of our data collection. A significant concept in statistics is distribution.\nprobability distribution is a mathematical function that, stated in simple terms, can be thought of as providing the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. For instance, if the random variable X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (“the experiment”), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails (assuming the coin is fair).\nFirst, we will use the dstools function\ndescribe to get some basic understanding of the HousePrice distribution. The\ndescribe function shows the most important distribution measures.\nWe can see the mean value is about 180,921 with standard deviation of 79,415. The quartiles gives us a better understanding of the prices the bulk of the houses were sold for. 50% of the houses were sold for prices between 129,900 and 214,000 (between the 25% and 75% quartiles).\nThe describe function gave us a general idea of the distribution, but we would really like to visualize the distribution. Seeing is believing is understanding. We use histograms for that.\nplotly function to the data wrapper. You can find documentation for using plotly here. When using plotly with dstools, the\nplotly function creates the HTML visualization. You need to chain it with the\nshow function to display the plot. The\nplotly function replaces\nyproperties with the column data (this our case, the column ‘SalePrice’). If the value of\nthis, its value is set to the contained data itself. This is useful when wrapping vectors rather than datasets.\nThe histogram sorts all house prices and puts them in bins. Each bin represents a range of prices. The Y axis shows how many data points are in each bin.\nThe dstools module provides convenience functions for all visualizations in this tutorial including histograms. The histogram\nfunction takes one argument, the name of the field to show in the histogram.\nFrom viewing the histogram, we can see that the sale price distribution is centered around 126K. We can also see that the distribution is skewed, or asymmetrical. Here’s what Wikipedia has to say about skewness:\nIn probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined.\nSkewness value of 0 means the distribution is not skewed. A negative skewness indicates that the distribution is left skewed and a positive skewness indicates the distribution is right skewed.\nWe can measure skewness using the skewness function. Skewness is a primitive value (number), so there is no need to chain the\nAnother interesting measure of distribution is kurtosis, measuring the tailedenss of the distribution. In Wikipedia’s words:\nIn probability theory and statistics, kurtosis (from Greek: κυρτός, kyrtos or kurtos, meaning “curved, arching”) is a measure of the “tailedness” of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable\nThe higher the value, the more data points are in the tail and the tail is longer. Normal distribution has the value of 0.\nIt is possible, of course, to show histograms of categorical fields such as PavedDrive. The histogram will show the number of data points with each PavedDrive category. Not surprisingly, almost all sales were of houses with paved drives.\nFinding Relationships Between Features\nSo we understand now the distribution of house prices, but we are really interested in exploring the relationships between the different features. We want to understand how the prices of houses relate to other features such as Lot Area, the year the house was built or if the house has a fireplace.\nThe first tool we will use is the correlation map. Let’s start with the Wikipedia definition of correlation:\nIn statistics, dependence or association is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. Correlation is any of a broad class of statistical relationships involving dependence, though in common usage it most often refers to how close two variables are to having a linear relationship with each other. Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the physical statures of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the demand for a product and its price.\nThe correlation map is a heat map showing the correlation between all data point features. the\ncorrmap function generates the correlation map for all data fields\nCorrelation can be in the range of -1 and 1. A value of 1 means the features are positively correlated i.e. they move in the same direction. Zero correlation means the featurs are not related. Negative correlation means when the value of one feature rises, the value of the other feature falls. Positive correlations are in red. Negative correlations are in blue. The correlation between two identical features is always 1. You can see that in the map with the diagonal red line.\nFrom the correlation map we can see that “Total basement area” and “first floor area” are positively correlated. This is because the basement is usually on first floor. The features “total room above ground”, “living area” and “overall quality” are positively correlated with “sale price”. The largest the living area, the more expensive the house is. The feature “year built” is negatively correlated with the feature “enclosed porch area”. This means, newer houses have smaller porches.\nCorrelation maps are great at directing our attention to interesting relationships between features. We use the scatter plot for understanding the nature of the relationship between the features. We noticed the correlation between living area and house price. Let’s view a scatter plot of the two features.\nThe X axis represents SalePrice. The Y axis, above ground living area. The correlation is now clear. You can image a line representing the relationship between sale price and area. You can also see the specific points that are distant from the line, like the two points between 100k and 200k at the top. These data points do not follow the general rule.\nScatter plots are good for comparing two continuous features but less so for categorical features. We can use the boxplot for that.\nIn this example, each box represents all data points with a particular quality score, between 1 and 10. The line in the center of the box is the median. The bottom box border is the 25% percentile and the top box border is the 75% percentile. This gives us a good idea of where 50% of the data points are (inside the box). The whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values, excluding outliers. Outliers are data point that are significantly distant from the rest of the data (more than 1.5 X interquartile range above or underneath the box). They are rendered separately. You can see, data points with overall quality of 8 have 4 outliers, 3 above the top whisker and 1 underneath the bottom whisker. Read here for a more detailed explanation of box plots.\nNotice that connecting the boxes creates an imaginary line, but the line is not straight. It is more like a log line. This indicates that the relationship between the two features is not linear but more like log. We can plot the log of the sale price instead of the actual sale price replacing the string\nSalePrice with a function.\nNow we can see the boxes are closer to an imaginary straight line.\nOriginal.

It’s cold, objective, accurate.\nIn reality though it’s more complicated. In the hands of someone with an agenda, data can be weaponized to back up that viewpoint. Even in the hands of someone benevolent, data can be misinterpreted in dangerous ways.\nSomeone who wants to win an argument using data can usually do so.\n“I like data because it helps me win arguments” – Never has a phrase better revealed someone who doesn’t get value from data\n— Andrew Anderson (@antfoodz) January 6, 2015\nPro Tip: Be Skeptical\nIn 1958, Darrell Huff wrote a bestselling book called “How to Lie With Statistics,” so this stuff isn’t necessarily new to our age of #bigdata. Most of the same lies, cheats, and misrepresentations still exist today (there’s also a whole Wikipedia page on “misuse of statistics”).\nData deception can occur for a variety of reasons, some benevolent and some not. Wikipedia lists a few possible causes here:\n- The source is a subject matter expert, not a statistics expert.\n- The source is a statistician, not a subject matter expert.\n- The subject being studied is not well defined.\n- Data quality is poor.\n- The popular press has limited expertise and mixed motives.\n- “Politicians use statistics in the same way that a drunk uses lamp-posts—for support rather than illumination” – Andrew Lang\nAnd to add one, as Andrew Anderson’s tweet mentioned above, sometimes people are simply motivated to prove their points. Data can be a trump card when it comes to certain debates, so the message gets skewed by the messenger.\nThis goes beyond misinterpreting A/B testing statistics (though you should certainly brush up on the basics there). There are wider and broader offenses of data deception. And marketers don’t just spread mistruths to others. We use data to lie to ourselves as well.\nTo be a better consumer and user of data, you should know these misdirections.\nHere are some of the most prevalent mistakes I’ve seen.\nAlways Check the Sample\nWhen presented with an interesting statistic, one must examine how the data was collected.\nFor example, in A/B testing, since we can’t measure ‘true conversion rate,’ we have to select a sample that is statistically representative of the whole. This applies for all methods of data collection, including surveys. Sampling is used to infer answers about the whole population.\nTo explain this, Matt Gershoff gives the example of cups of coffee. Say we have two cups of coffee and we want to know which one is hotter and by how much. All you need to do is measure the temperature of the two cups and subtract the lower temperature coffee from the higher one to see the difference. Very simple.\nBut if you wanted to discover, “which place in my town has the hotter coffee, McDonald’s or Starbucks?” you’d have a statistics question. Essentially, you’d want to collect a representative sample that is large enough to infer the results of the whole population.\nThe more cups we measure, the more likely it is that the sample is representative of the actual temperature. The variance shrinks with a larger sample size, and it’s more likely that our mean will be accurate.\nSo sampling can be a primary source of problems in bad data. It usually comes down to samples that are too small or unrepresentative of a population. In addition, it’s easy to cherry pick your sample and your data to get the answer you’d like.\nSmall Sample Sizes\nIn conversion optimization, it’s easy to be fooled by small sample size. Often it comes in the form of celebratory case studies where the company “lifted conversions by 400%.” As Tywman’s Law suggests, if the data is too surprising, there’s probably something wrong with it.\nThat’s usually the case in experimentation. As Peep Laja, founder of CXL, put it in a previous blog post:\nThat’s why you’ll see smart marketers calling out case studies with missing data or that seem too absurd to be true. That’s why case studies on WhichTestWon or LeadPages were such a problem, especially for new marketers who have yet to develop a hardened, cynical worldview actually questions the results.\nTo combat this problem, first, check your own data and don’t publish rubbish case studies. But on the consumption side, always be skeptical about other people’s test results, especially if they seem too good to be true.\nSurveys are a major culprit of using unrepresentative “convenience” samples (and small samples). That’s why you should be especially skeptical when you’re viewing the results of attitudinal surveys (“X percent of people say Y”).\nTomi Mester, who writes the Data36, blog gave an example of a fictional character, Clara, who needs to do research for a University class:\nCherry Picking Segments or Biasing Samples\nThis is pretty similar to the above case of unrepresentative samples, but it’s a bit more conscious. Essentially, if you want to make a point, you can pollute the sample with biased measurements, or you can cherry pick after the fact to prove your point.\nMarket researchers – well, marketers in general – can be deceiving from the start. If you choose a sample that is likely to be skewed attitudinally in your favor, it’s very easy to come up with nice marketing sound bites.\n- If you only survey your best customers, it’s easy to find that most of them prefer your software to others.\n- If you only analyze top cohorts, it’s easy to prove your campaign is effective.\n- If you only look at top performing segments in an experiment, it’s easy to call it a winner.\nProper sampling is hard to do, especially the further you venture out into the real world as opposed to lab controlled experiments. When data simply sounds weird, question the sampling. When you analyze your own data, be careful not to cherry pick to prove your points. In summary, know that much of the questionable data you read about in news stories has a solid chance of being affected by bad sampling. From How to Lie with Statistics:\nCorrelations ≠ Causation\nOne of the easiest ways to be fooled by data is to assume that correlation implies causation. Just because two variables have a high correlational coefficient does not mean they’re related in a meaningful way, let alone causal.\nSome of my favorite examples come from a website that chronicles spurious correlations. This one shows that Nicholas Cage movies are highly correlated with swimming pool drownings:\nCorrelational data can be valuable, especially in experiment ideation. Say you find that people who download a certain PDF are worth much more money to you over the long term. Well, a simple experiment would attempt to get more people to download the PDF and see what the results are.\nThe problem, though, is when you take these correlational observations at face value. Ronny Kohavi, Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft, gave the following example in a recent presentation:\nThe larger your palm, the shorter you will live, on average (with high statistical significance).\nYou wouldn’t believe there’s any causality in this case, right? Of course not. There’s a common cause: women have smaller palms and live six years longer on average.\nAs Kohavi put it, “obviously you wouldn’t have believed that palm size is causal, but how about observational studies about features in products reducing churn?”\nIn addition, these sorts of correlations turn up all the time in popular media. “X is associated with Y.”\nJordan Ellenberg gave an example in How Not to Be Wrong: say you have two binary variables “are you a smoker?” and “are you married?”\nYou find, after doing this research (with the proper and representative sample) that smokers are less likely than the average person to be married. This gets reported as such, and that’s where the confusion starts. As Ellenberg puts it, you can safely express this by saying, “if you’re a smoker, you’re less likely to be married.”\nBut one small change to this sentence would make the meaning very different, “if you were a smoker, you’d be less likely to be married.”\nThe second statement infers causality, which the original study did nothing to confirm. But when reading a sound bite like that, many would understand it to be the latter statement: “if you smoke, you’re more likely to be single.”\nPost Hoc and Other Storytelling Methods\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc, or “after this, therefore, because of this,” is a post hoc fallacy that establishes causation where there is only correlation. It looks backward in time and says, “this happened earlier, therefore it caused what followed to happen.”\nIt’s essentially a narrative fallacy, a method of storytelling by which you can explain past events, though your explanations likely have no bearing on reality.\nThe best explanation I’ve found of this comes from The West Wing:\nCandide by Voltaire also makes a comical case of the post hoc fallacy:\n“It is demonstrable that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles.”\nIt’s easy in marketing to say that certain actions caused certain results. Often, though, it’s simple storytelling.\nFor instance, analytics data tends to be seasonal. So if you’re starting your work at the bottom of a peak, it’s very like that any action will make it look like it’s increasing your metrics:\nThis is largely why we A/B test in the first place. If we could simply change things on the site and measure their impact, without the impact of seasonality and external validity factors, life would be much easier.\nBut if you change your hero image (without testing) and your conversion rate goes up, it doesn’t necessarily mean the hero image change caused that. “Post hoc, ergo proctor hoc.”\nAverages Can Lie\nAs the joke goes, “Bill Gates walks into a bar and everyone inside becomes a millionaire…on average.”\nHere’s the thing about the word average. Technically, it can mean a few different things. Colloquially, it’s less formal and tends towards meaning “prototypical,” or “most people,” or the most common representative of a set.\nBut mathematically, an average can be three different things:\n- Mean average\n- Median average\n- Mode average\nIf you have a set of numbers, say 3, 3, 5, 4, and 7, the mean would be 4.4 ((3+3+5+4+7)/5), the median would be 4 (since two of the numbers are higher than 4 and two are lower), and the mode would be 3 (since it occurs most frequently).\nWhile they all have their appropriate use cases for understanding data, problems occur when you choose one that misrepresents a data set. Most commonly, that occurs when a data set has a few outliers that skew the mean (such as with the Bill Gates example).\nA frequent example is with average salaries. Salary tends to be a metric that doesn’t fall on a normal distribution – rather, a few people make a ton of money and that skews the mean.\nOutliers can affect A/B test results as well, particular when you’re optimizing for a metric like average order value or revenue per visitor.\nI wrote a whole article on dealing with outliers in data a while back that goes through specific solutions, especially with regard to A/B testing.\nAverages can also mute your insights at times. Average click-through-rates, bounce rates, conversion rates, customer satisfaction numbers don’t tell a ton (which is why I’m not a fan of NPS in its aggregate form).\nIn addition, average conversion rates can, at times, hide gold mines of insights. So, look at the segments (but be careful not to cherrypick and make sure to account for multiple comparisons problem). These insights can be the beginning steps of a robust personalization program. As Peep put it in a previous article:\nCommon Data Visualization Tricks to Watch Out For\nThis is a whole section because it’s so easy to manipulate data by visualizing it. Data visualization is about storytelling, and it can be used for good or for evil. Most often, data visualization is simply inept and you’re looking at convoluted charts that mean nothing to anyone except the analyst.\nFrom time to time, you get some beautiful dataviz work like this (Berlin subway map compared to its real geography):\nBut then it also happens that you get some visualizations like this:\nFunnily enough, a lot of the offenders are prominent journalists and media outlets. It’s unclear whether they’re simply unaware of their offense of if they’re purposely propelling these misleading graphs into the public to get more clicks.\nBut in any case, the visualization tends to be a primary source of confusion and misrepresentations of reality. Here are some of my favorite offenders…\nThere are more ways pie charts can go wrong than go right. That’s why they are almost universally derided by analysts. When in doubt, it’s usually smart to avoid pie charts.\nWhy? They’re hard to read. They can easily distort proportions. Look at this example comparing pie charts that are seemingly the same, yet the corresponding bar charts show a much different story.\nIt’s even worse when they’re 3D pie charts, as the emphasis is largely misrepresented by the closer segments of the pie. For example, this chart makes it seems as if the teal and red portions are about the same size, even though in terms of quantity, red is a decent amount lower:\nThat’s not to say pie charts are always bad all the time, though. They’re great for demonstrating simple proportions:\n— Randy Olson (@randal_olson) November 5, 2015\nIf you want to make the difference between two data sets look larger than it actually is, truncate the chart. Here’s an example from Data36:\nHuge difference, right? Well, here’s the same data with the Y axis starting at zero:\nHow you visualize data can have a massive effect on how the recipient of the data interprets it. That’s why data visualization is such an important skill set for an analysts. Whether because of ignorance or malice, poor data visualization can cripple understanding.\nHere’s the graph from Fox News:\nBut here’s what it should look like:\n“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” – Benjamin Disraeli\nJust because it’s “data” doesn’t mean it is truthful. Just because it’s quantitative doesn’t mean it’s objective.\nI’ve gone over some common examples of data abuse in this post, but the more important point is: be skeptical. Question data. Be curious. You don’t need to accept things at face value.\nAs a citizen and consumer of data, being critical helps you sift out truth in the world. As a marketer, optimizer, or analyst, it helps you make sure you’re delivering truth in the world. It’s a crucial skill set."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9046dc97-9fd6-430b-add4-35a9cf3b5cd2>","<urn:uuid:88378378-eb62-4231-8550-6351ad4d30a5>"],"error":null}

Annually, he delivered a lecture on evolution called “From Cadillac, By Way of Kalamazoo, to You,” that used local references to explain evolution. The lecture was so popular that it drew standing room only crowds of students, faculty, staff and locals. Over the years, we have had repeated requests for copies of the lecture and we are now pleased to say that a 1976 recording of the talk is now available for streaming at https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/media_objects/t722hs36h!\n- The talented playwright and lyricist Howard Ashman earned his master’s degree at Indiana University in 1974. He went on to have an extremely successful career working with creative partner Alan Menken on such well-known works as Disney’s Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, which came out after his death. In 1987, Ashman returned to his alma mater for a production of Little Shop of Horrors (Ashman wrote the book and lyrics for the musical). While on campus, he sat down with faculty member R. Keith Michael for an interview; a number of clips from the interview were used in the 2020 documentary Howard. https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/media_objects/9s161p314\nC234: Indiana University Student Association (147 items): Consists largely of recordings of IUSA congressional meetings.

The Mu Chapter was established at Indiana University in 1929. The Archives holds a nice collection of its records spanning 1927-2008, which includes two recordings. The first one is a slideshow of photos from some of the group’s 1998 activities; the second one, dated 1985, is a recording from a larger APO event held in Boston. The camera scans the crowd as they sing what is likely the APO song. Access level: IU due to the music in both recordings but outside researchers can contact us for access!\nThis seems like enough for this update. Look for part two soon!","Ideally the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and research would be accommodated in a general research framework and best practice. This is not always the case and therefore this ethical framework for Interactive Essays will specifically focus on using digital tools and social media platforms for research activity, recruitment and communication with research participants and networking and dissemination of work for feedback. The British Educational Research Association (BERA) resource on ‘Ethical issues in online research’ (Jones, 2011) provide some clear distinctions:\n- The Internet as a tool for research\n- The Internet as a means to conduct research\n- The Internet as a medium for research\n- The Internet as a locale for research\n- The Internet as a means to distribute research\nThere are a number of challenges facing both the researcher, ethics committees and participants. In part, it is our own lack of knowledge about our own digital footprints: what data we create, how it is stored, how securely it is stored and who can access it, ‘Digital data can be analysed and reanalysed in ways that may not be anticipated or expected by individuals whose personal information is part of the large data sets that are being produced’ (Clark et al, 2015:4). This lack of knowledge we might have with our own data may lead to a complacency of how we might use others’ data. It is therefore critical that researchers (staff and students) apply an ethical framework to digital environments and virtual world, especially as useful data may just be there in the public domain. This, Davies et al (2016) describe as the ‘messy and often confusing definitions of the private and the public’, they ask us to rethink concepts of informed consent and confidentiality and work with this messiness. The British Sociological Associations position in their ‘Ethics Guidelines and Collated Resources for Digital Research’ asks for ‘discretion, flexibility and innovation’ (Davies et al (2015:3)\nThere are challenges with participants being Identifiable with their online information and how their online identity might link across platforms as well as the difficulty in authenticating online identities (Clark et al 2015) The security and privacy of data is not in the control of the researcher and what might be an advantage to be able to recruit participants globally becomes an issue with variance in geographic laws. The National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia updated their National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research in 2014 and identified five key categories pertinent to research that uses digital data in Clark et al (2015:7):\n- Consent (‘How easy is it to get informed consent from the participants in the community being researched?’ The ESRC framework for research ethics in Davies et al (2015))\n- Privacy and confidentiality (How are issues of identifiability addressed? as well as data storage identified in Davies et al (2015))\n- Ownership and authorship (authorship, the obligation to credit authorship and copyright in Davies et al, 2015)\n- Governance and custodianship (Identified as ‘legal and cultural differences across jurisdictions, online rules of conduct and the blurring of boundaries between public and private domains’ from the The British Psychological Society (BPS) and the British Society of Criminology (BSC) in Davies et al (2015)).\n- Data sharing: assessing the social benefits of research\n‘How certain is the researcher that they can establish the ‘real’ identity of the participants?’ was also raised as an issue by the ESRC framework for research ethics in Davies et al (2015:5)\nShaping an Ethical Framework for Interactive Essays\nA discussion of the issues around ethical practices and the Interactive Essay were discussed with students:\nUsing digital platforms and the internet for research:\n- Importance of developing skills for effective research practice online\n- Developing skills for accurate citation and referencing of material found online\n- Making sure that sources are credible\n- Developing skills to retrieve, store and organise research materials\n- Support the development of online skills with opportunities throughout the curriculum\n- Ensure students have access to appropriate technologies and staff to support them\n- Have discussions around ‘digital wisdom’ throughout the curriculum through challenging notions of ‘digital natives’ and ‘digital immigrants’\n- Include CRAP detection as part of the curriculum: Howard Rheingold’s ‘Crap Detection 101: How to tell accurate information from inaccurate information, misinformation, and disinformation’\nConducting research with online participants:\n- In the recruitment of research participants signature documentation must be obtained as part of the ‘informed consent process’\n- Subjects of research are entitled to withdraw from participation at any time\n- How safe is the data collected\n- Identify a specified time-period within which you will ensure the safe and secure storage of the data\n- How to research in closed groups\n- Does the study involve participants who are children under the age of 16 or vulnerable young people or adults who are unable to give informed consent?\n- Problems with participants’ rights to remain anonymous, and/or ensuring that the information they provide is non-identifiable\n- If you are working in a cross cultural setting, will you need to gain additional knowledge about the setting to work effectively?\n- The researcher might not know the demographic of the online participants\n- Obtaining consent in online spaces might be difficult unless they are willing to sign documents and return them by post or scan and return online/email. Active participation is not consent\n- Participants contributions may be difficult to remove completely and remain online or been reproduced elsewhere. However the consent to use this data may be withdrawn and should be respected\n- It is important that consent is informed consent and this should include information about what can happen to data online. Familiarity with platform/tool data protection, privacy and security is essential and researchers have a responsibility to explain these. There may also be different regulations depending on the location of the participant or the location of the tool/platform\n- The research may have a particular timeframe but the data will exist online long term. It is important that researchers and participants are informed about their own ‘digital footprints’\n- If the information is on a public platform this may be accessed and used by others\n- Important to be aware of what closed and open systems are online, for example the course Moodle page and a private group on Facebook are closed networks where individuals understand their information is kept within that group. If research is undertaken in that setting then consent from all members of that group would be necessary.\n- It is difficult to ascertain in an online setting the identity and age of participants. They might be under 16 years and not able to give consent or vulnerable adults. Signed consent might provide some assurance but not necessarily. Particular care would need to be taken if the research is likely to cause distress.\n- Knowing who participants really are might cause some issues with the reliability of the data collected, however this is no different to other anonymous methods of data collection.\n- Anonymising participants identities might not be possible if participants can be identified by their social media tags/identities.Participants personal data might be accessible depending on their security settings\nSharing work online and networking:\n- Awareness of closed and open groups\n- Being comfortable with sharing work online\n- Managing critique in online spaces\nThe curriculum should include discussion and experience of working in closed and open networking and community spaces so that students can make informed decisions about what information they share\nThe networking element of the interactive essay is optional as students might not be comfortable sharing their work outside the programme. An awareness of their own ‘digital footprint’ or not feeling ready to share academic work publicly needs to be supported\nIf students do share their work online it is important for them to consider how they encourage participation and feedback from others. Students need to be aware that they may receive negative comments and ensure they have mastery over the settings on their sites. For example comments can be for moderation only and the student can choose what they publish.\nUseful links to Digital Ethics Guidance:\nAssociation of Internet Researchers (AoIR): https://aoir.org/\n- 2012: Ethical decision-making and Internet research 2.0: Recommendations from the AoIR ethics working committee\n- 2012: This chartprovides a useful starting point for internet researchers to consider ethics.\nThe Internet Research Ethics Digital Library, Resource Center and Commons.\nThe Research Ethics Guidebook: A resource for social scientists. http://www.ethicsguidebook.ac.uk/Online-research-102\nE-Research ethics. http://eresearch-ethics.org/about/\nSocial Science Research Ethics: Web-based research. http://www.lancs.ac.uk/researchethics/7-1-webres.html\nClark, K.

{"question":"What are the advantages and limitations of red dot versus laser sights, and what are safety implications?","answer":"Red dot sights offer quick target acquisition but have limitations - their dots cover 1-5 inches at 100 yards and become useless if batteries die. While good for informal shooting and hunting, they lack precision. Lasers can be effective when used with scopes but are hard to see in bright conditions and their beams are only visible in fog. From a safety perspective, these targeting systems have different risk levels - red dots are optical devices with no external emissions, while lasers, particularly in Class 4 operation, require extensive safety measures including designated safety officers, controlled areas, protective equipment, and regular safety audits due to potential hazardous laser energy exposure.","context":["By B.B. Pelletier\nYou hear the terms “red dot” and “laser” in reference to airgun sights, but what are they? Are they the same thing, or are they really different?\nThey are actually two very different things. A red dot sight is an optical sight, while the laser is not a sight at all, although it can be used as one under the right conditions. Let’s take them one at a time.\nRed dot sights\nA red dot sight like the Leapers 40mm dot sight is similar to a scope with a single red (or sometimes green) dot of light (instead of crosshairs) in the center of the field of view. In the case of the Leapers sight, the color of the dot can be changed from red to green. All dots are generated by a tiny light source inside the red dot unit, so a battery is involved. If the battery goes dead, as it will when you forget to turn off the dot after use, the sight is useless.\nThe dot is projected on a transparent glass screen inside the sight. Unless you look through the eyepiece, it is impossible to see the dot. The image of the Crosman 0290 red dot sight shows this.\nTypically, there is no magnification with a red dot sight. It’s like looking through a widow at your target. It’s easier to acquire your target but also less precise than a scope. The bright dot is also easier to see than a pair of black lines, especially when the target is also dark.\nThe dot in a red dot sight is too large for precision sighting. The smallest dots cover about an inch at 100 yards, while others can cover as much as five inches. Some dot sights have dots whose intensity can be varied, and the size of the dot grows as it becomes brighter.\nA red dot sight is good for informal shooting and for hunting where rapid shots will be fired. It is the quickest of all sights to acquire and, as such, is a favorite of hunters.\nLasers are lights!\nA laser is a type of light that projects out. Because of the way the light waves are arranged, a laser remains focused in a tiny pinpoint of light over a great distance.\nThere is nothing to look through with a laser. Shine the laser at your target and see where the dot falls. If the gun is sighted to shoot where the dot shines, a pull of the trigger sends the bullet downrange to the dot. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it? But, there’s more to know.\nIt’s almost impossible to see the laser beam until it shines on something. Only in a fog does the beam actually show itself. It’s therefore difficult to know exactly where the laser is pointing. When used in conjunction with a scope, a laser can be very effective, because the scope shows you where the laser will shine, as long as both the scope and the laser are sighted-in.\nLow-cost lasers such as the Daisy Laser Sight can be hard to see at long distances in a bright room. Only high-quality lasers such as the AirForce LS-1 Laser are bright enough to use outdoors in daytime.\nYou may need both types of sights\nBoth red dot sights and lasers require sighting-in. Like scopes, they must be adjusted to a specific distance to coincide with the strike of the pellet. Each has its uses and both are fun. Depending on the type of shooting you do – hunting, target shooting or plinking – and the time of day you shoot – nighttime or daytime – you may need red dots and lasers to get the most out of shooting.","Class 4 Conversion Module\nLaser safety standards are well established and relatively harmonized internationally. These harmonized standards establish four broad classifications of laser safety for products. The classifications range from Class 1 in which the laser energy is fully contained within the laser system and the operator is not exposed to any laser energy, to Class 4 in which the laser system does not have containment provisions and the operator can potentially be exposed to high levels of laser energy. To process materials in a Class 1 laser system, the material must fit completely within the laser system enclosure.\nThe patented Class 4 Conversion Module is an option that allows the user to quickly and easily convert a laser system between fully enclosed Class 1 operation and open Class 4 operation, allowing the user to place oversized objects in the laser system for laser material processing or pass continuous objects such as rolls of material or conveyor systems through the laser system.\nThis module provides the following benefits to the user:\n- Increased Material Handling Flexibility and Productivity\nProvides a convenient and safe way to process a variety of material sizes and form factors that normally could not be processed in a closed Class 1 system.\n- Improved Safety and Reduced Liability\nComplies with all laser safety standards required for class 4 laser operation when operating in open Class 4 mode.\nHow the Class 4 Conversion Module Works\nULTRA platforms are equipped with interlocked access doors on either side of the laser system. The optional Class 4 Conversion Module allows use of these platforms with the side doors open by bypassing the safety interlocks on the side doors. With this module installed, the protective system housing is left open, creating the potential for exposure to errant laser energy. Use of this optional device changes the safety classification of the laser system from Class 1, which is considered safe for use under all conditions, to Class 4, which is considered potentially hazardous. Due to these potential hazards, laser safety standards require additional safeguards to be built into laser systems operating in Class 4 mode that are normally not present on Class 1 laser systems. The Class 4 Conversion Module provides these additional safeguards so the laser system meets Class 4 and safety audit requirements.\nIncreased Material Handling Capability\nAwareness of laser materials processing is growing at a rapid pace and as awareness grows, the need to process materials in different form factors and in more productive ways grows as well.\nPrior to the introduction of the Class 4 Conversion Module, which is exclusive to ULS laser systems, there were two methods for handling larger material. One approach was to purchase a Class 1 laser system large enough to completely contain the largest material a user expected to process. This drives up cost and makes for an inefficient use of space and resources, especially if oversize parts are not processed very frequently. The other approach was to purchase an open bed, certified Class 4 laser system. The drawback of operating an always open Class 4 laser system is the added risk and liability of operating continuously in Class 4 mode. Also, there is the burden of the additional safety protocols the user must practice along with the cost and maintenance of safety equipment. In some locations, routine inspections by safety inspectors may even be required to operate Class 4 laser systems.\nAn ideal solution for occasional processing of larger materials is a smaller Class 1 laser system that can be legitimately operated in Class 4 mode when needed. Less scrupulous manufacturers will look the other way when customers bypass safety interlocks on Class 1 laser systems or even hint to customers that this is an acceptable practice to process oversized materials. However, a Class 1 system with safety features bypassed is not equipped with the required safety features to operate in Class 4 mode and would never pass safety audits. ULS has solved this problem with its unique, patented Class 4 conversion module which adds all of the required safety features necessary to operate an open laser system in Class 4 mode. This module can be added and removed from the laser system in minutes thereby allowing the user to operate in true Class 4 mode only when necessary - providing complete flexibility.\nAn additional benefit of the Class 4 Conversion Module is the ability to convert a laser system to operate permanently in true Class 4 mode. This feature, in conjunction with the ULS Automation Interface option, allows a laser system to be safely integrated into a high productivity manufacturing environment. Laser based production processes can be developed on a Class 1 laser system in small batches and the same laser system can be easily converted to higher productivity with the addition of material handling equipment such as shuttles or roll feeds without a large investment in new and different laser systems.\nImproved Safety and Reduce Liability\nThere are many mandatory safety measures required under internationally recognized laser safety standards. These safety measures must be complied with when operating a Class 4 laser system. Certain safety measures are the responsibility of the manufacturer and are integrated into the optional Class 4 Conversion Module, including the following:\n- Remote Interlock Connection\nA means of remotely connecting to the interlock circuit of the laser system allowing connection of remote switches to the laser system for deactivating the laser. This feature must be used to connect an interlock switch to the doors of the designated room in which the laser system will be operated so that the laser is automatically deactivated when the doors are open.\n- Key Control\nA removable key that prevents unauthorized operation of the laser system when in Class 4 mode.\n- Laser Energy Emission Warning Device\nA visible warning light that indicates when the laser is capable of emitting laser energy.\nA mechanical device to block emission of laser energy. This device takes the form of a shutter which is manually operated.\n- Class 4 Warning Label\nA Class 4 warning label to indicate the laser system is classified as Class 4.\nIn addition to the requirements placed on the manufacture of Class 4 laser systems discussed above, there are certain operational safety measures that are the responsibility of owners of the laser systems operating in Class 4 mode. As part of the sales process for purchasing a Class 4 conversion module from ULS, information is provided to the user describing their responsibilities and ULS experts are available to answer any questions. These safety measures are mandatory for operation of Class 4 laser devices under Federal and State law in the United States as well as under the laws of most other countries. Many of these safety measures are outlined in ANSI Standard Z136.1 “American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers” or in equivalent standards available in most other countries, such as the European Standard EN 60825-1. Other safety measures may be required by state and/or local authorities, for example, the Regulation BGV B2 on laser beams of the German Employer’s Liability Insurance Association. It is the responsibility of the Owner to understand and adhere to these laws. A brief synopsis of the most common safety requirements addressed to Owners of a Class 4 laser is outlined below:\n- In any facility in which a Class 4 laser system is to be operated, an individual must be designated as a Laser Safety Officer (“LSO”) who will assume the authority and responsibility to monitor and enforce the control of laser hazards. The individual designated as the LSO should be trained in laser safety and aware of all safety measures set by law. There are many avenues available to acquire this training. Recognized sources of this training are the Laser Institute of America (www.laserinstitute.org), the Employer’s Insurance Liability Associations in the European countries or, laser safety associations within Owner’s country or territory.\n- The Owner of the Class 4 laser system will be responsible for creation of a controlled area in which a Class 4 laser system will be operated. A controlled area is an area designed to fully contain the laser energy potentially escaping from a Class 4 laser system and with measures in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the area including lighted warning signs outside the designated and controlled area and interlocks on entryways.\n- The LSO will be responsible for designating and training all personnel authorized to operate, maintain or service a Class 4 laser system. It will also be the responsibility of the LSO to take measures to inform and restrict all unauthorized personnel from access to a Class 4 laser system.\n- The Owner of the Class 4 laser system will be responsible for identifying and providing to all authorized personnel any protective equipment such as specially designed eyewear, protective equipment and clothing needed when operating, maintaining or servicing a Class 4 laser system. Further, the Owner will ensure that no juveniles operate the laser.\n- Mirrors, lenses and other reflecting or refracting materials should not be used around or processed in a Class 4 laser system. Adequate measures must be taken to control these materials around Class 4 laser systems.\n- The LSO will be responsible for auditing all safety measures on a regular basis. This includes regular retraining of authorized personnel, serialization and regular inspection (and replacement when necessary) of all special eyewear and clothing and regular inspection of all safety measures surrounding the controlled area in which a Class 4 laser system is operated. The LSO may be required to maintain records as necessary to prove compliance.\n- The LSO will be responsible for regular medical surveillance of all authorized personnel operating a Class 4 laser system. This can include but is not restricted to mandatory annual eye exams, for example.\n- Class 4 lasers must not be used at tradeshows or exhibitions.\nThe above list is not to be considered exhaustive. Other mandatory safety measures may be applicable which will vary from state to state and country to country. It is the responsibility of the owners of a Class 4 laser system and the owners of the facility in which it will be operated to identify and comply with all regulations pertinent to their locale. In some states, for example, anyone wishing to operate a Class 4 laser device must register with the state energy regulatory agency, pay annual fees and submit to annual inspections. There may be penalties involved for non-compliance. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has also adopted rules for safe use of lasers in the workplace. The LSO must comply with all Rules and Regulations set by law.\nA user must carefully weigh the risks and additional regulatory safety burdens of safely operating a laser system in Class 4 mode. However, if the need arises to operate in Class 4 mode in order to process oversized material or more efficiently move material through a laser system, a user can be confident in ULS solutions. By taking advantage of the Class 4 conversion module, a user’s laser system will have all of the safety features required to operate safely in class 4 mode and pass safety audits. User and owners will also receive all of the information and help they need to understand and follow proper safety practices and minimize business liability.\n- Remote Interlock Connection"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3ecc8e46-0b6d-4a66-b5cf-272aec8e788e>","<urn:uuid:45d32906-e936-4fcf-8f05-69c15ed3c5b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm planning to visit both institutions - how do the public access and visitor experiences compare between Leuven's historic center (including the Town Hall) and Yale's Beinecke Library?","answer":"Both locations welcome visitors but offer different experiences. In Leuven, the Tourist Office in the Town Hall is open daily from 10 am to 5 pm, offering walking tour booklets for €2 that guide visitors through the historic center, including the majestic Gothic Town Hall with its 236 sculptures. The Beinecke Library receives over 200,000 visitors annually, offering free admission to special public exhibitions throughout the year. Visitors can view permanent displays like the Gutenberg Bible and Audubon's Birds of America on the mezzanine, and the 1742 Library of Yale College collection on the ground floor. The library also hosts public events like concerts, readings, and conferences.","context":["Leuven, a lesser-known city in Belgium, is located a short train or car ride to the northeast of Brussels. However, it’s not that Leuven attracts fewer visitors than other Belgian cities such as Bruges, Antwerp and Ghent because it doesn’t have anything to offer— it is rather the contrary! The city of Leuven is a vibrant centuries-old university city.\nLeuven is home to the Catholic University of Leuven, an institution that was founded in 1425 and is the largest university in Belgium and one of the oldest and most renowned in Europe. It is a prestigious university that draws in bright minds from all over the world and has one of the most advanced research centers in the world. During the academic year, the majority of Leuven’s 100,000-strong population are students. Leuven is a city where centuries-old buildings and ultra-modern cutting-edge science go hand in hand. This large student population creates a vibrant and always-lively atmosphere in the historic city center.\nThat historic city center, although rather compact, is dotted with impressive buildings and important sites. It is, however, possible to explore the entire city center and see most of the architectural and cultural highlights in one full day. Tourism Leuven offers a convenient booklet of walking tours for only €2. The main office is open every day of the week from 10 am to 5 pm and is housed in the Town Hall on the Great Market Square\nTel: 0032 (0)16 203 020\nAs the tourist office is located in the Town Hall in the very heart of the city, it is only logical that tours depart from there, too. The Town Hall is without question one of the major landmarks in Leuven; a truly majestic Gothic building adorned with no less than 236 sculptures of prominent residents, saints, and the Counts of Leuven and Dukes of Brabant. It is a breathtaking structure, and arguably one of the most beautiful Gothic edifices in the entire world.\nAcross the Great Market Square from the Town Hall stands the equally imposing Saint Peter’s Church. Although the church’s spires were never finished, it still makes for an impressive sight. The towers are 50 meters (164 feet) high, but were originally meant to be 169 meters (554 feet) high. Nevertheless, the building’s exterior and interior are stunning—it is included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Belfries of Belgium and France.\nAnother absolute highlight is found on Ladeuzeplein, or Ladeuze Square in English. The University Library is sometimes considered to be among the world’s most beautiful library buildings. This one was designed by an American architect after the First World War, as a gift to the people of the city. The library’s bell tower is home to one of the biggest carillons on the planet.\nContinuing the walking tour of Leuven, another historically significant place is the Grand Béguinage, which is one of the best-preserved béguinages in its style. With its cobblestones, red-brick row houses, churches and green gardens, it is a quiet and quaint place to go for a stroll. The Grand Béguinage in Leuven was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998.\nThere are also several other religious landmarks in the city, from small chapels to large churches. One example of such a large church is Saint Michael’s Church with its towering façade that lies on the way to the Old Market Square.\nLeuven’s Old Market Square lies in the heart of the city, not too far from the Great Market Square. This square is entirely enclosed by gorgeous medieval step-gabled row houses—a few narrow (pedestrian) streets end at this square. The Old Market Square’s row houses are almost all home to bars, restaurants and cafés. In summer, the square fills up with tables and chairs of the bars’ and restaurants’ outdoor terraces. This is the heart of social life in Leuven; a place that’s always crowded with students and professors on a break, as well as tourists and locals enjoying the surroundings. Because of the high density of neighboring bars and eating venues, Leuven’s Old Market Square is often referred to as the ‘longest bar in the world’.\nAdditionally, Leuven is also the headquarters of Anheuser-Bush InBev, the world’s largest brewery. This is the brewery that first brewed Stella Artois and now also owns major beer brands such as Budweiser and Corona. The Stella Artois brewery is open to visitors on Saturdays and Sundays. The brewery lies close the train station and sometimes you can even see it when stepping off the train.\nArticle written by and photos by Bram Reusen for EuropeUpClose.com","History and Architecture\nThe Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library inspires engagement with the past, in the present, for the future. One of the world’s largest libraries devoted entirely to rare books and manuscripts, it is Yale University’s principal repository of literary archives, early manuscripts, and rare books.\nDesigned by Gordon Bunshaft of the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Beinecke Library opened in October 1963. It was the gift of three Yale alumni—Edwin J. Beinecke, 1907; Frederick W. Beinecke, 1909S; Walter Beinecke, 1910—and their families, who intended it as “a symbol of the loyalty and devotion of three brothers” and as “a source of learning and…an inspiration to all who enter.”\nBunshaft conceived of a cathedral-like exhibition hall that continues to inspire today. More than 200,000 visitors come through the main revolving doors each year from across New Haven, around the nation, and beyond to see the building and its permanent and special exhibitions and to attend concerts, readings, and conferences. Through its vast digital library and through books and essays published from research, the Beinecke Library reaches millions more online and in print.\nSpecial public exhibitions are arranged throughout the year and are open to all without admission charge. The Gutenberg Bible, the first Western book printed from movable type, and John James Audubon’s Birds of America are on permanent public display on the mezzanine. On the ground floor, visitors can see the 1742 Library of Yale College, the first books in the original Yale library, as well as a collection of incunabula, the earliest printed books in the West, from 1455 to ca. 1500.\nThe building’s design includes a six-story glass-enclosed tower of book stacks, holding approximately 180,000 volumes, and large “windows” made of translucent Vermont marble panels, an inch and a quarter thick, in a Vierendeel truss of steel clad in granite. The marble panels protect the collections from damaging direct sunlight while absorbing and diffusing the exterior light in warm hues on the interior.\nThe exterior framework gestures to the golden ratio: fifteen marble blocks run across the face of the building, five run vertically, and ten run along its depth, representing the ratio of 3:1:2. This is also a nod to the collections, as the pages of many early books and manuscripts are laid out in this proportion, considered pleasing to the eye and reverential to the text.\nThe Beinecke Llibrary holds more than one million books, many millions of manuscript pages, and tens of thousands of papyri, photographs, maps, posters, paintings, and art objects, as well as extensive audiovisual material and born-digital content. Collections range from ancient fragments on papyrus through works by living authors. Major collections include Early Books and Manuscripts (pre-1500), Early Modern (1500 to 1800), Modern (post-1800), American Literature, Western Americana, German Literature, the Osborn Collection of English literary and historical manuscripts, the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection of African American Arts and Letters, and the Betsy Beinecke Shirley Collection of American Children’s Literature.\nThe research level and most of the stacks are on two underground floors that extend beneath the plaza. Registered readers may consult the collections directly in the reading room. The Beinecke Library welcomes nearly 10,000 research visits annually, with about half from Yale and half from beyond campus. The library serves as a nexus for original scholarship in a wide range of fields: from literary and cultural studies to the history of science, music, theater, and art; the history of the book, photography, graphic design, and architecture; social, intellectual, and political history; medieval, Renaissance, and eighteenth-century Europe; American literature; Western Americana; nineteenth-century imperialism; African American culture; British literature; gay, lesbian, and transgender studies; transatlantic Modernism; postwar counterculture; contemporary American poetry; and more.\nThe courtyard adjacent to the reading room features a sculpture garden by Isamu Noguchi in an assemblage with representations of the earth (pyramid), sun (circle), and chance (cube). The sculptor described it as being “nowhere, yet somehow familiar. Its size is fictive, of infinite space or cloistered containment.”\nThe library is home to the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, awarded biannually, and to the Windham-Campbell Prizes for fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and drama, awarded annually. Each September, the library celebrates the Windham-Campbell prizewinners with a multiday literary festival, free and open to the public.\nIn 2015 the library’s Technical Services—cataloging, archival description, acquisitions, accessioning, and digitization work—consolidated operations in a state-of-the-art facility at 344 Winchester Avenue. The Bunshaft building underwent a comprehensive renovation in 2015–16, including conservation and restoration of its historic architecture and replacement of security and mechanical systems. The renovation doubled available classroom space. The library now hosts more than 600 class sessions each academic year, with courses from more than 50 Yale academic departments and schools and nearly 8,000 students attending."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:db51c9ff-0d62-4e74-9551-1a31b158a5ee>","<urn:uuid:eb841cc6-bc5f-463a-8932-b670a3d2bb4f>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What chemicals are essential for film development in darkroom processing, and what precautions must be taken when drying photographic materials to prevent damage?","answer":"Essential chemicals for film development include developers with reducing agents, preservatives, and activators, plus fixing baths containing sodium thiosulfate, sodium sulfite, acetic acid, and potassium alum. For drying precautions, materials must be kept in a clean, dry environment with temperature below 70 degrees and humidity below 50 percent. Air movement must be maintained constantly, and if drying outside, prolonged exposure to direct sunlight should be avoided as it can fade inks. Additionally, proper blotting materials like blotter paper, unprinted newsprint, or paper towels should be used, and coated paper materials must be separated to prevent sticking.","context":["Darkroom laboratory guidelines\nNowadays, digital imaging is a constant in everyone’s live, either by digital cameras or by it’s constant integration in mobile devices and other products. Digital vastly surpasses analog photography in our days, mainly due to it’s extreme flexibility and capacity of “production”, bringing quick previews of the work being done and, vast editing possibilities that simply are not present in analog photography or not even possible.\nDespite the range of options permitted by digital imagery, analog photography has always retained followers and lovers. The camera, the film, the printing, are all part of the seductive side of the analog photographic process that starts in the darkroom laboratory.\nFor some, camera gains the most attention, for me, it’s the process of bringing pictures to daylight trough a mostly “dark” process that always fascinated me and, leading me in a quest for always better processes to develop film.\nFor my analog photographs I use mostly stock film from Kodak, although my favorite brand was AGFA till the brand spin-off and halted film stock production. We can still find it today mainly because of the sublicences conceded to other brands.\nAs a purist and brand fan, AGFA terminated at that point.\nMost of my processes were based in chemistry from AGFA, with existing pre made chemicals, so I started to look at the old formularies of the brand and, mixing back old formulations that I knew practically would pretty much remained the same throughout the years.\nAt this point I divide laboratory photo-chemicals and processes at this point in two groups, the main group, developers and, every other photo-chemicals from AGFA formulations and, a second group based on comercial preparations still available in the market. I will cover in more detail the developers bringing a centralized information on that subject.\nDeveloper formulation has many different aspects to be considered and slight changes in a chemical can produce slight variations in the end result and as a consequence in the final print.\nThe role of different chemicals in the formula is approached briefly and it’s beyond scope of this site describing the different chemical reactions between the components of the developer with the negative but more detail are given on the actual impact of those components on the developed film.\nI will focus on well established formulations, with proven results. Mainly because the easiness of preparation of the formulations but also one cannot expect exotic results when making slight changes to the components.\nAll the developers mentioned in specific pages are for black-and-white negative film development in laboratory.\nGeneric view of processing solutions :\nDevelopers are essentially constituted by :\nReducing agent (the developing agent per-se)\nReducing agents normally used are : Metol, Hydroquinone, Phenidone, 4-aminophenol, glycine, pyrogallol, cathecol and many others.\nPreservative, the most widely used is sodium sulfite alone or with sodium bisulfite and included here also sequestrating agents like sodium EDTA to prevent calcium scum deposits.\nActivators : sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, borax, and others capable of creating a high pH.\nThe most used chemical restrainer is potassium bromide, in low percentages since the excess of potassium bromide in solution will restrain completely film development.\nThis is of course a general darkroom laboratory formulation, the actual development of the latent image on the exposed film is in the majority of the cases confined to some basic conditions of the developer solution, conditions those I have mentioned before.\nThe vast majority of developers have alkaline pH, some with values as high as 12, exceptions exist in particular formulations where we can find slightly acidic conditions like for instance in the case of Amidol based developers.\nThe fixing agent\nFixing agents are responsible for removing the undeveloped, non-exposed and, insoluble silver bromide by converting it to the soluble silver thiosulfate.\nBy processing the film in the fixing bath, it makes it transparent where there is no image, but also makes the image permanent.\nComposition of fixing baths are normally :\nSodium Thiosulfate (about 200gr)\nSodium Sulfite (15gr/L)\nAcetic Acid (ca. 13ml /L)\nPotassium Alum (as hardener)\nFormulation of fixing baths should observe some cares, acetic acid should not be added to plain thiosulfate solution since it decomposes the thiosulfate in a phenomena called sulfurization.\nThe chemicals addition should therefore be followed as indicated.\nHardening agents like potassium aluminum sulfate should be used, negatives produced by the use of hardening fixing solutions are much more resistant than those processed in non-hardening fixing baths.\nOptional laboratory processing solutions can be used, such as, stop-baths (with acidic value) to stop development immediately, and final washing aids like hypo-clearing solutions to remove any traces of thiosulfate remaining in the film.\nWetting agents can be used in a final wash to get uniform drying and with no water spots.\nThe overall developing process that I use can be resumed into defined steps:\nPre-wash / Pre-soak\nOptional stoping bath\nWetting agent bath\nAfter completion of the developing process, the film is set to dry in a dust-free environment until completely dry.\nThe process itself will be covered in more detail in dedicated pages.\nConsistence is a key factor for good film development and it must be always present if one is achieving good results with classic film development.\nThere are elements that are difficult to control and have direct influence on the final results, like precise temperatures of working solutions, pH, exhaustion of baths and agitation.\nCare should therefore be taken to ensure that all processes are made consistently.","Saving Possessions & Preventing Mold\nHow to Start the Cleanup\nSecure a clean, dry environment where the temperature and humidity are as low as possible.The temperature must be below 70 degrees and the humidity below 50 percent, or mold probably will develop and distortion will be extreme.Wet books, documents, or photographs that cannot be air-dried within two days should be frozen to inhibit mold growth.\nKeep the air moving at all times in the drying area. This will accelerate the drying process and discourage the growth of mold. If materials are dried outside, remember that prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may fade inks and accelerate the aging of paper.\nBlotting material for air drying should be clean and absorbent.Options include: blotter paper, unprinted newsprint, paper towels, rags, mattress pads, etc. Screening material (such as window screens) well supported and stacked with space between them provide an excellent compact drying surface.\nIf records are printed on coated paper, they must be separated from one another to prevent them from sticking. Place a piece of polyester film on the stack of records. Rub it gently down on the top sheet. Then slowly lift the film while peeling off the top sheet. Hang the polyester film up to dry on a clothesline using clothespins. As the document dries, it will separate from the surface of the film, so it must be monitored carefully. Before it falls, remove it, and allow it to finish drying on a flat surface.\nOnce dry, records may be rehoused in clean folders and boxes, or they may be photocopied or reformatted in other ways. Dried records will always occupy more space than ones that have never been water damaged.\nPlace interleaving material between the text block and the front and back covers. If time and supplies allow, interleaving material should be placed intermittently throughout the text as well. Fan volumes open, and stand them on edge with the interleaving paper extending beyond the edges of the book. Replace interleaving paper as it becomes soaked and invert the volume each time to ensure even drying.\nPhotographs, Negative, Motion Picture Film\nSeveral classes of photographs are highly susceptible to water damage, and the recovery rate will be very low. Avoid touching the surface of photographic prints and negatives. If an old photographic process cannot be identified, observe the item carefully and contact a conservator for advice. Never freeze old photographs or negatives.\nMost prints, negatives, and slides may successfully be individually airdried face up. Change blotting material beneath the photographs as it becomes soaked. Contemporary photographic prints and negatives that are still wet and have stuck together may separate after soaking in cold water.\nRemove the backing material from the frame. If the item is not stuck to the glass, carefully remove it from the frame and air dry. If the object appears to be stuck to the glass, do not attempt to remove it from the frame.\nDry intact with the glass side down. The treatment of items of high monetary, historic or sentimental value should only be performed in consultation with a conservator.\nStart cleanup as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the more likely the mold will grow."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f8db5fdf-8bff-4952-9e45-e9457a0434ed>","<urn:uuid:9ab16fe1-90ff-4008-9c05-ca8cc110a321>"],"error":null}

In 219 BCE, Hannibal besieged the pro-Roman town of Saguntum, effectively declaring war on Rome. In June 218 BCE, Hannibal set out from Spain with a force comprised of 50,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry and 37 war elephants to cross over the Alps into Italy. This was done to achieve surprise and bypass Roman garrisons stationed south of the Alps, in addition to the fact that the Romans had control of the sea. Although Hannibal’s forces were reduced to 26,000 men by the time he arrived in Italy, he managed to recruit Gallic warriors to his cause after defeating the Romans in a cavalry skirmish at the Ticinus River. A few weeks later in December, Hannibal faced a major Roman army under Sempronius Longus across the Trebia river.\nWho was involved?\nThe Carthaginian army at Trebia comprised of 28,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 37 war elephants. Hannibal’s plan was to send a force of Numidian cavalry to harass the Roman camp and lure the Roman army across the freezing Trebia river where it could be engaged in a set-piece battle. Hannibal’s main army would consist of heavy infantry in the centre, light infantry in the vanguard while the cavalry and war elephants would be arranged on the flanks. In addition, Mago Barca would be hidden nearby with 2,000 troops ready to attack the Roman army in the rear. The Roman army consisted of 36,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry.\nAt dawn on 21 December, Hannibal sent his Numidian cavalry to harass the Roman camp with missile fire before retreating across the Trebia River. This prompted Sempronius Longus to send his army across the river and arrange itself in three lines with cavalry on the wings. As the Roman infantry advanced, it forced the Carthaginian light infantry to withdraw behind the Carthaginian heavy infantry which then engaged the Roman infantry in hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, the Carthaginian cavalry and war elephants attacked the Roman cavalry and routed them before falling upon the flanks of the Roman infantry. Once this had happened, the order was given for Mago Barca to emerge from the nearby woods and attack the Romans in the rear, effectively surrounding them. While most of the Roman army was butchered, Sempronius Longus and 10,000 legionaries managed to hack their way through the Carthaginian army and escape to the nearby town of Piacenza. While Roman casualties numbered 30,000 killed, Carthaginian losses numbered about 5,000 men.\nWhat changed as a result?\nThe Battle of Trebia was a victory for the Carthaginians. Not only did it open the rest of Italy to Hannibal, but it also demonstrated his tactical genius, particularly his trademark double envelopment manoeuvre, that would confound the Romans again at the Battle of Cannae. As Patrick N. Hunt analysed,\n“Hannibal won his first Italian victory by careful strategy and thoughtful preparation against a Roman army that outnumbered him. He exploited Roman weaknesses in leadership. He also exploited weakness in Roman tactics, especially the outmatched Roman cavalry and Roman overdependence on slow infantry, as well as the use of raw legions. Hannibal used nature fully to his advantage. Having found a way to defeat Rome, he would use all of these strategies again (Hunt, 2017, p.97).\nFollowing the battle, Hannibal lost all but one of his elephants to frostbite. In addition, after crossing the Arno Marshes during the march into Etruria, Hannibal contracted an eye infection that caused him to lose sight in one eye. Nevertheless, Trebia brought Gallic allies to his standard and would mark the beginning of his sixteen-year-long campaign against Rome.\nGrant, R.G. 1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History.

{"question":"what things i should know about windows in tall buildings for emergency escape? pls explain","answer":"For emergency escape through windows in tall buildings, you need to know several key things: whether your window opens and how it opens, if the window is sealed (as most modern windows are), what it would take to break it (like a kick, chair, or desk), and what is immediately below the window including any broken glass that might be in your landing area. It's important to know this information before an emergency occurs, rather than trying to figure it out when escape is necessary.","context":["Hollywood has again done us no realistic favors. Rarely is an action movie complete without a fleeing bad guy or a chasing good guy jumping off or between buildings. Most notably, the opening sequence in Daniel Craig’s debut as 007 in Casino Royale has James Bond pursuing freerunning and Parkour legend Sébastien Foucan up, over and off scaffolding, cranes and high-rise buildings. It makes for fantastic action sequences and plays on what is surely our prehistorically conditioned fear of heights.\nBut the reality is that our fear of high places exists for good reason. A drop from a high place can end in serious injury or death. Unfortunately, modern construction technology pushes new buildings higher above ground level, making the likelihood of an emergency escape greater than ever. So how does a smart person adjust? It begins with situational awareness and ends with serious decisions and an assessment of survivability.\nHeights—Can You Avoid Them?\nFor the average urban citizen, heights are part of life. As real estate became scarce, buildings got taller. Finding oneself in an office or apartment above ground level is just part of city life. With this in mind, being aware of your surroundings, particularly your elevation and how to deal with it, is the key to survival.\nThe first and most fundamental element in escaping a high place is to know your options. For example, is there a fire escape? If so, how and where do you access the fire escape? If smoke is filling the hallways, that’s not a good time to be searching for the fire exit. Know your exits and routes. Most modern buildings have floor-plan maps with exits noted on the walls. Don’t rely on your landlord’s minimally compliant building code instructions for your own safety, though: Know where you need to go, particularly from the areas you commonly occupy.\nIf your exit routes are blocked and you have to consider escaping through a window, does your window open? If so, how? Is the window sealed (most modern windows are)? If so, what will it take to break it? A kick? A chair? A desk? If you manage to break the window, what is immediately below the window, in addition to all the broken glass you may have spread across your landing area?\nFor buildings three stories and lower, the possibilities are less severe. A drop from a second-story window is rarely fatal unless you land headfirst or on a sharp object. A jump from three stories is risky, and it requires some training, technique and a bit of luck. Understand that floor heights in buildings typically vary from 10 to 12 feet. Fire trucks can reach up to about 100 feet, so if trucks are on site and you are not in immediate danger from smoke or fire and within the range of the truck, wait for help. However, if you have to jump from three stories and below, here are a few things to consider:\n1.) Find another way. Jumping should be your last resort. There may be a safer way down.\n2.) If you must jump, choose the best place to jump. If circumstances allow you to jump onto soft grass rather than concrete, choose grass. Is there an escape route where you can make smaller successive jumps to get to the ground, such as on the roof of substructures? This could be a safer route if the structures below will support your weight.\n3.) Get as low as you can before you jump. Lowering yourself to a sitting or hanging position before jumping can mean the difference between a broken ankle and a safe landing. For example, if you were escaping from a ledge and could lower yourself down to the full extension of your arms, you could reduce the height of the drop by 6 to 8 feet.\nRELATED STORY: What Goes Up – 7 Must-Dos When Your Elevator Stops Working\n4.) Keep your feet and knees together. The worst thing you can do in a jump landing is take all the weight and momentum of your fall on one foot. Military paratroopers jumping with the added weight of kit and weapons practice for weeks on the technique of the “parachute landing fall” (PLF). The technique is designed to minimize the effect of the impact with the ground and transfer the inertia through a roll that utilizes the entire body. The first step in this process is keeping your feet and knees together. This does not guarantee an injury-free landing, but it does greatly reduce the likelihood of injury versus a one-footed landing.\n5.) Keep your elbows in and your chin tucked to your chest. The landing process is not over when your feet hit the ground. The inertia of the fall is likely to throw you to an oblique direction depending on your landing surface and the general direction of your exit from your window or ledge. Resist the urge to break a fall with a single hand or elbow. Like landing on one foot, hitting a single elbow or hand is a bad idea. You will likely underestimate how much inertia is behind your descent and injure yourself. Keep your chin tucked to your chest to avoid a final head snap after hitting the ground. Parkour practitioners utilize a slap landing that uses hands to mitigate impact, but this method is not advisable without practice.\n6.) Protect yourself. If time allows, consider putting on a coat, hat and gloves, if they are available. This might not be an option, but any added protection from impact and abrasion can improve your chances of avoiding serious injury and mitigate cuts and scrapes upon impact.\nSeptember 11, 2001, taught us two important lessons about escaping from high-rise buildings. First, there may be no options. For those trapped above the impact of the aircraft, there was practically no escape, and we watched in horror as people leapt to their deaths. If you find yourself in a similar situation, get to the roof, as there might be a slight chance of an air evacuation. The second lesson came from the survival rate of those who were below the impact of the aircraft. One particular example highlights the value of planning and practice. Morgan Stanley was the largest tenant in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Richard Rescorla, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces colonel, was the World Trade Center security chief for Morgan Stanley. He irritated the bankers with periodic evacuation drills that were actually utilized before 9/11 during brownouts when power grid failures shut down elevators. When the second plane hit their building, Morgan Stanley employees knew where to go and how to get there. Yes, there was heat and smoke, and terrifying events were going on around them, but ultimately all but 13 of Morgan Stanley’s nearly 2,700 employees survived. Rescorla did not, as he returned to the smoking building and was making a final sweep of the company’s floors when the building collapsed.\nLike any other survival scenario, always remember, with knowledge and a little preparation, you can find a way a safe way down from even the highest of places.\nRELATED STORY: Urban Evacuation – Tips to Escape a Disaster\nThis article was originally published in the Winter 2016 issue of BALLISTIC™.

{"question":"How do traditional motor learning practice strategies compare with the modern nonlinear pedagogy approach in skill acquisition?","answer":"Traditional motor learning practice strategies include part vs. whole practice, blocked practice, random practice, random-blocked practice, physical practice, and mental practice, with selection based on instructional readiness and task complexity. While repeated blocked practice enhances performance, skill retention and transferability benefit most from task variations. In contrast, the modern ecological dynamics framework and nonlinear pedagogy, as outlined in recent developments, emphasize treating athletes as complex adaptive systems. This approach focuses on designing learning environments and adapting programs that account for the integration between intentional action, cognition, and decision making. The framework provides strategies for identifying and manipulating key constraints that influence learning skilled behavior, offering a more comprehensive understanding of movement coordination and control.","context":["Motor Learning Principles\nIn many of our case simulations, we have provided patient and family education in exercise techniques and safety considerations. How do we optimize our patient/client's chances for mastering the task? How do we evaluate if our instruction led to the intended result? With adequate preparation and applying concepts of motor learning, we can evaluate our effectiveness as patient and family educators.\nSuggestions for exercise instruction\n- inquire about patients goals and general understanding of therapeutic exercise in rehabilitation\n- Assess for patient fears and/or concerns regarding exercise and exercise programming\n- choose an environment which is free of distractions\n- demonstrate correct and variant forms of movement to create a context for correct technique and common errors\n- use multiple modalities (verbal, visual, demonstration/kinesthetic) to optimize skill acquisition for all learners\n- evaluate patient performance by repeat demonstration under supervision\n- provide specific feedback to optimize the patient/client's ability to self-assess future performance\n- design instruction which allows for mastery of simple to more complex tasks.\nTaxonomy of Motor Learning\nTaxonomies are classification systems to categorize items, animal, activities, etc., using progressively specific terminology. In motor learning, taxonomies are used to help distinguish levels of complexity between movement-based activities.\nClosed environments are less complex than open environments. Closed environments are static: objects, people and surfaces do not move. Open environments are dynamic: objects, people and surfaces can move and change between episodes.\nIntertrial Variability: is absent when there is no change to the environmental conditions; is present when environmental demands change with each attempt\nDesired Outcome of the Action\nBody stable actions are less complex than body transport actions. Body stable includes maintaining a stationary/stable position while executing a motor task. Body transport includes activities where the patient/client is moving and changing positions through space\nTasks which do not include object manipulation are less complex than tasks where the person is required to move/manipulate an object\nPractice and feedback strategies are selected by the PT/PTA based on the instructional readiness of the patient/client and the complexity of the task demands (person/environment).

It assumes that the last item purchased is the first sold, so you can use it to track your inventory's value.\nFor example, let us say you have 5 shirts in stock. You bought them for $10 each and sold them for $15 each. With First in First Out (FIFO), you would record only $15 as income and $5 as cost of goods sold (COGS). With LIFO, however, you would record $20 as income because the last shirt you purchased was sold first — making it the most expensive shirt in stock.\nIn the case of the LIFO method, the value of your inventory is based on the price you paid for all of your items, not their current market value. If you use this method, then when you sell an item, you have to pay tax on its original cost and not its current value.\nIt is important to note that this method only applies to businesses that have inventory they store for resale.\nShould I Use LIFO to Value My Business’s Inventory?\nThe answer is that it depends.\nLIFO is a method of inventory valuation that assumes the most recent purchases are the first ones sold. As such, the value of inventory is based on the cost of goods sold rather than the original cost of inventory. This method can be used by businesses when they want to make their balance sheet look better than it really is. However, there are some situations where it makes more sense to use this method than others.\nFor example, if your business has been experiencing an increase in sales over time and you have purchased items at different times, it may be advantageous for you to use LIFO to value your inventory so that your income statement reflects this growth and shows higher profits than would otherwise be shown by using FIFO or another method of accounting for inventory.\nHow Can I Determine if Using LIFO is Right for My Business?\nLIFO is a popular method of accounting for inventory, but that does not mean it is right for every business. Here are a few things to consider before you decide to use LIFO to value your business's inventory.\n- Are you dealing with a large amount of inventory? If you have a lot of inventory, there is a good chance that your company will be slow to sell through it all and will have to write off any excess at the end of the year. This could cost your company money if you use LIFO rather than FIFO or weighted average cost.\n- Do your products change in price frequently? If so, using LIFO might not be right for you because it tends to undervalue current products in favor of older ones that were purchased at lower prices.\n- Are some products more expensive than others? If so, using weighted average cost might make more sense because it will take into account their relative costs when calculating their value — the more expensive items will be worth more than less expensive ones when calculating their total value."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0cbf8336-cc66-49d7-93dd-72ebb63708cd>","<urn:uuid:e5ff3422-0fed-4064-bf15-b3f2ed7aa222>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do arpeggiator and flanger plugins differ in terms of their compatibility with automation and sequencing capabilities?","answer":"Arpeggiator and flanger plugins have distinct automation and sequencing capabilities.

In contrast, arpeggiator plugins like BlueARP and Kirnu provide extensive automation through their step sequencers, allowing control over parameters like velocity, gate time, accent, transposition, and shift. Additionally, arpeggiators function as MIDI effects that must be inserted before the synth in the signal chain, while flangers are audio effects that process the sound after it's generated.","context":["Flange sounds can range from the sweeping jet-plane effect of Van Halen to the iconic 'breakbeat in a metal pipe' comb-filtering effect of early jungle/ DnB.

In the following list, I’m collecting the best free arpeggiator VST and AU plugins available today.\nNote: The plugins on this page do not create any sound on their own – you will need a sound source (for example a synth plugin like Serum or Massive) to hear anything.\nHow to use an arpeggiator in your DAW\nBefore we get to the list, here’s something a lot of new producers struggle with:\nHow do you use an arpeggiator plugin in your DAW?\nWhile it’s hard to give a general answer, in most DAWs you will have to find a way to insert your arpeggiator plugin into the signal chain before your synth (or other instrument). Arpeggiators are not audio effects like reverbs or compressors, they are MIDI effects and should affect the MIDI data before it arrives at your synth. If you put an arpeggiator after a synth in the effect chain, you will typically not hear an effect at all! If you’re not sure how to add MIDI effects to your DAW, a look into the manual or a Google/YouTube search should help.\nThe Best Free Arpeggiator Plugins – A Collection\nFormat: VST, 32 bit\nYou want to get the traditional arp sound but don’t want to spend a lot of time tweaking settings? Then you should check out Arpimedes by Tobybear. While it is the simplest arpeggiator VST on this list, it is also easiest to use. Set the speed, the number of steps (eight is the maximum), the number of octaves and the mode (up, down, up-down, down-up, as played, random) and you’re set!\nThis plugin is a good starting point when you’re new to arps but will probably not be sufficient if you need a little more control over your arp sound. As this one is an older release, it’s only available for Windows and runs in 32 bit.\nArpimedes is part of the Tobybear MIDIBag, which you can download here.\nFormat: VST2, 32 bit + 64 bit\nThe cleanly designed RandArp is a VST plugin by CodeFN42. After choosing rate, note order and octave order, you have the possibility to play with certain settings that can then be randomized to your liking. These include number of octaves, velocity, gate, shift and swing. You can also choose the percentage of the note probability – this refers to how likely it is that a note is generated. Setting this below 100% means that more notes will randomly be skipped.\nAll in all, it should be noted that RandARP focuses (as the name suggests) almost completely on randomization features. There is no step sequencer where you can draw in notes and there is no feature to transpose notes (you’ll have to do that via MIDI), for example. So, if you want to design your arp sequences step by step, this will not be the right VST plugin for you. However, if you’re looking for an arpeggiator that helps you create ever-changing sequences, you definitely should check RandArp out.\nRandARP can be scaled up to 200% and comes with different skins for optimal usability. Although the plugin is mostly self-explanatory, the download folder contains a 25-page manual that goes into detail on every feature and setting – perfect for anyone who wants to know how to get the most out of this free arpeggiator plugin.\nFormat: VST, AU, 32 bit + 64 bit\nOS: Windows, Mac\nYou want to have maximum control over your arp sequences? Then you should try out BlueARP VST by Oleg Mikheev (also known as Graywolf). When I first opened this plugin, I was a little overwhelmed by all the settings and boxes. However, after playing around with it a bit and watching the following video by howtomakeemusic, I found it’s actually quite easy to use:\nBesides a typical arp engine where you can control settings such as gate time, swing and number of steps, there is also a detailed step sequencer that gives you the option to change velocity, step type and transpose the note (octave or semitone). Step type includes normal, off, rest and tie. I particularly like the tie feature, which creates a gliding effect between steps.\nIf you want to play chords, you have the option of playing all the notes of the chord at the same time or you can choose exactly when each note of the chord will be played.\nAdditionally, BlueARP has countless advanced features, like setting a range for filtering out input notes or forcing the arpeggiated notes to a particular scale. If you use arp sequences a lot in your music, BlueARP will give you plenty of features to get the exact sound you’re looking for. You can find more information about the different features in the manual that’s included in the download files.\nFormat: VST, AU, 32 bit + 64 bit\nOS: Windows, Mac\nBefore BlueARP appeared on the radar, Kirnu by Arto Vaarala was pretty much the number one recommendation when it came to free arpeggiator plugins. Like BlueARP, Kirnu boasts a powerful step sequencer which can help you modulate settings like note length, gate time, accent, transposition and shift.\nOf course, you also have control over the rate, note type (normal, dotted, triplet), sort order (when you’re playing multiple notes) and octaves. You can even choose from a long list of scales (including modes) if you’d like your arp sequences to stick to a certain scale.\nDespite its compact design, Kirnu is a powerful arpeggiator that can do a lot of fun things. Here are some examples from the developer:\nI found Kirnu a little confusing in the beginning because not all of its features are self-explanatory. The download files don’t include a manual either – luckily, I found it on the developer’s website. After reading more about its many features, I found it much easier to create interesting sequences with it.\nNote: Kirnu isn’t the same as Kirnu Cream, which is its commercial successor (if you’re interested in the paid version, please be aware that some stability and compatibility issues have been reported lately).\nLooking for alternatives? Here are some more arpeggiator plugins you can try:\n- mucoder hypercyclic (note: more step sequencer than arp) (VST, AU / Windows + Mac / 32 + 64 bit )\n- Xoxos arp4midi (VST / Windows)\nOver to you…\nYour favorite free arpeggiator plugin was not included in this list?

{"question":"What is the main difference between activated carbon filters and HEPA filters in their ability to handle different types of air contaminants?","answer":"HEPA filters specifically target particles as small as 0.3 microns in diameter and can remove 99.97% of larger dust particles, effectively filtering dust mites, mold, and pet hair. In contrast, activated carbon filters are specialized in eliminating gaseous pollutants and odors, particularly from sources like tobacco smoke, cooking, and mold. While both filter larger particles from the air, activated carbon filters don't target a specific particle size but excel at odor removal, whereas HEPA filters focus on particle filtration.","context":["With the new OSHA Regulation change and a greater understanding of the side-effects from silica exposure, the importance of properly certified dust extractor systems is becoming more evident. Many businesses, and workers still aren’t using the appropriate dust extraction equipment in their day to day duties – some by choice, but others are being misled by vague terms that mask the truth and give the illusion that they are something they’re not.\nDust extractor systems with Certified HEPA filters ensure sufficient filtration so that you are not being exposed to any contaminants in your workplace. Sadly, we have come across terms that are being promoted in a way that makes them seem efficient and safe.\nWith terms like, “HEPA-Like”, “HEPA-Type” or “HEPA Ready”, there is no guarantee that the filters have been individually tested to ensure adequate filtration. Furthermore, due to the addition of “Like”, “Type” or “Ready” to the name, the manufacturers have slipped through a loophole and are not required to meet the strict certification standards, like genuine HEPA filters are.\nAs a result, customers are getting a false sense of protection and are being exposed to dangerous and toxic particles.\nBartell Global is teaming up with Ermator to help bring awareness to the issue so that you can be properly educated and make sure that you are not only investing your hard earned money into equipment that works, but also in exceptional equipment that ensures proper health and safety for the users, and those around them.\nWHAT IS A HEPA FILTER?\nHEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air filter (you may also have heard, High-Efficiency Particulate Arresting filter). They are made up of randomly arranged fiberglass fibers varying in size and thickness between 0.5 and 2.0 micrometers (or microns). These fibers have the ability to filter particles as small as one-300th the diameter of a human hair. A true HEPA removes up to a minimum of 99.97% of airborne respirable pollutants. This is important because a lot of the most hazardous particles are so small that they can easily sneak through most filtration systems that aren’t properly certified to ensure the minimum percentage of filtration.\nThere are 4 main ways HEPA filters work to capture the particles:\n- Inertial Impaction – This traps the heaviest or largest particles. – Because these particles are heavier than the air and other particles around them they continue in a straight line while the others can weave through some of the initial fibers in the filter. Ultimately these fibers tend to be the first to trapped and held.\n- Interception – Medium sized particles at snatched up via interception. This simply refers to when the fiberglass fibers in the filter intercepts the particles and they become stuck.\n- Diffusion– The randomness of the fibers in the filter cause particles to collide with each other and the fibers and they become trapped.\n- Straining/ Sieving – This is when the particles become trapped between two fibers in the filter.\nWe want to ensure that our customers are getting the safest most efficient products on the market, but also to help bring awareness to the dangers that not having proper dust extractor systems or filtration can result in. By not having adequate filtration you are not protected from toxic silica dust and other dangerous particles.\nYou’ll hear many boast about “HEPA-Ready” equipment and “HEPA-Like” or “HEPA- Type” filters, which is very misleading if you don’t know exactly what those terms mean.\nTERMS YOU’LL WANT TO KNOW\nHEPA-Type, HEPA-Like, etc. – These are terms that make people believe that the filter is a legitimate HEPA Filter or equally as good as a certified HEPA filter, when in fact it is not. They are not held to the same high testing standards and often don’t comply with the new OSHA regulations; which means they do not protect you from exposure of toxic respirable particles.\nA legitimate certified HEPA filter should be labeled and signed off, so that you know it has been tested and passed inspection to ensure that it meets the necessary health and safety standards.\nHEPA-Ready equipment is often marketed as sufficient on its own, but really means that the piece of equipment is compatible with certified HEPA filters. When investing in a HEPA-Ready piece of equipment, be prepared for significant additional costs to properly fit the piece of equipment with a certified HEPA filter.\nAdditionally, some HEPA-Ready vacuums or dust extraction equipment will often boast of a higher CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) suction rate – claiming that because of the higher CFM the vacuum is more efficient and better quality. This yet again, doesn’t mean what it claims. Let me explain why;\nFirstly, the CFM has nothing to do with filtration, it simply refers to the suction power. Second, those higher CFM ratings are based on HEPA-Ready equipment that DOES NOT have a certified HEPA filter. Using a filter that is not HEPA certified, will obviously allow more air through – as well as toxic particles that HEPA certified filters protect you from – allowing for a higher suction rate. The second you add a properly certified HEPA filter, that high CFM rating will drop about 30% because the HEPA filter doesn’t allow as much to pass through.\nWhat this means is, not only have you spent money on a “HEPA-Ready” dust extractor system that doesn’t protect you from the toxic particles, but also, that you now have to invest more of your hard earned money into fitting it with a properly certified HEPA Filter – which will cause that unrealistic CFM rating that you paid for, to drop by 30%.\nOur suggestion is, invest in dust extraction equipment with a built in certified HEPA filter.\nIf you have already purchased a “HEPA-Type, HEPA-Like (etc.)” filter or piece of “HEPA-Ready” equipment, we strongly suggest you to take additional health and safety precautions, by using masks or other pieces of safety equipment to make sure you’re not risking your life and breathing in toxic silica dust and other hazardous particles.\nIf you’re thinking about investing, make sure to check the HEPA filters for the proper labeling and certification. Do your research and educate yourself so that you end up investing in something that doesn’t protect you, your workers, your customers, or even your friends and family from the serious and dangerous effects and life altering consequences of silica exposure and other hazards.\nWe want to make sure that all of you are protected so if you have any questions about this blog or anything related to HEPA Filters, or Bartell Global equipment please feel free to contact us and we would be happy to help.","Table of Contents_\nSome consumers may confuse air filters with air purifiers because air filters often reside within air purifiers. However, to understand the difference between an air filter vs. an air purifier, you may need to understand the way each works because there are several types of air purifiers (including lots of top-rated air purifiers) just as there are a couple of types of air filters.\nSpeaking of different purification devices, you’ll want to learn about air purifiers vs vacuum purifiers, electrostatic air purifiers vs HEPA, and allergen removes vs air purifiers. In case you’re interested in other units.\nThe filtration methods vary between air filters and air purifiers unless you are comparing filters with a filter-based purifier. Both air cleaning technologies eliminate microscopic particles, including pet dander, dust particles, and mold spores. However, when using a filter, the device catches larger particles as the air passes through it. Meanwhile, air purifiers eliminate contaminants using electricity, ionization, or UV light. You may also be interested in the pros and cons of a diffuser vs. air purifier.\nMany air purifiers, like the finest air purifiers for pets, come outfitted with their air filters. However, some air filters are placed within a house’s ductwork. To find the best air purifier for your home, you can do a comparison of the various types of air purifiers. Although the air conditioners and furnaces come with their filters, some consumers have additional filters added. The main kinds of filters that are used include HEPA and activated carbon. Many consider HEPA filters the best option for cleaning airborne particulates, while activated carbon filters work well against household odors. Air purifiers work better than house plants when masking odors.\nHEPA filters will help with pollutants, while activated carbon ones will help with odors.\nHigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters eliminate at least 99.97% of larger dust particles size 0.3 microns in diameter. These filters can eliminate dust mites, mold, pet hair, or other organic compounds while the air flows through them. Some brands offer “HEPA-type” filters, which do not meet the industry standard requirements for an actual HEPA air filter.\nThe type of filter that works best on odors and gaseous pollutants features activated carbon as its material. These filters work well in eliminating odors from tobacco smoke, cigarette smoke cooking, and mold, among other indoor air pollution. Like HEPA filters, these filter larger particles from the air, but they do not target a specific size.\nSeveral types of air cleaners exist that improve indoor air quality. However, many of these produce ozone, even the ones that aren’t referred to as ozone generators. Electrostatic precipitators, ionizers, and ozone generators each feature unique processes. Electrostatic precipitators typically make up the best options within this group. Ionizers cause particles to stick to nearby surfaces, including clothes or your body. As the name implies, ozone generators produce toxic ozone, which is tolerable in small amounts. Just be sure to ventilate the room while using any of these options.\nThe primary type of electronic air purifier that removes airborne particulates using air filtrate that traps particles is an electrostatic precipitator, which should not be confused with the electrostatic filters for furnaces. Electrostatic precipitation occurs when the particulate matter passes through the air purifier and receives an electrical charge. The particles are then attracted to an oppositely charged collection plate and kept on the surface. This type of air purifier is cleanable, so it does not feature disposable filters. Some air purifiers utilize filters and electrostatic precipitation, resulting in fewer particles.\nSome air purifiers emit ozone, which can be toxic at higher levels.\nWhat do air purifiers filter?\nAir purifiers catch solid particulate matter or gaseous molecules. The type of air purifier affects what is eliminated, but some air purifiers provide both methods in one device.\nCan I use both an air purifier and humidifier together?\nYou may use both an air purifier and humidifier, especially if you are worried about viruses in the air. The air purifier should eradicate some of the larger particles containing the virus, while the humidifier may reduce the infectiousness of viruses if kept at the right level.\nDo air filters improve air quality?\nAir filters reduce the particulate matter in the air, which increases indoor air quality. However, they do need to be changed or cleaned every so often to remain effective. To check whether you have a washable or disposable filter, you should consult your user’s manual.\nSTAT: According to several studies (Lapidus et al., 2013), increasing the humidity in the air to a range of 40-60 percent reduces the infectiousness of viruses.

{"question":"As a parent concerned about grief, how do modern funeral trends accommodate children's attendance, and what's the psychological impact of involving children in death-related events?","answer":"Modern funeral trends show more flexibility in how children participate in memorial services. Whether children should attend largely depends on their age and maturity level, as well as their relationship with the deceased. For older children who can understand the situation, attending can help with the grieving process and provide closure. However, very young children and infants may be better kept away, as they won't understand the events and could disrupt the service. From a psychological perspective, children from age 2-9 process death differently - younger ones may see it as temporary sleep, while older ones grasp its permanence. It's important to be honest with children about death, using clear language and avoiding misleading phrases like 'put to sleep'. This helps them develop healthy grief responses and rely on adults for comfort and reassurance.","context":["Subscribe to our free newsletter to receive all the latest offers...\nFuneral Etiquette: Trends for Modern Mourning\nIf you’ve never been to a funeral before and are concerned about what exactly funeral etiquette involves, don’t worry. The following guidelines will help you navigate the (often unspoken) ‘rules’, enabling you to rise to the occasion with confidence.\nUniversal Funeral Etiquette\nFuneral traditions, rituals and conventions vary considerably in different countries and cultures, worldwide.\nHowever, appropriate etiquette, wherever you may be in the world, is based essentially on showing profound respect for the deceased and conducting oneself in a dignified manner, according to the prevailing funeral conventions.\nDress Code Trends for Modern Mourning\nEven in modern society, the overriding aim should always be to dress respectfully and appropriately.\nAs a general guideline, dark coloured (not necessarily black), conventional clothing is still the preferred form of attire for attending funerals. Men, traditionally, wear black ties and dark suits; women, generally, choose subdued coloured outfits such as smart trouser suits, below-the-knee skirts, modest dresses and jackets, etc.\nConversely, wearing unconventional or bright-coloured clothing may be equally appropriate, particularly where the deceased has previously instructed family and friends not to wear black at the funeral.\nChildren & Funerals\nWhether children should be allowed to attend funerals depends largely on the age and maturity of the individual child involved, as well as the nature of child’s relationship with the deceased.\nA strong argument exists for children who are old enough to understand what is happening to attend the funeral, not least as a means of facilitating the grieving process and gaining closure.\nEqually, very young children, infants and babies who would inevitably be oblivious to events, are probably better off not attending the funeral. Also, on a practical note, the presence of a crying baby at a funeral can prove highly stressful, particularly for the adult in charge.\nIf in doubt, consult your funeral director about whether the presence of children is deemed appropriate; Funeral Directors.\nWhen attending a funeral, it is common practice for the mourners (apart from immediate family) to arrive early and take up position, at least 5-10 minutes before the funeral officiant commences proceedings.\nThe seating at the front of the funeral venue is reserved for immediate family, with other mourners occupying the seats to the rear.\nAfter the ceremony, the mourners stand while close family members leave the building, first. The immediate family then usually pauses to acknowledge those who have attended the funeral and maybe exchange a few brief words.\nTrends for Modern Mourning\nTrends in contemporary funeral etiquette include:\n● a shift away from religious observance and ritual towards personalising funeral ceremonies in a non-religious context;\n● less formal and rigorously defined funeral-wear, in certain circles, in favour of greater individual expression, sometimes even with a hint of drama, e.g. ostentatious ladies’ outfits complete with large hats, showy jewellery, dark glasses, etc., and more casual men’s attire instead of dark suits and black ties;\n● increased use of social networking websites to pay tribute and mourn the deceased, online.\n© Funeral Services Guide","Engraved Cremation Urns Human Cremation Urns Pet Cremation Urns\nIt is natural to want to protect our children from painful experiences.\nMost adults, however, are surprised to find how well most children adjust to the death of a pet if they are prepared with\nhonest, simple explanations. From a young age, children begin to understand the concept of death, even though they may\nbe unaware of it at a conscious level.\nWhen a pet is dying, it may be more difficult for a child to resolve the\ngrief experienced if the child is not told the truth. Adults should avoid using terms like \"put to sleep\"\nwhen discussing euthanasia of a family pet. A child could misinterpret this common phrase, indicating the adult's denial of death, and develop a terror of bedtime.\nSuggesting to a child that \"God has taken the pet\" might create conflict in the child, who could become angry\nat the higher power for cruelty toward a pet and the child.\nChildren are capable of understanding, each in\ntheir own way, that life must end for all living things. Support their grief by acknowledging their pain. The\ndeath of a pet can be an opportunity for a child to learn that adult caretakers can be relied upon to extend comfort and reassurance.\nIt is an important opportunity to encourage a child to express his or her feelings.\nTwo and Three\nYear Olds: Children who are two or three years old typically have no understanding of death.\nThey often consider it a form of sleep. They should be told that their pet has died and will not return. Common\nreactions to this include temporary loss of speech and generalized distress. The two or three year old should be reassured\nthat the pet's failure to return is unrelated to anything the child may have said or done. Typically, a child in\nthis age range will readily accept another pet in place of the dead one.\nFour, Five, and Six Year\nOlds: Children in this age range have some understanding of death but in a way that relates to a continued\nexistence. The pet may be considered to be living underground while continuing to eat, breathe, and play. Alternatively,\nit may be considered asleep. A return to life may be expected if the child views death as temporary. These children\noften feel that any anger they had for the pet may be responsible for its death. This view should be refuted because\nthey may also translate this belief to the death of family members in the past. Some children also see death as\ncontagious and begin to fear that their own death (or that of others) is imminent. They should be reassured that their\ndeath it not likely. Manifestations of grief often take the form of disturbances in bladder and bowel control, eating,\nand sleeping. This is best managed by parent-child discussions that allow the child to express feelings and concerns.\nSeveral brief discussions are generally more productive than one or two prolonged sessions.\nEight, and Nine Year Olds: The irreversibility of death becomes real to these children. They\nusually do not personalize death, thinking it cannot happen to themselves. However, some children may develop concerns\nabout death of their parents. They may become very curious about death and its implications. Parents should be\nready to respond frankly and honestly to questions that may arise. Several manifestations of grief may occur in these\nchildren, including the development of school problems, learning problems, antisocial behavior, hypochondria concerns, or\naggression. Additionally, withdrawal, over-attentiveness, or clinging behavior may be seen. Based on grief reactions\nto loss of parents or siblings, it is likely that the symptoms may not occur immediately, but several weeks or months later.\nAdolescents: Although this age group also reacts similarly to adults, may adolescents\nmay exhibit various forms of denial. This usually takes the form of a lack of emotional display.

{"question":"What are the key initial steps for incorporating a startup, and what legal documents should be prepared for the founders?","answer":"The key initial steps for incorporating a startup include forming a company through the Companies Office to create a separate legal personality, and having founders sign subscription agreements to purchase their shares at a nominal price. For legal documentation, companies need to maintain a share register, interests register, and opening minutes recording share issues. Additionally, founders should sign vesting agreements that typically span 4 years, requiring them to work for the company to fully earn their equity. It's also crucial to establish a shareholders' agreement that covers decision-making processes, share sales procedures, funding arrangements, and conflict resolution mechanisms.","context":["This is a special guest post series by Sacha Judd (aka @szechuan).\nSacha is a partner at Buddle Findlay, based in Auckland. She works with a number of early-stage technology companies including Vend, Pocketsmith, Litmos, My Tours, GoVocab and others, helping founders with everything from setup and shareholder arrangements to capital raising. She is a not-evil lawyer who makes the scary legal stuff much less scary.\nIn this two-part series I’ve asked her to describe some of the common problems she deals with so you can hopefully avoid repeating those mistakes in your ventures.\nOver to Sacha…\nInnovative New Zealand businesses are taking on the world, launching globally competitive products and services, raising capital from overseas investors, and getting acquired by large multi-national corporations.\nTechnology has made starting a business much easier. Open source development tools and cloud-based hosting services have made it much cheaper to get a new product or service built and launched. Modern accounting tools like Xero make it possible to keep your finances in order. Online banking means your bills get paid on time and you can keep on top of your cashflow. The Companies Office even has an automated and streamlined online incorporation process. As a consequence, entrepreneurs in the start-up phase feel very self-sufficient. The DIY attitude is part of what makes New Zealand companies so amazing to work with.\nBut, not so fast. There are some easily-avoided traps that I see entrepreneurs falling into over and over again. As a lawyer, it might seem like I have a vested interest in suggesting start-up founders get professional advice early. But, the alternative is that they often end up paying people like me a lot more to clean up the mess later on, assuming that’s even possible.\nIn this series, I’ll discuss some things you should think about to make sure you are laying the right foundation for your start-up. There are a few important choices that young companies can make early on that have significant consequences, particularly if you intend to raise money from external investors at some point in the future. If you follow this advice it should save you time and money, both by avoiding some obvious mistakes, and by giving you a good basic understanding to work from so that when you do decide to bring advisers on board you know what you need and what to ask for.\nThis is my advice about when to take advice.\nWanna be starting something?\nThe first thing to do is form a company so that your business has a separate legal personality. This is important to separate the legal liability for the business from your own personal assets, though in practice, if you are borrowing any money or opening a facility with a bank, you are likely to be asked to give a personal guarantee as well. Make sure you understand the effect of this, and get good advice before you sign. This advice applies whether you’re a solo-founder or working with others.\nIf you are working with co-founders, you need to discuss candidly at the outset whether each of you will take an ownership stake in the business (shareholders), a governance role in the business (directors), or work for the business for salary or wages (as employees or independent contractors).\nThis can be a very tricky discussion to have at the start of a project you’re all excited about, and one that is often deferred or avoided altogether. You need to talk honestly about each person’s contribution and what value you each attribute to it. The tendency is often to just settle for an equal split of shares, because it seems “fair”, and avoids a hard conversation. However, that may not reflect the time and effort and expertise that each person is bringing to the table, and may lead to arguments down the road. More than that, academic research indicates that founder teams who avoid having these discussions up front, and agree to split their equity equally, tend to suffer (on average) a 10% discount to the pre-money valuation of their companies when it comes to their first financing rounds. Your company may actually be worth less if you don’t go through this process at the start.\nOne useful tool I’ve found helps founder teams with these discussions is Frank Demmler’s “Founders’ Pie Calculator”. This is a great starting point for working through what each of you brings to the table, how the rest of the team feel about the value of that contribution, and what your overall commitment to the business will be. It’s not a magic wand for settling the question of your equity split, but it does give you a good framework for trying to have the conversation in an objective, unemotional way.\nOnce you’ve settled on the percentage ownership, you can form the company. The Companies Office makes it easy to do this yourself, but in some ways this masks the compliance that sits in the background. Did you know you’re supposed to have a share register? An interests register? Opening minutes recording the issue of shares to each of the founders? You need to keep these and other records at the registered office of your company. It’s too easy to overlook this paperwork until you want to raise capital and the investor asks to see it, at which point it may be too late to put in place quickly and easily.\nIt’s (not just) a matter of trust\nAt the outset of a new venture, everybody involved is excited about the project, positive about its future prospects, and in agreement on most things. It’s hard to imagine a time when you might not feel the same way. But things change. One of the founders gets a great job opportunity to move to another country, or wants to take time out to start a family. One of you wants to expand into Australia, but the others think it’s a terrible idea. You get approached by someone who wants to buy the business, but only some of you want to sell. If you haven’t agreed anything in advance, you may find yourself in an incredibly stressful situation, facing disagreement without any framework to help you deal with these issues.\nTo avoid getting into this situation, all of the founders should, at the very least, get together and dream up all the best and worst scenarios that might play out. Talk about what you would want for an outcome in these cases, writing down everything that you agree. Ideally, you should take the next step and put a binding agreement in place to record your intentions.\nA good, simple shareholders’ agreement should do a few things.\n- It should reflect how decisions will be made. As a matter of company law, most decisions can be made by management. A few key decisions relating to the company require shareholder approval; sometimes 50% approval and other times 75%. Depending on your ownership structure, you might want to list out a series of key decisions that will require unanimous approval, or at the very least, a high enough threshold to give any smaller shareholders some comfort that the major founders won’t just do whatever they like. These decisions might include: entering into high-value or long-term contracts, raising capital, hiring senior employees, or major changes in business direction.\n- It should state how you will be able to sell your shares should you wish to. Do you have to offer them to the other shareholders first (pre-emptive rights)? If a large enough number of shareholders want to sell, can they force the others to sell too (drag-along rights)? If the major shareholders want to sell, do they have to secure a deal for the minor shareholders as well (tag-along rights)? Are you free to transfer your shares to a family trust or investment company?\n- It should deal with funding. If the company needs money, will you borrow from the bank? Do the shareholders have to guarantee this funding if that’s required? What about if you decide to issue new shares? Do the existing shareholders all have a right to maintain their existing percentages by putting in more money?\n- It should cover what else you are allowed to do. The start-up might not be the full-time focus for all of the founders at the outset. You may have some friends and family as initial investors. The agreement should cover restraints of trade, and whether shareholders are able to work or invest in other similar businesses.\n- It should set out what you want to have happen if things go wrong. If someone doesn’t hold up their end of the agreement, do they have to sell their shares? To the other shareholders, or to the company? At fair value or at a punitive discount? If there are only two of you, and you have a fundamental disagreement, you may want to consider simple deadlock provisions rather than going through the time and expense of independent valuations of the business.\nA good shareholders’ agreement is written in plain English, and is able to be understood by all of the founder shareholders. There will be the temptation to use a template agreement, but as you can see from the questions above, every shareholders’ agreement will be substantially different, depending on the number of investors and their respective levels of control (for example, a 50/50 company needs very different arrangements than one with a majority founder shareholder, and a number of smaller minority shareholders). There is really no substitute for getting some good advice on this, and getting everything documented and signed.\nWith your company correctly incorporated and a good shareholders’ agreement in place you can get on with the business of building something great.\nIn the next post we’ll look at how you can make sure the company owns what you think it does and be prepared in advance for investment or acquisition.\nContinues in Call Me, Maybe (Part II)…","One of the first steps to incorporate a startup company is to issue equity to the founding stockholders. However, there is more to that process than just deciding how much equity each founder should receive. Here are a few additional issues to consider:\nLegally-speaking, there is no such thing as “founders stock.” Founders typically receive common stock, i.e. a class of stock with no special rights or preferences. Although there have been efforts by various organizations to promote the issuance of special classes of stock for founders that contain “super voting” rights or similar protective provisions, in practice, those provisions hardly ever survive the first round of outside investment. In the vast majority of cases, we recommend sticking to the K.I.S.S. principal and issuing common stock to the founders.\nEach founder should sign a subscription agreement (often alternatively called a stock purchase agreement) with the company to purchase their shares of stock. The purchase price is usually nominal; often less than a penny per share. However, the subscription agreement should also include a contribution of any intellectual property, domain names, business plans, or other assets that the founder has created further the business.\nFor any company with multiple founders, each founder should enter into a vesting agreement with the company. The vesting agreement will require the founder to work for the company for a defined period of time in order to fully “earn” their founder equity. If the founder ceases to work for the company for any reason before the shares are fully-vested, then the company has the right to repurchase the unvested shares for a nominal amount. In essence, the unvested shares are forfeited. To use a simple example, if the founder has a four-year vesting agreement and is fired after two years, then 50% of that founder’s equity would be forfeited.\nWhy would a founder voluntarily agree to this? Because in most cases, each founder is going into this business with the expectation that all of the other founders will be actively working on the business. If a founder leaves, regardless of the reason, that expectation has now been frustrated. Absent a vesting agreement or some other agreement in advance, the other founders will have no way to recover that equity, other than a negotiation with the departing founder, which will usually be expensive at best. A former founder who still holds significant equity creates a litany of potential problems. Aside from the potential resentment that the remaining founders may feel, that chunk of now-passive equity may be a deterrent for future investors. We have seen at least two companies fail in large part due to this issue.\nThe vesting period is normally three to five years, with four being the most common. Vesting normally occurs monthly over that period; however, if the founders are relatively new to each other, then a “cliff” for the first year may be appropriate; cliff vesting means that the first tranche does not vest until the end of that cliff period. In some respects, a cliff is like a beta test to make sure the relationship will work. Founder equity also normally would fully vest upon a sale of the company, although this may not always be the case for equity incentives that the company issues to future employees.\nOne important tax issue for founders to understand is that, if they receive restricted stock (i.e. stock subject to a vesting restriction), then, in most cases, the founder would be well-advised to file an 83(b) election with the IRS. Absent this filing, the founder will pay tax on the fair market value of each tranche of shares when it vests at the fair market value on the vesting date. If the company grows quickly, one might imagine that these tax bills could grow exponentially. The deadline for filing is strict; the filing must be made by mail no later than 30 days after the date the shares are issued.\nRight of First Refusal and Lock-up Agreements\nAnalogous to the expectation that founders will all actively work on the business is the expectation that, at least initially, the founders will get to decide who the other shareholders are. One way to protect this expectation is by creating a “right of first refusal” in favor of the company or other stockholders. A right of first refusal gives that company or other stockholders the right to match any offer to purchase shares of the company’s stock. So, if a founder wants to sell some of their shares, and a potential buyer makes an offer, then the company or other stockholders can match that offer and keep the shares from going to a potentially unknown party. Typically, the right of first refusal is added to the company’s bylaws so that it automatically applies to new shares of stock whenever they are issued.\nLastly, founders should include a lock-up agreement in their subscription agreements. A lock-up agreement is an agreement by the shareholder not to sell their shares for some period of time (typically 180 days) following an initial public offering. Underwriters fear (often rightly) that a large number of sales by insiders or former employees immediately following an IPO may depress the stock price. However, a lock-up agreement typically cannot be imposed without the agreement of the stockholder. In order to avoid the difficulties in trying to track down former founders and employees at the time of your IPO, include a simple lock-up agreement in your subscription agreement.\nBy following these best practices, you and your co-founders will establish a solid foundation for your startup and, hopefully, your future success!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c6bcf221-fa2b-40a1-b1df-498650fb6801>","<urn:uuid:45e6d070-6806-4ac8-b3a5-bd6ce2739df4>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I work at a medical center and want to help address poverty-related health issues. How are some hospitals implementing programs to tackle this problem?","answer":"Several medical centers have implemented innovative programs to address poverty-related health issues. Boston Medical Center runs a bike-prescribing program that offers discounted memberships to the city's bike-sharing system for just $5 per year, helping address both transportation and exercise needs. They also operate a food pantry for food-insecure families. Organizations like Health Leads allow doctors in 20 clinics to 'prescribe' services like healthy food or safe housing to low-income patients, with volunteers helping connect patients to these services. In San Francisco, the Center for Youth Wellness screens children for adverse childhood experiences and provides counseling and biofeedback training to help manage stress. However, many of these programs struggle with funding as Medicaid and other insurance don't cover many of these services.","context":["When poor teenagers arrive at their appointments with Alan Meyers, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, he performs a standard examination and prescribes whatever medication they need. But if the patient is struggling with transportation or weight issues, he asks an unorthodox question:\n“Do you have a bicycle?”\nOften, the answer is “no” or “it’s broken” or “it got stolen.”\nIn those cases, Meyers does something even more unusual: He prescribes them year-long memberships to Hubway, Boston’s bike sharing program, for just $5 per year—a steep discount from the regular $85 price.\n“What we know is that if we are trying to get some sort of exercise incorporated into their daily routine, [the bike] works better than saying, ‘Take x time every day and go do this,’” Meyers told me.\nThe bike-prescribing program is paid for by the city. For patients without bank accounts, Boston even puts up its own city credit card. Meyers thinks the two-wheeled solution tackles several problems at once.\n“Boston is pretty compact, parking is always a problem, and getting around on a bicycle makes all the sense in the world,” he said. Plus, doctors at Boston Medical Center use their electronic medical records to prescribe the bikes, and they plan to measure how patients’ use of the bikes tracks with their weight and health over time.\nMeyers realizes that sedentariness is one of the many ills that afflict the poor to a greater degree than the rich. People earning less than $36,000 are far less likely to exercise than those earning $80,000 or more. Low-income people may live in dangerous areas, have little free time, lack access to parks, or some combination.\nThe bike program is one example of the various ways physicians are attacking a vexing problem that’s not in any medical handbook: Poor patients are sicker, and their poverty actually makes them sick.\nHow ‘Toxic Stress’ Damages the Brain\nOne in every six Americans lives in poverty–for an individual, that means earning less than $11,670 per year. The immediate lifestyle implications of such an income are clear: It’s not enough to buy a decent one-bedroom apartment in most cities, let alone a gym membership, fresh produce, or access to high-end medical care. A healthy diet, as one study determined last year, costs $1.50 more per day than an unhealthy one.\nAnd it’s well known that low-income people aren’t as healthy. People of a lower socioeconomic status have a 50 percent higher risk of developing heart disease, for example. Writing in the New York Times, Annie Lowrey found that though Virginia’s Fairfax County and West Virginia’s McDowell County are separated by just 350 miles, men in the richer Fairfax County have “a life expectancy of 82 years and women, 85, about the same as in Sweden. In McDowell, the averages are 64 and 73, about the same as in Iraq.”\nBut a growing body of evidence suggests that the very condition of living with no money, in a tumultuous environment, and amid stark inequality can alter individuals’ gene expression. What’s more, the pressure of being poor sometimes weighs so heavily that the body pumps out more stress hormones, which ravage the immune system over time.\nPoor nutrition, trying times, and environmental toxins in childhood can turn certain genes “on” or “off.” Even poor children who seemingly overcome the hardships of poverty—by making good grades and adapting socially—tend to have higher levels of stress hormones, blood pressure, and body mass index than their wealthier peers.\n\"Exposure to stress over time gets under the skin of children and adolescents, which makes them more vulnerable to disease later in life,\" says Gene Brody, founder and director of the University of Georgia Center for Family Research.\nChild-rearing problems that are more prevalent among poor households, such as chronic neglect or a parent's incarceration, compound on money woes and congeal into something known as “toxic stress.” These “adverse childhood experiences” jab at the brain at critical moments in its development, changing the architecture of key brain structures and setting the stage for long-term anxiety and mood-control issues.\n“If you have a whole bunch of bad experiences growing up, you set up your brain in such a way that it’s your expectation that that’s what life is about,” James Perrin, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told me.\nIn a groundbreaking study in Science last year, people who were primed to think about financial problems did worse on a series of tests that involved decision-making—a sign that physical scarcity can make it difficult for our brains to free up enough space for long-term planning.\nOne study found that the anxiety of living in poverty is a stronger predictor of mental health problems than going to war. Food-stamp recipients cannot use their benefits to buy diapers, and last year, a team of researchers at Yale University’s School of Medicine found that mothers who couldn’t afford diapers for their babies were more likely to feel depressed and anxious.\nThese worries can leave their mark on children, both in the form of a more volatile childhood environment and, potentially, through the mother’s own genetic makeup: Animal studies have shown that anxieties about certain stimuli can be hereditary.\nPoverty can also deplete self-control. Smoking and unhealthy eating habits are more prevalent among the poor. A just-published study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found that girls who were repeatedly exposed to poverty growing up were more likely to be overweight or obese as young women.\n“Habits form early,” Daphne Hernandez, the study author and health policy professor at the University of Houston, told me. “You begin to crave those [inexpensive] foods, and making the transition to healthier foods is difficult. Even when you’re not living in poverty anymore, you may still be buying the cheaper foods.”\nHernandez found that for boys, childhood poverty wasn’t linked to adult weight problems—but that isn’t necessarily anything to celebrate. Hernandez thinks it's heavy childhood manual labor that’s protecting the boys from obesity. “If you live in poverty, you’ll enter the labor market earlier,” she said. “For girls, it’s babysitting, but for boys in impoverished communities, they’ll more than likely engage in construction work.”\nAll of these factors combined mean that when doctors treat poor patients, they’re facing not just one ailment, but two: the illness itself, and the economic fragility that underlies it.\n“Our society in general has looked at the issue of poverty in two ways: either a social problem, or a mental-health problem,” said Nadine Burke Harris, a San Francisco pediatrician. “But it's also a serious medical problem.”\nA Patchwork of Programs\nSome doctors are incorporating the treatment of poverty-related obstacles into their medical routines. In addition to its bicycle program, Boston Medical Center operates a food pantry for food-insecure families.\nThere are also groups like Health Leads, which was started by the lawyer Rebecca Onie at Boston Medical Center when she was a Harvard sophomore. Today, Health Leads allows doctors in 20 clinics across the country to “prescribe” services like healthy food or safe housing to their low-income patients. Health Leads volunteers (usually med students) set up card tables in clinic waiting areas and try to connect patients with prescribed services.\n“A busy mom, a single mom who has two kids and doesn't have a car—when she walks out of the doctor’s office, she will never be more motivated than she is right there,” Health Leads’ marketing director, Connie French, told me. “If all of this can happen in one environment, it's more likely she'll have the time to do the things she needs to do to stay healthy.”\nOne D.C. woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, recently met with Health Leads in the lobby of the office where she takes her grandson, who lives with her, for asthma treatment. The group told her that the roaches in her mobile home might be exacerbating his asthma and taught her how to trap them with roach motels.\nRoughly two-thirds of Health Leads patients secure at least one resource—receiving food, getting their heat turned back on, or finding a job—within 90 days of speaking to a volunteer, Onie told The Atlantic in 2011.\nIn San Francisco, Burke Harris launched the Center for Youth Wellness, where each child gets a universal screening for adverse childhood experiences as part of his or her first doctor's visit. Depending on the roots of the patient’s stress, the Center may provide counseling for both mother and child. Or it might refer them to a practitioner trained in biofeedback—a type of meditative training that aims to bring relaxation through greater awareness.\n“[The biofeedback specialist] hooks the kid up to a bunch of electrodes that measure things like heart rate and breathing,” Burke Harris said. “It helps them to bring a cognitive awareness to kids of their internal states. One thing we know that happens is that kids with toxic stress have decreased engagement of prefrontal cortex. When you have strengthening of the prefrontal cortex circuit, it helps to physiologically and neurologically balance effects of chronic stress.”\nPayment and Culture Obstacles\nThe rub is that Medicaid and other insurance don’t cover many of these services, so the groups are often left scrambling for funds. As Perrin puts it, the programs are “being paid for with a combination of bubble gum and rubber bands.”\nFrench told me that Health Leads also saw that, in addition to the roaches, the D.C. woman’s mobile home had very old carpet that needed to be replaced—but the organization can't afford to buy her new carpet right now.\nMeyers said that Boston’s city government, which picks up the tab for the discount bike program, would probably tolerate “two or three” bikes being stolen before they pulled out, but “there are many ways that this could cause a problem. The thing might just end.”\nAnother challenge is getting primary care physicians to screen for toxic stress and other poverty indicators in the first place.\n“That's something the medical community has not responded to at all,” Burke Harris said. “Physicians say, ‘What do you want me to do? I have a 15-minute patient visit.’”\nPerrin said the connections between destitution and illness have grown so strong that he’s been moved to push for poverty-combating legislation from a medical point of view.“We have a role to argue that we need to do things better for America’s families, like the minimum wage, and the Earned Income Tax Credit,” he said. “Those aren’t things doctors have traditionally talked about, but we’re starting to. If patients get the resources they need, we’ll have healthier people.”\nThis article available online at:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e77b19fd-0392-40f9-a71e-c060a34d035a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a researcher studying muscle tissue - how can I quickly distinguish between different types of muscle fibers while preserving their mRNA?","answer":"You can distinguish muscle fiber types using a combination of histochemical acetylcholine esterase stain and immunohistochemical staining with slow myosin heavy chain antibody. The process takes about 32 minutes and involves: 1) Using Karnowsky and Roots staining to identify neuromuscular junctions, 2) Applying NOQ7-5-4D antibody coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 to detect slow MyHC positive fibers. Singly innervated fibers (SIFs) show large C-shaped neuromuscular junctions and no slow MyHC staining, while multiply-innervated fibers (MIFs) have smaller circular junctions and are positive for slow MyHC.","context":["Sven Fraterman and Neal Rubinstein, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia\nTo locate gene products in distinct muscle fiber populations of different muscle allotypes, a novel protocol was established. A rapid method to distinguish muscle fiber types using histochemistry and immunohistochemistry was used to provide criteria for their selective isolation by laser capture microdissection while preserving messenger RNA (mRNA). Polymerase chain reaction showed a differential expression pattern of muscle specific genes in different muscle fibers in laser captured material.\nWhile vertebrate limb muscles have traditionally been the paradigm for studies of skeletal muscle myogenesis, a few atypical muscle groups such as extraocular muscles (EOMs) have distinct functional specializations and patterns of gene expression1. Differences between muscle groups (called allotypes) have been the subject of research for the past decades. The limb and EOM allotypes differ in their pattern of innervation. All limb fibers and 80% of EOM fibers are singly innervated fibers (SIFs) which have only one neuromuscular junction. About 20% of EOM fibers are multiply-innervated fibers (MIFs): they have multiple neuromuscular junctions2. In the past, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were mainly used to study differences between muscle fiber populations3,4, While useful, these techniques are limited in their capability to assess multiple gene products from a mixed muscle fiber population. Moreover, the mixed fiber populations of these muscles make it impossible to study the composition of individual fiber types. To overcome these problems, laser capture microdissection was used to isolate different muscle fiber populations and analyze multiple gene products by polymerase chain reaction . The muscle fiber populations in EOM and limb muscle were distinguished by a combination of the histochemical acetylcholine esterase stain by Karnowsky and Roots5 and immunohistochemical staining with a mouse-monoclonal slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC) antibody (NOQ7-5-4D)6. SIFs show a large, C-shaped neuromuscular junction after acetylcholine esterase staining and do not react with the anti-slow MyHC antibody. The neuromuscular junction of MIFs is smaller and more circular and all MIFs are positive for slow MyHC by immuno-staining. Since mRNA is sensitive to degradation, total time from thawing the slides to dehydration by xylenes was reduced to 32 minutes by combining the histochemical and immunohistochemical reactions and the direct coupling of the antibody to Alexa Fluor 488 by Molecular Probes ZenonTM technology.\nThis protocol describes a way to isolate and visually distinguish muscle fiber population from two different muscle allotypes and characterize different muscle fibers by multiple RT-PCRs.\nEquipment and Reagents\nThis protocol requires the following reagents:\n◊ RNase Away (Invitrogen, Cat. # 10328-011)\n◊ ZenonTM Alexa Fluor 488 Mouse IgG1 Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Cat. # Z-25002)\n◊ PicoPureTM RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Cat. # KIT0204)\n◊ RiboAmpTM RNA Amplification Kit (Arcturus, Cat. # KIT0201)\n◊ Slow Myosin MyHC Antibody NOQ7-5-4D\n◊ PCR Primer (Invitrogen, custom-made)\n◊ Goat Serum (Sigma, Cat. # G-9023)\n◊ Ethanol (Pharmaco, Cat. # 111ACS200)\n◊ Hydranal-Xylenes (Riedel-de Haen, Cat. # 37866)\n◊ 2-Methylbutane (Fisher, Cat. # A-03551-4)\n◊ Colorfrost /Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher , Cat. # 12-550-19)\n◊ Acetylthiocholine Iodide (Sigma, Cat. # A-5751)\n◊ Sodium Acetate (Sigma, Cat. # S-2889)\n◊ Sodium Citrate (Fluka, Cat. # 71402)\n◊ Cupric Sulfate (Sigma, Cat. # C-1297)\n◊ CapSure HS LCM Caps (Arcturus, Cat. # LCM0214)\n◊ FastStart Taq DNA Poymerase (Roche, Cat. # 2 032 926)\n◊ dNTP Mix PCR Grade (Invitrogen, Cat. # 18427-013)\n◊ UltraPureTM Agarose (Invitrogen, Cat. # 15510-027)\n◊ UltraPureTM 10x TAE (Invitrogen, Cat. # 15558-026)\n◊ Ethidium Bromide (Sigma, Cat. # E-1510)\n◊ Tissue-Tek OCT Compound (Sakura, Cat. # 4538)\n◊ DEPC Treated Water (Ambion, Cat. # 9920)\nEquipment and Labware\n◊ General equipment necessary:\n◊ Disposable gloves\n◊ Flow hood\n◊ Dry ice\n◊ Liquid nitrogen\n◊ Ice or cold block\n◊ Nuclease-free, aerosol resistant tips\n◊ RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes\n◊ KimwipesTM or similar lint-free towels\nThe following laboratory equipment is required to microdissect muscle fiber properly:\n◊ Cryostat knife\n◊ Arcturus PixCell II Laser Capture Microdissection System with fluorescence package\n◊ QImaingTM Retiga 1300 cooled mono 12-bit digital camera\nThe following laboratory equipment is required for RNA isolation and analysis by RT-PCR:\n◊ Incubation oven\n◊ Arcturus alignment tray\n◊ Thermo Cycler with heated lid\n◊ Horizontal gel chamber\n◊ Power supply\n◊ Gel Doc 2000TM Documentation System (Bio-Rad, Cat. # 170-8615)\nIn addition to the usual precautions listed below, some special precautions were taken connected to the rapid staining protocol:\n1. Use RNase AWAY according to the manufacturers instructions on laboratory bench surfaces, cryostat, cryostat knife, PixCell II Laser Capture Microdissection System and Arcturus alignment tray.\n2. Disposable gloves are to be frequently changed and RNase-free plasticware used.\n3. Heat inactivate serum.\n4. Use DEPC-treated water for the preparation of all staining solutions and for washing.\n5. Use chemicals in the highest grade available.\n6. Staining and washing time is to be reduced to a minimum, while still preserving the capability to distinguish different muscle fiber populations.\n1. After dissection, limb muscle and EOMs are covered in OCT compound and successively frozen in cooled 2methylbutane (30 seconds) and liquid nitrogen (10 minutes). The muscle can be stored at -80C.\n2. The muscle is cut into 10 m sections with the cryostat. During the cutting process, the slides with 4 sections each are stored on dry ice and are afterwards stored at -80C.\n3. For the acetylcholine esterase stain by Karnowsky and Roots, the following solution is prepared in the following order:\n5 mg of acetylthiocholine iodide are dissolved in 6.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2, followed by:\n0.5 ml 0.2 M sodium citrate,\n1.0 ml of 30 mM cupric sulfate,\n1.0 ml DEPC-treated water, and\n1.0 ml of 5 mM potassium ferricyanide.\nLarger q uantities of the four solutions can be prepared and stored at 4C. But the staining solution has to be prepared fresh since the acetylthiocholine starts to precipitate out of solution after 2 hours.\n4. To stain slow MyHC positive fibers rapidly Molecular Probess ZenonTM antibody-labeling technology is used. 20 l of NOQ7-5-4D are mixed with 5 l of Component A (ZenonTM mouse labeling reagent), incubated for 5 minutes. Followed by 5 minutes of incubation with Component B (ZenonTM mouse blocking reagent).\n5. After adding Component B to NOQ75-4D, the slide for laser capture microdissection is placed in DEPC-treated water with 2% heat inactivated goat serum for 5 minutes to block non-specific binding sites.\n6. The Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated NOQ7-5-4D antibody is diluted 1:40 in the prepared acetylcholine esterase staining solution.\n7. The blocked slide is now incubated with the prepared staining solution for 20 minutes.\n8. After 20 minutes, the slide is washed twice for 3 minutes in DEPC treated water.\n9. The slide is dehydrated in 75%, 90%, and 100% ethanol for 30 seconds respectively, followed by 5 and 7 minutes in fresh xylenes. After 1 minute in a flow hood the slide is ready for laser capture microdissection.\n10. The Arcturus PixCell II Laser Capture Microdissection System with fluorescence package is switched on and the blue filter cube is set. The QImaingTM Retiga 1300 cooled mono 12-bit digital camera is activated.\n11. The microdissection laser is set to 7 m size, 70 mW power and 850 s pulse duration. The last two values are adjusted to the lowest values possible to still perform laser capture microdissection. This adjustment to a minimal setting enables to actually dissect single muscle fibers.\n12. SIFs were dissected based on their large neuromuscular junction stained by Karnowsky and Rootss acetylcholine esterase stain and their lack of slow MyHC staining (Figure 1C). MIFs were dissected based on their smaller neuromuscular junction and a positive signal for slow MyHC (Figure 1A). Additionally, muscle fibers were dissected which were positive or negative for slow MyHC, but didnt show a site of innervation based on Karnowsky and Rootss acetylcholine esterase stain. To dissect single fibers, it can be advantageous to search for fibers on the edge of a fiber bundle as they prove to be easier to dissect without picking up undesired fiber populations.\n13. To avoid cross-contamination by other cell types, every cap is scanned visually after the dissection by placing the cap on a fresh slide and viewing it at lowest power. This is followed by a scan at the highest power to make sure that only the desired tissue was captured based on the fluorescence signal (Figures 1B and 1D). The cap is discarded, if unwanted tissue was present. Monochrome pictures of samples were taken using the QImaingTM Retiga 1300 cooled mono 12-bit digital camera.\n14. Each cap is then placed in an ExtracSureTM device. The RNA from approximately 25 fibers of each population is pooled and RNA extraction is performed with the PicoPureTM RNA Isolation Kit as described in its protocol within 2 hours of the dehydration with xylenes.\n15. After the RNA is extracted, the RiboAmpTM RNA Amplification Kit is used according to the manufacturers instructions to linearly amplify the sample RNA and transcribe the aRNA back to single stranded cDNA. One round of linear amplification was performed for all samples, typically yielding 300 - 600 ng of aRNA.\n16. To study expression of muscle specific genes, 50 ng cDNA are amplified with FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase for 40 cycles with conditions and reagents as presented in Table I. The epsilon- and gamma- subunit of the a cetylcholine receptor and slow MyHC are amplified. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was amplified as a reference for the amount loaded and the quality of the cDNA. All primers (Table II) are intron spanning to produce a cDNA specific PCR product. To avoid false positive results by PCR product carry-over, PCRs are setup in a flow hood.\n17. 15 l of each PCR product were loaded on a 2% agarose gel and separated by 120 V for 25 minutes. Gels are stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using the Gel Doc 2000TM Gel Documentation System.\nThe data presented in this application note demonstrates that it is possible to isolate a single muscle fiber type or a distinct muscle fiber population and analyze from it the expression of muscle specific genes by RTPCR. Figure 1 demonstrates the isolation of an individual fiber type by LCM. The ZenonTM technology based immunohistochemical staining of slow MyHC positive fibers gives a strong, unambiguous signal in less than 35 minutes. The acetylcholine esterase stain of Karnowsky and Roots allows us to assess rapidly the innervation pattern of muscle fibers. When used alone, this esterase stain can provide results within 5-10 minutes. Hence, rapid identification of distinct fibers based on their immunohistochemistry and innervation pattern allows us time to process tissue via LCM and isolate mRNA without significant time for degradation.\nUsing this type of analysis on limb muscle confirms data previously obtained by other means4. Hence, we can apply the technique to another muscle allotype, the EOM, and be sure that this protocol and the Arcturus PixCell II Laser Capture Microdissection System is sufficient to distinguish muscle fiber types and give new insight into the differences among muscle allotypes.\n1.

{"question":"what coins found in ramla excavation and what business practices existed?","answer":"Two bronze coins were discovered in Ramla: a Byzanto-Arab follis from 645-670 CE and an Abbasid follis minted in Ramla from 805-806 CE. Regarding business practices, Muslims developed several innovative financial methods including partnerships, checks, and credit, which emerged from their use of a money economy. Additionally, they had organized craft guilds whose leaders regulated quality, price, and production of goods.","context":["In January 2019, a salvage excavation was carried out along Shalom Aleichem Street in Ramla (Permit No. A-8421; map. ref. 187333–59/649161–81; Fig. 1) after antiquities were damaged prior to construction. The excavation, on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, was directed by D. Masarwa, with the assistance of Y. Amrani (administration), A. Peretz (photography), M. Kahan (surveying and drafting), S. Krispin (metal detection), Y. Tepper (scientific guidance), H. Torgë (pottery), M. Shuiskaya (pottery drawing), N. Katznelson (glass), A. Varnai-Ganor (glass restoration), C. Hersch (glass drawing), R. Kool (numismatics) and A. Dagot (location map).\nRamla was founded in the early eighth century CE by the governor of the district of Palestine, Sulayman ibn Abdel Malik of the Umayyad dynasty, who later received the title of caliph. In many excavations over recent years in Ramla, remains have been found of an extensive and prosperous settlement from the Early Islamic period, which continued in existence until the Ottoman period (for excavations in the vicinity of the current excavation, see Shlomi 2008; Korin 2009; Masarwa 2011; Eshed 2014; Toueg 2015; for the location of these excavations, see Fig. 1).\nTwo excavation squares were opened (D2, D3) revealing a channel and construction remains from the Abbasid period (eighth–ninth centuries CE; Figs. 2, 3).\nA water channel (L102; exposed length c. 4.5 m, width c. 0.15 m), running in a general east–west direction, was revealed in the western part of the excavation area. It was built of small fieldstones and coated with gray plaster. The channel, which continued beyond the excavation area, seems to have served for either irrigation or sewage. Parts of a floor bedding comprising small fieldstones and gray mortar abutted the channel on the north and south (L105, L108). Two bronze coins were found on Bedding 105: a Byzanto-Arab follis (645–670 CE; IAA 165370) and an Abbasid follis minted in Ramla (805–806 CE; IAA 165371). pottery sherds the Abbasid period were discovered on the beddings and in the soil fill above the channel (L100).\nNorth of the channel was a wall segment (W106; Fig. 4) built of small fieldstones bonded with gray mortar; it may have been part of an installation. The wall was cut by a modern cesspit (L103; 0.4 × 0.7 m; see Fig. 4), which was lined with small and medium-sized fieldstones bonded with gray mortar.\nA round refuse pit (L104; diam. 0.7 m, depth 0.6 m) was dug into brown soil in the eastern part of the excavation area. Pottery sherds, including Abbasid-period oil lamps, and a few fragments of glass vessels from the Abbasid and Fatimid periods (Katznelson, below) were found in the pit.\nThe pottery finds from the excavation were dated to the Abbasid period. These included a krater (Fig. 5:1), a glazed bowl (Fig. 5:2), a body fragment of a barbotine jug (Fig. 5:3), a juglet (Fig. 5:4), a pomegranate-shaped vessel (Fig. 5:5), a flask (Fig. 5:6) and oil lamps (Fig. 5:7–9).\nThe Glass Finds\nThe excavation yielded very few glass fragments, all dated to the Abbasid–Fatimid periods. The fragments include an almost complete miniature bottle (Fig. 6:1) and a small lower part of a decorated vessel (Fig. 6:2). Also found was a small rim and neck fragment (not drawn), which is colorless, with pitting and silver iridescent weathering—possibly belonging to a bottle of unclear shape, a rounded rim and a cylindrical neck.\nBottle No. 1 has a tubular, unevenly squatted body with a thick, flattened base, which is oval in shape. The bottle’s rim and the upper part of the neck are missing; the bottom of the base is broken, where the pontil may have been attached. Vertical tooling marks visible on the vessel’s body indicate that it was probably drawn after inflating, resulting in its irregular shape. Similar small cylindrical bottles with a rounded rim and a short neck are well known in Abbasid–Fatimid contexts all around Israel, including Ramla (Gorin-Rosen 2010:231, Pl. 10.5:3, see discussion and further references therein).\nThe complete shape of Vessel No. 2 is unclear. Its base is pushed-in and pinched with an interior loop above a disk-shaped ring. Bases of such form are rare in Israel, appearing at Bet She’an in Abbasid–Fatimid levels (Hadad 2005: Pl. 38:797–800). Similar loop-shaped bases ascribed to globular bowls or bottles were found in the shipwreck at Serçhe Limani from the early eleventh century CE. However, no parallels for a complete vessel profile have been suggested (Lledó and Matthews 2009:430, Fig. 41-6, BA 772, 779, 791, 800, Type VII). Thus, our fragment, which bears small remains of a circular protruding design on its lower wall, is of special interest; the design could have been molded or impressed. Vessels with comparable motifs of impressed prunts include small globular bowls and bottles in the Kuwait Museum, which are described as either Egyptian or Syrian products of the ninth–tenth centuries CE (Carboni 2001:284–287, Cat. Nos. 3.52 a–d, 3.53 a, 3.55 e, f). A few parallels from excavations in Israel include a small Abbasid-period bottle from Khirbat ‘Adasa (Gorin-Rosen 2008: Fig. 3:5, see a reference therein for Bet She’an).\nThe excavation revealed settlement remains from the Abbasid period (eighth–ninth centuries). The coin from the mid-seventh century CE, along with the glass vessels from the Abbasid–Fatimid periods, attest to additional periods during which the site was inhabited.\nCarboni S. 2001.

Identify the traditions that influenced Muslim art, architecture, and literature.Explain the advances Muslims made in centers of learning.\n2 Terms and Peoplesocial mobility – the ability to move up in social classFirdawsi – poet known for his history of Persia, the Shah of Namah (Book of Kings)Omar Khayyám – scholar, astronomer, and philosopher, best known for the Rubáiyátcalligraphy – art of beautiful handwritingIbn Rushd – a scholar who put all knowledge, except the Quran, to the test of reason\n3 Terms and People (continued) Ibn Khaldun – devised a set of standards for the scientific study of history; emphasized economics, social structure, and avoiding biasAl-Khwarizmi – a mathematician who pioneered the study of algebraMuhammad al-Razi – studied measles and smallpox; taught to treat the mind as well as the bodyIbn Sina – wrote the Canon on Medicine, an encyclopedia of medicinal cures3\n4 What did Muslims achieve in economics, art, literature, and science? Under the Abbasids, Muslim civilization absorbed traditions from all of the people who lived under Muslim rule, including Jews and Christians. The great works produced by scholars of the Abbasid period shaped Muslim culture and civilization.European scholars began to study Muslim philosophy, art, and science.\n5 Camel caravans crossed the Sahara to West Africa. Muslim rulers united diverse cultures and incorporated learning from many regions.Camel caravans crossed the Sahara to West Africa.The Silk Road brought trade from East Asia and provided a link to Europe.Monsoon winds brought ships to Asia and East Africa.Merchants were valued in the Muslim world. They spread products, cultures, and ideas widely.5\n6 Indian numbers were introduced and became today’s Arabic numerals. Sugar arrived from India.Papermaking came from China.As more people converted to Islam, Arabic became widely understood, facilitating trade and new learning.New business practices, such as partnerships, checks, and credit, grew from the use of a money economy.\n7 Some valued products included: Steel swords—DamascusLeather goods—CórdobaCotton textiles—EgyptCarpets—PersiaHandicraft industries were valued. Heads of each guild regulated quality, price, and production.Muslim rulers extended agriculture.In addition to food, farmers grew cotton, sugar cane, flowers, and herbs.\n8 Slavery did exist, however. There was social mobility, with options to improve one’s standing through religious, military, or scholastic achievements.Slavery did exist, however.Many slaves were house servants, skilled artisans, or soldiers, who could earn their freedom.Slaves could often buy their freedom. If a slave’s father was a freeman, he could be freed as well.8\n9 Islamic art and literature reflected the diverse cultures within the Muslim world. It was forbidden to portray God or human figures in religious art.The Quran itself was the greatest literature.\n10 The rich tradition of Arab storytelling continued in this period. Firdawsi’s the Shah Namah, or Book of Kings, told of the history of Persia.The Rubáiyát, by Omar Khayyám, is a philosophical work in four- line stanzas.Poets wrote tales of romantic and dangerous desert journeys. Some are remembered today—“Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves” and “Aladdin and His Magic Lamp,” from The Thousand and One Nights.\n11 Domes and arches adapted from the Byzantines became symbolic of Muslim architecture. The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem is the oldest surviving example of Muslim architecture. It was built in 688.Domed mosques and high minarets still dominate Muslim cities such as Medina.\n12 Works in elaborate flowing script, especially illustrating verses of the Quran, are found as decorations on buildings, ceramics, and books.Muslim artists perfected skills in calligraphy.\n13 Muhammad’s great respect for learning inspired advances in philosophy, history, mathematics, and the sciences.Learning from earlier civilizations was translated into Arabic from Persian, Sanskrit, and Greek.Great centers of learning were founded in cities such as Cairo, Baghdad, Córdoba, and Timbuktu.\n14 Ibn Rushd put knowledge to the test of reason. Ibn Khaldun set standards to avoid bias and error in the study of history.Arab scholars translated works from Greek, Hindu, and Buddhist philosophers.Scholars sought to harmonize Greek ideas, based on reason, with Muslim ideas based on divine revelation.\n15 Arab scholars made many mathematical advances. Arab mathematicians developed what became our modern number system.The study of algebra was pioneered by al-Khwarizmi in the 800s.\n16 Building on the work of the Greeks, Muslims greatly advanced medicine and public health. Physicians and pharmacists had to pass tests.There were hospitals and physicians who traveled to rural areas.Pharmacists mixed bitter-tasting medicines with sweet-tasting syrups and gums for the first time.\n17 Muhammad al-Razi studied measles and smallpox Muhammad al-Razi studied measles and smallpox. He also stressed the need to treat the mind as well as the body.Ibn Sina compiled a huge encyclopedia of all known medical knowledge called the Canon on Medicine.Muslim physicians made great advances in medicine.Arabic physicians could even perform cataract surgery using hollow needles."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:97af19e3-a832-4e5c-b7c2-db6d6460b326>","<urn:uuid:88fd6dc5-db56-49ba-8f27-f1d9500e2589>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What preparation is needed before a lumbar puncture for suspected meningitis, and how quickly do doctors begin treatment?","answer":"Before a lumbar puncture, patients must inform their doctor about any medications (especially blood thinners), history of seizures, pregnancy, and bleeding disorders. While fasting isn't usually required unless sedation is planned, patients should arrange for someone to drive them home afterward. For cases of suspected meningitis, doctors begin treatment rapidly, often starting antibiotics before the spinal tap results are available, which can take several hours to return. The doctor makes initial treatment decisions based on symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient may be immediately placed in isolation upon arrival at the emergency department, and various tests including blood work and imaging may be ordered alongside the lumbar puncture procedure.","context":["What is a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture (LP) or spinal tap may be done to diagnose or treat a condition. For this procedure, your doctor inserts a hollow needle into the space surrounding the spinal column (subarachnoid space) in the lower back to withdraw some cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or inject medication.\nCSF is a clear fluid that bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord. CSF is continuously made and reabsorbed in the brain.CSF is made up of cells, water, proteins, sugars, and other substances that are essential to maintain balance in the nervous system.\nWhy might I need a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture may be done for various reasons. The most common reason is to remove a small amount of CSF for testing. This can help in the diagnosis of various disorders. The fluid is tested for red and white blood cells, protein, and glucose (sugar). The clarity and color of the fluid are also checked and it is tested to see whether bacteria, viruses, or abnormal cells are present. Excess CSF may also be removed in people who have an overproduction or decreased absorption of the fluid.\nA lumbar puncture procedure may be helpful in diagnosing many diseases and disorders, including:\n- Meningitis. An inflammation of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. The inflammation is usually the result of a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.\n- Encephalitis. An inflammation of the brain that is usually caused by a virus.\n- Certain cancers involving the brain and spinal cord\n- Bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it (subarachnoid space)\n- Reye syndrome. A sometimes fatal disease that causes severe problems with the brain and other organs; Although the exact cause of the disease is not known, it has been linked to giving aspirin to children. It is now advised not to give aspirin to children during illnesses, unless prescribed by your child's doctor.\n- Myelitis. An inflammation of the spinal cord or bone marrow.\n- Neurosyphilis. A stage of syphilis during which the bacteria invades the central nervous system.\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome. A disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system.\n- Demyelinating diseases. Diseases that attack the protective coating that surrounds certain nerve fibers - for example, multiple sclerosis or acute demyelination polyneuropathy.\n- Headaches of unknown cause. After evaluation by a doctor and head imaging if necessary, a lumbar puncture may be done to diagnose certain inflammatory conditions that can result in a headache.\n- Pseudotumor cerebri (also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or IIH). In this condition,pressure within the subarachnoid space is elevated for reasons that are not clear. A lumbar puncture is only done in this condition after evaluation and head imaging.\n- Normal pressure hydrocephalus. A rare condition affecting mainly older people in which there is a triad of loss of urinary control, memory problems, and an unsteady gait. A lumbar puncture is done to see if the pressure of the CSF is elevated or not.\nIn addition, a lumbar puncture may be used to measure the pressure of the CSF. The doctor uses a special tube (called a manometer) to measures the pressure during a lumbar puncture.\nFinally, a lumbar puncture may be done to inject medicine directly into the spinal cord. These include:\n- Spinal anesthetics before a surgical procedure\n- Contrast dye for X-ray studies - for example, myelography\n- Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer\nYour doctor may have other reasons to recommend a lumbar puncture.\nWhat are the risks of a lumbar puncture?\nBecause this procedure involves the spinal cord and brain, the following complications may occur:\n- A small amount of CSF can leak from the needle insertion site. This can cause headaches after the procedure. If the leak continues, your headache can be severe.\n- You may have a slight risk of infection because the needle breaks the skin’s surface, providing a possible way for bacteria to enter the body.\n- You may have temporary pain or numbness of your legs or lower back pain.\n- Bleeding may occur in the spinal canal.\nYou may have other risks, depending on your specific medical condition. Be sure to discuss any concerns with your doctor before the procedure.\nHow do I get ready for a lumbar puncture?\nHow do I prepare for a lumbar puncture?\nCheck with your healthcare provider about what you should do before the procedure. Below is a list of common steps that you may be asked to do:\n- Your doctor will explain the procedure to you. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the procedure.\n- You will be asked to sign a consent form that gives permission to do the procedure. Read the form carefully and ask questions if something is not clear.\n- Generally, you won’t need to fast before a lumbar puncture unless a sedative is prescribed. Follow your doctor’s instructions.\n- Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.\n- Tell your doctor about any medications (prescribed and over-the-counter) and herbal supplements you take.\n- Tell your doctor if you have a history of seizures or if you are taking any prescribed medications for seizures.\n- Tell your doctor if you have a history of bleeding disorders or if you are taking any anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medications, aspirin, or other medications that affect blood clotting. It may be necessary for you to stop these medications prior to the procedure.\n- If the procedure is done on an outpatient basis, you may be asked to remain in the hospital for several hours following the procedure. You should plan to have another person drive you home.\n- Based on your medical condition, your doctor may request other specific preparation.\nWhat happens during a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture procedure may be done on an outpatient basis or as part of your stay in a hospital. Procedures may vary depending on your condition and your doctor's practices.\nGenerally, a lumbar puncture follows this process:\n- You will remove any clothing, jewelry, or other objects that may interfere with the procedure.\n- You will be given a gown to wear.\n- You will be reminded to empty your bladder prior to the start of the procedure.\n- During the lumbar puncture you may lie on the exam table on your side with your chin tucked to your chest and knees tucked to your abdomen. Or, you may sit on the edge of an exam table with your arms draped over a table positioned in front of you. In either position the back is arched, which helps to widen the spaces between your vertebrae.\n- Therefore, your back will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution and draped with sterile towels. The doctor will wear sterile gloves during the procedure.\n- The doctor will numb the skin by injecting a local anesthetic. This injection may sting for a few seconds, but makes the lumbar puncture less painful.\n- The hollow needle will be inserted through the numbed skin and into the space where the CSF is located. You will feel some pressure while the needle is inserted. You must remain absolutely still during the insertion of the needle.\n- The CSF will begin to drip out of the needle and a small amount, about one tablespoon, will be collected into test tubes.\n- If the doctor needs to inject medication into the spinal canal, it will be given through the same needle after the CSF is collected.\n- When the procedure is done, the needle will be removed and a bandage will be placed over the injection site. The test tubes will be taken to the lab for testing.\n- Tell the doctor if you feel any numbness, tingling, headache, or lightheadedness during the procedure.\nYou may have discomfort during a lumbar puncture. Your healthcare providers will use all possible comfort measures and complete the procedure as quickly as possible to minimize any discomfort or pain.\nWhat happens after a lumbar puncture?\nYou usually will be asked to lie flat for about one hour after the lumbar puncture is completed. This helps reduce the incidence of a headache. You will be allowed to roll from side to side as long as your head is not elevated. If you need to urinate, you may need to do so in a bedpan or urinal during the time that you need to stay flat.\nYou will be asked to drink extra fluids to rehydrate after the procedure. This replaces the CSF that was withdrawn during the spinal tap and reduces the chance of developing a headache.\nAfter recovery, you may be taken to your hospital room or discharged to your home. If you go home, usually your doctor will advise you to only engage in very light activity the rest of the day.\nOnce you are at home, notify your doctor of any abnormalities, such as:\n- Numbness and tingling of the legs\n- Drainage of blood or pain at the injection site\n- Inability to urinate\nIf the headaches persist for more than a few hours after the procedure, or when you change positions, you should contact your doctor.\nYou may be instructed to limit your activity for 24 hours following the procedure. Generally, if no complications occur, you may return to your normal diet and activities.\nYour health care provider may give you other specific instructions about what you should do after a lumbar puncture.\nBefore you agree to the test or the procedure make sure you know:\n- The name of the test or procedure\n- The reason you are having the test or procedure\n- The risks and benefits of the test or procedure\n- When and where you are to have the test or procedure and who will do it\n- When and how will you get the results\n- How much will you have to pay for the test or procedure\nOnline Medical Reviewer:\nNelson, Gail A., MS, APRN, BC\nOnline Medical Reviewer:\nWeisbart, Ed, M.D.\nLast Review Date:\n© 2000-2015 The StayWell Company, LLC. 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067.

Additionally, a mask may be placed over your nose and mouth to further prevent the spread of infection.\nExamination: The doctor performs an early examination to determine if help is needed with breathing or blood pressure. The doctor then checks your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.\nTesting: Once the doctor examines you and learns of your symptoms, further evaluation depends on the doctor's assessment of the likelihood of meningitis. If the doctor suspects bacterial meningitis, he or she may order the following:\nAntibiotics may be given early in the evaluation.\nA CT scan may be performed. This can sometimes determine if the brain is infected or has an abscess.\nBlood is drawn to check the white and red blood cell counts.\nA chest X-ray film may be obtained to look for signs of pneumonia or fluid in the lungs.\nOther tests may be performed to look for other sources of infection.\nSpinal tap: A spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, is necessary to diagnose meningitis. The results of the spinal tap are essential to help the doctor determine both the presence and then the type of meningitis. Correctly diagnosing meningitis is absolutely essential to guide treatment decisions. If you are too sick for a spinal tap, you will be treated with antibiotics on the assumption that you have meningitis. The spinal tap will be done when your condition improves.\nCerebrospinal fluid is obtained through a spinal tap. This fluid surrounds and cushions the brain and the spinal cord. The fluid is analyzed in the lab for things like the presence of white and red blood cells and protein and glucose (sugar) levels. The doctor then interprets the test results to determine if meningitis is present. The test results can also indicate if the meningitis is due to a bacterial infection, fungal infection, or a virus.\nTo obtain the fluid, you are given an injection of lidocaine (Anestacaine, UAD Caine, Xylocaine HCl, Xylocaine-MPF), a local anesthetic similar to Novocaine used by dentists. A small needle is placed in the lower back, around the small of the back, to obtain the fluid.\nAlthough the spinal tap can sometimes be uncomfortable, it is generally not very painful. The main complications of the procedure are headache, which occasionally occurs, and infection, which is extremely rare.\nBecause the results of the spinal tap can take up to several hours to return, the treatment often begins before the results are available. The doctor focuses early treatment on a medical opinion of the most likely cause based on your symptoms and physical examination findings.\nMedically Reviewed by a Doctor on 11/4/2014\nMust Read Articles Related to Meningitis in Adults\nFever in Adults\nA fever is a body temperature of 100.4 F or greater.

{"question":"What happens when asbestos is combined with other materials for heat resistance?","answer":"When asbestos is combined with other materials, it can achieve enhanced heat resistance properties. For example, when combined with silicone resin, the reinforced plastic can retain 50% of its room temperature tensile strength or produce a minimum 10,000 psi after 5-10 hours at 1,200°F. When combined with phenolic resins, the resulting products can provide insulation and retain strength when subjected to 5,000°F for periods of 1 to 30 minutes.","context":["Question?

As the author points out, while this is a lenghty article, there is far more detailed information about asbestos properties, chemistry, etc. A separate ASBESTOS BIBLIOGRAPHY gives access to much of that data.\nOur articles about the properties, manufacture & uses of asbestos-containing products includes detailed information on the production methods, asbestos content, and the identity and use of asbestos-containing materials. Page top photo: tremolite asbestos in the forensic laboratory ©Daniel Friedman.\nGreen links show where you are. © Copyright 2014 InspectApedia.com, All Rights Reserved.\n[Click to enlarge any image]\nThe following text is Adapted from Rosato (1959) p. 37-611  © 2013 InspectApedia.com\nThe physical, mechanical, chemical, electrical, and related properties of asbestos without such added materials as Cement, rubber, etc., will be reviewed. However, it is important to appreciate that far more data for these afore-mentioned items are available. They are reviewed in the chapters listed at the end of this page - chapters which explain the properties of asbestos when it is combined with various other materials.\nThese data are directly related to the performance of products or end items; they are more important, inasmuch as more than 95 per cent of the asbestos used is combined with other materials. Some products are never identified as containing asbestos even when as much as fifty per cent of their content is asbestos, e.g., asphalt tile, vinyl tile, and plastics.\nBasic properties of raw asbestos are interesting and important, but when the asbestos is combined with other materials, drastic differences may occur.\nPhysical and chemical properties of asbestos (as with many other materials) can be altered; e.g., heat resistance of asbestos fiber is a very important characteristic; it can produce more interesting results, however, when it is combined with other types of materials.\nWhen asbestos fibers are subjected to a temperature of 1,200°F, their tensile strength values are extremely high. In comparison, tensile strength values of organic and inorganic fibers are completely destroyed or melt between 200 and 900°F.\nFigure 2.2. View showing parallel fiber structure of asbestos vein, (Courtesy Johns-Manville-Corp.)\nUltimate tensile strength of chrysotile asbestos fibers is approximately 42,000 psi after two minutes at 1,2Q0°F ; 32 per cent strength retention occurs.\nAfter one hour at 1,200°F, tensile strength drops to 2,000 psi. When the fibers are com- bined with silicone resin to produce structural plastics, the reinforced plastic can retain 50 per cent of its room temperature tensile strength or produce a minimum 10,000 psi after 5 to 10 hr. at 1,200°F.\nWith phenolic resins, asbestos products are produced which will provide insulation and retain strength when subjected to 5,000°F for periods of minutes (1 to 30 minutes) . See Figure 2.1 in which a rocket motor part is subjected to a temperature of 5,000°F. Figure 2.1. Rocket motor aft (asbestos-phenolic insulator) before and after firing at 5,000°F.\nThe temperature approximately 1/8 in. from the surface exposed to 5,000°F will be approximately 200°F after 1/2 to 1 min. of exposure.\nWhen combined with magnesium carbonate and other similar products, heat insulators can be produced which will be useful for many years in such applications as boilers operating at temperatures from 500° to 1,200°F or 1,800°F. Although asbestos fiber mechanically breaks down at approximately 1,500°F, it does not completely disintegrate until 2,770°F. At this temperature, it can be related to such a ceramic material as magnesium oxide. When combined with other materials, it provides for interesting products in different temperature and time environments.\nAsbestos is used with such binders as epoxy, furane and phenolic resins to produce chemical resistant products, otherwise immediate breakdown of the asbestos would occur. Typical applications include spinning bobbins for the manufacture of synthetic fibers, chemical corrosion re sistant asbestos-cement pipes, and chemical resistant plastic tanks.\nAsbestos fibers can also be changed chemically to produce improved or completely different propertiès.*\nAsbestos fiber or paper treated with a 20 per cent, by weight, of aqueous solution of magnesium chloride, dried, dipped in a 20 per cent aqueous solution of concentrated ammonium hydroxide, and dried at 175° F, causes an increase in strength ten times greater than its original strength. It also produces a 165 per cent increase in dielectric strength.\nReports on the various types of asbestos versus heat and chemical conditions have originated from various sources. In the majority of cases, specific data on physical or chemical properties of asbestos fibers have been obtained for use in special programs.\nThe method of conducting tests as well as conditions of evaluating data must be understood in order to obtain conclusive statements. In reviewing these data, it is important to recognize that specific conclusions can sometimes limit the application of the product.\nFor example, in the textile field ASTM Grade AAAA has been reported to have a service temperature as high as 900°F.\nThe ASTM Underwriters' Grade specifies service temperature as high as 450°F. These particular temperature values tend to be meaningless inasmuch as time periods are not included; therefore, their usefulness is limited.\nSee ASBESTOS TEMPERATURE PROPERTIES for more details about the effects of high temperatures on asbestos fibers & products.\nBasically, asbestos is the only mineral which can be woven like cotton; it can resist fire, heat, time, weather and many 'acids or, alkalies. When it is used with other materials, its strong flexible fibers interlock to form .reinforcing webs within solids, liquids, and semiliquids.\nThe resulting products can gain durability and toughness as well as increased resistance to breakage, abrasion, and wear. The fibrous structure of an asbestos vein is shown in Figure 2.2 earlier on this page.\n* Callinan, T. D. (to General Electric Co.)

{"question":"Como estudiante de diseño industrial, me gustaría entender mejor la evolución del diseño finlandés. ¿Cómo se refleja la funcionalidad en el diseño tanto en las obras de Saarinen como en el diseño finlandés contemporáneo? 🤔","answer":"Functionality is a core principle in both Saarinen's work and contemporary Finnish design. In current Finnish design, as seen at Helsinki Design Week, functionality is combined with craftsmanship and a touch of eccentricity, particularly evident in modular and multi-functional pieces that address space-saving needs in expensive cities like Helsinki. This approach emphasizes durability, sustainability, and timeless aesthetics. Similarly, Saarinen's work, particularly his furniture designs, focused on solving practical problems while incorporating innovative materials and construction techniques. His designs, like the Womb chair, were created to improve people's habits and quality of life, combining functionality with comfort and security. Both approaches demonstrate how Finnish design consistently prioritizes practical utility while maintaining aesthetic excellence.","context":["The words “Scandinavian design” have become a shorthand for sleek, understated and beautiful minimalism. But when it’s not dressed in Cos basics, Scandi design is far from a catch all term; as each nation would attest. This is certainly evident in Helsinki Design Week, the annual event that both celebrates and carves out a distinct stance on the matter.\nAs seemingly with most things in Finland, designs are delivered with sincerity, craftsmanship and a touch of eccentricity that shows the Fins take things simultaneously very seriously indeed, but always with a certain playfulness. It is about beauty, but also about functionality: most importantly, these never have to mean they aren’t about fun. This is no more evident than in the work of 83-year-old, permanently cheerful designer Eero Aarnio (www.eeroaarnio.com), inventor of the iconic 1963 Ball chair. His modernist studio and home in the forests around Helsinki acts like both a miniature museum and busy workspace. Despite being at an age where most would settle with repeats of Midsummer Murders, Horlicks and telling young people to get a haircut, Aarnio is as busy as ever, working on numerous new prototypes and harbouring dreams about designing an electric car.\nWorks like Aarnio’s Ball and Ring chairs and glistening Puppy pieces don’t become classics by accident. Down to their very core they speak volumes about play and joy: the bright colours, the shining materials, the rounded forms say something fundamental about enjoying life through enjoying objects and aesthetics. But they’re more than items of frivolity, they’re durable, functional and thoughtful too.\nThis triumvirate of design qualities has permeated throughout Finnish construction more widely, as attested by many of the pieces at this year’s Habitare design fair, a vast product, furniture and interiors showcase. Ranging from the quintessentially Finnish Moomin lights (moominlights.com), designed by Harri Koskinen and made in Finland by Melaja, to Helsinki-based artist Man Yau’s adorable Toystory (www.manyau.fi/toystory.html) range of glass blown dildos to Lumo Kids’ fun, Nintendo-esque Mushroom Stool (www.lumokids.com); cute is never at the cost of class and functionality.\nThe Mushroom stool exemplifies another trope central to much Finnish design: modularity and multi-functionalism. Helsinki isn’t a cheap city to live in, so space is at a premium, and designers are increasingly focusing on making pieces that save space and easily metamorphose. Think sofa beds for the design crowd. While the “s” word – sustainability – is less loudly on people’s lips at HDW, the use of sustainable materials and processes is very much the backbone of Finnish design. Materials are made to last, and the simple yet slightly eccentric aesthetic makes pieces timeless. As Tanja Sipilä, the founder of Helsinki-based design and lifestyle store Tre (www.blog.worldoftre.com) surmises, life – like design – must be enjoyed. If possible, the objects we surround ourselves with should be transparent in their meaning and ethics, and inspiring in their appearance.\nOf course, design products at fairs are about aspiration: there’s no suggestion we can all afford such beautifully functional objects. But one of the most important things we learnt from the Finnish design community wasn’t about acquisition or luxury, but about a sense of community and relaxation. Combining superb forms with togetherness and tradition, the new Loyly Design Sauna, created by avanto architects, is a sensitively drawn yet viscerally modern structure in the city’s archipelago area overlooking the sea. The main materials are black concrete, light Scandinavian birch wood, blackened steel and wool, and as well as three public saunas–unusual in their mixed-gender, swimming costumed rules–there’s a gorgeous restaurant and lounge, with interiors by Joanna Laajisto Creative Studio. But beneath the carefully curated materials and well-groomed clientele lies rather more timeless sensibilities: of socialising (you can’t take a phone into a sauna, or the sea), time out and simple pleasures. In the often fraught world of modern life, and modern design, it’s just the sort of reminder you need that the devil might not always be in the details, but in delight.\nFind out more about Helsinki Design Week: www.helsinkidesignweek.com which ran from 1-11 September.\n1.

He was best known for designing the Washington Dulles International Airport outside Washington, DC and the TWA Flight Center in New York City.\nImage source: https://www.futureartdesign.com/designers/eero-saarinen\nWhat Are The Most Important Events In His Life?\nHe was born in 1910 in Finland. Son of the architect Eliel Saarinen, he emigrated to the US with his family in 1923. In 1934, he graduated from Yale University and thanks to a Yale scholarship, he traveled to Europe again but he returned to the US in 1936 to work at his father’s architectural practice. Indeed, he perfected at the Cranbrook Institute of Architecture and Design of which his father was a director. Here, Eero Saarinen met Charles Eames in the late 1930s. Experimenting with Charles Eames, he co-developed new furniture forms and the first designs for furniture of molded laminated wood. In 1940, they both took part in the “Organic design in Home Furnishings” competition mounted by the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA). While Charles Eames continued to work on molded furniture in plywood, the Finnish architect decided to work on other materials.\nImage source: https://jenikirbyhistory.getarchive.net/amp/media/eero-petajaniemi-7906f8\nEero launched his own architectural practice after his father’s death, and in the ensuing decade produced a flood of important buildings and interior projects, establishing him on his own firmly within the canon of great modern architects. He loved models, especially large ones into which he could stick his own head in order to visualize the interior space, and numerous photographs exist showing him and his employees inspecting or constructing them. In August 1961, Saarinen complained of headaches as he was preparing for his firm to move from Detroit to New Haven, Connecticut, and checked himself into a Michigan hospital to seek a quick remedy. Doctors discovered instead that he had a brain tumor, and Saarinen elected to undergo an operation that promised a very slim chance of survival. He died during surgery, having turned 51 just a week and half earlier.\nImage source: https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/003bf048-0140-42d5-9a11-82ef2d4381db\nWhat Are His Most Successful Works?\nImage source: https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/e3a834d6-67ce-44a5-b00b-6e7db97721a8\nHis enormous success is certainly linked to the Knoll company for which he realized the “Womb” chair, and his most famous group “Tulip” or “Pedestal”, which incorporated inside it armchairs, chairs, dining tables, tables, stools.\n- The Womb chair\nIn 1948, Eero Saarinen designed the “Womb” collection, which was supposed, as the name suggests, to make those seated on it feel as secure and cozy as a fetus in the womb. He created a womblike chair using a glass fibre shell upholstered in foam rubber and fabric. The Womb Chair came to be when Eero was asked by Florence Bassett Knoll to create a chair she could curl up in. She wanted it to be shaped like a basket, large enough for lots of pillows, and one she could sink into to read a book. The Womb chair is designed to facilitate a relaxed sitting posture, providing emotional comfort and a sense of security-hence, the name “Womb.” The seat fits perfectly in both a modern and classic, industrial or minimal style. Its wide range of colors makes it possible to satisfy the various tastes while maintaining the unmistakable design that has made it an absolutely modern style icon. The Womb chair displays the Finnish-born designer’s flair for challenging rules, breaking molds and setting new standards for modern design.\nAbout Saarinen’s Style\nImage source: https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/159d9a45-cffd-4415-942c-68f9e41e529e\nSaarinen’s style follows rational and pure concepts but it is always incorporated to the search for innovative and revolutionary materials. His research, in fact, is not limited to the study of design but intends to improve people’s habits, improving their quality of life. His own work included a series of dramatically different designs that displayed a richer and more different vocabulary. In questioning the presuppositions of early modern architecture, he introduced sculptural forms that were rich in architectural character and visual drama unknown in earlier years. The exciting results were welcomed by many who were bored by the uniformity and austerity of the International Style of modern architecture.\nImage source: https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/e884e182-ef78-4626-8650-749d2a2a5fed\nSaarinen was considered to be part of the second generation of the modern movement within architecture. Like many contemporary architects, Saarinen was challenged by furniture design, especially the chairs, which presents aesthetical and structural problems that are particularly difficult to solve. The focus of his design practice was on utilizing new construction techniques as well as creating architecture which contained variety and visual effect. By the time of his death, Saarinen did not have a distinct architectural style, despite helping to bring modern architecture to mainstream America. Many of his publication proclaimed Saarinen to be the most influential architect of his era. He designed mostly with steel, glass and concrete. He enjoyed the concept of exposing the structure of the building with steel."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:797a0694-7d1d-481f-8d80-bc0a0a839725>","<urn:uuid:dd8958fc-8f72-4ff3-8d6a-1d87731a7ee6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you tell me about the medicinal uses of mastic in ancient Greece?","answer":"Mastic was widely used as a medicine in ancient Greece. It was specifically used as a remedy for snakebite, and several prominent ancient Greek physicians documented its benefits.

Greek fishermen were diving for sea sponges when they found the wreck in 1900.\nArchaeologists excavating the Antikythera shipwreck expedition in 2015 created a high-resolution, 3D map of the site using stereo cameras, mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).\nThe team created 3D virtual reconstructions of many artefacts on the seabed, and 3D-modelled all of the major recovered finds once on shore. A series of scientific analyses are now being conducted on these items, including DNA analysis of ancient ceramic jars to identify the 2,000 year-old food, drinks, perfumes, and medicines contained in them. Isotope analysis of lead objects will determine where the lead was mined, to reveal the home port of the ship.\nFoley thinks that underwater archaeology is one of the most exciting ways to bring the past back to life, as there is a huge amount of data on the sea floor waiting to be tapped into. \"The kinds of things you find on the seabed are different from what you find on land sites. A lot of land archaeology is carried out in tombs and burials which is a very specific record, whereas in the water you've got everything – from the most mundane stuff of everyday trade to some of the very valuable, elite goods,\" he says.\n\"Bronze statues are preserved on shipwrecks that would otherwise have been melted down and re-used if it were on land.\"\nEven more exciting is extracting ancient DNA from empty transport jars on shipwrecks. He is carrying out research on transport jars from classical Greece, from around 500-300 BCE and finding out what was being traded in the world's first economies.\n\"The conventional wisdom is that these jars mostly held wine. If the archaeological literature was correct, then 90% of the ancient economy was based on this single commodity and this just doesn't past the smell test,\" Foley argues.\nSo rather than finding grape DNA, Foley and his team have found olive DNA, mixed with around seven different species – a lot of vegetable materials – legumes, beans, nuts and walnuts Also herbs, particularly juniper, which the ancients used for flavouring. \"Only one jar was found containing grape DNA in the dozens we've looked at, and that seems certain to contain wine,\" he adds.\nThe archaeological team tried several methods to extract the DNA. The first way was by simply using a steel tool to scrape out some ceramic shavings and fragments from inside the amphora. Microbiologist Maria Hanson worked on the findings in the laboratory, to ascertain the origin of the samples.\nThis process only made it possible to work on a very limited surface. Foley turned to the latest technology available, which was being used by the Massachusetts state police forensics lab. \"We asked them how they recovered trace DNA from crime scenes and they put us on to these swabs that they use to extract tiny bits of DNA from. We tried this with the archaeological artefacts and it worked much better than the physical scraping method, and has the benefit of being completely non-destructive.\"\nThe archaeologist's goal is to find out how people transitioned from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. \"You can think of these shipwrecks as ancient telephone calls. The transmission lines are the shipping lanes and the ship's themselves are packets of information. With our technology now we can go out and find these telephone lines and eavesdrop on these ancient telephone calls. It would give us a really good understanding of how our distant ancestors created and invented civilisation, and actively transmitted civilisation across time and space.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:193928d1-2599-45f5-a70a-53c763510200>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm pregnant and take both folate and vitamin C supplements. Which one requires a higher daily dosage during pregnancy?","answer":"During pregnancy, folate requires a higher daily dosage. Pregnant women need 600 mcg of folate per day, while the recommended daily allowance for vitamin C during pregnancy is 85 mg. The folate requirement increases from the normal 400 mcg for non-pregnant women, while vitamin C increases from 75 mg to 85 mg during pregnancy.","context":["Why Folate matters for babies, tots and mama\nWhat to Know\n- Folate requirements before, during and after pregnancy\n- Identify important food sources of folate\nFolate, or folic acid, is an essential water-soluble B vitamin. Folate is the name of the naturally occurring nutrient found in food. The synthetic form, in supplements or fortified foods, is called folic acid. Folate helps our tissues and cells grow and function, so it’s a crucial nutrient during periods of rapid growth such as in pregnancy, infancy and adolescence. For babies in particular, folate supports the formation of the brain and spinal cord from the neural tube and plays a role in supporting your baby’s brain development.\nFortunately folate is found naturally in a wide variety of foods, including dark leafy vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, dairy products, meat, eggs, seafood and grains. Folate is particularly high in spinach, yeast, asparagus and Brussels sprouts. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers to enrich widely consumed breads, cereals, flours and other grain products with folic acid.\nNon-pregnant women aged 19 and older require 400 mcg of folic acid per day. During pregnancy, the requirement increases to 600 mcg per day and to 500 mcg per day while breastfeeding.\nWhile pregnant, supplementation is recommended because it can be difficult to meet the heightened folate requirement through diet alone. In fact, the US Public Health Service recommends that all women of childbearing age who are capable of becoming pregnant take 400 mcg of folic acid daily.Women who have had a child with spina bifida may need higher doses of folic acid, up to 4000 mcg per day starting one month prior to conception.\nEvidence suggests that healthful diets with adequate folate may reduce a woman’s risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord birth defect when taken before conception and continued throughout the first trimester of pregnancy.\nBabies up to 6 months of age need 65 mcg of folate daily which increases to 80 mcg from 7-12 months. Children up to 3 years of age need 150 mcg of folic acid daily. Breastfed, full term babies do not need folic acid supplementation unless indicated by the doctor. Once you start introducing solid foods in your baby’s diet, make sure to include foods rich in folic acid and continue doing so as your child grows older so she/he gets enough of this important nutrient.\nSee “What to Do” section for folate rich foods.\nWhat to Do\nInclude folate rich foods in your everyday diet and that of your child. Here are some good sources of folate:\n- Spinach, boiled ½ cup – 131 mcg / serving\n- Black-eyed peas, boiled, ½ cup- 105 mcg/ serving\n- Asparagus, boiled, 4 spears – 89 mcg/ serving\n- Lentils, cooked ½ cup – 179 mg/ serving\n- Brussels sprouts, frozen, boiled, ½ cup – 78 mcg/serving\n- Lettuce, romaine, shredded, 1 cup – 64 mcg/ serving\n- Avocado, raw, sliced, ½ cup – 59 /mcg / serving\n- Spinach, raw, 1 cup – 58 mcg/ serving\n- Broccoli, chopped, frozen, cooked, ½ cup – 52 mcg/ serving\n- Mustard greens, chopped, frozen, boiled, ½ cup – 52 mcg/ serving\n- Green peas, frozen, boiled, ½ cup- 47 mcg/ serving\n- Kidney beans, canned, ½ cup-46 mcg/ serving\n- Peanuts, dry roasted, 1 ounce – 41 mcg/ serving\n- Wheat germ, 2 tablespoons- 40 mcg/ serving\n- Tomato juice, canned, ¾ cup- 36 mcg/ serving\nTake a prenatal vitamin with 400 mcg of folic acid\nIf you are trying to conceive or are already pregnant, take a prenatal supplement that contains folic acid. It is good idea to take folic acid along with other B vitamins as these vitamins work well together.\nSpeak with your health care provider\nTalk to your doctor to determine the best folic acid dose for you. If you are taking other medications, ask your doctor if these interact well with folic acid absorption.","Vitamin C is an antioxidant present in many fruits and vegetables. Also known as L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C has a wide variety of uses in the body. It supports normal growth and development and helps the body repair damaged tissue.[2, 3] Vitamin C also assists in the production of collagen, a protein that’s necessary for healthy skin, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.\nTo say that vitamin C is beneficial would be an understatement. It influences iron absorption and helps fight cell-damaging free radicals. A 16-year study found that regular vitamin C supplementation promoted heart health. Additionally, people who consume foods rich in vitamin C or other antioxidants may lower their risk of high blood pressure.[7, 8, 9]\nHigh Doses of Vitamin C\nIn the 1970s, chemist and Nobel Peace laureate, Linus Pauling, proposed that high doses of vitamin C could help prevent the common cold. Many people swear by Pauling's claim that vitamin C can boost the immune system naturally, but the research is still inconclusive.\nA number of studies have examined whether high-dose vitamin C can provide extraordinary therapeutic results. Results thus far are inconclusive. However, animal studies have found that vitamin C may make traditional therapies more effective.\nNatural Dietary Sources of Vitamin C\nMany types of food are fortified with vitamins and vitamin C is usually in the mix. However, like all vitamins, it’s best to get your daily intake from organic, natural sources and the best, natural sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables. Below are some of the best foods for vitamin C.\n|Sources of Vitamin C|\n|Food and Serving Size||Vitamin C (mg/serving)|\n|Red or Yellow Bell Pepper, Raw, 1/2 cup||95|\n|Orange Juice, 3/4 cup||93|\n|Orange, 1 medium||70|\n|Grapefruit Juice, 3/4 cup||70|\n|Kiwifruit, 1 medium||64|\n|Green Bell Pepper, raw, 1/2 cup||60|\n|Broccoli, cooked, 1/2 cup||51|\n|Strawberries, fresh, sliced 1/2 cup||49|\n|Brussels sprouts, cooked, ½ cup||48|\n|Grapefruit, ½ medium||39|\n|Broccoli, raw, ½ cup||39|\n|Tomato juice, ¾ cup||33|\n|Cantaloupe, ½ cup||29|\n|Cabbage, cooked, ½ cup||28|\n|Cauliflower, raw, ½ cup||26|\n|1 Lemon Yield, 48g||18.6|\n|Potato, baked, 1 medium||17|\n|Tomato, raw, 1 Medium||17|\n|Spinach, cooked, 1/2 cup||9|\n|Green peas, frozen, cooked, 1/2 cup||8|\nDaily Intake of Vitamin C\nThe amount of vitamin C that a person needs may vary with factors like age or whether a person is smoking, pregnant, or even breastfeeding. These are the guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Dietary Supplements:\n|Recommended Daily Allowances of Vitamin C|\n|Age||Female||Male||Pregnant female||Breastfeeding female|\n|0-6 months||40 mg||40 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|7-12 months||50 mg||50 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|1-3 years||15 mg||15 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|4-8 years||25 mg||25 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|9-13 years||45 mg||45 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|14-18 years||65 mg||75 mg||80 mg||115 mg|\n|19+ years||75 mg||90 mg||85 mg||120 mg|\nDangers of Vitamin C Deficiency\nA lot of people might think “scurvy” is just pirate lingo, but it’s actually a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C. Symptoms of scurvy include fatigue, gum disease, anemia, scaly skin, and easy bruising. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in the United States these days but some people remain at risk.\nPeople who get too little variety in their food may not receive adequate nutrition. Normally, when we hear \"malnourished\" many of us think \"starving\", but what it's more likely to mean is that a person is deficient in specific nutrients and it's affecting their health. Those who rely on a carnivorous diet might miss their daily quota for vitamin C as meat and dairy don’t contain much of this critical nutrient. Infants fed evaporated or boiled cow's milk may not get enough vitamin C, especially since cow’s milk is low in vitamin C to begin with. Breast milk and infant formula are both better sources of vitamin C.\nSome medical conditions can cause vitamin C deficiency. Digestive tract injuries or inefficiencies, genetic diseases, and other issues can negatively affect not just vitamin C absorption, but nutrient absorption as a whole. Kidney disease and some types of cancer can also cause vitamin C deficiency.\nSmoking cigarettes is a bad idea for many reasons. One of the effects of the tissue damage it causes is the body using up vitamin C at a faster rate than normal. As a result, smokers and people exposed to second-hand smoke may need an extra 35 mg of vitamin C a day.\nVitamin C Supplementation\nUsually, if you follow a balanced diet with a foundation of organic fruits and vegetables, you’ll get all the vitamin C you need. If you don’t, vitamin C supplementation might be something to consider and discuss with your healthcare provider.\nBe aware of the difference between synthetic and natural vitamins. Synthetic supplements are manufactured with unnatural ingredients and chemicals. They are made to mimic natural vitamins but not everyone is convinced of their efficacy. Conversely, natural supplements are made using ingredients drawn straight from their natural sources.\nVitamin C supplements are usually available as ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, or calcium ascorbate. Synthetic and natural ascorbic acid have similar properties, but I always recommend a natural, plant-based source.[15, 16]\nIf your diet isn’t providing you with enough vitamin C, you should consider that it's not providing you with all the other nutrients your body requires, either. In such a case, you may want to skip the vitamin C supplement and look for a solid multivitamin. I recommend IntraMAX® and believe, without a doubt, that it’s the best multivitamin available anywhere. It’s an organic, liquid formula loaded with all the nutrients you need, as well as powerful antioxidant and immune system stimulators. It's as complete as it gets.\nWhere do you get your vitamin C?

{"question":"How do Bakshaish carpets preserve artistic spontaneity, and what parallels exist with autism education approaches?","answer":"Bakshaish carpets uniquely preserve spontaneity and expressiveness in room-size format, displaying bold drawing and improvised features despite requiring organized production methods. Multiple weavers collaborated while maintaining creative freedom, resulting in distinctive patterns and abrash effects typical of village rugs. Similarly in autism education, there's an ongoing debate about preserving authenticity versus standardization - some institutions like Celebrate the Children replicate 'neuro-typical' environments to help students develop real-world skills, while others advocate for sensory-sensitive spaces. Both contexts demonstrate the challenge of balancing authentic expression with practical requirements for larger-scale implementation.","context":["Bakshaish Carpets: The Room-Size Rug with a Soul\nBakshaish Carpets - There is an old Roman saying that one should not argue about matters of taste. And so it is in the world of antique carpets. Some of us like refined elegance and precision wrought with premeditated control; others prefer spontaneity and bold expressiveness responding to the inspiration of the moment. For some collectors and enthusiasts, the court carpet and its urban descendants are the epitome of rug production. They represent the result of countless trials and errors refined and perfected over time. Their designs are well laid out; they begin and end in the appropriate places; the borders turn the corner without interruption or confusion. Finely woven, their drawing is often high-resolution with subtle curves and undulations. For a carpet lover of another sort though, these qualities are boring, even distasteful. They like the homier products of village weaving or nomadic tribal groups. They take pleasure in the weaver who has no plans or cartoons save for those that reside in the memory. They appreciate angular jagged drawing that often goes hand in hand with a coarser weave. They enjoy the rug that has evident traces of the changing decisions and moods of the weaver – radical alterations of color or motif, or changes in proportion of the design. Improvisation of pattern where a border turns a corner is also a major source of such enjoyment to collectors of this second orientation. For the most part this divide of city versus village or tribe also involves a division of scale. True village and nomadic weavers seldom made rugs that we would describe as “room-size,” for within their native tradition they had no use for larger pieces of this sort. Consequently when we encounter larger carpets, they tend to be urban productions because urban weavers had long made carpets for larger architectural interiors. And, as a further result, room-size rugs seldom display the quirky expressiveness and spontaneity of village rugs. They are well-planned workshop pieces. Those who want expressive spontaneity are more or less by default enthusiasts or smaller rugs.\nEnter the Bakshaish carpets produced in Northern Iran. Not all Bakshaishes are big; there are smaller pieces. But those that are larger appear to be one of the few big carpet productions that managed to straddle the usual aesthetic divide between village or tribal and room-size carpet weaving. There is no Bakshaish pattern. Bakshaishes come in allover designs as well as medallion compositions. They may have floral or geometric designs, or something defiantly in between. But what distinguishes a Bakshaish is the bold, expressive drawing; one might almost call it expressionist. It has the same graphic quality one looks for in a great Kazak or a really good Turkish village rug. And like these, Bakshaish rugs may exhibit abrupt or radical abrash effects. In allover designs, the repeating motifs or medallions may change their form, scale, or proportion. The spacing of motifs, even central medallions, may be erratic or improvised. The drawing is large scale and graphic, and often highly geometricized, even when it is applied to a demonstrably urban prototype or model. The corner solutions are often improvised. Put simply, the Bakshaish is like a giant village rug, and for enthusiasts of village production, the Bakshaish represents one of the few options for a larger carpet.\nGiven the attention that village production has received in the more recent literature on the history of carpets, especially as exemplified by the work of scholars like Dr. Jon Thompson, it is surprising that the origins of the Bakshaish production are still not entirely clear. It would be wonderful if we could isolate or pinpoint the earlier traditions of the Bakshaish weavers in order to understand how they transferred a village aesthetic appropriate to scatter size rugs into the production of larger pieces. One can advance a tentative hypothesis. These were weavers who had traditionally produced smaller tribal or village products of Northwest Persian type such as we see in Kurdish weaving, which shares many of the same qualities as Bakshaishes. At some point, however, Bakshaish weavers were induced to get in on the production of room-size pieces for foreign markets. This involved a reorganization of production methods, for it takes more people and a greater investment to produce larger rugs. Perhaps whole villages or extended families collaborated to produce larger Bakshaish carpets. But what is striking is that such changes did not affect the creative or technical processes, which still favored improvisation and spontaneity, even though multiple weavers were involved in an organized, disciplined effort. This is where the magic of the large-scale Bakshaishes resides. They never lost their distinctive and idiosyncratic creative spark even in the midst of catering to the demands of the marketplace. The are the only room-sized carpets that convey the emotive power of the weaver as the best smaller village rugs do. It is this rare achievement that still makes them so prized among carpet lovers, and rightly so.","Similar to a mainstream school setting, Celebrate the Children, a school for children with autism, lines its hallways with colorful banners, photographs, and student artwork. Parents concerned with some of their children’s hypersensitivities often ask Monica Osgood, the school’s director, if there is too much stimulation. Monica responds that her students need to learn in ‘real’ world settings if they will ever have a chance to use their acquired skills outside of the classroom. This logic for replicating ‘neuro-typical’ environments, argues directly against the sensory sensitive approach, and, with reasons worth exploring. Individuals with autism often have very poor generalization skills. Therefore proponents of ‘neuro-typical’ simulated environments claim that sensory sensitive environments actually cause less, not more, universal access and integration into the larger population. Whether or not there is any truth to this claim is unknown. There are strong arguments for and against the ‘neuro-typical’ approach, but there are no definitive studies comparing the sensory sensitive approach to the ‘neuro-typical’ approach.\nThe first argument for the ‘neuro-typical’ approach is an argument against the prevalence of sensory difficulties in autism. Developmental Psychologist Uta Frith writes, “a question mark hangs over the sensory phenomena, which are often reported but not currently required for diagnosis.” Psychologists Meena O’neil and Robert Jones found that much of the early sensory research and conclusions suffer “from serious methodical limitations.” Many of the early studies lacked appropriate control groups and depended on “the limitations of retrospective parent-report methodology typical of the area” for data collection. In regards to the first-hand accounts, O’neil and Jones also point out that “a number of dangers are inherent in uncritically accepting these accounts at face value and in any wider generalization to the autistic population as a whole.” Still, some researchers, like Janet Kern, insist that more current research demonstrates that sensory processing dysfunction persist globally throughout autism and affects “all the main modalities and mulitsensory processing” systems. Others like Geraldine Dawson and Renee Watling contend that “sensory processing abnormalities are not universal or specific to autism, the prevalence of such abnormalities in autism is relatively high.” If sensory processing dysfunction is not universal to autism then it might be hard to advocate for sensory sensitive environments if they hinder generalization skill development, which appears to be a more universal difficultly for individuals on the autism spectrum.\nIn reality, you rarely hear proponents of the ‘neuro-typical’ approach denying sensory processing difficulties. They simply believe sensory sensitive environments are more limiting due to poor generalization skills. ‘Neuro-typical’ proponents are correct about poor generalization skills in autism. Laura Klinger and Geraldine Dawson’s research, at the University of Washington Autism Center, demonstrates that children with autism struggle applying previously learned concepts in new situations. For instance, if an individual learns how to use the bathroom in one particular setting s/he may not generalize this skill set to other bathroom settings. This struggle exposes an intriguing difference between the wiring of a ‘typical’ brain and an autistic brain.\nThe majority of human cognitive systems possess a “built-in propensity to form coherence over as wide a range of stimuli as possible, and to generalize over as wide a range of contexts as possible.” Uta Frith explains that poor generalization skills may be the result of an autistic brain’s propensity to discriminate between the finest of detail. “Autistic children might not be prepared to see similarities at a more abstract level, and hence would fail to place stimuli into the same category, even when they only differ in the tiniest detail.” Undoubtedly, if individuals are unable to transfer skills they become imprisoned to the select few autism specific environments where they acquired the skills.\nWith generalization in mind, USA Architects’ concept for the 167,000 square-foot Morris-Union Jointure Commission’s (MUJC) Developmental Learning Center (DLC) “was to replicate the environments and social settings that students would normally travel “off-campus” to experience.” USA Architects designed the main corridor as a “replica of a typical American main street.” This “street” includes the Commerce Bank, Warrenville and Berkeley Hardware Store, Carmen’s Barber Shop, Ferratti’s Plant Nursery, Towne Deli Diner, Manufacturing lab, ShopRite, and a mock Apartment complete with living and dining room, kitchen, bedroom, laundry and game rooms. Dr. Kim Coleman, MUJC’s superintendent, believes that, “Simulating the real world in school should make the transition to the real world that much less intimidating.”\nNot everyone agrees with Dr. Kim Coleman for several reasons. First, proponents of the ‘neuro-typical’ approach must assume that current ‘neuro-typical’ environments represent the best environments in which people learn. If not, then they are awkwardly advocating for designed environments that fail both mainstream and autistic individuals. For example, we know that sunlight and certain types of exterior views improve overall health, increase productivity, and reduce sick days and attrition rates. Yet, how many schools, grocery stores, retail stores, banks, and apartments provide adequate daylight and beneficial exterior views? In parts of California, for example, “many of the classrooms built since the 1960’s have little daylighting. Windows are commonly built with “black glass” that allows a view out, but no useful daylight in. Numerous schools have been built with no windows at all.” What type of ‘neuro-typical’ environment should architects replicate in such a context, the environment ‘neuro-typical’ students have or should have? If the latter, then the argument that replication helps generalization doesn’t apply. If the former, then could it also be argued that if ‘neuro-typical’ students learn to read in the dark, then individuals with autism must learn to read in the dark?\nAdditionally, proponents of the sensory sensitive approach argue that individuals with autism need an environment that helps them acquire a skill before they can generalize it. In other words, individuals can only generalize skills that they possess. If individuals cannot acquire or experience extreme difficulty learning a skill in a ‘neuro-typical’ simulated setting then the ‘neuro-typical’ argument is a hard sale.\nA third argument against replicating ‘neuro-typical’ environments is that such settings do not improve generalization skills, but merely mask poor ones. Being able to generalize skills does not mean being able to only function in substandard ‘neuro-typical’ environments. It means being able to use a skill in good, mediocre, and bad environments. ‘Neuro-typical’ environments attempt to simulate the real world so the individuals with autism never actually have to generalize skills. USA Architects’ DLC is somewhat of an exception to this. Unlike Celebrate the Children, the DLC does not attempt to replicate a ‘neuro-typical’ school. By not having to replicate a typical school, USA Architects were able to offer individuals more opportunities to practice generalizing skills. For example, there are a variety of bathrooms from residential to public scale. This emphasizes generalization over replicating skills in copied environments.\nThe last argument against the ‘neuro-typical’ approach stems from a larger question about society’s responsibility towards individuals with disabilities. Should individuals with disabilities be required to habituate themselves to the ‘typical’ standard if they want access and acceptance into the larger society? For example, if the ‘ambulant-typical’ environment consists of mainly stairs should architects force individuals with limited mobility to learn to navigate the environment without ramps, lifts, or curb cuts? That’s a rhetorical question. Perhaps ‘neuro-typical’ environments should be more accommodating for individuals with autism. We demand it to be for individuals with limited mobility, why not autism?\nBoth, the sensory sensitive and ‘neuro-typical’ approach, have good reasons to believe the other limits individuals with autism. Until future studies can answer the following questions comparing the two we will be left squabbling over many logical arguments that might prove superfluous. Do sensory sensitive environments hinder generalization skills? Do ‘neuro-typical’ settings hamper skill acquisition? Do individuals with autism more quickly learn skills in sensory sensitive environments? Is the rate of acquisition statistically meaningful when compared to the possible difficulties of generalizing that skill? Does replicating the ‘neuro-typical’ environment improve generalization skills? Is it statistically meaningful when compared to the possible difficulties of acquiring that skill? Do individuals exhibit differences in quality of life between the two environments, i.e. rates of depression, stress levels and overall health? Perhaps the answers to these questions will bridge the divide between the two theories, and the more appropriate approach will be more of a mixture of the two than a triumph of one over the other.\nIf you enjoyed this article check out more by Christopher N. Henry here.\nFor more images of the DLC see the gallery after the endnotes. Add to the discussion in the comment section below.\nChristopher Henry has been researching, writing, and consulting on autism design since 2005.

{"question":"What are the key design requirements for safety vests, and what workplace injury statistics highlight their importance?","answer":"Safety vests have three major compliance elements: background material (must be yellow-green, red-orange, or red), retroreflective material (reflective strips that reflect light back to its source), and specific garment design (must resemble human form with 360-degree horizontal reflective bands). The importance of proper safety equipment is highlighted by workplace injury statistics - in 2009 there were 667 fatalities and 28,958 injuries in work zone crashes, while more recent data from 2017 shows 882,730 occupational injuries across industries, with 15% involving workers being struck by objects or equipment.","context":["To most people, a safety vest is a safety vest. Orange or lime green, big or small, it’s all the same. But one look at some sobering statistics, and you’ll realize otherwise. You’ll realize the importance of having the correct and compliant safety vest for your line of work.\nAccording to the 2011 NSC Injury Fact Book, there were 667 fatalities and 28,958 injuries in work zone crashes in 2009. That’s almost two deaths per day. And it’s two too many. These statistics show that struck-by accidents remain a major workplace hazard. And they outline the importance of making sure your safety vest is fully compliant.\nBecause the fact is, it’s easy to wear one that isn’t compliant, without even knowing it. High-visibility apparel has become an iconic part of the image of the blue-collar worker. You see them in commercials on road construction workers, airline and transportation workers, law enforcement and other service personnel. And most of those times, in those commercials, they’re wearing a vest that isn’t compliant.\nThere are three major elements to high-visibility apparel that is compliant with ANSI/ISEA 107, the high-visibility industry standard: Background material, retroreflective material, and garment design. They also must pass tests by an independent third party.\nThe background material of compliant safety vests must be yellow-green (lime), red-orange (orange), or red. This is usually a fabric and is the crux of the vest. Rigorous testing and guidelines must be followed for chromaticity coordinates, luminance, colorfastness (fading), burst strength, tear resistance and dimensional change (shrinking). Basically, the vest must be bright enough, and they must stay that way despite wear and tear. Synthetic materials such as nylon and polyester are usually best since natural fabrics such as cotton suffer fading after laundering.\nThe second major element is retroreflective material. They’re more commonly referred to as “reflective material” or “reflective tape.” Basically, these are the reflective strips you see stuck to the background fabric. Their primary purpose is to reflect light back to its source, especially at night. They must pass stringent tests for photometric performance, which basically means, “how brightly does it reflect light back to its source?” Other requirements include performance after abrasion, temperature exposure, washing, and performance when wet – to simulate working conditions during rainfall. There are two different types of retroreflective material. One of silver in color and is commonly called “silver glass bead” or just “glass bead.” It only works when a light source is present for it to reflect back, typically automobile headlights at night. The other type is called “combined performance,” “high gloss” or “prismatic.” It is lime-green, orange, or red in color and meets the requirements for not only retroreflective material but also background material, providing both daytime and nighttime visibility.\nThe third and final major element of compliance is garment design. It might not look like it, but the design and configuration of the high visibility garment’s features are actually very much on purpose, with the entire goal is so that the garment resembles the human form. Each different type of garment (vest, jackets, shirts, etc) must meet a minimum area of background material, a minimum area of reflective material, and for it all to be configured a certain way. All of these garments are classified (Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3) based on how much background and reflective materials are needed, and all of the different types require one 360-degree horizontal band of reflective material encircling the torso, in order to provide visibility to the worker from all angles. There also must be reflective material in the shoulders (not required for Class 3).\nAll of these requirements are not laws. It is up to the workers to wear them, and up to employers to make wearing them mandatory. But the importance of these high-visibility safety garments is clear.

Thankfully, there are simple steps you can take to keep your employees safe.\nEven if you do not consider your workplace to be dangerous, familiarizing yourself with common workplace injuries is a valuable exercise.\nSimilar to how the majority of car accidents occur within a few miles of people’s homes, accidents can happen in the most unassuming, seemingly non-hazardous workplaces.\nThe last thing you want as a leader is to deal with lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, and lost productivity as a result of an avoidable injury in the workplace.\nUnderstanding the main causes of common injuries can help you spot potential risks and prevent accidents altogether, saving you time, stress, money, and even the risk of an injury yourself.\nIn this article, you’ll discover workplace injury statistics, common types of workplace accidents, and four tips you can use to best prevent injuries in your workplace.\n4 Steps to Preventing Workplace Injuries\n- Communicate hazards\n- Enforce proper attire\n- Keep the space orderly\n- Generate awareness\nThe Most Common Workplace Injuries\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that there were 882,730 occupational injuries and illnesses in 2017. Considering there were 125 million full-time workers in 2017, this means that nearly 0.7% of full-time employees were injured in 2017.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nOf those injury cases, data indicated that:\n- 11% of injuries involved overexertion from lifting or lowering\n- 64% of bone fractures resulted from accidents in the service-providing industries\n- 26% of bone fractures result from accidents in the trade, transportation, and utility industries\n- 62% of slips, trips, and falls occurred on the same level\n- 20% of slips, trips, and falls involved a worker falling between two or more levels\n- 15% of all non-fatal workplace injuries involved workers being struck by objects or equipment while on the job\n- 35% of cases across all industries were sprains, strains, and tears\nThis data also showed that, across all industries, more than 25% of injuries were caused by slips, trips, and falls.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nWhether you work in an environment known for increased levels of risk, such as a construction site, or in an unassuming restaurant or office building, slips and falls are going to happen.\nFour Steps to Prevent Workplace Injuries\nWhile workplace accidents are impossible to eliminate entirely, there are a number of data-driven steps you can use to successfully prevent the majority of accidents.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nConsider applying the following tips to keep your employees and job site safe and secure.\n1. Communicate Hazards\nPosting adequate signage that clearly marks any obstacles must be a high priority. For example, clearly marking spills and dangerous machinery can decrease both falling and pinching incidents.\nSpecifically, for machinery, ensuring that all tools necessary for operation are accounted for is vital. Installing proper lighting can make certain that your job site is easy to navigate and remain safe in.\n2. Enforce Proper Attire\nMandating employees to wear slip-resistant footwear, hardhats, and warm clothing are effective steps in the fight against workplace injuries.\nPersonal protective and life-saving equipment, including eye and face protection, are also powerful tools.\n3. Keep the Space Orderly\nConnected to communicating hazards, containing spills quickly is a must-do. This requires having proper clean-up equipment readily accessible on site, as well as routinely checking for spills.\nA clean space can prevent accidents.\n4. Generate Awareness\nEducating employees about how to move through the workday and space safely is paramount. The system doesn’t have to be extensive, though that wouldn’t hurt either.\nSimple briefings at the start of the workweek (in the form of a standup) allow managers to relay known hazards and best practices to their teams.\nEducation won’t only benefit employees, though. It also has advantages for managers, some of whom may not be trained in how to communicate with employees about workplace safety.\nTraining for managers can focus on identifying ways to encourage employees to report accidents and ‘near-misses,’ which are often ignored. These sessions are also a good time to highlight incident investigation skills and proper reporting procedures.\nMake Your Workplace Safer\nNow, with an enhanced understanding of the most common workplace accidents, you’re aware of the risks that your business faces in the day-to-day environment.\nAnd, with the above tips for accident prevention, you can proactively put a safety plan in place that effectively prevents accidents and keeps your employees safe on the job.\nNo program is perfect right out of the gate, so understand that there will always be room to improve your company’s safety plan.\nAs long as you offer opportunities for employees to communicate their opinions, consider them carefully, and dedicate time to implementing effective fixes, you’re on the right path."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a17b2f15-4c10-4caa-8d14-17aaf5f7f623>","<urn:uuid:c1b6807c-e4f7-4d05-8658-ff1f39aff1a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm wondering about the proper technique for getting off chairlifts and how this relates to common early-season snowboarding injuries - can you explain both aspects?","answer":"For proper chairlift technique, start by sitting with your bottom angled on the chair and keeping your board straight. When unloading, stand up with weight on your front foot and place your back foot on the stomp pad or against the binding. Keep your head up, look forward, push off the chair, and glide away from the lift before stopping. Regarding injury risks during early season, chairlift areas can be particularly dangerous due to increased traffic when limited terrain is open, leading to more collisions. These collisions can result in various injuries from concussions to broken bones and torn ligaments. It's important to exercise extra caution during early season and ease into your riding - don't attempt techniques you might have mastered at the end of last season, as you're likely not at the same ability level. Wait until you're safely away from others before stopping, and if you do fall while unloading, lift operators will stop the chair so you can safely clear the area.","context":["Part 1: Snowboard Gear, Stance, and Strapping In\nThere are several things beginner snowboarders need to know before they even set foot on snow. In the first section of our beginner’s guide to snowboarding, we will cover:\n- How to properly put on your boots.\n- The basic parts of a snowboard.\n- How to strap in and out of a snowboard.\n- Figuring out your snowboard stance.\n- How to carry your snowboard.\nSo let’s get started! Making sure your boots fit properly is one of the most important things to master as a beginner snowboarder. When trying on boots, only wear one pair of socks and make sure there is nothing else in the boot. We often see beginners who wear multiple pairs of socks to stay warm, but this is unnecessary. Modern snowboard boots are designed to keep your feet warm and comfortable with just one pair of socks. Also, make sure your heel is in the very back of the boot to ensure a snug fit. If you are unsure if your boot is on properly, ask your snowboard instructor or rental shop employee to help.\nWhen it comes time to try on your snowboard, the first thing you will need to do is determine your “stance.” Your stance is the direction you face while sliding downhill. There are two snowboard stances, regular and goofy. A regular stance means that your left foot is forward, while a goofy stance means that your right foot it forward. There is no correct snowboard stance, it is all about what feels good to you.\nIt is important to understand the basic parts of a snowboard so you know what your instructors are talking about. The front of the snowboard is called the nose and the back of the snowboard is called the tail. There is also the heelside edge (the side edge closet to your heel when strapped in) and the toeside edge (the side edge closet to your toes when strapped in). Bindings are another essential component to a snowboard, these are what attached your feet to your snowboard. They are typically made from plastic or metal and feature a ratcheting strap system to secure your fit.\nTo strap into your snowboard, find a flat service. You don’t want to be on a hill because this will only make things more difficult. Place one foot into the binding, feed the “ladder” into the ratchet and crank the ratchet to tighten. To release, simply pull the buckle away from the ratchet.\nIt might sound silly, but it’s also important to pay attention to how you carry your snowboard when you are not riding it. Watch the above video to find out why.\nPart 2: Skating, Gliding, Standing Up, and Moving Uphill\nNow that you’ve got all of your gear and you know how to get in and out of your snowboard, it’s time to start learning some of the basic movements on snow. This section will cover:\n- How to skate and glide.\n- How to get up from the ground (while strapped in).\n- How to move uphill\nWhen you’re not going downhill, it is most common to get around with your front foot strapped in and your back foot pushing you forward. This is called skating and it is how snowboarders get onto chairlifts and how they move around on flat surfaces. But unlike skateboarding, the back foot typically pushes with your rear foot behind your heelside edge. The above video goes into more detail about how to skate and glide on snow.\nWhen you are just getting started, you will probably be spending a lot of time on the ground. That is why it is important to understand how to stand up from a seated position with both feet strapped in. From a seated position, bend your knees and scoot your board towards your behind. Now, lean forward with your upper body and stand up using your quads and core. Try this on the flats a few times so you don’t have to worry about sliding downhill. You can also stand up by flipping onto your knees and your toeside edge. Watch the above video to see this in action.\nThe whole point of snowboarding is to glide downhill, but sometimes it is necessary to actually move uphill while strapped in. To do this, face uphill and dig your toeside edge into the snow. Then, continually hop forward like you’re jumping rope.\nPart 3: How to Stop, Turn, and Ride a Chairlift\nOnce you’ve mastered the basics of navigating flat surfaces, it’s time to move on to the fun part: going downhill. In the final section of the beginner’s guide to snowboarding, professional snowboard instructor Chris Rogers explains:\n- How to stop.\n- How to turn.\n- How to get on a chairlift.\n- How to get off a chairlift.\nBefore you learn how to go straight downhill, you need to learn how to stop and control your speed. Start on your heelside with your board across the hill (perpendicular), try to find the balance point where you slowly move downhill without moving side to side. You should be in a mid-squat with your toeside edge slightly off the snow. You can also stop and slow down while you’re facing uphill by balancing on your toeside edge with your heels off the snow. Chris Rogers demonstrates exactly how to do this in the above video.\nOnce you’re comfortable controlling your speed on both your toe and heel edges, it’s time to learn how to turn. Rogers recommends starting with “garlands.” A garland is a half-turn that utilizes the same skills you mastered when learning how to stop. After you have made plenty of garlands on the hill, you can move into full C turns. For a full C turn, you will learn how to shift your weight from your toes to your heels (and vice versa). Once you can link together some full C turns, you’ll create a full S turn. Congrats, you’re officially snowboarding!\nOne often overlooked, but extremely important, part of learning how to snowboard is how to ride a chairlift. To get to the chairlift, skate up to the area that tells you to wait. After a chair passes and it’s your turn, skate up to the loading area. Move your back foot over to your toeside edge to make it easier to sit down. When the chair comes, simply sit down and scoot to the back of the chair. Once safely seated, put down the safety bar and enjoy the ride up.\nTo get off of a chairlift safely, point your snowboard straight. You want the nose of your snowboard pointing directly at the unloading ramp. As the chair enters the unloading area, place your board down and stand up with your back foot on your snowboard between your bindings. Glide away from the chair to clear the unloading area.\nPart 4: Balance Fundamentals\nBasic balance fundamentals will help you get better at snowboarding faster. Here are some basic balance fundamentals:\n- The two-footed hop\n- How to ollie\n- How to nose press and tail press\n- How to 180\nTo practice the two-footed hop, flex your ankles and knees and jump straight up. Flex again as you come down and think about a soft landing.\nWith an ollie, move your weight toward your back foot and then pop off the tail like a spring. You can this with your front foot and spring off the nose, this is called an ollie. Again, think about landing softly with both feet.\nPart 5: Movements on a Snowboard\nThis section will cover the four basic ways to move on a snowboard:\nTilt is how you control your edge angle – the more you tilt your board the more you engage your edge through the turn.\nBy flexing one ankle and extending the other you create a twist on the snowboard. A twist helps you start turns smoothly.\nPivot is the rotation of the snowboard and it helps the board skid through the turn.\nBy shifting your weight between your feet, you can control pressure of the snowboard. Keeping your weight centered over the front foot is one of the most important parts of learning to turn.\nSo how do these moves make you a better snowboarder? Tilt lets you start carving turns to control speed and also lets you explore freestyle carving tricks like the euro-carve. Twist lets you start turns more smoothly, big or small, and is essential as you get better and start exploring the mountain. Pivot helps you shape your turns and is the foundation to spins like 180s and 360s on snow. Pressure is how you move on a snowboard to shift your weight and is the building block for nose-presses, tail-presses, butters, and jumps. Basically, these four movements make up everything you do on a snowboard – from your very first turns, to a double cork 1080.\nWhat to Wear\nA good day on snow starts with a good set of skivvies, so here is what to wear on the mountain. Wicking base-layers keep you warm and comfortable by moving sweat away from your skin. Avoid cotton layers at all costs, they do the opposite. Also, be sure to wear one pair of ski or snowboard specific socks, and only one pair. They are designed to keep you warm.\nMake sure your snowpants are waterproof, breathable, and appropriate for the climate that you are visiting. And underneath you only want to have on base-layers.\nMid-layers depend on the weather and your personal preference. Layering is great – as the day’s weather changes, so can your outfit. A little cold put one on, a little warm take one off.\nFor jackets, you’ll want to make sure they’re waterproof and possibility insulated depending on the climate that you are in. If it’s cold, you’ll want a neck gaiter to keep your neck and face warm.\nYou should wear a properly fitted helmet designed for skiing or snowboarding. A bike helmet won’t do. You’ll also want ski or snowboard googles to protect your eyes from the sun (snow is very reflective), keep the elements out, and help you see where you are going.\nThe choice between gloves and mittens is a personal preference. In general, gloves allow for more dexterity while mittens are warmer.\nAnd now you’re ready to go outside!\nHow to Get Off a Chairlift\nHere are some helpful tips to help you get off the chairlift successfully. Start off by getting comfortable standing up and practicing unloading, you can use a bench or chair.\nYou can start by practicing on a bench sitting with your butt angled on the chair and keeping your board straight. Stand up with your weight on your front foot and place your back foot on the board on the stomp pad or against the back binding. Keep your head up, look forward, stand up, and push off the chair to glide away.\nNow it’s time to ride the chairlift. When you’re riding up, make a plan with the other people on the chair and plan to unload in different directions.\nRemember to sit with your butt angled on the chair and to keep your board straight. Stand up with your weight on the front foot and place your back foot on the stomp pad or against the binding. Keep your head up and look forward, stand up, push off the chair, and glide away.\nWait until you are away from the chair and other people before you skid to a stop. If you fall while unloading, the lift operators will slow and stop the chair so you can safely get out of the way. Follow these tips and you’ll be getting of the chairlift like a pro.\nSo that wraps up our five-part series on learning how to snowboard. We hope we answered some of your basic questions. If you are a beginner snowboarder, there is no better way to learn than to take a lesson from a professional instructor. Visit the Take a Lesson page for more tips or watch more videos.\nHave fun, and see you on the slopes!","It’s a skier or snowboarder’s worst nightmare: a season-ending injury in November.\nNo one wants to end his or her season on a ski patrol sled, worse yet before it really even really gets underway. Following Friday’s story, “Instructors offer tips on easing into ski season,” we decided to add a doctor to the discussion. We spoke with Dr. Rick Cunningham, of Vail Summit Orthopedics and the U.S. Ski Team, about what he’s seen in his office already this season and how to best prevent a potential season-ender in November.\n“We can almost predict the type of injuries we will see with snow conditions,” Cunningham said. Harder packed snow tends to cause more fractures, and deeper snow leads to more knee injuries, he said.\nThis year, however, has been a little different. “I’ve seen a surprising number of ACL tears this early in the season,” he said. “Typically heavier snow brings in ACLs.”\nMany of the injuries Cunningham has treated this year have been terrain park related.\n“Those hard landings when there’s not much coverage, the force is such that you can have more long-bone fractures. The ground is less forgiving,” he said of early season conditions. His recommendation was don’t go too big too soon.\nCunningham has also noticed an alarming trend.\n“By and large I see a lot of young people in their teens and 20s” and, unfortunately, an increasing number of 12- to 17-year-olds suffering serious injuries.\n“Ten, 12 years ago we didn’t see as much of it,” he said.\nHe also recommended exercising caution early in the season with regard to traffic on the hill.\n“On these days when not much terrain is open, collisions are common.” Injuries from collision can range from concussions to broken bones and torn ligaments, Cunningham said.\nAs to avoiding injury, he echoed the sentiments of the instructors we spoke with earlier in the week.\n“If there is was a word of caution: ease into the season.”\nOne pattern he said he’d seen was people trying to do big tricks in the park early in the season.\n“It’s not like you stopped skiing a week ago,” he said. “You’re not up to the same ability.” He cautioned against attempting tricks a skier or rider might have successfully completed at the end of last season.\nIn addition to using caution, Cunningham said, preseason conditioning is one of the better ways to avoid injuries.\n“If someone doesn’t have good core strength, they’re going to be in the backseat position” and, as a result, more susceptible to injury.\n“Good hip strengthening helps prevent knee injuries,” he said.\nWhile knee injuries are more common in skiers, Cunningham said he also sees them in snowboarders. Snowboarders, he added, are more likely to injure upper extremities — wrists, shoulders, etc.\nCunningham closed with two additional thoughts.\nHe suggested skiing or riding loose. Instructors call it an athletic stance, flexing and extending with turns and terrain. Skiing or snowboarding with a rigid stance, commonly seen in intermediate or beginner skiers and riders, will have more of an impact on joints and place a skier or rider at a higher risk for injury.\n“Be like an accordion with your lower extremities,” he said. Absorbing shock in a jump is especially important.\nFinally, like the instructors we spoke with, Cunningham said that when falling it’s usually best to go with the fall and not try to recover.\nHe cited a recent study showing a correlation between attempting to recover from a fall and injuries occurring as a result.\n“That’s how the largest number of World Cup skiers tore their ACL,” he said.\nWith those suggestions in mind, consider using caution in the early season. It might just lead to more time on the snow — and help avoid a personal introduction to the fine folks at Vail Orthopedics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:87e9542f-9d39-4fa5-a892-11b6d68cb6b7>","<urn:uuid:cfd07945-53e9-479b-8f55-6bf6027d03d7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do RomaxDesigner and Matlab compare in their ability to interact with external hardware and software systems?","answer":"RomaxDesigner and Matlab both offer external system integration but with different focuses. RomaxDesigner provides interfaces to specialized analysis software like Simpack, LDP, and AnSol, primarily for detailed gear analysis and stress calculations. Matlab, on the other hand, has broader connectivity options, including interaction with multiple programming languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran, Python), direct communication with hardware devices like Arduino and test instruments (oscilloscopes, power supplies, signal analyzers), and support for various communication protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, I2C, SPI, Modbus, Bluetooth). Matlab also includes specialized toolboxes for instrument control and hardware interaction.","context":["RomaxDesigner provides a suite of tools for mechanical analysis of rotating structural components such as gears, shafts, bearings, clutches and synchronizers, and spline connections and housings. Engineers designing gearboxes, transmissions, vehicle drivelines at a system level, as well as providers of components, will find value in the consolidated analysis approach this software provides. The unified approach is especially valuable when there are multiple nonlinear interactions contributing to load, component stress, and misalignment. When components are operating near to their limits, the increased accuracy provided by the detailed analysis modules lets users maintain adequate safety factors while avoiding defensive overdesigns.\nRomaxDesigner is modular software, with a base package allowing system-level design and analysis, and with modules that allow the detailed analysis of individual components. The base software can analyze systems on parallel axes, with extensions available to analyze perpendicular shafts and planetary systems. Even in the base package, users can build and analyze complex systems, including nonlinear and 3D effects.\nUsers define each system component with a level of complexity appropriate to the needed analysis. Base modules let users define each component using an industry-standard closed-form equation. With more-advanced modules, individual components can be converted to models with finite-element attributes. For example, a housing can be defined according to its stiffness, (using a reduced-stiffness matrix from a finite-element model) or as a finite-element model solved in an advanced module. Users can define a bearing simply as a rotatable support with specified flexibility; a catalog-level design with ISO capacities and macrogeometry; or with full microgeometry, life adjustment factors, and high-speed inertial effects. As the model develops, users can add further detail to each component.\nThe software then simulates the effect of a duty cycle or series of loads on the entire system, with multiple conditions of speed, load, and temperature defined, allowing simultaneous cumulative damage analysis of all components. Users can define and apply multiple duty cycles, reflecting different applications.\nRomaxDesigner models shafts for deflection and stress using closed-form equations for beam segments. Advanced modules provide the capability to use FE models for more-complex shaft geometry. Users can choose from predefined materials and stress concentration factors, or develop their own. The base package can model parallel and concentric shafts. Perpendicular shafts and moving axis (planetary) shafts are modeled with extended modules. An additional module analyzes shaft fatigue. The software can define and analyze shafts that are connected at non-90° angles, though the gear definitions for these systems are limited.\nThe base package provides standard bearing-life and load-capacity analysis using ISO 281:1990 or ISO 291:2007. The program also includes a modified rating with a closed-form calculation of effects of misalignment. A built-in database includes data from four bearing manufacturers’ catalogs. Users can define and save additional bearings. A bearing search tool allows quick access to all four catalogs and user-defined bearings.\nBearing models provide nonlinear stiffness interactions with adjacent components, which can be critical when calculating gear-support stiffness, gear-mesh misalignments and preload requirements. When calculating bearing life, the models include the effects of misalignments developed through the flexibility of any coupled components. A bearing preload tool automates studies of bearing life as a function of preload. RomaxDesigner does not currently include the effects of localized housing distortion on bearing roundness, nor a direct way to calculate the effects of thermal expansion on bearing fit and preload. These features have been proposed for a future release.\nAdvanced bearing-analysis modules provide detailed analyses (ISO 281 Supplement 4), including contact stress, fluid-film thickness, and stress-based life calculation. Advanced bearings can be defined with an assortment of predefined roller and raceway crowns, or with a measured crown.\nRomaxDesigner models may include spur and helical gears, and with the perpendicular-axis module, bevel and hypoid gears. The base software models gears with enough detail to analyze their effects on the rest of the system. Additional modules allow design and rating to AGMA, DIN and ISO standards. For parallel-axis gears, additional modules permit macrogeometry definition and optimization for manufacturability as well as detailed analysis of microgeometry for contact stress and transmission error. RomaxDesigner graphics are suitable for a variety of reporting illustrations, such as system topology and component deflection.\nFor parallel and perpendicular-axis gears, modules provide interfaces to more detailed analysis software, such as Simpack, LDP, and AnSol. They act as a “front end” for even more-computationally intensive formulations of bending and contact stress. The combination of these software packages is particularly powerful, as it permits cumulative damage-life analysis including the nonlinear effects of gear-tooth deflection and bearing stiffness, acting on a fully developed tooth profile. Additional modules focus on NVH and dynamic characteristics, such as gear rattle and whine, system modal analysis, and clutch analysis. Modules are also available to automate optimization and for the sensitivity analysis of system and component designs.\nThe developer does not include self-directed tutorials with the software, but the company does provide user training directly. The trainers customize course content and duration to meet the needs of each organization. A one-week training session would be sufficient to cover the basic modules and a few advanced topics. Many highly specialized software packages require constant use to become and stay proficient. I find that RomaxDesigner does not require this level of attention. Engineers with other responsibilities will find this software functional even if not used on a regular basis.\nThe software comes from Romax Technology, based in Nottingham, U.K., with offices in Asia, Europe, and North America (www.romaxtech.com).","Matlab was released in 1984 by Mathworks, an American privately-held corporation whose other major product is the closely-related Simulink. Additionally, Mathworks offers close to 100 other programs, such as Polyspace, SimEvents and Stateflow.\nMatlab’s main focus is numerical computing, including matrix and algorithm operations, plotting of data and functions and creation of user interfaces. It is capable of interacting with outside programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python.\nOne factor that accounts for Matlab’s phenomenal success and enduring wide use among researchers, engineers, and advanced students is its comprehensive and well-designed documentation. Mathworks offers on its website free-of-charge a wide variety of tutorials and training sessions.\nThe best introduction is Matlab’s Onramp, a free, two-hour online overview course that introduces new users to the Matlab language and shows some real-world examples. The course starts with fundamental Matlab commands, then shows how to import and display data and introduces typical projects for putting this knowledge to work. A user-oriented project that concludes the course involves analyzing light from a star to see whether it is moving towards or away from the earth.\nMost of the course interacts with a web-based version of Matlab, in contrast to the desktop versions, which, despite its different superficial appearance, is essentially written in the same Matlab language. The course is divided into simple units that build the user’s knowledge base. After viewing introductory material, the user executes commands by entering them into the command window following the Matlab prompt (>>) and pressing Enter/Return. A star (*) denotes multiplication of scalar numbers.\nMatlab focuses on deep learning, computer vision, signal processing, quantitative finance and risk management, robotics and control systems. Deep learning pertains to training networks. A key component in that endeavor is image recognition. Other areas are speech recognition and text analytics. Matlab’s deep learning is interactive with industry-wide products such as Caffee and Tensor Flow-Keras.\nThe key to training a model is to have access to large databases. In looking at images, for example, the first task is to isolate the object of interest from the background.\nMatlab makes it feasible to run through an entire video and separate out a group of pixels or area of the picture. Then, the network can be trained to retain and correlate this information on a case-specific basis. Moreover, Matlab permits the user to monitor the progress of network training to see if it is moving rapidly in the right direction.\nSpeech recognition and text analytics are important parts of network training. To this end, deep learning interacts with Python, Java, .net, C and C++. Computer vision in Matlab presupposes algorithm development to deal with diverse situations that constantly arise. Matlab and its associated program, Simulink, begin by acquiring the requisite graphics and video from imaging hardware. Video and images may then be used for visualization and manipulation by means of graphical tools that are provided within these programs. Additionally, there are libraries of standard algorithms that enable users to implement designs in embedded hardware.\nSignals from a variety of sources may be acquired, measured and analyzed, making use of Matlab and Simulink signal processing resources. These tools allow users to first preprocess and filter signals, then to analyze them for use with data analytics and machine learning. Ultimate goals are to analyze trends and to perceive patterns in signals at the outputs of connected instrumentation.\nMatlab and Simulink also are likely to play a central role in robotics with functions that can connect to outside robot operating systems independent of hardware details. This facility works with well-known equipment such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi as well as with older robotics having legacy code.\nMatlab helps engineers design and deploy control systems at all stages of development, as in plant modeling and automatic code generation. These tools are quite flexible and able to solve wide-ranging control problems. An example is Arduino support in Matlab. Using the Matlab package for Arduino hardware, Matlab interactively communicates with the board, which can then perform a variety of functions including acquiring analog and digital signals, controlling other hardware using digital and pulse-width modulated signals, driving dc, stepper and servo motors; accessing peripheral devices and sensors via I2C and SPIB or Wi-Fi to communicate with an Arduino board; and building interfaces with hardware and software libraries.\nMatlab is a high-level interpreted language. Without delay, the user accesses I/O instructions with no compilation required. There are numerous math, engineering and plotting capabilities so that data from the Arduino is available for timely analysis and display.\nMatlab’s Instrument Control Toolbox facilitates control and communication with test and measurement instruments such as oscilloscopes, power supplies, signal analyzers, function generators and analytical instruments. VISA instrument drivers, for example IVI and VXI plug&play, are first required, or alternately text-based SCPI commands over communications protocols such as GPIB, TCP/IP and UDP. Another approach is to control and acquire data from test instrumentation without benefit of code.\nMatlab’s Instrument Control Toolbox generates data that may be sent out to an instrument, or it can import data into Matlab, which then subjects it to analysis and display. Tests can be automated, hardware designs verified and test systems built, incorporating LXI, PXI and AXle standards.\nOther computers can be remotely connected to Matlab by means of TCP/IP, UDP, I2C, SPI, Modbus and Bluetooth serial protocols. In all cases, the Mathworks Instrument Control Toolbox requires prior installation of Matlab. The Matlab Instrument Control Toolbox can acquire and control data from an oscilloscope to simplify data analysis and create automated tests. It is also easy to make graphical interfaces.\nReferring to the oscilloscope’s operating and programming manuals, data can be acquired and controlled using GPIB, serial, TCP/IP, UDP and VISA interfaces. Matlab’s Instrument Control Toolbax provides connectivity via Matlab Instrument Drivers, IVI and VXIplug&play. Native Matlab instrument drivers to not require the installation of additional drivers. They work on Windows, Linux or Mac operating systems.\nIVI instrument drivers are often included when you purchase an oscilloscope, or they are available on the manufacturer’s website. VXIplug&play similarly often ships with the instrument or is available online.\nTo see how to connect an oscilloscope that is running the Matlab program, first display a waveform in the oscilloscope, for example a 5-V peak-to-peak square wave centered on the X and Y axes. To bring the waveform information into Matlab, install VISA drivers obtained from the Tektronix or National Instruments website. The oscilloscope-computer hardware connection can be over USB, RS-232, GPIB or Ethernet.\nIn the computer, from the Matlab program, access Test and Measurement Tool, which is included in the Instrument Control Toolbox. Expand the Hardware section to reveal Interface Options. Select the interface that has been used to connect the oscilloscope to the computer, in this example USB.\nThe Instrument Control Toolbox permits the user to search for available hardware, configure instrument settings, read data from the instrument and save a log of the session as an M-file. To navigate the tool, click on the Help tab, which guides you through the process of connecting to the instrument. The Help section updates with specific steps that pertain to chosen options.\nUnder the driver that is selected, in Instrument Functions, select Read Waveform. For Waveform Object, select Waveform 1. For Input Argument(s), type in Channel 1. For Output argument(s), type in X,Y. Then show Help, if needed, and Execute.\nThe Response Window shows that the function has been completed successfully. Below, click on Export. The Data Exporter Window permits the user to select a destination, such as MATLAB Workspace. In the Command Window, enter plot (X, Y). The 5-V peak-to-peak square wave is now displayed in Matlab and shown in the computer."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:607fcace-deea-4865-86d5-eb2a49f2d742>","<urn:uuid:92f19734-a2ad-47c3-bf98-3ce0a5d44c1e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone studying demographics, I'm curious about how Hispanic Heritage Month started in USA and what's the current Hispanic population status? Can you explain the historical background and latest statistics?","answer":"Hispanic Heritage Month originated in 1968 when California Congressman George E. Brown introduced Hispanic Heritage Week during the Civil Rights Movement's push for multiculturalism. President Lyndon Johnson authorized annual proclamations for the week, and in 1988, under President Reagan, it was expanded to a full month (September 15 - October 15). The timing was chosen to coincide with multiple Latin American independence days, including those of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico, Chile, and Belize. Regarding current demographics, according to the US Census Bureau, the Hispanic population has grown significantly to reach 62 million people as of July 2021, representing 18.9% of the total U.S. population. This makes people of Hispanic origin the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the United States.","context":["RISE MODULE: HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\nHISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\nHispanic Heritage Month is celebrated annually in the United States from September 15 through October 15. In 1968, California Congressmen George E. Brown introduced Hispanic Heritage Week to honor Latinx and Hispanic communities that were heavily represented in his East Los Angeles district. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s ushered in a new era of multiculturalism and efforts to amplify the culture and history of a diverse range of racial and ethnic groups in the United States.\nOn September 17, 1968, Congress issued a joint resolution to authorize and request President Lyndon Johnson issue annual proclamations declaring September 15 and 16 to mark the beginning of National Hispanic Heritage Week. President Johnson, and every president after, issued yearly proclamations to honor the week until 1987 when Representative Esteban E. Torres of California proposed expanding the observance period so the nation could honor, observe and develop events and activities to celebrate Hispanic achievements and culture. Under President Ronald Reagan in 1988, Hispanic Heritage Week was expanded to a full 31 days from September 15 through October 15. Those dates are significant because September 15 coincides with the national independence day of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Mexico celebrates its independence on the 16th, Chile on the 18th and Belize on the 21st.\nThe month is marked by a celebration of history, culture and contributions of generations of Hispanic and Latinx people that have shaped and influenced society\nDEFINING THE TERMS\nThe use of the term \"Hispanic\" in the recognition of the month is not without controversy. The term Hispanic refers to one who speaks Spanish or who is native to a Spanish-speaking country. While Hispanic and Latino are sometimes used interchangeably, they have different meanings. Hispanic refers to individuals who are Spanish-speaking or have a background in a Spanish-speaking country. Latino refers to those who are from or have a background in a Latin American country. The terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" refer to ethnicity, culture, and identity. They are groups based on shared culture rather than skin color, race or other physical features. However, the groups are also broader than ethnicity, which can make the terms confusing. For this reason, people who are Hispanic may vary in their race and also where they live or originate. For example, a person from the Dominican Republic and a person from Mexico might both call themselves Hispanic because they share in common a spoken language and a legacy of Spanish colonies. The recent popularity (and use) of the word Latinx in the U.S. presents another alternative to the contested \" Hispanic\" label that proponents say also offers gender inclusivity. The month is marked by a celebration of history, culture and contributions of generations of Hispanic and Latinx people that have shaped and influenced society in myriad ways. It marks a way to honor voices, culture and language, and amplify teaching of diverse texts and stories.\nSOME CONVERSATION STARTERS\n- Engage friends in their knowledge about Hispanic Heritage Month. Help to share information and spark meaningful discussion. For example: \"What do you know about Hispanic Heritage Month?

Celebrated from September 15 until October 15, this national observance started in 1968 when President Lyndon B. Johnson designated a week to recognize the contributions of Hispanic Americans. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan expanded the weeklong observance to a month. It was subsequently enacted into law on August 17, 1988. The start date of September 15 was significant because it’s also the anniversary of independence for the Latin American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico, Chile and Belize’s independence days are September 16, 18 and 21. Columbus Day or Día de la Raza, is on October 12. Thus, the national observance in the U.S. extends until October 15.\nHispanic Heritage Month Celebrations at Home, School or Program\nDiscover the arts, crafts, book recommendations, virtual tours, music and more of Hispanic and Latino cultures.

Steam-in-Place (SIP) Operations are used in the food and biotechnology industries, using the thermal energy of condensing steam for a controlled time period to effect a bioburden reduction.\nSIP operations may be used for varying purposes, including (a) process disinfection to kill pathogenic (disease producing) organisms, (b) the thermal inactivation of a target organism, or (c) steam sanitization to achieve a 99.9% bio kill of all present organisms. The most stringent SIP application achieves sterile conditions throughout the entire equipment set with the goal of sterilizing the process system as an entity. The process system may include processing vessels and piping, filtered gas overlay supplies, process liquid filters, valves, pumps and processing instrumentation.\n1. Perform Clean-In-Place (CIP) Operations Before SIP Operations\nPerform effective CIP operations prior to initiating SIP operations to remove processing soils. The thermal resistance of microorganisms and spores can be enhanced by the protective effects of process soil.\n2. Confirm Saturated Steam Supply\nOperations should confirm steam supply header pressure and temperature to ensure a saturated steam supply. Superheated steam or an insufficient steam supply will result in a failed SIP program. Steam quality in the food industry must meet “Culinary Steam” requirements and in the biotech industry, specifications for “Clean Steam” must be met.\n3. Introduce Saturated Steam Supply as High as Possible\nThe SIP operations should be configured to introduce the saturated steam supply as high as possible in the equipment set, leveraging the steam supply pressure and temperature differences to push out ambient system gases through monitored process low points. The ambient gases will sink to process low points for effective evacuation.\n4. Install Low Point Trap Blocking Valves and Temperature Sensors\nInstall steam trap blocking valves and a steam trap at each process low point and include a temperature monitoring device between the valve and steam trap to monitor temperature at each process low point. Be sure to locate the element above the traps condensate leg for accurate temperature measurement. If possible, use trap bypass valves for efficient air purging at the process low point to minimize the mixing of steam and air.\n5. Use Monitored High Point Air Bleeds\nThe importance of complete air elimination from the processing system cannot be overstated. To assist in the complete replacement of air with saturated steam, use monitored high point air bleeds to push high air pockets out of the system. High point air bleeds are recommended on large filter housing, process vessel vent and overlay gas supply lines.\n6. Avoid Parallel Steam Paths\nWhenever possible, avoid parallel steam paths within the processing system sharing a common steam trap. As pressure differences occur during air removal stages, a parallel line pockets air, which prevents proper steam exposure, and result in sterility failures.\n7. Plan Steam Flow and Process Flow in Same Direction\nPlan the SIP operation to have steam flow in the same direction as the process flow to take advantage of the existing process piping pitch and support for process drainability. Plan the piping system to avoid hoses, dead-ends, and non-drainable low points that can create condensate pools or air pockets. These pools and air pockets can provide an insulating effect on the targeted microorganisms. Prompt and effective condensate elimination is critical to SIP operations success.\n8. Include a Time Delay\nAfter process air has been fully removed and the system charged with saturated steam, a time delay is recommended for all system components to achieve the desired set point temperature. To achieve sterile conditions, universally expose the system to the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) 21 CFR Guideline (Section 600.11) Time – Temperature Relationship of 121.5°C for 20 Minutes. Consider adding an additional 1.5°C to the SIP set point to cover temperature element accuracy concerns. The 20 minute thermal exposure must be continuous, without the temperature dropping below the set point.\n9. Active Steam Flow During SIP Hold\nProviding a means of active steam flow to the process as the SIP timer counts down can help ensure the required thermal treatment has been achieved. This steam “activity” can be achieved through positioning the process vessel vent pressure control valve slightly open, or through the use of orificed steam traps or bypass valves.\n10. Protect Sterile Process Boundary\nAfter the desired exposure to saturated steam has been achieved for a complete thermal bio-kill, the sterile process boundary must be protected as the condensate is drained from the system. The equipment is cooled to prepare for sterile process operations.\nOnce the sterile boundary has been created, the questions is often raised “How does one protect and maintain a sterile process boundary?” The use of overlapping sterile boundaries, active or passive air overlays, and steam blocks can be employed with great success.\nIf you would like to know more about maintaining sterile conditions, contact Mike Byron, one of our process systems subject matter experts, at firstname.lastname@example.org to discuss your specific facility issues."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9910b4f9-d1d2-493e-bf0b-6a4b6813bd7c>","<urn:uuid:dd53ebfb-8a03-4c02-9407-bcb48b48b537>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What makes Vesta significant in terms of its structure and historical classification?","answer":"Vesta is notable both for its unique structure and historical classification status. It has a metallic iron-nickel core with a rocky mantle and shows evidence of past lava flows, challenging old views that asteroids were dead, unexciting worlds. While currently not classified as a dwarf planet, it was actually considered a planet for almost four decades along with Ceres, Pallas, and Juno. The asteroid rotates quickly, completing one rotation in 5.342 hours, and experiences temperature ranges from -20 degrees to -190 degrees Celsius. Additionally, recent research has revealed its significance in solar system history, as studies of Vesta's meteorites have provided valuable insights into the Lunar Cataclysm event that affected the entire solar system four billion years ago.","context":["Date: June 19, 2010\nTitle: Second Place Vesta\nPodcaster: The Ordinary Guy from Brains Matter podcast\nOrganization: Brains Matter – http://www.brainsmatter.com\nDescription: Who remembers second place? It’s a problem that plagues anyone who isn’t the biggest or fastest or shiniest. In today’s episode of 365 Days of Astronomy, we look at the second largest object in the Asteroid Belt – Vesta.\nBio: The Brains Matter podcast has been producing and communicating science stories and interviews since September 2006. The show is based out of Melbourne, Australia, and takes an everyday person’s perspective of science in easy-to-understand language.\nToday’s sponsor: This episode of “365 Days of Astronomy” is sponsored by the Physics Department at Eastern Illinois University: “Caring faculty guiding students through teaching and research” at www.eiu.edu/~physics/.\nAdditional sponsorship for this episode of 365 Days of Astronomy is provided by Chuck McCorvey.\nHello everyone. I’m the Ordinary Guy – the host of the Brains Matter podcast, coming to you from Melbourne, Australia.\nWhen you think of astronomy, you’re probably like me. I think of planets, moons, galaxies, black holes, comets… all those big or exciting things. What about asteroids? They tend to be the forgotten member of the astronomical family. They are usually quite benign, only occasionally causing a stir.\nAs you most likely know, there’s a rocky belt between Mars and Jupiter called the Asteroid Belt. Within the asteroid belt, there are a vast number of rocky objects called asteroids. The largest object in the Asteroid Belt is called Ceres – and as with everything else, people tend to remember first place. Bu who remembers who got a silver medal in a particular event at the last olympics? It’s the bane of second place, I guess.\nWhat is the second largest object in the Asteroid Belt?\nIt’s an object called Vesta. It’s just over a quarter the size of Ceres, and measures, in round figures, about 580 km by 460 km, and has a mass of just under 2.7 x 10^20 kg. To put that in context, put 20 zeroes after a 3. A large person is in the order of about 1 with two zeros after it, in kilograms. As you can tell by the fact that the measurements are different in different dimensions, Vesta is not round.\nYou may recall that the IAU’s definition of a planet back in 2006 required an object to have ‘sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium’ – in other words, nearly round. So does Vesta get classed as a Dwarf Planet? After all, Ceres is classed as one. Right now it’s not considered one, but this may change – in 2011, the Dawn spacecraft will orbit the asteroid, and astronomers will get a lot more data to make their determination at that point in time. The IAU draft proposal in 2006 listed Vesta as a candidate for a planet, incidentally. For the moment, the mass is less than what is required to be considered a Dwarf Planet by the IAU resolution XXXVI 5.\nLet’s take a bit of a look back at the discovery of Vesta – it was discovered on the 29th of March, 1807 by a German astronomer by the name of Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers. It was named it after the Roman goddess of home and hearth, after Olbers allowed mathematician Carl Friedrich Guass to name the object.\nWhen Ceres and Pallas were discovered in 1801 and 1802 respectively, Olbers proposed that both objects were the remains of a destroyed planet. He contacted Englishman William Herschel, suggesting a search in the area where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected. He started his search that year, and he found Vesta a few years later.\nVesta was the fourth object to be found in the asteroid belt. For almost the next four decades, it, along with Ceres, Pallas, and Juno, were considered to be planets. So don’t fear Pluto, your demotion was definitely not a first!\nSo where abouts is Vesta? We’ve already established that the asteroid belt lies between Mars and Jupiter. The Earth lies at 1 AU, and Vesta lies at about 2.5AU. It rotates fairly quickly, even for an asteroid – we know the earth takes a day to rotate around its axis – Vesta takes 5.342 hours. There’s a range of temperature – from about -20 degrees when the sun is overhead, to about -190 degrees at the winter pole, although this varies depending on the seasons. And when I mentioned degrees, I’m referring to celsius! I could have said kelvin, but either way, real science people don’t use fahrenheit, right?\nIt’s believed that Vesta has a primarily a metallic iron-nickel core with a rocky mantle. Observations through the Hubble Space Telescope have shown that there’s a 460 km wide crater near the south pole – that’s 4/5th the diameter of the whole asteroid itself! The crater is so deep, that it exposes the subsurface of Vesta. There are several other craters on the surface, and some of the smaller solar system objects are thought to have been created by Vesta collisions. The Hubble has also showed that Vesta used to have lava flows, challenging the old views that asteroids were fairly dead, unexciting worlds.\nHopefully we’ll find out a bit more about Vesta thanks to the Dawn probe from NASA – this was launched on the 27th of September, 2007 and is the first mission to this particular asteroid. After sending back data on Vesta for about nine months, it’ll then move on to Ceres and study that, until it runs out of fuel. One of the big hopes of this mission is to figure out the precise mass of Vesta and this will then help astronomers figure out the masses of asteroids that are in turn affected by Vesta.\nThis is just a summary of some of the wonders of Vesta – if you’re interested in finding out more, I’d suggest you contact your nearest astronomy club, or do some research on it yourself – you’ll be amazed at what you find!\nThanks for listening everyone – and if you would like to hear more stories on science, curiosities and general knowledge, head over to www.brainsmatter.com.\nBye for now!\nEnd of podcast:\n365 Days of Astronomy\nThe 365 Days of Astronomy Podcast is produced by the Astrosphere New Media Association.

Until tomorrow…goodbye.","Scientists have now discovered that studying meteorites from the giant asteroid Vesta helps scientists understand the event known as the “Lunar Cataclysm,” when a repositioning of the gas giant planets destabilized a portion of the asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. Previously, researchers had only lunar samples to work with. Scientists are now using a class of meteorites known as howardite, eucrite and diogenite meteorites, that are connected to Vesta to study the lunar cataclysm, providing about three times more samples to analyze.\nThe left-hand mosaic of the far side of the moon is based on data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. On the right is an image of the giant asteroid Vesta from data obtained by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft. The insets show thin sections of the lunar sample 10069-13 and eucrite NWA1978. Image credit: NASA/GSFC/ASU/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA\nThe asteroid Vesta, and perhaps other large asteroids, have more in common with Earth’s moon than previously thought, according to a team of researchers from the NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI). Both Vesta and the moon appear to have been bombarded by the same population of high-speed projectiles four billion years ago.\nDespite the fact that the moon is located far from the asteroid Vesta, in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, they seem to share some of the same bombardment history. The radiometric ages of moon rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts have long been used to study the bombardment history of the moon.\nSimilarly, the ages derived from meteorites samples have been used to study the collisional history of main belt asteroids. In particular, howardite and eucrite meteorites (common species in our meteorite collections) have been used to study asteroid Vesta, their parent body. Now, for the first time, an international team of researchers has linked these two datasets, and found that the population of projectiles responsible for making craters and basins on the moon were also hitting Vesta at very high velocities, enough to leave behind a number of telltale impact-related ages.\nThis research has been possible thanks to a multi-disciplinary work, including geochemistry, dynamics, simulations of impact events, and spacecraft observations. The findings were published in the March issue of Nature Geoscience in an article titled: “High Velocity Collisions from the Lunar Cataclysm Recorded in Asteroidal Meteorites.”\n“It’s always intriguing when interdisciplinary research changes the way we understand the history of our solar system,” said Yvonne Pendleton, NLSI director.\nWith the aid of computer simulations, researchers determined that meteorites from Vesta recorded impacts by unusually high-speed projectiles which are now long gone. They deduced that this period of bombardment was related to a time in solar system history four billion years ago when gas giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, migrated from their original orbits to their current location.\nThe team’s findings support the theory that this repositioning of the gas giant planets destabilized portions of the asteroid belt and triggered a solar system-wide bombardment of asteroids. This event, called the “Lunar Cataclysm,” pulled many asteroids into orbits that collided with Earth and the moon. The research provides new constraints on the start and duration of the lunar cataclysm, and demonstrates that the cataclysm was an event that affected not only the inner solar system planets, but the asteroid belt as well.\nThe team’s interpretation of the howardites and eucrites was augmented by recent close-in observations of Vesta’s surface by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft. In addition, the team used the latest dynamical models of early main belt evolution to discover the likely source of these high velocity impactors. The team determined that the same population of projectiles hitting Vesta also had orbits that struck the moon at high speeds.\n“It appears that the asteroidal meteorites show signs of the asteroid belt losing a lot of mass four billion years ago, with the escaped mass beating up on both the surviving main belt asteroids and the moon at high speeds” says lead author Simone Marchi, who has a joint appointment between two of NASA’s Lunar Science Institutes, one at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, and another at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. “Our research not only supports the current theory, but it takes it to the next level of understanding.”\nThis research unveils an unexpected link between Vesta and the moon providing new means for studying the early bombardment history of the terrestrial planets.\nThe research was conducted by members or associates of the NASA Lunar Science Institute’s Center of Lunar Origin and Evolution (CLOE), based at SwRI in Boulder, Colo. The impact study team consisted of S. Marchi and W.F. Bottke, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colo.; B. A. Cohen from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.; D. A. Kring, USRA-LPI, NASA Lunar Science Institute, Houston, Texas; H. Y. McSween, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.; D. P. O’Brien, Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Ariz.; P.

Russell, University of California, Los Angeles, Calif.; with international partners K. Wünnemann, Museum Für Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany; and M. C.

{"question":"What type of protection did lords provide to their dependents in both feudal and manor systems?","answer":"In the feudal system, lords provided protection from external forces to their vassals as part of a formal treaty established during the ceremony of praise, where vassals promised to fight for the lord in return. In the manor system, lords provided safety and protection from outside threats to the serfs and peasants who worked their lands. This protection was part of the economic and social system that made peasants dependent on their lord and the land.","context":["In its origin, the feudal granting of land had been seen as a personal link between the Lord and the vassals, but with time and the transformation of fiefdoms into hereditary possessions, the nature of the system was considered a form of “country politics”. In the 11th century, France saw what historians called a “feudal revolution” or “mutation” and a “fragmentation of powers” different from the development of feudalism in England, Italy or Germany at the same time or later. In France, counties and duchy began to break into small farms, when castles and small lords took control of local lands, and (as the comital families had done before them), the little masters seized/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state – especially the very professional rights of justice, but also travel costs, market fees, forest royalties, the Lord`s obligations to use, etc. Power became more personal and decentralized at that time. The nobles, both noble and simple knights, took advantage of men, although they had no land, but they obtained from a master rights over the income of a mansion or other countries through the feudalism system. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands or fiefdoms were considered hereditary and, in most territories, they were no longer divisible between all heirs, as was the case in the early Middle Ages. Instead, most fiefdoms and countries went to the eldest son. The domination of the nobility was built on its control of the country, its military service as a heavy cavalry, its control over castles and various tax immunity or other constraints. Relief – A fine paid by the heir of a vassal to the Lord for the privilege of the success of an estate.\nFeudal duties were the series of reciprocal financial, military and legal commitments of the warrior nobility in a feudal system.  These obligations have developed in both Europe and Japan, with the decentralization of the Empire and lack of monetary liquidity, as groups of warriors have assumed the social, political, judicial and economic spheres of the territory they control.  While many feudal duties rested on the control of a parcel country and its productive resources, even landless knights had feudal duties such as direct military service on the orders of their Lord. Feudal duties have not been uniform over time or across political boundaries. And in their later development also duties of and towards the peasant population, as accommodation.  Before a lord could give someone (a fiefdom), he had to make that person a vassal. This is what happened in a solemn and symbolic ceremony, called a ceremony of praise, which consisted of the act in two parts of tribute and allegiance. During the tribute, the Lord and the Vassal concluded a treaty in which the Vassal promised to fight for the Lord at his command, while the Lord agreed to protect the vassal from the external forces. A gentleman also enjoyed ancillary benefits and fiefdom-related rights. For example, when a vassal died, the Lord was entitled to a large sum of money from the heirs of the vassal. If the heir was a minor, the Lord could sell or give custody of the country and take advantage of his profits until the heir arrived. A gentleman also had the right to refuse the marriage of an heiress with a fiefdom if he did not want to have the husband as his vassal.\nThis type of family involvement of the Lord has made the feudal relationship intimate and complex.","- 1 What system was the manor system?\n- 2 How does the manor system work?\n- 3 What was the purpose of the manor system?\n- 4 What best describes a manor?\n- 5 What is an example of Manorialism?\n- 6 What were the four main parts of the manor?\n- 7 What was life like on a manor?\n- 8 What is the difference between feudalism and the manor system?\n- 9 What is a manor and what are its benefits?\n- 10 What is the most important building on a manor?\n- 11 What is the difference between Villeins and freemen?\n- 12 What did peasants drink?\n- 13 What is the difference between Manor and manner?\n- 14 What is the difference between a manor and a mansion?\n- 15 What does manor mean in Old English?\nWhat system was the manor system?\nManorialism, also called manorial system, seignorialism, or seignorial system, political, economic, and social system by which the peasants of medieval Europe were rendered dependent on their land and on their lord.\nHow does the manor system work?\nThe lord of a manor was supported by his land holdings and contributions from the peasant population. Serfs who occupied land belonging to the lord were required to work the land, and in return received certain entitlements. The manor system was made up of three types of land: demesne, dependent, and free peasant land.\nWhat was the purpose of the manor system?\nThe Manor System refers to a system of agricultural estates in the Middle Ages, owned by a Lord and run by serfs or peasants. The Lords provided safety and protection from outside threats and the serfs or peasants provided labor to run the manor.\nWhat best describes a manor?\nnoun. (in England) a landed estate or territorial unit, originally of the nature of a feudal lordship, consisting of a lord’s demesne and of lands within which he has the right to exercise certain privileges, exact certain fees, etc. any similar territorial unit in medieval Europe, as a feudal estate.\nWhat is an example of Manorialism?\ncould not without leave quit the manor and could be reclaimed by process of law if he did. The strict contention of law deprived him of all right to hold property, and in many cases he was subject to certain degrading incidents [he] paid for his holding in money, in labour, and in agrarian produce.\nWhat were the four main parts of the manor?\nA manor was usually comprised of tracts of agricultural land, a village whose inhabitants worked that land, and a manor house where the lord who owned or controlled the estate lived. Manors might also have had woods, orchards, gardens, and lakes or ponds where fish could be found.\nWhat was life like on a manor?\nThe people living on the manor were from all “levels” of Feudalism: Peasants, Knights, Lords, and Nobles. There were usually large fields around the Manor used for livestock, crops, and hunting. The only people allowed to hunt in the manor’s forests were nobles.\nWhat is the difference between feudalism and the manor system?\nRelationship: Feudalism deals with the relationship between nobles and vassals. Manorialism deals with the relationship between the vassals, or the lords, and the peasants or serfs.\nWhat is a manor and what are its benefits?\nBenefits that a medieval manor provided were the serfs tended the lord’s lands, cared for his animals, and performed other tasks to maintain the estate.\nWhat is the most important building on a manor?\nA manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord’s manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets.\nWhat is the difference between Villeins and freemen?\nVilleins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord’s consent. Villeins typically had to pay special taxes and fines that freemen were exempt from, for example, “filstingpound” (an insurance against corporal punishment) and “leyrwite” (fine for bearing a child outside of wedlock).\nWhat did peasants drink?\nThe villagers drank water and milk. The water from a river was unpleasant to drink and the milk did not stay fresh for long. The main drink in a medieval village was ale.\nWhat is the difference between Manor and manner?\nA manor is a mansion or stately home. A manner is a characteristic way of doing something. These words are homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings), so it’s easy to mix them up.\nWhat is the difference between a manor and a mansion?\nYes, a ” manor ” usually denotes a country house surrounded by acres of land, and its origins date back to the days of feudal lords. A ” mansion ” is nowadays simply another word for a very large house and tends to be used a lot by estate agents in order to inflate the selling price of otherwise relatively ordinary houses.\nWhat does manor mean in Old English?\nManor comes from the Old French manoir, meaning “dwelling place,” but a manor isn’t just any old dwelling place. In the days when people still had titles of nobility, the houses and the grounds of the nobles were known as manors."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d85f85bb-5350-4d91-8776-70cefaa4e4db>","<urn:uuid:87939c9d-7ed1-4e00-aadd-5091e5ff964b>"],"error":null}

Each living honoree received an official Hall of Fame Induction Certificate and gold Hall of Fame ring.","context":["25th ANNUAL HALL OF FAME INDUCTION CELEBRATION IN\nBOXING'S HOMETOWN - CANASTOTA, NEW YORK\nCANASTOTA, NY - JUNE 8, 2014 - Over the course of four sun-filled days (June 5-8th) the boxing world celebrated the Hall of Fame’s landmark 25th Anniversary and honored the Class of 2014 as they joined boxing immortals. Thousands of boxing fans from throughout the United States and across the globe, along with members of the worldwide boxing community, assembled at the Hall of Fame's Events Pavilion to see the new inductees enshrined at the Official Induction Ceremony on Sunday, June 8th.\nThe ceremony capped a fun-filled weekend in “Boxing’s Hometown” celebrating the new inductees and the sport of boxing. The weekend featured many exciting and memorable events including a golf tournament, cocktail party, banquet, a Night of Puerto Rican Pride and boxing autograph card show. There were also a variety of activities on the Museum Grounds including the popular \"ringside lecture\" question and answer sessions, celebrity fist casting, celebrity boxing demonstrations, raffles and a silent auction.\nThis year's living inductees were two division champion “The Pride of Wales” Joe Calzaghe, six division champion “The Golden Boy” Oscar De La Hoya, three division champion Felix “Tito” Trinidad, promoter Barry Hearn, referee Richard Steele, journalist Graham Houston and photographer Neil Leifer. Living honorees received the official Hall of Fame Induction Certificate and gold Hall of Fame ring symbolizing their status as Hall of Famers.\nPosthumous inductees of the Class of 2014 honored were George “K.O.”Chaney, Charles Ledoux and Mike O’Dowd in the old-timer category; Tom Allen in the pioneer category; and referee Eugene Corri in the Non-Participant category.\nChaney’s grandson, Craig Kirchner, accepted for his family and made a special donation to the Hall of Fame, a 100-year old \"K.O.\" Chaney sweatshirt that his grandfather wore.\nJoseph Hillstrom, great nephew of O’Dowd, accepted Hall of Fame honors on behalf of his great uncle.\nVeteran journalist Houston was the first living member of the Class of 2014 to accept his Hall of Fame ring. “…Sometimes you write articles and you write thousands of words and you wonder do people really enjoy what I write. Sometimes you have little doubts and then you get inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame and you think , you know what, people out there do like what I ‘ve done over the years. I can’t ask for more than that. And I can’t ask for more than to be inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. I’m so grateful, humbled and honored.”\nBritish promoter Hearn proudly accepted boxing’s highest honor next. “…We are so lucky to be involved in this quite unique sport and we’re surrounded by quite unique people. They should have our respect, they should have our admiration and they should have our support. All we have to do is play straight with them and we know they will play straight with us. To the people of Canastota, to Ed Brophy, his organizing committee, these wonderful helpers who are everywhere, thank you for giving me a day I never dreamed in my lifetime I would experience. Thank you to all you guys for your support.”\nNext was Leifer, the first photographer elected into the Hall of Fame. “To be the first photographer (in the Hall) is just a real, real honor. It’s an honor for me and, it’s an honor, I think, for all the photographers that have worked so hard…There are two questions I’m asked all the time. What is your favorite sport to photograph and I always answer boxing. The answer is so easy and these four days have really just convinced me how right I’ve been all these years…So the second question I’m asked all the time, usually on a college campus where I lecture occasionally to photojournalism students and young students come up to me and they say, ‘Neil, how can we have a career like the one you’ve had?’ And my answer is so simple. I look at them and of course they immediately think I’m full of it when I say to them, ‘It’s easy. You can definitely have a career as good as mine. Just go out and find yourself a subject like Muhammad Ali. Hitch your wagon to it and stick around for forty years and you’ll be a superstar.' So I want to dedicate my being inducted today to the great Muhammad Ali, one of the great human beings of all time. There is no way I would be standing here had Ali not taken me on the greatest ride of my life.”\nAn emotional Steele was next to join boxing’s immortals. “Wow. 58 years I have been working trying to get where I’m at today, not even knowing where I was going. Not even knowing what I was going to do or who I was going to be surrounded by. You guys have really showed me what love is. I love boxing and what you guys have put together to show me that you appreciated what I have done, I love you all for this. This memory will be with me for the rest of my days….The fans, oh wow, you guys are great. If I had enough rings I’d give you all one! …Boxing is my life. Boxing has been good to me. And I want to take this time to thank you all the fans, all the people in charge of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Thank you so much. This is an honor. I am so happy…”\nUndefeated two-division champion Calzaghe was next to the podium to accept his gold ring. “Thank you so much. Wow. I will never forget this for the rest of my life. To see these great champions, referees and promoters and to be nominated on the 25th Anniversary against two absolutely special fighters in Oscar De La Hoya and Tito Trinidad, wow. That’s all I can say is wow. I’m just so humbled to be in their presence…I wanted to be a footballer and I remember being freezing cold in the winter left on the subs' bench shivering, not scoring any goals. Then I went to the boxing gym and started beating people up and I thought, you know what, I like this boxing, this feels good. My hands were a lot faster than my feet…I thank God, all my fans, my family who has always been there for me. Thank you so much and thank you for being here and giving me one of the best weekends. I will never ever forget this moment and I’ll cherish it the rest of my life.”\nThe fighting pride of Puerto Rico Trinidad walked to the podium to chants of “Tito, Tito, Tito” from his adoring fans. “…and today I am very proud to be recognized for my career, which has basically been my whole life. I want to let you know my family has always supported me, been there for me throughout my entire career…But today in front of all of you, this person, without him, more than likely, I’m completely sure I would not be here. Besides being my father, he has been the best father, the best manager, the best trainer - with all respect to managers and trainers here – he fought with me every day to accomplish being here standing in the Hall of Fame. I’m very proud of you dad, extremely proud. I owe you a lot…Truthfully this award, this ring, which is very beautiful, also belongs to you. From my heart, I love you…I love this Museum, I love my people. Puerto Rico! Thank you.”\nNext to join boxing’s immortals was “The Golden Boy” De La Hoya. \"Today marks an incredible personal achievement but it is only the latest milestone that never would have been possible without my family, my friends and most importantly, the fans. The gold medal in Barcelona, the world championships is six different weight classes, the founding of Golden Boy Promotions and my foundation, my entire journey from East Los Angeles to this moment has been a partnership between myself and the millions of people that have supported me first as an amateur and then as a champion and now as a promoter, businessman and philanthropist. I share this honor with each and every single person here, the fans. Thank you very much. I am particularly excited to see so many of my fellow fighters here today and I am astonished by the names that I am joining in this special fraternity. So many of these men were not only dominate inside the ring, but were and are larger than life outside the ropes. Alexis Arguello, may he rest in peace, Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Jack Dempsey, George Foreman, Julio Cesar Chavez, the list goes on and on and on. And of course Felix Trinidad – who I am most privileged to join today in this Induction Ceremony.”\nAmong the boxing stars on hand for the weekend were Hall of Fame Alumni Bob Arum, Al Bernstein, Don Chargin, Stanley Christodoulou, Joe Cortez, Pipino Cuevas, George Foreman, Wilfredo Gomez, Larry Hazzard, Don King, Ruben Olivares, Carlos Ortiz, Russell Peltz, Aaron Pryor, Dwight Qawi and Michael Spinks.\nOther boxing celebrities in attendance included Vito Antuofermo, Billy Backus, Iran Barkley, Lucian Bute, Dickie DiVeronica, Ivan Calderon, George Chuvalo, Gerry Cooney, Carlos De Leon, Glen Johnson, Zab Judah, Juan LaPorte, John John Molina, Erik Morales, Diana Prazak, Lucia Rijker, John Ruiz, Zou Shiming, Leon Spinks, Marlon Starling, John H.

EDF said the accelerated plan represents an investment of 8 billion euros — or just shy of $10 billion — between 2018 and 2035.\nEDF is already involved in energy storage technology applications, including batteries and pumped hydroelectric storage. The state-owned utility says its ambitions are focused on all segments of the electricity storage market “to help ensure the smooth running of a balanced electricity system, for residential customers, businesses and countries.” The EDF Group is particularly interested in becoming a leader in residential storage and self-consumption services in France and Europe.\nAfrica is also a priority market for EDF, where the company has a goal to develop a portfolio of 1.2 million off-grid customers by 2035, through local partnerships. EDF has already deployed 15,000 solar and storage systems in Ivory Coast and is now looking to expand its services in Ghana.\nThe utility's renewed push into the energy storage business comes as higher levels of solar penetration and a rapid decline in energy storage costs have made batteries an attractive way to shift peak load and reduce stress on the electric grid. Behind-the-meter installations in particular are projected to accelerate in the coming years. According to GTM Research, behind-the-meter storage will rival utility-scale in deployed capacity by 2022. The same trend is underway in Europe and across the globe.\nIn Italy, local subsidies and a strong solar market are expected to cause behind-the-meter installations to soar after 2021, according to a December report compiled by Delta-ee on behalf of the European Association for Storage of Energy. This growth could enable Italy to overtake Germany, where subsidies also play a big role, as Europe’s top energy storage market after the turn of the decade.\nLooking further out, however, the report notes that European markets will start to transition away from a reliance on government support to install batteries, toward more market-based growth.\nEDF, which is heavily invested in nuclear power, is looking to diversify its offerings amid a changing energy landscape. This past year the company launched a new Distributed Energy and Storage business unit in the U.S., building on its 2016 acquisition of groSolar. And in December EDF won a 10-megawatt/40-megawatt-hour contract with Pacific Gas & Electric, enabling the company to build out its expertise in smaller-scale storage projects.\nWithin the next 12 months, EDF plans to launch at least three battery projects to improve the performance and balance of the power system, including EDF Energy’s 49-megawatt battery storage project for Britain’s National Grid — which is set to be one of Europe’s largest battery storage projects.\nEDF's plan to deploy an additional 10 gigawatts of energy storage by 2035 will comprise 6 gigawatts of industrial-scale projects, including pumped storage and batteries, and 4 gigawatts of individual batteries for retail customers, companies and municipalities, Reuters reports.\nFaced with rapid advancements in storage technology, EDF is also increasing its research and development capabilities as it increases energy storage deployments over the coming years. The utility plans to double its investments in storage for the power system, to 70 million euros ($86 million) for the 2018-2020 period. In addition, EDF’s Nouveaux Business unit will allocate €15 million ($18.4 million) in the next two years — representing a third of its total investments — to projects and startups linked to electricity storage and flexibility.\n“Electricity storage technologies have a potential to radically change the energy sector,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF’s CEO and chairman, in a statement. “EDF’s Electricity Storage Plan is based on the expertise coming from all entities within our Group and 25 years of investment in R&D.”\nEDF’s new storage strategy follows the unveiling of a Solar Power Plan late last year, in which the company said it would invest 25 billion euros to build 30 gigawatts of solar power capacity in France between 2020 and 2035.\nThe French utility has set a new target to reach a 100 percent carbon-free power system by 2050, Lévy said last week. The new Electricity Storage Plan, coupled with the Solar Plan, “confirms EDF’s ability to enable a competitive ecosystem in order to make our carbon-free future a reality.”\nWill energy storage replace peaker plants?

{"question":"What are the financial implications of maintaining EOL applications, and how do modern archiving solutions address these cost concerns?","answer":"Maintaining EOL applications carries significant financial burdens, including increased out-of-support license costs with premium pricing for major patches, ongoing hardware support expenses, and potential compliance violation fines. Organizations also face expenses related to application software support licenses, server costs, environmental costs, and administration fees for operating legacy systems. Modern archiving solutions address these concerns by enabling organizations to decommission legacy applications while preserving necessary data in a single repository. This approach eliminates associated maintenance costs while ensuring data remains accessible for business needs and compliance requirements, leading to significant cost reductions through a holistic enterprise archive platform.","context":["CloudSphere has released the results of its new EOL Management and Risk for IT Assets: An Enterprise User Survey, which reveals the level of confidence individuals have regarding which End of Life (EOL) or near-EOL applications pose the greatest risk to businesses. The survey further identifies the areas of greatest concern regarding the risk of running EOL applications within their IT environment.\nWe sat down with Keith Neilson, CloudSphere to chat about the report's findings, the cyber risk of EOL apps, and what organizations can do to mitigate their risk. Why is it important for businesses to monitor End-of-Life (EOL) or near-EOL applications within their IT estate?\nEnd-of-Life (EOL) software and asset support may not always be top-of-mind for organizations, but EOL plays a surprisingly strong role in both the efficiency and security of the enterprise’s IT estate.\nBy gaining a better understanding of where and how EOL is affecting a company’s tech stack, businesses can safeguard against several major risks.\nRisks include service and support from the software vendor stopping. This means any future patches for security vulnerabilities in the application code or libraries will no longer be updated to counter any possible threats in the future. The application (app) is then vulnerable to threats that continue to develop and exploit in new ways.\nAnother risk is the increased out-of-support license costs. Software vendors will provide \"out of support\" maintenance to a point, it is no longer general release, but companies can get major patches on a per-account basis, but this is often priced at a premium which quickly sends shockwaves through IT budgets.\nOut-of-date and End-of-Life software can manifest itself from an Operating System (OS) perspective. The risk here aside from the cost to get support (if eligible) is that each and every application that runs on top of that OS is now undermined and exposed to its very foundations being unsupported. The result is leaving threats on the doorstep of each app and its corresponding users and data.\nOther risks include a lack of support for hardware devices that the business might need for an application to integrate with and consume along with the potential for serious compliance gaps. Think manufacturing and production lines stopping due to incompatible drivers and applications. Another risk, compliance failure. Most Operating Systems and applications in use are known by industry-specific regulations that will stipulate software in use to be supported and compliant with regulations. Once End-of-Life, the organization will fall out of compliance rendering the entire IT stack a threat - data, network, app layer, etc.\nIn an EOL survey commissioned by CloudSphere in July of 2022, the results highlighted that IT stakeholders have some visibility into their assets, but a limited grasp of where EOL may be a factor and the possible adverse impacts these scenarios could have on their IT estates.\nWhat risks do unaccounted-for EOL or near-EOL applications pose to companies’ tech stacks?\nWhile 73% of survey respondents from the report said they were confident they were aware of all the applications and cyber assets currently running within their IT environments, only 65% felt confident they knew of all cases of applications at or near EOL within those environments.\nCompanies who are unaware of running EOL applications may experience problems ranging from lapsed licenses and lack of vendor support to broken applications and major security gaps that may persist from a lack of patching support. Not to mention the commercial exposure for sector-specific compliance, which can result in very large fines.\nWhich departments within an organization's IT infrastructure are most vulnerable to the threats of running EOL applications?\nThis really comes down to specific business units and those running the most business-critical applications. Typically challenges manifest as the enterprise struggles to have a completely straight line of support for operating systems being used as older apps have dependencies.\nAt times you will have some apps not perceived to be crucial on out-of-support software. If they are not connected apps there might not be a concern but more often than not, there is something critical, sensitive, handling regulated data which is where enterprises get stuck, panic, and then must deal with.\nWhile organizations prioritize certain departments as more vulnerable than others, it is important to remember that EOL can pose a significant risk to all departments, including downtime from broken applications, wasted spending on lapsed or unused licenses, gaps in data security and reporting that can prompt regulatory violations and fines.\nHow can businesses ensure they are confidently tracking current EOL or near-EOL applications?\nCyber Asset Management solutions allow for the discovery and identification of software packages and operating systems within the estate. There are reports and alerts within this solution that highlight and help plan the migration and remediation of EOL software.\nWhat are the overall benefits of integrating a robust cyber asset management strategy within an organization?\nBy integrating a robust cyber asset management strategy, companies will not only have the capabilities to manage the risks of running EOL applications more effectively but will also inform overall better decisions within their tech stack. This includes, weeding out costly redundant systems, or dropping software that may be nearing End-of-Life to avoid unnecessary licensing costs and support gaps. ###","A typical IT environment contains legacy systems comprised of applications and data that have been superseded by new solutions, or inherited as a result of business mergers or acquisition.\nLegacy applications are of low value to a business, but they must be maintained and supported to ensure access to the data they hold which is often required to meet compliance regulations and support reporting, audit or legacy discovery. These applications are often no longer supported by the vendor or are on legacy infrastructure and require specialized knowledge to maintain. As a result, they are expensive to retain and may represent a risk to the organization.\nDecommissioning Legacy Applications\nAs business applications reach the end of their life cycle, they will typically be superseded by other applications with more advanced functionality, better integration or more modern user interfaces. A classic example is when a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is introduced, replacing many older systems. However, these older systems often contain sensitive business data that has not been migrated to newer applications.\nConsequently, businesses keep these obsolete systems alive - simply to preserve this data. Unfortunately for the business, this is done at a cost.\nThe Decommissioning Struggle\nExpenses that are typically present include application software support licenses, server expenses, environmental costs and even administration costs for simply operating and maintaining these legacy systems. Additionally, organizations often struggle with decommissioning legacy applications after their business use, which creates a tremendous amount of redundancy across the enterprise.\nWhen pursuing an application retirement strategy, an organization must begin by considering a number of business and policy questions.\nIf decommissioning legacy applications is a priority, these six questions may provide a roadmap for change.\n- Which legacy systems should be kept operational and which should be decommissioned?\n- For the systems that are to be decommissioned, what data actually needs to be preserved?\n- For what period of time should the archived data be retained?\n- What relations between data fields will be important for providing business context?\n- Which users will need access to data and what levels of permissions need to be supported?\n- What queries will users need to perform and how should the results be presented?\nCurrently, information archiving solutions allow legacy applications to be shut down and decommissioned, which saves the costs associated with supporting and maintaining them. Archived information remains accessible, ensuring support for business reporting, auditing or data retention policies.\nThe need for change is starting to surface.\nCIOs are recognizing the importance of archiving by including an archive strategy in their overall information management vision and strategy. A proper archive solution enables large volumes of business information to be stored and managed in a single repository to ensure long-term preservation and retention management.\nThe technical solution is to decommission legacy systems after transferring their data into an enterprise archive. Leading archiving solutions today archive legacy data so that the system can then be switched off, eliminating all its associated costs. The archived data is then accessible for all business needs and will meet retention and other compliance requirements.\nThe benefits of archiving are beyond dispute. Significant cost reductions can be achieved by adopting a holistic enterprise archive platform. With trends in information storage moving more to cloud computing, big data and information protection, organizations require complete solutions for enterprise archiving that are built to allow the user to find the information they need, regardless of the application that created it.\nToday, enterprises are seeking integrated content management products that archive inactive information from legacy applications - allowing them to be decommissioned. By adding archive technology, organizations can preserve the value of enterprise information, satisfy retention policies and ensure regulatory compliance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bee6f1f0-bdf8-49c6-ab66-c155a179dac9>","<urn:uuid:53345e08-5e5f-458b-9445-4bdcec20c080>"],"error":null}

It focuses on studying things like buildings, pottery, tools, and graves to understand how people lived in the past. In contrast, paleontology is the study of prehistoric life through fossils - preserved remains of organisms like animals, plants, and microorganisms that lived long ago.

The oldest dinosaur fossils were found in the early 1800s, making it one of the earliest recorded discoveries in paleontology. Since then, dinosaurs have been discovered worldwide, giving us a glimpse into their history.\nDinosaur paleontology is a science that has existed for hundreds of years and is still as much a mystery today as it was in its earliest inception. Paleontologists study bones and other remains left behind by dinosaurs. This determines critical details about what these animals looked like and how they lived. These findings help us better understand the world around us. It also helps us make better decisions regarding living with nature.\nThe history of dinosaur paleontology is a long, complicated one. It can be challenging to keep track of all the different discoveries and ideas that have been proposed over the years. This article will introduce the history of dinosaur paleontology. This includes its origins, how it differs from other disciplines, and how it has changed over time.\nDinosaur paleontology is now a recent discipline. It was first developed in the 19th century by Sir Richard Owen, who is considered its founder. To understand what dinosaur paleontology is and how it works, we must first understand some basic definitions:\nThe scientific name for dinosaurs refers only to animals more closely related to birds than crocodiles or lizards. Dinosaurs include bipedal and quadrupedal animals. They lived during the Mesozoic Era (approximately 250 million years ago).\nPaleontology refers to the study of fossils and their preservation techniques. Fossils are objects left behind after an animal dies or changes form through natural processes. This includes erosion or decomposition (e.g., teeth). Scientists can determine what kinds of animals existed during specific periods by studying these fossils.\nPaleontology is the study of prehistoric life. Fossilized remains of prehistoric organisms are called fossils. Paleontologists study fossils to learn about the lives and environments of extinct animals, plants, and other microorganisms.\nPaleontology has a long history. Early paleontologists were naturalists. They studied invertebrates and other organisms that lived on land or in water. These early paleontologists included Georges Cuvier (1769-1832), Richard Owen (1765-1849), William Buckland (1784-1856), and Mary Anning (1799-1847).\nIn 1841, Mary Anning discovered a fossilized skeleton of a plesiosaur (a marine reptile) near Lyme Regis in England. This was the first time a complete skeleton of an animal had been discovered in its entirety. It also marked the beginning of paleontological research into dinosaurs.\nWhat Is Modern Paleontology?\nModern paleontology is the study of fossils and the discovery and examination of them. Paleontologists are trained to interpret fossil records. This can be used to learn about ancient life and the environments in which it lived.\nIn the history of dinosaur paleontology, many different methods have been used to find fossils. This includes dredging for fossils near riverbanks and chipping away at rock layers to reveal more fossils. It also includes digging up bones that other scientists have already discovered.\nDinosaur paleontology is one of the essential fields in science. It allows researchers to study creatures that have been dead for millions of years but are still recognizable. And learning those fossils taught us much about what life was like before humans existed!\nThe discovery of dinosaur fossils helped scientists understand how animals lived in the past. It also showed when they evolved into what they became today. For example, scientists soon realized that dinosaur bones were found in numerous locations worldwide. This included North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. This led them to believe that dinosaurs must have lived on land during that period.\nIn addition to learning about dinosaurs’ physical characteristics (such as size), scientists also studied their lifestyle by examining their teeth and other body parts found within their fossils at various museums worldwide.\nWhat Is Paleobiology?\nPaleobiology is the study of life in the past, and it’s one of the fastest-growing fields in science today. Paleontologists study fossils, which are remains of organisms that lived in the past. Fossils can tell us about the environment, food sources, and climate of the period they were formed. They also provide a window into how animals evolved.\nPaleobiology has been around for more than 150 years! The first paleontologist was George Cuvier, who began studying fossils in the 1800s. Since then, there have been many changes to this field. At first, scientists thought dinosaurs were slow and stupid creatures. They didn’t deserve a place in science because they weren’t intelligent enough to have culture or written language. However, this idea has changed since then! We now know dinosaurs were some of the most intelligent animals on Earth.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Paleobiology And Paleontology?\nThe difference between paleobiology and paleontology is not that subtle. Paleobiology looks at life in the past, while Paleontology looks at life in the present and past. Paleobiology is a subset of paleontology. It focuses on studies of ancient life forms and their interactions with the environment. Paleobiology focuses on the biological aspect of dinosaurs.\nPaleontology has been split into two branches: sedimentary rock formation and fossilization. The sedimentary rock formation happens when sediment is transported by water or wind. It also includes the cementation process. Fossilization is the process by which an animal’s body becomes mineralized over time. This is due to chemical reactions happening inside its body.\nWhere Did the Idea of Extinction Originate?\nThe idea of extinction originated with the discovery of fossils during this period. This led scientists to believe that they were able to trace the evolutionary history of animals by studying their remains. It originated in the early 1800s when paleontologists first began to study fossils.\nIt was soon realized that dinosaurs were quite different from other animals. They could not have been alive simultaneously as humans. Since they were been wiped out by a meteor impact or some other natural disaster, it indicated they were not native. Some say they had migrated here from another planet. It was also considered unlikely that dinosaurs were related to birds. This is because those two groups lived on opposite sides of the Earth at the time (birds are feathered and warm-blooded).\nThis idea became popular among scientists because it explained how these creatures would have come to exist on Earth in the first place. If they originated elsewhere, then there must also be evidence of their destruction in other parts of the world. This is precisely what we find in the fossil record.\nHow Vast Was the Geological Timeline?\nThe history of dinosaur paleontology can be divided into two distinct periods. One is before and the second is after the development of the science of geology. Before the dinosaurs’ discovery, scientists could not answer questions about the geological timeline. They could not determine how much time had elapsed since Earth was formed.\nThe earliest discoveries of dinosaurs occurred in 1829. This was the discovery of a tooth by William Buckland, a British geologist, and professor at Oxford University. He called it “an enormous tooth” because it looked like something from an ancient crocodile. This is considered the first evidence of dinosaurs on Earth.\nIn 1842, Mary Ann Mantell and Dr. Gideon Algernon Mantell discovered a fossilized skeleton in London. She said it was the first evidence of Iguanodon, which had long been thought extinct at that time. Later studies revealed this animal to be a type of plesiosaur alive during the Jurassic period (200 million years ago).\nIn 1859, Othniel Marsh made his first discovery of the first pterosaur fossils. He found dinosaur bones at Como Bluff in Wyoming Territory. This was one of many findings he made over the next few years. These helped establish that dinosaurs existed before humans evolved on Earth (approximately 675 million years ago).\nThe history of dinosaur paleontology is a long and eventful journey. It began with the discovery of fossilized remains in the early 1800s. However, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that scientists started to put together a timeline.\nThe first few decades of paleontological study produced many theories. This included what dinosaurs looked like and how they behaved. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that scientists were able to piece together enough evidence from fossils to start making accurate predictions. This was about what life might have looked like millions of years ago.\nBy the end of the 20th century, researchers had accumulated enough data about dinosaurs’ lives and deaths. They began making some educated guesses about where they lived during their lifetimes. The discovery of feathered dinosaurs in China in 1996 helped scientists understand how birds evolved from dinosaurs over time.\nWhen Were the First Dinosaurs Discovered?\nThe history of dinosaur paleontology began with the discovery of dinosaur fossils in England in the early 1800s. At first, scientists believed they were fossilized bones from giant reptiles. However, as more and more new specimens were found, it became clear that they were actually fossils of dinosaurs. The first known dinosaurs date back to around 245 million years ago.\nMany early discoveries were misidentified as giant humans or other animals. However, this didn’t stop them from getting published and being used in science for hundreds of years.\nThe history of dinosaur paleontology has been an interesting one. It started with Sir Richard Owen’s discovery in 1841 of the first complete skeleton of a dinosaur (a Megalosaurus). He named it Megalosaurus because he thought it looked like one. Now we know that dinosaurs are pretty different from mammals in terms of structure and lifestyle.\nThese are the people responsible for our understanding of dinosaurs. Without their curiosity and dedication, dinosaurs would still be mysterious to us. We would still have many more questions than answers. However, they were not the first, nor will they be the last, to uncover the history of dinosaur paleontology. They have paved the way for future researchers and scientists. Without them, modern science, as we know it, might never have been born."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ffcb0bbd-0b03-4fa4-9359-495a110aa37a>","<urn:uuid:4d720c7c-31ae-4da6-89aa-811c6a36736c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between how neuropeptide genes were identified in C. elegans versus how the FOXO transcription factor's role was discovered in Drosophila?","answer":"The identification approaches were quite different. For C. elegans neuropeptide genes, researchers first tried similarity searches using known sequences, which found only two novel neuropeptide-like proteins. They then used a more sophisticated PATTERNFIND algorithm to scan for specific amino acid patterns, ultimately identifying 32 nlp genes encoding 151 neuropeptides. In contrast, FOXO's role in Drosophila was discovered through genetic studies and loss-of-function experiments. Researchers found that dFOXO mutants appeared normal in well-fed conditions but showed interesting effects when tested in compromised insulin pathway backgrounds - revealing that dFOXO controls cell number through regulating genes like d4E-BP. The differences in approach reflect the challenges of identifying multi-peptide encoding genes versus characterizing specific transcription factors.","context":["Significance and context\nMuch synaptic signaling in the nervous system is facilitated by specialized peptidergic neurotransmitters called neuropeptides. Neuropeptides function in neurotransmission primarily by modulating synaptic signaling through other, small-molecule, neurotransmitters, and exert their function through seven-span transmembrane receptors, although a sodium channel that can be directly gated by the neuropeptide FMRF has been identified inthe snail Helix lucorum. Neuropeptides thus appear also to act as fast neurotransmitters.\nMolecular and biochemical studies have established that the neuropeptides comprise a large and diverse group of signal molecules, but the molecular mechanisms underlying neuropeptide-mediated synaptic transmission remain largely elusive. The nematode Caenorhabditiselegans, with its simple nervous system and completely sequenced genome, lends itself to a systematic analysis of neuropeptide function. A remarkable feature of this animal pertinent to such an investigation is that synaptic connectivity has been deciphered in unprecedented detail by serial sectioning and electron microscopy. In addition, many neuropeptides have already been identified in C. elegans, demonstrating that neuropeptide signaling operates in the worm nervous system.\nNathoo and co-workers set out to search for more neuropeptide genes in the C. elegans genome. Two different classes of neuropeptide genes had been described by previous studies in the worm: genes for FMRF-like proteins (flp), with some 23 members, and 37 insulin-related genes. Are these all? The authors note two observations that hint at the existence of more. First, there are many more putative neuropeptide receptor genes (about 130) in the C. elegans genome. Second, specialized dense-core synaptic vesicles (the sites of neuropeptides) that are not immunoreactive for any of the known neuropeptide families are found at nematode synapses.\nTo identify novel neuropeptide genes in C. elegans, Nathoo et al. first carried out similarity searches of the nematode protein database, using known neuropeptide sequences as probes. This approach returned just two novel neuropeptide-like proteins (NLPs). The limited success of the similarity search underlines the peculiar structure of neuropeptide genes: most encode many related neuropeptides, which renders them invisible to simple BLAST searches. For a neuropeptide gene to be picked up by BLAST, it would have to encode multiple unrelated neuropeptides. To overcome this limitation, the authors used PATTERNFIND, an algorithm that can scan for the existence of a defined amino-acid pattern within a protein. To filter the output of PATTERNFIND, they established a set of criteria that a bonafide neuropeptide would have to fulfill. This analysis was indeed more productive, and resulted in the identification of 32 putative nlp genes including the two (nlp-1 and nlp-2) previously identified.\nIn summary, the 32 novel nlp genes identified are distributed between 11 families, on the basis of the presence of conserved motifs, and encode 151 total putative neuropeptides. For many of these newly identified neuropeptide genes, a reciprocal search of GenBank revealed the existence of close relatives in other species, which further validates the screening strategy and suggests conservation in synaptic signaling mechanisms. To identify the sites of action of the novel neuropeptides, Nathoo et al. generated transgenic lines for each of the genes identified with reporter green fluorescent protein fused to the neuropeptide gene. As expected, many are expressed extensively in the nervous system, indicating a function in synaptic signaling. Some are also expressed during early embryonic stages and might have a function in development.\nIdentification of the complete set of neuropeptide genes in a simple animal model such as C. elegans allows for precise deciphering of their biological function in the context of the whole organism. The nematode has a simple nervous system of just 302 neurons yet this nervous system gives rise to a remarkably elaborate array of behaviors and environmental responses. Some of these have already been shown to involve neuropeptide-facilitated neurotransmission, such as social 'clumping' behavior. The powerful genetics tools (for example, RNAi, genetic knockouts and suppression analysis) available in C. elegans should now assist a comprehensive investigation of peptidergic synaptic signaling.\nThe work also demonstrates that a combinatorial approach to mining and extracting information from genome sequence databases can be more productive than using any single tool. Although algorithms and web-based search engines exist that will summon a plethora of individual bioinformatics tools to scrutinize genomic sequences, automated genome annotation is, most of the time, not that thorough and sometimes even erroneous. Manual inspection is therefore advisable and likely to yield highly relevant information.","Controlling how many cells make a fly\n© BioMed Central Ltd 2003\nPublished: 21 August 2003\nStudies in Drosophila have revealed the Forkhead-family transcription factor FOXO to be a crucial mediator of the branch of the insulin-signaling pathway that controls cell number.\nInsulin and IGF in mammals\n\"We know most of the biochemistry of the system from mammalian cell-culture experiments and knockout mice,\" explains Martin Jünger, a PhD student in Hafen's lab. Decades of experiments have shown that insulin regulates energy metabolism, and more recent results show that it plays a key role in embryonic  and post-embryonic  growth, as well as the determination of lifespan .\nStudies in mammalian cells have also shown that insulin negatively regulates FOXO (Forkhead box, subclass O) transcription factors, which in turn arrest the cell cycle and, in some types of cell, induce cell death. FOXO transcription factors therefore have a negative influence on growth, and their function is turned off by the insulin effector protein kinase B (PKB, which is also known as AKT ).\nThe worm and its dauer stage\nTerms for equivalent proteins in different species\nForkhead transcription factors\nThree different hFOXO proteins\nInsulin effector kinases, containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains\nPDK1 and PKB/AKT 1–3\nPDK1, Akt-1 and Akt-2\ndPDK1 and dPKB/dAktfs\nThe evidence that dauer formation is dependent on the transcription factor DAF-16 comes from genetic experiments showing that if the insulin-signaling pathway is mutated, C. elegans enters the dauer stage. But in a double mutant in which DAF-16 is also disabled, the worms develop as normal. The clear implication is that in normal animals the insulin pathway has its effects on dauer formation via negative regulation of DAF-16. \"But the link to growth [in worms] is not clear,\" says Hafen. \"Because this strange worm is built by a precisely fixed number of cells, there is no relation between body size and insulin signaling.\" This apparent difference in action threw into question the idea that the insulin pathway has a conserved role in worms and mammals.\nDrosophila and growth\nInto this arena of confusion comes Drosophila. The clearest indication of the way that insulin signaling affects this species comes from the so-called chico mutant. Wild-type Chico protein functions in the insulin-signaling pathway, and flies lacking it are small with delayed development. In many ways this is similar to the situation in mammals, where mutations in the insulin/IGF pathway affect growth and body size. The flies have fewer cells, and the cells they do have are smaller in size. \"This [growth] reduction is something that was never seen in C. elegans,\" says Hafen. \"So, before our recent work, the best concept was that the initial pathway was the same in all species, but the readout was different,\" leading to growth in mammals but preventing dauer formation in C. elegans.\nSorting out size and number\nOne part of the answer to this question – dealing with the size of each cell – came from a paper previously published in Science . This showed that cell size is controlled in Drosophila by the S6 kinase (dS6K), an enzyme that apparently acts downstream of dPDK1 and dPKB and is named for its effects on ribosomal protein S6. Mutating dS6K produces small flies that have the same number of cells as in the wild type but whose cells are small. The answer to the cell number question came from the paper by Jünger et al. , which initially set out to characterize the fly DAF-16 homolog and to assess both whether and how it fitted into the fly insulin-signaling pathway and also its growth-modulating capabilities.\nWhen the Zürich team produced dFOXO mutants they were initially surprised. The flies were viable and normal-sized; there was no apparent phenotype, other than that the flies were more susceptible to oxidative stress than were their wild-type cousins. Jünger and colleagues had anticipated that removing the presumed negative influence would cause the flies to grow bigger. At first, they questioned whether they really had mutated dFOXO, but the genetic and molecular evidence was compelling.\nAs a next step, Jünger started to test the mutants in a genetic background in which other aspects of the insulin pathway were compromised. In this case, a normal fly would produce fewer, smaller cells. But take dFOXO away and the flies have small cells, but almost the normal number. \"The reduced cell number [in insulin-pathway mutants] is rescued by the absence of the transcription factor, because [wild-type] dFOXO has a negative influence,\" he explains.\nJünger went on to show that dFOXO operates in part by up-regulating the gene for a binding protein called d4E-BP. With larger quantities of this binding protein produced, the translation-initiation factor eIF4E is effectively removed from the translation machinery, in turn inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis. This shows that insulin operates not only by regulating pre-existing 4E-BP protein via phosphorylation , but also by influencing the intracellular abundance of 4E-BP at the gene expression level.\n\"We have shown that d4E-BP is a relevant target [of the pathway],\" says Jünger, \"but we absolutely don't postulate that it is the only one. It's more like a 'proof-of-principle' experiment, showing that we can find physiologically relevant targets in our rather artificial cell culture system, where we stimulate Drosophila cultured cells with bovine insulin! But recent microarray studies (by Puig et al.  and Ramaswamy et al. ) suggest that FOXO proteins work by modulating the transcription of large sets of target genes.\"\nThe picture that emerges for Drosophila is that the insulin signaling pathway forks at PKB, with an S6K element controlling cell size, and a FOXO element taking charge of cell number (see Figure 1).\nAt the same time as the Jünger et al. paper  was published, two other groups were publishing findings that support the same idea. Robert Tjian and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, presented biochemical evidence that when insulin is applied, dFOXO is phosphorylated by dPKB, leading to it being retained in the cytoplasm and therefore not being capable of initiating transcription . His group reports that \"targeted expression of dFOXO in fly tissues regulates organ size by specifying cell number with no effect on cell size\". Moreover, they also found and validated d4E-BP as a target gene. This nicely complements the findings of Jünger et al. .\nOn top of this, Tjian's group had another striking result. \"We found that FOXO also regulates expression of the insulin receptor,\" says Tjian. \"This means that in the absence of insulin, FOXO is produced. This not only limits growth, but it also up-regulates sensitivity for insulin. The system is now primed to look for lower concentrations of insulin.\"\nA third study, by Jamie Kramer and colleagues at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada, presents a slightly different picture. Kramer et al.  agree with Jünger et al. and Tjian's group that dFOXO is the fly homolog of DAF-16 and hFOXO (see Table 1). But, in a key difference, Kramer et al. found that overexpression of dFOXO leads to reductions in both cell size and cell number. \"We have seen this effect in both the eye and the wing of Drosophila,\" says Kramer. He believes that this difference between his results and those of the other groups is most likely to arrive from his use of overexpression analysis whereas Jünger used loss-of-function techniques.\n\"A general problem,\" agrees Jünger, \"is that overexpression studies are prone to artefacts, because overexpressed proteins often start doing things which under normal, physiological protein concentrations they do not.\" Tjian agrees; \"If I got results from overexpression experiments that differ from loss-of-function work I would be inclined to trust the loss-of-function study,\" he says. At the same time, Tjian points out that his team's findings also came from overexpression studies. He is now keen to study the exact differences in method between his own and Kramer's work to see if this sheds light on the differences.\nCompleting the triangle\nFor Hafen, the new data complete the triangle. \"In the worm, fly and human, FOXO is [a] negative [regulator of growth],\" he says. \"Now the pictures do not look different at all. What we see is a great underlying evolutionary conservation of this pathway.\" In Hafen's view, this pathway governs one of the most fundamental controls that the ancestors of multicellular organisms had to evolve. \"Wild flies are not like our laboratory flies, fed on delicious food day in, day out. In nature animals often have too little food, so they have to evolve mechanisms to deal with the issue. They can't just run their metabolism at maximal speed, irrespective of whether there is food around or not; they have to find ways to adjust their metabolic rate and their speed of development according to the availability of nutrients.\"\nHe postulates that his group didn't see the full effect of the dFOXO mutants because the flies were growing in unnatural conditions: because the flies are fed the whole time, the insulin pathway is constantly activated. A constantly starving wild fly with a dFOXO mutation might have an impaired ability to limit its rate of growth to suit the nutrient availability.\nHafen likens the situation to driving a car when you know that the tank is running out of fuel. \"You don't go at hundred and forty kilometers an hour, you reduce speed to reduce fuel consumption,\" he comments. \"This is what animals had to learn to do during evolution – and they do it at least in part via the insulin-IGF pathway. The main goal of this pathway is to adjust growth rates, or the developmental program in the case of C. elegans, with respect to availability of food, and the mechanism is conserved right down to the level of the DAF-16 transcription factor.\"\nTjian is also excited by the findings. \"We are starting to get a better idea of how transcription factors affect organ size and how they are used to decide when to stop putting new cells into organs,\" he says. And understanding the role that FOXO plays in morphogenesis has far-reaching implications in both the laboratory and medical practice.\n- Jünger MA, Rintelen F, Stocker H, Wasserman JD, Végh M, Radimerski T, Greenberg ME, Hafen E: The Drosophila Forkhead transcription factor FOXO mediates the reduction in cell number associated with reduced insulin signaling.

{"question":"What are the differences in research methods between studying a wildflower and studying Trentepohlia algae?","answer":"When studying a wildflower, research involves gathering physical specimens, consulting botanical reference books like Flora of the British Isles, and using flower guides with illustrations for identification. The plant can be examined directly, taken apart, and viewed under microscope. For Trentepohlia algae, research focuses more on microscopic examination to observe specific features like filament diameter (10-20 µm in T. aurea), cell structure (lacking pyrenoids), and distinctive orange coloration from haematochrome pigment that masks the chlorophyll. While wildflowers can often be studied in the field, Trentepohlia requires more specialized laboratory analysis to identify species accurately.","context":["Researching a wildflower\nResearching a wildflower involves gathering information on the anatomy, distinguishing characteristics, family, and appearance of a plant. The first stage is to know about the plant you are illustrating. Feel free to use the English name, but do all research using the Latin or scientific name. This avoids confusion as some plants are called different names depending on where you are, even within countries. For more on scientific nomenclature, check out my earlier blogs, What’s in a name part 1 and part 2.\nResearching a wildflower: Botany\nMost of the flowers I illustrate are UK species. This allows me to consult the same reference books. I start by looking up botanical descriptions of the species in two books on British wild plants. These are Flora of the British Isles by Clapham, Tutin and Moore; and New Flora of the British Isles by Stace. I am also building up a collection of BSBI handbooks, all are excellent and help untangle tricky families of wildflowers. I only have 4 but there are 24 titles available. Be aware that if you are researching grasses or bryophytes you will need other identification bibles. For grasses this is Grasses of the British Isles by Cope and Gray (a BSBI Handbook) and Grasses by Hubbard. Mosses need Mosses & Liverworts of Britain and Ireland by the BBS and Atherton.\nBooks referred to to understand the botany of a species\nNavigating Botany reference books\nMany of these books are pretty academic and you need a good grasp of basic botanical terminology before they make much sense. Luckily they have glossaries in the back, and with time you get used to their somewhat dry presentation and will learn enough botanical terms for the text to make more sense. You will come across sentences which seemingly contradict themselves such as , “[stems] glabrous, or sparsely pubescent leaves….deeply lobed to…entire; phyllaries…ususaly glabrous to pubescent” (Stace p. 619) but over time you realise this just covers the enormous variation between individual plants of one species. Always remember this. Just as every human being is an individual member of one species, so too are plants individuals within the same species.\nPage on Cotoneasters from New Flora of the British Isles by Stace, one of my botany bibles\nBooks which have helped me learn my botany and which I often refer to are Understanding the Flowering Plants: A practical guide for botanical illustrations by Anne Bebbington. This is massively helpful in terms of explaining illustration techniques and some of the finer points of botany and nomenclature. I also love The Cambridge Glossary of Botanical Terms by Hickey and King and Common Families of Flowering Plants by Hickey & King, again because of the illustrated explanations of botanical terms.\nResearching a wildflower: Get the plant to draw!\nBy far the easiest way to correctly draw a plant is to draw it from life. You can examine it, take it apart, put it under the microscope, and compare it to other individuals of the same species. Colour matching is easy. You can choose a plant that shows the species-specific traits most clearly. I have a mental map of the area where I live and know where to go to find Meadow saxifrage, Petisites, the best Hawthorn berries, Moschatel, Brooklime, and any number of other common and less common wildflowers. Never dig a wildflower up by the roots, or if you have to then replant it as soon as possible, in the same place. Always ask the landowner before picking a flower. Extend the flower’s life by keeping it in a sealed and inflated plastic bag, sprinkled with water and kept in the fridge. Plunge a cut flower into water as soon as you can, after cutting a cm off the stalk base.\nPainting holly Ilex aquifolium from numerous specimens\nResearching a wildflower: Existing flower guides: Favourites\nI use lots of Flower guides for reference. These have images which are helpful, and written descriptions which I cross-check with information in the other botany books. I always look at The Wild Flowers of the British Isles by Garrard and Streeter. The illustrations are extremely good for the feel of the plant and colour reference, and although the book is out of print you can get copies secondhand.\nPages from The Wild Flowers of the British Isles along with some dried Pignut leaves slipped in between the pages.\nAnother book I always check is Collins British Wild Flower Guide by David Streeter. This can be an uncomfortable experience as I did a quarter of the plates, and live in fear of seeing illustrations that I got terribly wrong. I’ve been ok thus far. I press leaves from actual plants in the pages of Garrard and Collins because the books are large format meaning the pressed leaves don’t fall out all the time. In the Collins guide, I find the illustrations by Christina Hart-Davies incredibly useful and clear. I’m very lucky to count her as a friend, and if I am stuck for good reference I can drop her an email and she sends over scans from her sketchbooks.\nCollins British Wild Flower Guide a page on the left by Chris Hart-Davies, one on the right by yours truly\nResearching a wildflower: Existing flower guides: Others\nOther useful illustrated guides include the fold out charts by Field Studies Council (many of which I’ve illustrated, so again, this can feel a bit strange). Readers Digest guide to wild flowers is hit and miss but can have information and details in it that isn’t included elsewhere. The Wild Flower Key by Francis Rose is excellent although in my old edition the illustrations are reproduced rather small and a little blurry.\nI should also mention Keble Martin. His work is glorious in both knowledge and composition, but was reproduced in 1965 when image reproduction was not strong and the original plates have long since been dispersed. Someone once told me they saw a Keble Martin original and the lines were crisp and colours perfect, which is heart-breaking. In my Concise British Flora the illustrations are a little brown and blurred.\nAlthough correct in all aspects, I have never got on with the illustrations of Marjorie Blamey which are reproduced in many different guides to UK flora. They are not quite crisp enough to work from, but using them for identification seems to work fine. The copy I have sees them alongside the work of Fitter and Fitter in Collins Wild Flowers of Britain and Ireland. Also worth a mention is David Sutton’s Green Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain and Europe with illustrations by Emberson.\nAssortment of illustrated flower guides that I use for reference.\nThe best illustrated UK Flower guide is…\nHowever, the most important reference that I have by far is a complete set of Drawings of British Plants by Stella Ross-Craig. These are pen and ink drawings of most of the UK’s wildflowers, completed across her lifetime. (Not all trees are featured and there are no grasses, rushes and sedges). She produced them in 31 separate parts, family by family. Each plant gets an A5+ size plate to itself. Some of the parts are paperback, some are bound together in blue. The purchase of an index was a great moment for me, as was the day I finally completed my set. Yes, feel free to be jealous.\nTime after time she captures the precise feel of a plant’s growth habit. her attention to detail is exacting. The close ups are pertinent and I am an absolute disciple of her work. Interestingly, I often recognize her work in paintings by other illustrators, and I’m sure the same can be said for my pictures. If you can’t get your hands on the actual living specimen, get your hands on Stella Ross-Craig instead. I’m not alone in my passion, as this blog by the National Botanic Garden of Wales shows.\nTwo plates from Drawings of British Plants by Stella Ross-Craig\nUsing old illustrations\nAlong with recent books, it is worth looking up old (and in some cases centuries old) illustrations of plants in herbals and manuscripts. Many have been reproduced as coffee table books, but they are a prominent part of my reference library. Titles include the Clutius Botanical Watercolours by Claudia Swan, The Frampton Flora by Richard Mabey, various compilations of old botanical illustration plates, and Flowers of the Wayside and Meadow by J Lloyd Williams. Illuminated manuscripts, books of days, and psalters often have floral edges which are often ridiculously accurate.\nSome older reference books\nMy reference Library\nAll these reference books take up space, and that’s only the plants! My bookshelves in the studio have half of the top shelf full of my published work and the other space crammed with reference books, sketchbooks, and notebooks full of notes taken from online and in person courses I’ve attended. Things like ellipse guides, greetings cards, and old CDROMS of work also jostle for space.\nMy studio bookshelves. Horribly chaotic.\nI also keep my printed-out photos of visual reference (from my own archives and online sites). I process and keep them in an ever-expanding set of alphabetised folders.\nMy A – Z visual reference files\nEach time a new species needs drawing, I consult these folders along with my library of reference books and online resources. If it’s a new species, it’ll get a new sheet of A4, neatly labelled and popped into the right ring binder once the plant is painted.\nExamples of my pages of reference\nThere are a great many online botany sites, some more useful than others. As part of my research I make my way through a list of about 20, gathering images and taking written notes. A few of the best are Plant illustrations, Kew’s Plants of the World, Naturespot, and Wild flower finder.\nUsing my own reference\nI can’t remember what plants I have illustrated, taken photos of, or drawn in my sketchbooks. Every time I have a new job I’ll quickly flip through my sketchbooks, done between jobs and invaluable for reference. For more on why these are so helpful check out my blog.\nSeeing if I have already illustrated it is easier. I just search my picture files. So long as I’ve not mis spelt the name or got a hyphen in the wrong place, up come thumbnails of that plant.\nOwn illustrations: Image search for “Rowan”\nI do the same for my photo archive. So long as each photo is named correctly, I can get my hands on my own copyright free imagery within seconds. As long as I took a photo of the plant when it was growing in profusion under the studio window. Which, irritatingly, I do not always remember to do!\nSome of my own photo reference files\nHow to collate Reference\nI cross-reference written descriptions in flower guides with my botany books to pinpoint the distinguishing characteristics of a species. Sometimes the identification bibles disagree, which can be stressful. To speed up reference gathering, I have a research template which lists my main reference books. I use this to put down the right page number for each new species I’m working on.\nBlank research sheet\nI go through each title taking written notes, then add notes from my online sources. I also collate folders of images found on the internet and print these off. It is vital not to simply copy someone’s photo or illustration as this is copyright infringement, so working from a variety of visual references is really important,\nPage of my written notes on the Fool-s water-cress\nCollating reference: Examples\nThis photo shows how all of it looks as I work on a pencil rough.

Free-living species are mostly yellow to bright orange or red-brown in colour, due to the orange pigment, haematochrome (β-carotene), which usually hides the green of the chlorophyll. The genus is terrestrial, commonly on rocks, walls, tree bark and, especially in the tropics, on leaf surfaces. The haematochrome no doubt protects the alga's chlorophyll in these subaerial habitats. Trentepohlia is also a widespread photosynthetic symbiont (photobiont) in lichens.\nJohn, in John et al., (2002), based on recent work in Ireland by Rindi & Guiry (2002), recognises five British and Irish species and states that there are at least twelve known species in the genus. Van den Hoek et al. (1995) consider that there are about forty species, mostly tropical and subtropical. There is general agreement that the genus requires taxonomic revision. In Britain, the best known is T. aurea (L.) Martius, which forms conspicuous, bright orange, small cushions on rock faces and sometimes on tree trunks (especially Quercus (oak)). It is most common in wetter, western districts and in upland areas, and prefers lime-rich substrates.\nAs with other Trentepohlia species, T. aurea is filamentous, with both creeping and erect filaments. Creeping filaments produce gametangia; aerial filaments produce sporangia (neither illustrated here). T. aurea is recognised by its aerial filaments being 10-20 µm in diameter and in the filaments not being constricted at the cell junctions. The chloroplasts are small, discoid (in this species, ribbon-like in certain others) and lack pyrenoids. As seen below, the haematochrome makes the chloroplasts seem orange or brown under the microscope and they are hidden amongst the droplets of the haematochrome itself. Aerial filaments end with a capping cell. The cell walls are lamellate (layered).\nAlthough the best known, T. aurea is probably not the most common species in Britain. Trentepohlia is not uncommon on damp, sheltered walls, at least in west Scotland, and material photographed and collected at a Renfrewshire site (March 2002), on an old, mortared, sandstone wall on the edge of a wooded ravine, was found to differ from T. aurea in its significantly narrower, more tapering filaments.\nSuch material may well have been named as T. calamicola in the past, see the key in Pentecost (1984), but John's (op. cit.) revision of the genus provided more species to choose from. The Renfrewshire material keys out instead to T. abietina (Flotow) Hansgirg, and it matches very well the photographs on the accompanying CD-ROM and the photomicrographs and notes in Rindi & Guiry (op. cit.). Although T. abietina is said to be known in the British Isles only from scattered localities in Ireland, mostly on trees but also on limestone rocks within forested areas, it is also predicted to be widespread in the \"wetter westernmost areas of the British Isles\", i.e. including west Scotland. Further experience suggests that T. abietina is, indeed, frequent on tree trunks (sometimes as small and inconspicuous colonies) and on shaded rock faces in this area.\nT. calamicola, as now understood, is a greenish species, yellow only when dry, and seemingly rare, known for certain only in Ireland and Cornwall, though considered \"probably more widely distributed\".\nTrentepohlia is also a widespread photobiont in lichens, particularly in tropical crustose species. Friedl & Büdel (1996) list its presence in lichens of the orders Arthroniales, Gyalectales, 'Sphaeriales' and Ostropales. The large, crustose lichen genus Opegrapha ('scribble lichens') (Opegraphales) is one such genus in Britain with Trentepohlia symbionts. It is not clear which or how many Trentepohlia species occur as lichen symbionts - a \"Trentepohlia lichenicola\" has been described, but John (op. cit.) notes that at least two of the free-living species are known to occur as lichen photobionts. As with other lichen photobionts, algal morphology changes markedly within the lichen thallus, the typical filamentous structure being lost.\nSince fungal hyphae are often associated with free-living Trentepohlia colonies, perhaps the symbiosis can be viewed as varying levels of parasitism, though Opegrapha can occupy exposed habitats that would not be suitable for the alga alone.\nThe photomicrograph is of Trentepohlia within the lichen Opegrapha niveoatra (Borrer) Laundon, a species of nutrient-rich tree bark. It is intended to add a photograph of this lichen at a later date; another Trentepohlia-containing Opegrapha species is shown below.\nThe class Trentepohliophyceae differs from other green algae in the structure of the flagella (in the biflagellate gametes and in the quadriflagellate zoospores). Presence of polyhydroxyalcohols is also a distinctive character and the mode of cell division is distinctive. Van den Hoek et al. (1995) give a good outline account of these features.\nThe class contains the single order, the Trentepohliales, and four genera, including Trentepohlia. The related genera are Phycopeltis, Printzina and Cephaleuros, all of which grow mainly on leaves in the warmer and more humid parts of the world, though there are records of each from the British Isles. Cephaleuros species can be parasitic and they cause substantial economic damage to tropical crops (cocoa, tea, etc.)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:50477a4c-45b0-4895-ab38-29864488b243>","<urn:uuid:3e26befb-2355-41e8-ade1-6a280d4eb55a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Did the Union forces have more success with their railroad operations compared to the Confederates during the Atlanta campaign?","answer":"Yes, the Union forces had more success with their railroad operations. While the Confederates destroyed the railroad bridge at Chattahoochie when abandoning their positions, the Union's Sherman's Pioneers successfully rebuilt it, allowing locomotives to proceed south of the river and simplify army supply operations.

After detaching troops for essential garrisons and minor operations, Sherman assembled his nearly 100,000 men and in May 1864 began his invasion of Georgia from Chattanooga, Tennessee, where his forces spanned a line roughly 500 miles wide.\nSherman set his sights on the Confederacy’s last major industrial city in the West and General Joseph E. Johnston’s Army of Tennessee, which aimed to protect it. Atlanta’s use to the Confederacy lay in its terminus for three major railroad lines that traveled across the South: the Georgia Railroad, Macon and Western, and the Western & Atlantic. U.S. Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant knew this, sending Major General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Division of the Mississippi towards Atlanta, with specific instructions, “get into the country as far as you can, inflicting all the damage you can against the war revenues.” The city’s ability to send supplies to Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia made Atlanta all the more important.\nIn August 1864, Sherman moved his forces west across Atlanta and then south of it, positioning his men to cut off Atlanta’s supply lines and railroads. When the Confederate attempts to stop the maneuvering failed, the writing was on the wall. On September 1, 1864, Hood and the Army of Tennessee evacuated Atlanta and torched everything of military value. On September 3, 1864, Sherman famously telegrammed Lincoln, “Atlanta is ours and fairly won.” Two months later, so was Lincoln’s reelection.\nAfter the Atlanta campaign, Grant explained to Sherman that the Confederates must be “demoralized and left without hope,” and he instructed Sherman, “Take all provisions, forage and stock wanted for the use of your command. Such as cannot be consumed, destroy. Leave the valley so barren that crows flying over it...will have to carry their provender with them.” This strategy sought the total economic collapse of the South, as well as completely disabling the South’s capability of fielding armies. In addition to the wholesale plundering of Southern resources, including taking them from civilians, the Union reversed its policy of swapping prisoners, realizing it had a far bigger reserve of manpower than the South. The Atlanta Campaign was a perfect example of this, as both sides lost about the same number of casualties. By September 1864, however, Sherman still had about 80,000 men, while Hood’s army was reduced to about 30,000.\nThus, with his remaining forces, about 60,000 strong, Sherman decided to take the unprecedented step of cutting his own communication and supply lines and commencing a widespread march across Georgia, destroying Southern infrastructure and living off the land until his forces reached the coast and linked up with the Union navy. Aside from those plans, Sherman did not appoint a fixed time for his arrival, and the concept of the march greatly concerned the Lincoln Administration, since his men would virtually be on their own without any contact with the rest of the North as they marched straight through the heart of the Confederacy. Grant expressed his own concerns but eventually gave Sherman a simple go-ahead: \"Go as you propose.\"\nUltimately, Sherman’s armies cut a path of abject destruction 60 miles wide and 300 hundred miles long from Atlanta to Savannah, which some likened to a Biblical blight. And as Sherman had intended, he did indeed made Georgia “howl.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:39d6b3cf-f388-4708-810f-fcba07fd59e3>","<urn:uuid:22011264-bc4a-42fe-a1e7-a493cf1a2ef5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone studying emergency response protocols: When comparing deep chemical burns versus deep thermal burns from fire, what are the crucial differences in immediate first aid and when professional medical care becomes absolutely necessary?","answer":"For deep chemical burns, immediate decontamination is crucial - remove the person from exposure and carefully remove contaminated clothing. However, unlike superficial chemical burns, deep chemical burns should not be cooled with water. Professional medical care is necessary for chemical burns if there are signs of deep tissue damage, which may not be immediately apparent. For deep thermal burns, the area should be immediately covered with a clean cloth without cooling, and professional care is required if the burns are deep (showing darkened skin, burst blisters and crusts) or if they cover an area larger than the victim's palm. Both types require emergency care if they affect critical areas like face, neck, groin, hands and feet. Chemical burns may require additional specialized treatment like antidotes depending on the chemical involved, while thermal burns typically focus on preventing infection and managing tissue damage.","context":["Chemical Burns Overview\nA chemical burn is irritation and destruction of human tissue caused by exposure to a chemical, usually by direct contact with the chemical or its fumes. Chemical burns can occur in the home, at work or school, or as a result of accident or assault. Although few people in the United States die after contact with chemicals in the home, many substances common in both living and storage areas can do serious harm.\nMany chemical burns occur accidentally through misuse of products such as those for hair, skin, and nail care. Although injuries do occur at home, the risk of sustaining a chemical burn is much greater in the workplace, especially in businesses and manufacturing plants that use large quantities of chemicals.\nMost chemical burns are caused by either strong acids or strong bases (for example, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide). Acids damage and kill cells by coagulating cells while bases liquefy cells. Prolonged exposure can severely damage human tissues and, if the patient survives, leads to scarring and disability. Other chemicals like oxidants and certain metals may also produce similar chemical burns. Limiting the time of exposure to any of these chemicals can greatly reduce their damaging effects.\nUnfortunately, some chemical burn agents are designed to harm people (chemical agents used in wars and in terrorist attacks). It is not the scope of this article to cover these agents.\nChemical Burn Causes\nMost chemicals that cause burns are either strong acids or bases. A glance at the medical information on the labels of dangerous chemicals usually confirms the expected toxicity. Common sense precautions and consumer education can reduce the risk of injury. A variety of common household products that may cause chemical burns are as follows:\n- Concrete mix\n- Drain or toilet bowl cleaners\n- Metal cleaners\n- Pool chlorinators\nThis is just a sample list. Many other products used in the home and at work may contain some amount of chemicals that may cause burns. It is important to keep the labels on the containers in case of an exposure so the medical personnel can know what the patient has been exposed to.\nAll of these should only be stored in the appropriate containers to prevent accidental ingestion.\nChemical Burn Symptoms\nAll chemical burns should be considered potential medical emergencies.\nMost chemical burns occur on the face, eyes, hands, arms, and legs. Usually a chemical burn will be relatively small and will require only outpatient treatment. Chemical burns can be deceiving, however. Some agents can cause deep tissue damage that is not readily apparent when people first look at it.\n- Tissue damage from chemical burns depends on several factors.\n- The strength or concentration of the agent\n- The site of contact (eye, skin, mucous membrane)\n- Whether swallowed or inhaled\n- Whether or not skin is intact\n- With the quantity of the chemical\n- The duration of exposure\n- How the chemical works\n- The length of time to washing (decontamination)\n- Signs and symptoms of chemical burns include the following:\n- Redness, irritation, or burning at the site of contact\n- Pain or numbness at the site of contact\n- Formation of blisters or black dead skin at the contact site\n- Vision changes if the chemical gets into the eyes\n- Cough or shortness of breath\n- In severe cases, a person may develop any of the following symptoms:\nChemical burns can be very unpredictable. Death from a chemical injury, although rare, can occur.\nWhen to Seek Medical Care\nOnce all immediate danger has passed and the person has completed basic first aid (removed from the chemical source, contaminated clothing removed, and, if skin or eyes involved, extensive rinsing with water in most situations), a doctor, if immediately available, should review the injury and the chemical involved to make sure the patient needs no further emergency treatment. If a potential problem remains, the doctor can arrange appropriate treatment or will direct the patient to go to a hospital's Emergency Department.\nAny chemical burn can be a legitimate reason to summon emergency medical help if no doctor is immediately available. Always err on the side of safety and call 911 if the severity of the injury is unknown, if the medical stability of the person injured is not clear, or if there are any concerns about a chemical injury.\nEmergency personnel are trained to assess the extent of a chemical burn, begin treatment, and transport victims to the most appropriate hospital.\nEmergency officials also may determine the need for more involved decontamination of both the patient and the accident site prior to going to the hospital. It is possible that the patient needs further decontamination before arriving at the hospital. As much of the following information as possible needs to be related to the 911 dispatcher:\nNumber and location of the injured person or people\nMechanism or nature of injury (how it happened)\nWhether emergency personnel can reach the victims (are victims trapped?)\nName, strength, and volume or quantity of the chemical causing the burn (give a container or its label of the chemical to emergency personnel, if possible)\nLength of time of contact with the chemical\nChemical Burn Diagnosis\nIn the emergency department, a person can expect the following:\nInitial evaluation and stabilization\nRapid evaluation of the chemical's ability to damage tissue\nDetermination of the extent of injury\nBlood tests and other studies to determine if the patient should be admitted to the hospital\nDetermination of additional injuries and treatment\nChemical Burn Treatment\nMost people with minor chemical burns do not need to be admitted. Most can go home after arranging follow-up care with a doctor. Patients with major chemical burns however, need to be admitted to a hospital. Ingestion or inhalation of chemical burns may need to be admitted for observation, depending on the potential severity of tissue damage.\nChemical Burns Self-Care at Home\nBegin basic first aid. Immediately call 911 if a person has a severe injury, any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or other symptoms throughout the body. If you are aiding an injured person with these symptoms, lay the person down and immediately call 911. Protect yourself and make sure that you are not exposing yourself to the same chemical.\n- Remove yourself or the injured person from the accident or exposure area. Take appropriate care not to cause further injury to the patient.\n- Remove any contaminated clothing.\n- Wash the injured area to dilute or remove the substance, using large volumes of water. Wash for at least 20 minutes, taking care not to allow runoff to contact unaffected parts of anyone's body. Gently brush away any solid materials, again avoiding unaffected body surfaces.\n- Especially wash away any chemical in the eyes. Sometimes the best way to get large amounts of water to the eyes is to take a shower. If there is an eye wash station nearby (usually fond at work sites), follow the simple instructions to rinse out the eyes.\nChemical Burn Medical Treatment\nSpecific medical treatment depends on the chemical that the patient was exposed to. Some of the general steps taken to medically treat chemical burns are as follows:\nIV fluids may be needed to normalize blood pressure and heart rate as any type of burn (fire, chemical, sun exposure) often results in dehydration of the patient.\nThe IV access may also be used for any medications needed to treat pain or protect against infection.\nDecontamination will begin (likely water irrigation).\nSome people may be an antidote to counteract the chemical, if appropriate.\nAntibiotics often are not needed for minor chemical burns.\nWounds will be cleaned and bandaged with medicated creams and sterile wraps as needed.\nConsultation with other medical specialists may be done if indicated.\nPain in a burn can often be severe. Adequate pain control will be addressed by the doctor.\nIf there is any indication of breathing problems, a breathing tube may be placed in the patient's airway to help maintain the airway and provide adequate ventilation.\nChemical Burns Follow-up\nAfter leaving the emergency department, call the designated doctor within 24 hours to arrange follow-up care. Patient's should call sooner if any new problems or concerns arise.\nChemical Burns Prevention\nSecure all chemicals, in and out of the home, in locked cabinets or out of the reach of children.\nPeople should always follow directions and safety precautions on the label provided by the manufacturer when using any chemicals.\nWear safety gloves clothing and eye protection when using most chemicals, and remember - safety first!\nChemical Burns Prognosis\nMost chemical burns are minor and can be treated without causing long-term problems. Some burns, however, cause significant scarring or other medical complications. Some of the chemical burns that have a more guarded outlook are ingested and inhaled chemicals that may cause burns. These burns can lead to permanent disability or death.\nBurns in the eye can lead to blindness.","First aid: what to do with a burn before an ambulance arrives\nAbout how to not be confused in a difficult situation and what to do with a burn before the arrival of an ambulance, says the project leader “First Aid” TV channel “Doctor”, resuscitator Alexei Starkov.\nTake the classic for the summer period situation, when a person cooked meat on open fire , decided to speed up the process and splashed fluid for ignition, resulting in a severe burn of the hand. In this case, the degree of tissue damage often depends on how quickly relief is provided.\nFirst of all, you need to assess the depth of the lesion and burn. Superficial burns are red spots on the skin or blisters: whitish, tense. Deep burns are considered if the blisters are marked with bloody contents of red or brown color, if they become sluggish or burst and are baked by crusts.\nSurface burns must be cooled. For this purpose, ordinary running water is best. Its temperature should be about 20 ° C, and the cooling time should be about 15 minutes. The burned place needs to be put under water and thus to remove heat from the skin. Deep burns do not cool – immediately close with a clean cloth!\nFurther the superficial burn should be closed. Ideally for this use a sterile bandage, but it is obvious that in an emergency this is not always achievable. Any pure matter, for example, a T-shirt, will do.\nGently apply the cloth to the burn surface, trying not to cause additional injury. In order that the pure matter does not fall from the burn place, carefully fix it. The dressing should not be oppressive, so as not to provoke the opening of blisters – it is only needed to fix the tissue in place of the burn. In the event that the clothing is stuck to the wound, it is necessary to carefully cut it with scissors around the affected area, without tearing off the adherent fragment from the skin.\nWith burns, you can not:\n1. Prick the blisters: this immediately makes the wound infected.\n2. Apply a wet bandage to the wound : for some time it will really relieve the pain, but at the same time increase the risk of infection of the wound. The analgesic effect of this dressing will take less than a minute.\n3. Use the following substances:\n• vegetable oil – a film that forms fat, interferes with heat transfer. Thermal energy from the surface will pass inside, affecting the deep layers of the skin;\n• alcohol – alcohol dehydrates the skin, which will only worsen its condition;\n• urine – its anti-inflammatory properties have not been scientifically proven.\nThe victim should be immediately taken to the doctor if:\n- on the body there are deep burns (darkened skin, bursting blisters and crusts);\n- Burn blisters cover an area larger than the palm of the victim;\n- burns are affected by the shock zone on the body: face, neck, groin, hands and feet.\nSuch burns should be examined and treated only by specialists."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:21caa5c0-983c-43b0-82f1-b2b10b89c23e>","<urn:uuid:cfa55b3d-37b2-41b2-9a6f-7515d4a5caad>"],"error":null}

She realized that the PPE that was available was a prominent issue.\nWomen handling chemicals in their jobs, for instance, were at risk of exposing themselves to harmful substances because of the way their clothing was designed.\n“They’ll say things to me like, ‘Well, I just didn’t fit,'” Henry shared. “When I hear that and then I correlate it to their work wear. The men would even say they didn’t look like they fit.”\nAnother response she said she often received was, “‘We are tired of this ‘pink it and shrink it.’ We want work wear that fits.'”\nWomen were represented in a smaller margin of employment in STEM occupations, according to a 2016 chart by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Women hold about 14 percent of architecture and engineering jobs, and just 9 percent of construction jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n“SeeHerWork’s mission is about saving lives and attracting and retaining in these very lucrative, equal-pay careers that go with massive labor shortages every year,” Henry said.\nThe company sells products such as leather gloves, high visibility long-sleeved shirts, vests, backpacks, safety glasses and undergarments such as bras.\nThis inclusive line also provides items for men, who also range in size.\n“You’re already trying to prove yourself as a female in a male-dominated career,” Vivi Rodriguez, a firefighter and paramedic, told GMA. “And it’s really hard when what you’re complaining about is that your pants don’t fit or your gloves don’t fit.”\nRodriguez said that when she wears clothing from SeeHerWork, she doesn’t have to worry about “a glove falling off during overhaul or my clothing being see-through because I’m sweating.”\n“I’m able to focus on the job that I’m trying to do.”\nPaving the way for the next generation\nSome encouraging words other women gave Henry within these focus groups were:\n“‘We cannot wait for this gear to come out so we can perform,” she said they have told her. “We can pull up the next level, the next generation that’s going to come in behind us.'”\nCopyright © 2019, ABC Radio.
