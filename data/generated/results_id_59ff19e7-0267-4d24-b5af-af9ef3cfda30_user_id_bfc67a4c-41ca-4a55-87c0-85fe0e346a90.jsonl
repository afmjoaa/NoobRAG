{"question":"What specific improvements in potato quality and safety are being pursued through research, and how do these relate to current farming yields in different countries?","answer":"Research is pursuing multiple quality improvements, including reduced bruising through silencing polyphenol oxidase, and lower levels of reducing sugars and asparagine to decrease acrylamide formation during high-temperature cooking. These improvements are particularly important given the current yield gaps - Kenya's average yield is only 10 tonnes per hectare compared to 40 tonnes in Egypt and South Africa. The new genetic modifications being developed aim to combine improved disease resistance with better tuber quality, while potentially reducing acrylamide formation by up to 90% when cooked at high temperatures. Current yields are significantly impacted by poor seed quality and disease, with only 2% of Kenyan farmers using certified seeds compared to 99% in the Netherlands.","context":["- Development & Aid\n- Economy & Trade\n- Human Rights\n- Global Governance\n- Civil Society\nThursday, February 22, 2024\nWorld Food Day is celebrated on October 16, 2022, with the theme Leave NO ONE behind. During this week IPS will look at features that showcase better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life.\nNairobi, Oct 11 2022 (IPS) - Until a few years ago, Kenyan potato farmer Richard Mbaria used to harvest just four tonnes of the crop from an acre of land thanks to poor quality seeds, combined with an attack on the crop by pests and diseases.\nThe middle-aged farmer would select seeds from his previous harvest, picking the smallest tubers that could not fetch good prices in the market. This was the practice every other smallholder farmer in his Kapsita village in Elburgon, Nakuru County in Kenya’s Rift Valley region and beyond would do too. The reason is that many rarely afford certified seeds, and those who could were unaware of the importance of using approved seeds.\n“That was then and today, but today I get an average of nearly 8 tonnes of the produce from an acre of land and want to improve the harvests to 10 to 12 tonnes from the same land in the near future,” Mbaria proudly discloses.\nThe father of four did not transform his farming miraculously. He has been trained in better management of crops and also on the selection and preservation of healthy planting seeds, which he is now selling to local farmers.\nEven more radical transformation has happened to his farming. He’s now on the journey to becoming qualified to produce certified tissue culture planting material, thanks to the training he has received from Egerton University’s Enhancing Access to High Quality Seed Potato for Improved Productivity and Income of Smallholder Farmers in Nakuru County (HQSPIPI), implemented under the Community Action Research Programme (CARP+).\nTissue culture is the cultivation of plant tissues or organs in specially formulated nutrient solution in a lab or a controlled environment using mainly sprouts or tissue-like leaves, which are grown in a medium with nutrients and disease-killing chemicals. This way, an entire plant is regenerated from a single tissue.\nThis is done in a controlled environment – usually in a lab or a greenhouse to produce plantlets, also known as apical root cuttings and mini tubers (tiny-sized potato seeds), but which are clean and free of disease, explains Professor Anthony Kibe, Associate Professor of Agronomy at Egerton University.\nWhen transplanted in the field, the result is seed potatoes which can be sold to farmers for high productivity and at relatively affordable prices.\nThe resulting plantlet or its small tubers at the bottom of the roots can be transplanted in the fields. The crop is usually high-yield and also free of disease when properly managed.\n“Tissue culture (also known as in vitro culture) offers an excellent way for the rapid propagation of seed potato offering high yielding disease-free planting material using hydroponics or aeroponics technologies,” says Kibe.\nThe technique, he says, is critical in the production of disease-free and high-yielding fruits and vegetables and is widely used in bananas in East Africa. In potatoes, it is mainly practiced by large commercial farms, seed companies, and government research institutions due to the costs and complexity for an ordinary farmer.\nThe implication is that certified seeds are relatively expensive and out of reach of most of the nearly 1 million smallholder farmers engaged in potato farming in Kenya.\nThe programme is one of the activities under Transforming African Agricultural Universities to meaningfully contribute to Africa’s growth and development (TAGDev), an initiative by Uganda-based Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM), in partnership with the MasterCard Foundation.\nOne of its aims is to train farmers to plant quality seeds, test their soils, effectively manage diseases and pests, among others, for increased productivity, and organize them in marketing cooperatives for higher incomes, explains Kibe.\n“About ten years ago, the average yield for potatoes per hectare in Kenya was 22.5 tonnes; today, it has dropped to around seven tonnes a hectare due to, among others, the transmission of diseases through seeds,” he adds.\nIt is a concern that his farmers’ outreach project has been addressing by offering free advice, addressing the major constraints to the production of the critical food crop.\n“One way of addressing the problem is by training a number of farmers to become producers of disease-free seeds for sale to their colleagues for increased yields and higher income,” he says. Sadly, he notes, only about 2% of Kenyan farmers who grow potatoes use certified seeds, compromising yields.\n“This is in stark contrast with leading world producers such as the Netherlands producer, where 99% of farmers use certified seeds,” Kibe explains.\nIn Kenya, average yields are around 10 tonnes per hectare, while the crop’s potential is as high as 30 tonnes for the size. The lack of quality disease-free seeds of improved varieties is a major cause of this yield gap. This is in contrast to countries like Egypt and South Africa, where yields stand at 40 tonnes per hectare, he told IPS.\n“The planting material many farmers use each season for a new crop is produced, stored, and traded by farmers without regulation,” says Kibe.\nFarmers select the seeds from their previous harvest. Part of the challenge is that only a few privately-owned farms and a handful of state-owned seed enterprises produce certified seed potatoes.\nWhere new varieties have been produced and propagated under the technology, yields have been as high as 30 tons per hectare.\nPotato, he notes, has been a low-priority food crop in Kenya’s research agricultural research system, despite its importance as a staple food and its potential contribution to the country’s food security.\nUnder his project, nearly 5,000 farmers have been reached and trained on good husbandry for higher yields since 2017.\nOf the three roles bestowed on universities – teaching, research, and outreach, the latter has been the least applied, with universities doing research with the expectation that the extension arms in government would do the knowledge transfer, says Anthony Egeru, who heads TAGDeV project at RUFORUM.\n“However, the universities need to have visibility and prove relevant to communities in which they operate and assert their roles as facilitators of development,” he says.\nUnder the initiative, farmers such as Mbaria are reached by the universities and benefit from the knowledge in their possession, which largely remains stored in journal publications. On their side, universities fulfill their obligation of giving back to society.\nWhile hydroponics is a technology out of reach of many growers, it is essential for the fast multiplication of seeds, according to Michael Cherutich, a potato expert at Kenya’s Agriculture Development Corporation.\nThe seed producers, including the state corporation, can hardly meet the demand for certified seeds. One way of ensuring affordability has many seed producers in the villages in potato farming areas.\nIPS UN Bureau Report\nThis story includes downloadable print-quality images -- Copyright IPS, to be used exclusively with this story.\nIPS is an international communication institution with a global news agency at its core,raising the voices of the South\nand civil society on issues of development, globalisation, human rights and the environment\nCopyright © 2024 IPS-Inter Press Service.

A further ten per cent will be provided by the industrial partners in the project: BioPotatoes UK Ltd and Simplot, based in the US. If the project is successful, both companies will invest in taking the potato through the process of regulatory approval and to market in the US and Europe.\nThe project, which takes a GM approach, aims to combine the benefits of ground-breaking research from TSL, The University of Leeds and Simplot in one Maris Piper potato that will be resistant to late potato blight and potato cyst nematodes. It will also contain much lower than normal levels of reducing sugars and asparagine – naturally occurring chemicals in many starchy foods that form acrylamide when cooked at high temperatures. In addition, by silencing a polyphenol oxidase, it will be less prone to bruise damage, which will reduce food waste caused by discarding bruised tubers.\nEvery year 120,000 hectares of UK land are devoted to growing this important staple food, but producers and processors face huge challenges getting potatoes to our plates.\n- Late potato blight costs UK potato farmers an average of £55 million per year in losses and costs of controls.\n- Potato cyst nematodes are increasingly hard to control. They cause up to £26 million a year in losses. Two out of five possible pesticides used to control them have already been withdrawn from use by the EU. The other three are under review by the EU and if they became unavailable, losses would increase to £55 million, leaving little or no control of this serious pest which can wipe out an entire crop.\n- Bruising costs GB potato farmers £26 million each year and causes significant wastage in the supply chain and in the home.\nProfessor Jones aims to begin work this autumn introducing three genes which confer resistance to late potato blight, two genes that confer resistance to nematodes and a further three genes which switch off the production of asparagine and reducing sugars and polyphenol oxidase, into a Maris Piper potato.\nProfessor Jones said:\n“We’re still some years away from our final crop. It would need to go through all the necessary approval processes. If it passes those tests and if it is approved for planting, this potato could prevent many tonnes of pesticides and fungicides being sprayed on our land, increase yields and make a healthier crisp or chip.”\nThe TSL Potato Partnership Project is a public-private partnership. It combines scientific expertise from The Sainsbury Laboratory and the University of Leeds with commercial expertise from BioPotatoes UK Ltd, a small British company which aims to commercialise this technology in the UK to benefit UK farmers and consumers, and Simplot, a global agribusiness company that recently received US regulatory approval for its first generation Innate™ potato.\nQuestions and Answers\nWhy do we need a potato with all these traits?\nThis potato will address three distinct factors which affect successful potato cultivation by UK and international growers. Substantial losses can be caused by nematode pests and by late blight disease, caused by a fungus-like organism which was responsible for the Irish potato famine.\nAdditionally, potato tubers are subject to bruising and deterioration during storage, causing elevated levels of naturally occurring reducing sugars and a substance called asparagine. Asparagine and reducing sugars when cooked at high temperatures – for example, frying or baking – cause the formation of acrylamide. Acrylamide is a chemical which occurs naturally in starchy foods when cooked at high temperatures and has been linked to cancer.\nEating a healthy balanced diet and minimising acrylamide formation in food, for example, by lightly toasting bread and frying chips to light golden colour is encouraged.\nThe European Food Safety Authority says that although studies on human subjects have provided limited and inconsistent evidence of increased risk of developing cancer from acrylamide in food, studies on laboratory animals have shown that exposure to acrylamide through diet greatly increased the likelihood of developing gene mutations and tumours in various organs. Based on these animal studies, EFSA’s experts agree with previous evaluations that acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups, and that reducing exposure is desirable.\nThese challenges can be addressed, in part, by adding the right genes to the repertoire of genes that potatoes already carry.\nHas the project been funded?\nYes. The Horticulture and Potato Initiative has now announced the funding. The project is due to start in the autumn.\nWho are your partners on the project and what will each of them contribute?\nThe project comprises a partnership between TSL, University of Leeds, Simplot and BioPotatoes UK Ltd. The industrial partners will between them contribute 10% towards the costs of the project. TSL will contribute expertise in blight resistance and Leeds will contribute expertise in potato cyst nematodes. Simplot will contribute its expertise in tuber quality improvement and share relevant technologies to help the project deliver its aims.\nHow much will the project cost?\nThis project will cost approximately £900k over five years.\nHow many genes are you putting into the potato and how will they work?\nThe aim is to put in three different genes for potato late blight resistance, and two genes that confer enhanced tolerance of PCN. We will also put in two genes that between them silence (specifically in the tuber) three different genes (for polyphenol oxidase, invertase, and asparagine synthetase). We will also use a gene from tomato to help us select for potato cells, tissue and plants that have received the intended genes in the laboratory.\nAren’t there already blight resistant potato varieties available?\nPotato varieties have been bred with late blight resistance, but these do not find widespread favour in the current market, and may also be susceptible to nematodes. When farmers choose which potato variety to plant, and when processors or supermarkets choose which varieties to source, they take many different factors into account, not just blight resistance. The main varieties favoured by the market, such as Maris Piper in the UK and Agria in the rest of Europe, are potatoes that meet market requirements. The approach in this project is to use the GM method to introduce genes that will improve already-popular varieties. A different and perfectly reasonable approach taken by others is to try to breed new blight resistant varieties that meet market requirements. There is no reason why these approaches cannot co-exist.\nCan you describe the different stages of the project before the potato is available?\nFirst, scientists have to construct the combinations of DNA sequences that will be introduced into plant cells of the variety Maris Piper.\nThey will then have to conduct the gene introduction, and select plantlets that carry the introduced genes.\nThey will examine many independent lines to see whether each has received the DNA of interest, and confirm whether those which have received a single copy of each gene of interest, are expressing the genes appropriately in those lines.\nOnce such lines have been identified in the lab, they will be ready to test in the field to ensure they retain all the characteristics that make Maris Piper a favoured variety.\nWhen a suitable line has been identified during field trials, scientists will start to accumulate data that can used to prepare a dossier for submission to the independent regulatory authorities to show the new variety is productive, has the intended additional properties and no other(s), and is safe for human consumption. This will probably require additional funding and be undertaken starting at the earliest 3 years after the beginning of the project.\nYou have already developed a potato with resistance to late blight using a resistance gene. Does this single gene no longer work?\nAbsolutely not. The first gene cloned is extremely useful, and we wish to use it wisely to retain its usefulness as long as possible; this requires that it only be commercially deployed in combination with additional resistance genes. Like antibiotics, if one relies entirely on only one mode of action, the pathogen can evolve to evade that action. Therefore, if one can deploy multiple resistance genes with multiple modes of action at the same time, evolution of the pathogen to simultaneously overcome these multiple modes of action will be slower, and so the durability of each mode of action is safeguarded.\nHow long will it be before these potatoes are available?\nRealistically, 8-10 years at the earliest.\nWhat is the potential return on tax-payers’ money?\nThe effect of the Irish potato famine shows how serious potato diseases are for food security. We will need new, safe, disease-resistant and pest-resistant crops if we are to feed an increasing global population and to support the farming industry. Food and farming in the UK is a major manufacturing sector and the largest employer; potatoes are a key part of that industry. Furthermore, European regulations have led to tighter restrictions on use of agrochemicals, which increase the urgency for alternative solutions.\nLate potato blight costs UK potato farmers an average of £55 million per year in losses and costs of controls. Potato cyst nematodes are increasingly hard to control. They cause up to £26 million a year in losses. Two out of five possible pesticides used to control them have already been withdrawn from use by the EU. The other three are under review by the EU and if they became unavailable, losses would increase to £55 million, leaving little or no control of this serious pest which can wipe out an entire crop. Bruising costs GB potato farmers £26 million each year and causes significant wastage in the supply chain and in the home.\nThe previous funded work has revealed great insights into blight resistance, has developed new technologies to accelerate cloning of resistance genes, and has trained some outstanding early-career researchers. Many of these advances will benefit the wider bio-economy and not just the UK potato industry. Furthermore, this has added to the control options available which support integrated pest management and provide the potential to safeguard the effectiveness of existing control measures such as fungicides used to control late blight. This project will enable us to bring the results of these discoveries to market.\nHow will the potato benefit the environment?\nThe carbon footprint of potatoes in the UK today includes the extensive use of agrichemicals to control blight and nematodes, and emissions from regular tractor use. This project will enable reductions in both. Furthermore, the project will reduce food waste that arises when tubers are discarded or rejected in the supply chain or at home.\nHow is the potato good for consumer health?\nPotatoes are an important source of fibre, carbohydrates, vitamins and nutrients in our diet.\nWhen baked or fried at high temperatures, potatoes, like other starchy foods can form acrylamide. This is not a new element in the diet; humans have probably been exposed to acrylamide in small doses since they first started cooking starchy foods.\nThe European Food Safety Authority says that although studies on human subjects have provided limited and inconsistent evidence of increased risk of developing cancer from acrylamide in food, studies on laboratory animals have shown that exposure to acrylamide through the diet greatly increased the likelihood of developing gene mutations and tumours in various organs. Based on these animal studies, EFSA’s experts agree with previous evaluations that acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups.\nEating a healthy balanced diet and minimising acrylamide formation in food, for example, lightly toasting bread and frying chips until they are a light golden colour is encouraged.\nSimplot’s Innate (TM) technology, which will be used in the development of the new potato at TSL, could reduce acrylamide formation in that potato, when cooked at high temperatures, by up to 90%.\nWill the potato be safe to eat?\nYes. Many of the aspects of this technology exist in other edible crops. There is no reason to anticipate it might be unsafe to eat, but to ensure this, extensive food safety testing will be undertaken before it will permitted to be brought to market.\nIs the GM technology that is being used safe to use in developing food for human consumption?\nMany independent studies and reports have come to the conclusion that GM food is as safe as conventionally produced food.\nHow will the potato reduce wastage?\nThe project will reduce food waste that arises when tubers are discarded or rejected due to bruising or too high levels of reducing sugars and free asparagine. This will increase the number of potatoes reaching consumers and should thus have the benefit of making more food available from the same land and reduce the overall cost of food production.\nWill you be holding field trials of the potato, and if so, where and when?\nWe will conduct field trials in Norwich in a confined area protected by a secure fence which has been used before for trials of this type. The earliest time when we might begin trials is Spring 2016. The trials will continue for five years. If the work succeeds in producing a potato line that carries all the desired and intended characteristics, and no adverse side effects, further funding will be sought to generate data to make the case for submission to regulatory authorities for commercialisation.\nHow will you make sure that your potato plants don’t cross-pollinate with other plants in the environment?\nBecause potatoes are propagated as tubers, their seed is never a source of cultivated potato plants. During the field trial phase, they will not be grown near any other potatoes.\nIs there a risk of gene transfer to other plants during field trials and if the plants are commercially grown?\nBecause potatoes are propagated as tubers, their seed is never a source of cultivated potato plants. During the field trial phase, they will not be grown near any other potatoes. Trials have to go through numerous regulatory checks at an UK and EU level and this is one of the factors taken into consideration before commercial crops are licenced.\nHow do you know the trial will be safe?\nRigorous regulations govern the planting of GM crops in the UK. The Government’s independent group, ACRE (the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment), will be assessing the application for permission to conduct the trial."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8789bd57-cb53-437d-a729-fcb6e75416cc>","<urn:uuid:2f371883-6f6c-4e42-a59b-28b18f8dd34c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you please explain what activities and natural attractions are available at Greenbelt Park throughout the different seasons?","answer":"Greenbelt Park offers various activities and natural attractions year-round. The park features four nature trails: the 1.1-mile Azalea Trail connecting picnic areas, the 5.3-mile Perimeter Trail for hiking and horseback riding, the 1.4-mile Dogwood Trail with self-guiding brochures, and the 1-mile Blueberry Trail. Wildlife viewing includes deer, squirrels, red foxes, blue jays, and cardinals.

Many visitors aren't aware that the NPS has an attractive campground just 13 miles from the White House in Greenbelt Park.\nLocated northeast of downtown Washington, near the intersection of the Capital Beltway (I-495 / I-95) and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, is an 1100-acre oasis named Greenbelt Park. The heavily wooded area includes hiking trails, picnic areas, and yes, a 174-site campground that the park says has never filled during the off-season, and rarely during peak travel months.\nHow can that be? Part of the answer may be the area's rather steamy summer climate, but the park website includes another :\nQ: Why haven’t I heard about Greenbelt Park or the Greenbelt Park campground?\nA: Since we are a federal government agency, we cannot spend taxpayer dollars on advertisements. We rely on word of mouth, Internet, and campground directories. We are a hidden jewel of the National Park Service.\nGreenbelt Park represents one of the earliest NPS ventures into urban sites.\nIn the 1930s Greenbelt, Md., became the first planned community in the United States built as a federal venture in housing. From the beginning it was designed as a complete city, with businesses, schools, and facilities for recreation. In 1950 the National Park Service established Greenbelt Park and acquired land for the establishment of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. The parkway, which opened in 1954, was created to provide an uninterrupted scenic route for passenger vehicles between the two cities.\nThe current campground dates to the Mission 66 era, and is open year round. The area\naccommodates tents, recreational vehicles, and trailers up to 36 feet long. Restrooms, showers, picnic tables, water, and grills are provided. There are no utility connections, but a disposal station is available. Camping is limited to 14 days per year\nCampsites are first-come, first-served, but reservations are available Memorial Day through Labor Day. See the park website for information on fees and reservations and campground regulations. Washington, D.C., is a popular destination for scout groups, and the park eventually concluded that the needs of those groups and other campers were best served by designating one loop in the campground exclusively for scouts. See the park website for details and special requirements for use of the Scout Loop.\nIn addition to camping, the park has four attractive nature trails:\n• Azalea Trail (1.1 miles) This trail connects the three picnic areas and passes through plant communities that grow along streams and on hillsides.\n• Perimeter Trail (5.3 miles) This trail is popular for hiking and horseback riding. It circles the park’s western section and leads to some of the most beautiful scenery in the area. Note: Horses are not available for rent in the park.\n• Dogwood Trail (1.4 miles) Start at the parking area on Park Central Road. Self-guiding brochures tell about the ecology, early land use, and nature’s recovery found along this trail.\n• Blueberry Trail (1 mile) This trail begins just beyond the campground entrance and traverses a section of abandoned farmland, mature forest, marsh, and stream bottom.\nThere are also three picnic areas in the park. Holly and Laurel may be reserved in advance; Sweetgum is available first-come, first-served. Each picnic area has restrooms, water, picnic tables, and grills (only charcoal fires are permitted).\nUnless you're one of the handful of humans who can efficiently decode the mystery of Washington's one-way streets, traffic circles and other navigational black holes, I'd suggest you combine a stay at Greenbelt Park with use of the area's Metro system of trains and buses.\nThe Greenbelt Metro Station, located less than two miles from the park, has a five-story parking garage which is usually more convenient—and less expensive—than parking options in the center of the city. If you're driving an RV, be sure to note special information on the park's FAQ page concerning large vehicle parking near the metro station. Driving directions to the nearest Metro station are also available at the park office.\nGreenbelt Park provides a nice respite from the crowds and urban landscape of the city. Even if you don't use the campground, a brief visit and a stroll on a park trail can help regain your equilibrium during a visit to Washington.\nDeer, squirrels, and red foxes make their home at Greenbelt Park, as do blue jays, cardinals, and other birds. In spring displays of flowering dogwood, laurel, and azalea catch the eye. In summer visitors strolling along the park’s trails are surrounded by wildflowers or ferns lining deep-cut streams. The colors of changing leaves in autumn are as vivid as can be found anywhere in the region. In winter a new world opens up. Crisp days and sunlight filtering through bare tree branches provide an invigorating atmosphere for observing nature.\nCamping during a visit to Washington, D.C?

{"question":"How should one approach vertical gardening in a limited space, and what soil preparation is essential for successful plant growth?","answer":"In small gardens, vertical integration can be achieved using tall structures like arbors, lattices, or sculptures to bring height and intimacy. Climbing roses, flowering vines, and annuals like scarlet runner beans or sweet peas can enhance the garden without taking up ground space. Even creative solutions like old ladders, bamboo teepees, or rusted rebar can serve as climbing structures. For the soil preparation aspect, it's essential to ensure the soil is loose and nutrient-rich. The soil should be loosened to a depth of at least 12 inches for most plants, and up to 2 feet for trees and larger specimens. After loosening, several inches of compost or fine bark should be added to keep it loose and workable. The soil should also have a good balance of macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients, and should drain freely.","context":["Cultivating small spaces\nby AMY STEWART\nSEVERAL MONTHS AGO, A READER asked me for some suggestions about gardening in small spaces. I told him I'd answer him in a future column. It's taken me a while to get around to it, but perhaps the delay was worthwhile. Fall is the perfect time to redesign a garden, whether it's large or small. You can move plants around this time of year, make divisions, and take cuttings, then let the rainy winter weather give the garden the deep soaking it needs to get reestablished. So here are my suggestions for creating something extraordinary in a small space.\nThink Big. Don't assume that having a small garden means that you should fill it with small plants. Skip the pansies, primroses, and impatiens. These flowers only grow to about 6 inches tall and will yield a miniature garden, the sort of thing you stand over and look down upon. Remember that a garden is more than a patch of dirt to be filled -- a garden includes the airspace above that patch of dirt. Go for tall plants that will make a statement.\nI particularly like Verbena bonariensis, a tall purple verbena with stiff, narrow stems and clusters of deep purple flowers. It's a striking, architectural plant that is light and airy, so it won't conceal what's behind it the way a large shrub might. It also attracts butterflies and is easy to propagate.\nA friend of mine planted an enormous salvia, S. gesneriiflora \"Tequila\" in her small patio garden. It grows to over 6 feet tall, sports deep red trumpet-shaped blossoms almost year-round, and is a magnet for hummingbirds. Choosing one large, striking plant to dominate a small space works well -- as long as it's a plant that you genuinely love.\nI've also seen small spaces filled with sunflowers and hollyhocks. One disadvantage to this planting scheme is that it peaks in summer and dies off in winter. But if your goal is a brilliant summer display, go for enormous sunflowers like \"Giant Greystripe,\" or maybe the perennial Maximilian sunflower and hollyhocks in shades of deep red and purple. It'll knock your socks off.\nStriking Color Combinations. One drawback to a small space is that you do have to make some choices -- there just isn't room to plant everything. A carefully chosen color scheme can really make an impact in a small space. Also, the color of the foliage matters more than it might in a larger garden, where the eye has more to take in. Consider silver foliage -- artemesia, lavender, or artichokes -- with deep purple flowers. Or try chartreuse foliage -- helichrysum \"Limelight,\" breath of heaven, or geranium \"Ann Folkard\" -- with magenta flowers. Bronze foliage such as canna, some of the heucheras, and some of the ornamental grasses look great with orange flowers. These color schemes are too limited to carry out on a large scale, but they can look great around a patio or a narrow planting strip.\nVertical Integration. Use tall structures like an arbor, a lattice, or a sculpture to bring height and intimacy to a small garden. Climbing roses, flowering vines and annuals like scarlet runner beans or sweet peas can enhance a small garden without taking up too much space on the ground, as long as they're given something to climb. And it doesn't have to be expensive--I've seen an old ladder, a bamboo teepee and even rusted rebar fashioned into a structure for plants to climb.\nForm Over Function. Small gardens are a great place to try out a formal garden, the sort of thing that would be too much labor on a grander scale. Plant in stripes, squares, triangles, or Celtic knots. Get a book on formal European gardens and find just one bed that you can replicate. Consider a formal herb garden edged in lamb's ears and filled with tidy rows of sage, thyme, chives and parsley. Add tulips and fall crocuses at neatly spaced intervals between the plants so you'll have some variety in spring and fall.\nGo Natural. Even a small garden can be a haven for birds and butterflies. I particularly like Noël Kingsbury's book Natural Gardening in Small Spaces; it's packed with ideas for creating meadows, bogs and habitats of all kinds. Although his idea of a small space is a little different from mine, most of his designs can be replicated on a tiny scale. He includes a great section on establishing a meadow, which is never easy in a large area where weeds and existing grasses can out-compete wildflowers. But on a smaller scale, it's easier to keep on top of weeds during the first few years while native grasses and flowers take over. Also, if you're after something low-maintenance, a water-wise perennial garden of California natives like ceanothus, Cleveland sage and mimulus works well on any scale.\nDirt, Dirt and More Dirt. The best thing you can do to get a small garden off to a good start is to improve the soil. Patio gardens and sidewalk strips may be filled with topsoil that was brought in when your home was built. That kind of soil is not likely to be high in nutrients, and if you're packing a large number of plants into a small space, you'll need good soil to help the garden reach its potential. Dig out the first foot or two of soil and mix it well with the best compost you can buy. Add another thick layer at the base of your plants each fall. And encourage your plants to grow together to form a canopy that covers the soil, which will help preserve moisture and prevent runoff.\nMake It Count. There's no room in a small garden for runners-up, for plants you merely tolerate. Everything counts -- every leaf and flower should move you. So above all, plant what you love.\ngarden-related announcements and news to Amy Stewart.\n© Copyright 2003, North Coast Journal, Inc.","Poor soil grows poor plants. Unless you drew the lucky card and have a garden full of black gold, you’ll need to know how to improve soil. Improving garden soil is an ongoing process as the plants leach nutrients, leaving the soil inadequate for their needs. Whether your soil is nutrient deficient, compacted, heavy clay or any other issue, here’s a little soil amendment info to get you started.\nSoil Amendment Info\nSoil amendment can be as simple as mixing in leaf litter or it can be as complicated as running drainage pipes. The condition of your soil needs to be adequate for sustaining plant needs. Compact or hard soils are actually great for starting a lawn, as long as you add a little sandy topsoil if starting from seed. Plants like fruits and vegetables, however, need loose, nutrient rich soil with plenty of organic amendments added every year. There is no rule on the best soil for gardens, but there are some basic guidelines and some easy fixes.\nHow to Improve Soil\nIn most cases, the need for amending soil arises from having poor, compacted soil or nutrient deficient soil. Here are some general tips on improving your soil:\nPoor, Compacted Soil\nDense, hard soil may be the result of construction or simply little ones running across it constantly in play. The depth of compaction is important to know how to deal with it. If you have very deep, hard areas, you may have to rent equipment to dig it up and loosen it.\nLoosen the soil to a depth of at least 12 inches for most plants and up to 2 feet for trees and larger specimens. Garden soil preparation by manually shoveling is usually sufficient in most cases. Once the soil is loose, you may need to add several inches of compost or fine bark to keep it loose and workable.\nNutrient Deficient Soil\nImproving garden soil is imperative for a bountiful garden. Organic matter is the best soil amendment because it breaks down naturally to release nutrients for plant uptake. Some of the best items to use are:\n- Leaf litter\n- Clean hay or straw\n- Seedless weeds\n- Crop residue\n- Sphagnum moss\n- Peat moss\n- Pine needles\n- Grass clippings\n- Wood shavings\n- Dust and aged manures\nGarden soil preparation with these items works best if they are dug into the soil to a depth of 6 to 12 inches. You can even save your kitchen scraps to work into soil, but avoid meat, bones and fat. Cover crops provide “green manure” to work into soil in spring for an extra shot of nitrogen and increased soil percolation.\nMixing the Best Soil for Gardens\nThere isn’t an actual recipe for soil; however, it needs a good balance of macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients, should drain freely and have a balance of carbon to offset the nitrogen.\nAcid and alkaline soils can be amended with lime to sweeten the soil and sulfur to increase the acidity. Wood ash and oyster shells also naturally make acidic soil more neutral. Test kits are available at most garden centers to see if your soil is high or low in pH."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b6d45990-74d2-4a38-ba6b-bb86944884b1>","<urn:uuid:dd4df76c-f5b4-45df-92df-ff492fd6780e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Can you compare la estructura física of a contactless Smart Card versus an RFID access control card?","answer":"A contactless Smart Card consists of a chip module and an antenna for radio communication, conforming to ISO standards with specific dimensions of 3.370 inches length, 2.125 inches width, and 0.030 inches thickness. RFID access control cards also contain an antenna and chip, but may have additional features like magnetic stripes or multiple technologies (such as combi cards that combine UHF with other technologies like HID iCLASS or MIFARE). Both types operate using radio frequencies, though they may use different frequency bands - Smart Cards typically operate at 13.56 MHz, while RFID access control cards can operate at various frequencies including LF (120-125 kHz), HF (13.56 MHz), UHF (860-980 MHz), or Microwave (2.45 GHz and above).","context":["Wiegand, 120 kHZ, UHF, EPC, microwave, MIFARE, RS232, RS485, clock and data, AES, facility codes, client codes: The world of access control and vehicle identification is literally filled with concepts, techniques, acronyms and words that people outside our industry often find pretty difficult to understand and that sometimes seem very confusing. Also new entrants to this world often are overwhelmed by the number of techniques and concepts.\nGood news and bad news\nThe bad news is that there really is a lot that can be learned when someone is getting involved in the procurement, supply or implementation of RFID based systems to identify people or objects like cars. The good news however is that the basic concept of RFID is pretty straightforward. Even when you really get involved with the details of programming and interpreting tags, the basic model is not too complicated. Understanding this basic concept will help you interpret a lot information that your are faced with in the right way. This article’s objective is to help you on your way with understanding the most important concepts. It is not technically complete and it sometimes presents a simplified version of the related technology.\nUnderneath a model is presented that can be used as a framework to understand what needs to be done to have RFID tags and readers communicate successfully. It is a more detailed view on the principle of RFID that was presented in the earlier insight with the title ‘What is RFID?’.\nAs you may know a few things are needed to have an operational RFID system in place:\n- A reader, that is connected to (or integrated with)\n- An antenna, that sends out a radio signal\n- A tag (or transponder) that returns the signal with information added\nThe reader usually is connected to a third party system that is accepting (and storing) RFID related events and uses these events to trigger actions. In the security industry that system might be a building access control system, in the parking industry it is most likely a parking management or vehicular access control system. In libraries it might be a library management system.\nLet’s have a closer look at access control systems. These systems usually consist of:\n- RFID access control cards that, are read by\n- Access control RFID card readers next to the door, that are connected to\n- Access control panels (a physical controller), hardware that is able to open door locks and that is connected to\n- An access control management system (software) that manages building access credentials and authorizations.\nMany different access control systems exist worldwide. Most of these systems store access control rights for people (or vehicles) and also link those people to something that identifies them. Usually a number that is stored on an access control card. When an access control card (the RFID tag) is shown to the access control reader next to the door (the RFID reader with RFID antenna), that specific number is sent to the access control panel (a physical controller). The control panel connects with the access control management software (at a server or in the cloud) to check who is connected to that number and if he/she has access to the door that is approached. When the person is authorized an event is stored at the server (for the event log book) and the access control panel is asked to open the door (by telling the physical lock to unlock).\nThe basic principle is easy. But a lot of software components and hardware devices are put to work to physically open the door when someone with the right access rights is showing their RFID card to the RFID reader.\nYou will probably know that RFID is a generic word for a wide variety of different systems that use radio frequencies to identify something. All that variation is the reason that RFID tags and readers are not always interoperable. And that again is the reason that RFID manufacturers and vendors ask so many questions when you try to purchase their systems: they would like to make sure that whatever RFID systems you procure, it is really working well.\nThe following model is an abstract representation of the access control system that was mentioned in the previous paragraph:\nThe model shows three columns with a few layers. The first column represents the tag. The tag is presented to the reader (center column) and the reader is connected to the access control system in the third column.\nEach column is connected to another column at several virtual layers:\n- Tags are programmed with a number. That number needs to be in a format that is understood by the reader and that format should also be known in the access control system so that it can be processed. Tags usually have a facility code number (also called client code or facility code) and a card number. The facility code number links the tag to a specific installation, country or application. The card number should be unique for the installation with that facility code and is used to identify an individual carrier (like a person or car).\n- The number is encoded in a specific way so that it can be sent through the air. This communication protocol makes sure that tag and reader understand each other.\n- The encoded number is sent using radio waves at a specific frequency. The frequency of the reader and tag should be the same so they are able to communicate.\n- The reader is physically connected through wires in a cable with a controller that is part of the access control system. A reader communication protocol is applied to encode information sent over the physical line.\nThe difference between layer 2 and 3 is that in layer 3 the reader can actually ‘hear’ the tag, but it does not understand it until they speak the same ‘language’ in layer 2. The specification of layer 2 enables basic compatibility between tag and reader. The ‘EPC Gen 2’ standard used in UHF (or RAIN RFID) is an example of a standardized air interface: a combination of a selected frequency with a specified communication protocol.\nLevel 4 is about the physical connection between the reader (with antenna) and the access control system. What type of cable should be used and what ‘language’ is spoken? An example of that is Wiegand, a standard that is used a lot all over the world and that specifies how to use two data wires and one ground wire.\nThe Wiegand confusion\nThe word Wiegand can cause confusion. It can be used when talking about the wiring, but it can also refer to the coding format of the card. And to make it more confusing: many readers are capable of reading Wiegand formatted cards, but can then use other types of communication and wiring between the reader and the access control panel.\nThe Wiegand effect originally refers to magnetic effect in specific wires, named after John R. Wiegand. This magnetic effect is used to encode and decode information.\nThe Wiegand effect is used for security keycards. The plastic keycard has a series of short lengths of Wiegand wire embedded in it.\nThe Wiegand interface is a wiring standard commonly used to connect a card reader to the rest of an access control system.\nThe Wiegand protocol prescribes how to connect the wires and how to send information (numbers) from the card reader to the access control system. The Wiegand 26 format describes how the number on the card, the card data, is formatted (8 bits for the facility code and 16 bits for the card numbers).\nOther vendors have adopted the Wiegand 26 format and have made changes to it to enable use of longer card numbers or longer facility codes. Many variations exist today. The physical Wiegand cards are not used anymore, but the Wiegand format is widely used nowadays when programming a variety of access control RFID cards (HID, UHF, etc.).\nTag programming (1)\nLet’s have a more thorough look at each layer of the model and show some examples of technologies that are used in that specific layer.\nWe talked about the programming format, mentioned Wiegand as an example and addressed the existence of facility codes and card numbers. A wide variety of programming formats is available. A few common formats are:\n- Wiegand 26 bit with or without facility code\n- Wiegand 37 bit with or without facility code\n- HID corporate 1000 with facility code\n- Magstripe (Clock & Data) with several ‘Decimal’ versions\n- Nedap XS with customer code (also see paragraph ‘facility codes and variations’)\n- EM4200, 40 bit ID numbers\nMany cards have a preprogrammed number that is usually unique. This number is called the CSN (Card Serial Number) or UID (Unique IDentifier). It usually is advised not to use this pre-programmed number. In some rare cases it might not be unique (like with the TID on UHF tags and the 4byte ID on current MIFARE Classic cards). But more importantly: the standard card number format is not very user friendly and is not linking the card to a specific installation.\nNumbers are programmed at a specific location of the tag or card. UHF cards have several memory sections. MIFARE classic and HID iCLASS cards have specific sections. MIFARE DESfire cards is organized using a file structure. Java Cards use an application structure.\nIn short, to program any card you will need to know:\n- The number (range) and potentially the facility code\n- The location on the card (sector, file, application)\n- The programming format\nWhen combi cards are used, there are two parts of the card that need to be programmed. Nedap for example sell cards that combine long-range UHF with conventional card technologies like HID iCLASS or MIFARE.\nBoth the UHF part and the other part of the card can be programmed with the same number in the same or different formats. Many options are possible, but it depends on your situation what we would advise.\nFacility codes and variations\nWe talked about the use of facility codes: this first portion of the card number format is used to help the reader (and the access control system) decide if the card belongs to the installation or if that card should be ignored. If the selected facility code for an installation is for example ‘1’, then only cards with facility code ‘1’ will be read and interpreted. Cards or tags with other facility codes will be ignored.\nSo one could say that through facility codes cards are grouped and linked to a “facility”. The number in the card format that is used to identify the ‘carrier’ (person, car, animal, etc.) should be unique within that group of cards or tags with the same facility code. It is a security measure and decreases chances of running into duplicate carrier numbers.\nThe word ‘facility code’ has some equivalents in the access control industry:\n- Site code\n- Client code\n- Country code\n- Customer codes\nThese words all refer to the same thing: the grouping of cards through a number that identifies that group. It is important to be aware about the existence of these codes, since it can cause problems when building access control installation.\nReaders, or the access control systems that they are connected to, often are configured to accept only one facility code (or the technical equivalents). When additional tags are procured for an existing installation chances are that a facility code is used. If the new tags have a facility code that does not match the facility code in the reader or the facility code on the existing cards, the newly procured cards will not work.\nThe ‘Nedap XS’ card format uses customer codes: cards are potentially linked to specific customers. Nedap tags with this format (TRANSIT transponders,uPASS UHF tags programmed in this format, Nedap XS cards) always carry a customer code. Readers that are manufactured by Nedap and that are configured to read Nedap XS formatted tags, will instantly filter out all cards that do not have a matching customer code. Reprogramming cards often is not possible for practical reasons. Therefore it is extra important to verify what customer code is used when the Nedap XS card format is selected.\nCommunication protocol (2)\nThe communication protocol prescribes how the content of a card or tag is sent to the reader and how it should be interpreted. It is a definition of rules for communication between two devices.\nModification of the radio signal is used to encode information but also to distinguish the radio communication from other radio signals. Commands are specified to make sure it is clear who is sending and who is listening. Algorithms are defined to make sure the right tag or card is read when more than one card or tag might be in the range of the reader (anti-collision).\nMany systems use proprietary air interfaces. This implies that cards/tags and reader will always have to come from the same vendor.\nNedap’s TRANSIT reader for example will only work properly with Nedap TRANSIT tags. The good thing is that there is only one vendor responsible for the fact that the reader reads those tags well. The ordering process usually also is more straightforward, since clients do not have to worry about the programming format of the tags or cards.\nThe downside of proprietary air interfaces is that it prevents interoperability with devices from other manufacturers. Once you buy a reader with a proprietary air interface, you will have to buy cards or tags from that same manufacturer.\nReaders and cards/tags that fully comply with a standardized air interface are very likely to be interoperable. Of course they need to operate on the same frequency (see next paragraph) and they need to comply with the same version of the standard.\nISO144443-A for example is a famous standard for smartcards communicating at 13,56 MHz. Since many vendors have adopted (portions of) this four part standard you can find readers that support basic reading of Legic cards, HID iCLASS cards and MIFARE cards.\nAnother well-known standard is RAIN RFID, also known as EPC Gen 2, the standard for readers and tags/cards that operate at the UHF frequency (appr. 900 MHz). The RAIN alliance promotes the use of ISO/IEC 18000-63 and GS1 EPC(TM) UHF Gen 2. A wide variety of readers and tags comply with these standards, which makes them interoperable.\nTags (or cards) and readers may be interoperable, it is still important to consider how to program tags. UHF tags can be programmed for example with Wiegand formatted numbers. The standard identifier on UHF tags (the so called TID) is not guaranteed to be unique and is not really fit for use in access control systems.\nRFID systems use a wide range of frequency bandwidth. The antennas on both the reader and the tag are tuned to one specific frequency to enable basic interoperability. You can however define different air interfaces for one frequency. 13,56 MHz for example is a frequency that is used in access control systems, but also in library management systems. The standardized air interfaces for these two application areas are very different. The same applies for example to low frequency access control cards (120-125 kHZ): HID Prox cards, Nedap Nexs cards and EM cards all operate in that frequency range, but they are not interoperable.\nFrequencies that are often used in access control are (examples in brackets):\n- LF: 120-1355 kHz (HID Prox, EM, Nedap NeXS)\n- HF: 13.56 MHz – (MIFARE Classic, DESfire, HID iCLASS, Legic)\n- UHF: 860 – 980 MHz (RAIN RFID/EPC Gen 2)\n- Microwave: 2.45 GHz and > (Nedap TRANSIT)\nIt is important to realize that local radio regulations prescribe specific requirements for use of the frequency. UHF for example is not globally harmonized, which means that you will need to look out for readers (and tags) that are complying to radio regulations in your country.\nReader Communication (4)\nThe access control reader is physically connected to the access control system. This physical connection is called the interface. A reader communication protocol is applied to encode information sent over the wires.\nCommon interfaces and reader communication protocols are:\nInterface Protocols supported:\nRS232 CR/LF, DC2/DC4\nRS485 CR/LF, DC2/DC4, OSDP, Profibus\nWiegand W26-bit, W32-bit\nThese connection methods often can be made wireless.\nOSDP is a standard that is managed by SIA (Security Industry Association) that is about to be widely embraced by the security industry as a standard (based on RS485) for connecting readers with access control panels (controllers). Information about OSDP can be found here.\nNedap’s uPASS Access reader is an example of a reader that is ready for OSDP deployment.\nKeep it simple!\nWe do hope this insight helps you to understand the basic concepts of how to get access control cards, readers and controllers to work. The basic model is simple. And although many variations exist, this basic model should help you understand how to relate all these words and concepts to each other.\nNeed additional information or help?

A smart card is capable of storing and processing the data securely in a network of computers. The scope of smart cards is increasing day by day in diverse applications like banking, telephone services, and medical records systems etc. In this article we will try to understand what is a Smart Card, how Smart Cards work, its specifications, types, applications, advantages and disadvantages of Smart Cards.\nTable of Contents\n- 1 What is a Smart Card\n- 2 How a Smart Card Works\n- 3 Smart Card Architecture\n- 4 Types of Smart Card\n- 5 Applications of Smart Card\n- 6 Advantages of Smart Card\n- 7 Disadvantages of Smart Card\nWhat is a Smart Card\nSmart-Card is a secure portable storage device which is used in various applications requiring controlled access to sensitive information. It is in the size of a credit/ debit card, incorporated with one or more integrated circuit chips.\nIt functions as a microprocessor, memory and provides an input-output interface. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifies certain voluntary international standards in many scientific and technological fields. However, till to date, ISO has not defined any standards for the devices termed as “Smart Cards.”\nFig. 1- Introduction to Smart Card\nThough it needs mention that ISO has set certain standards for what ISO calls an Integrated Circuit Card (ICC). Some of the fundamental characteristics of an ISO ICC (ISO 7816) are:\n- The ICC may contain one or more integrated circuits.\n- The length, width and the thickness of a card must be 3.370 inches, 2.125 inches, and 0.030 inches respectively which are the dimensions of a standard credit card.\n- The ICC provides spaces on the card for magnetic stripe and embossed data storage.\nA Smart-Card is similar to Integrated Circuit Cards except that it may not necessarily have magnetic stripe. The other Smart-Card related standards include ISO 14443 and ISO 15693 where the range of operation is defined. Smart Cards operate at 13.56 MHz and the distance ranges between 10 centimeters (3.94 inches) to 1 meter respectively.\nFig. 2 – Physical Components of a Contact less Smart Card\nImage Courtesy : embeddedsecuritynews\nHow a Smart Card Works\nThe Smart Cards which are issued to a user are programmed with unique information, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN). The microcomputer of smart-card performs a secret one-way transformation on the PIN, which is a mathematical function (f) and the result (R) of this function R= f (D), where the input to the function D is impossible to determine.\nHence, the transformed unique PIN is stored in the smart card’s memory which is unreadable. The user’s PIN is never written onto the working memory of the host computer, which might be modified or monitored by an adversary.\nFig. 3 – Generalized Smart Card System\nTo access the computer system, a user must insert his/ her Smart-Card into a Smart-Card Reader and enter his unique PIN by means of a card reader’s keypad. When the contact pad on the smart-card comes in contact with the electrical connectors of the reader, the smart card’s microcomputer chip performs the one-way transformation on the entered PIN and compares it with the stored PIN.\nIf the two PINs match, then the information is exchanged between the smart-card and the host computer, which determines the user’s identity and the information which the user is entitled to access.\nSmart Card Architecture\nA Smart Card’s architecture basically consists of three elements. They are:\n- I/O System\n- Central Processing Unit (CPU)\nFig. 4 – Smart Card Architecture\nI/O (Input/ Output) System\nSmart Cards must have certain components to perform Input/output (I/O) functions. It has internal logic circuitry which works in conjunction with the microprocessor that controls the timing and flow of data transferred into and out of the smart card’s memories. It has a physical structure through which it can interface to a smart-card reader device, which is connected to host computers for the exchange of data.\nThe categories of physical interfaces depends on the type of smart cards i.e. the contact type and the contactless type. Interface of a Contact Smart-Card is a contact pad beneath which lies a chip module and the interface of a contactless type card includes a chip module and an antenna to communicate using radio waves.\nFig. 5 – Chip Module on Smart Card\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU)\nThe CPU or the microprocessor is the component which distinguishes the smart cards from other cards which are designed to simply store data. The microprocessor in association with the operating system enables the smart-card to “make its own decisions” concerning where the data is stored in its memories and under what circumstances it should transfer information through its input/output interface.\nThe microprocessor consists of three major components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit, and the bus.\nMemory (ROM, RAM, EEPROM)\nThe memories used in Smart Card’s microcomputers are manufactured from semiconductor materials. Semiconductor memories consist of matrices of cells formed by transistors to store information.\nTypes of Memory\nThe three types of semiconductor memory used in Smart cards are:\n- Read Only Memory (ROM)\n- Random Access Memory (RAM)\n- Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM)\nROM (Read Only Memory)\nSmart Card’s ROM is a semiconductor memory where the information stored is retained indefinitely without a continuous power supply to the memory. In this programming process, the ROM is often masked in such a way that it cannot be read or altered by the user.\nSemiconductor ROM is typically used for storing the Smart Card’s general operating system programs such as the program needed to start the Smart-Card when its power is turned on.\nRAM (Random Access Memory)\nAny information stored in RAM can be accessed only in a fixed amount of time i.e. the stored information in a smart card’s RAM is lost immediately if power to the memory is removed. RAM is the fastest type of memory, used only for temporary storage. The information in RAM is accessed in the range of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds (billionths of a second).\nEEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)\nSmart card’s EEPROM is a non-volatile memory which can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. EEPROM can be used for storing programs and data that needs modification periodically. Since EEPROM can be erased, a smart card containing EEPROM will not “expire” as its memory is filled up.\nTypes of Smart Card\nSmart Cards can be classified in two types. They are:\n- Contact Smart Card\n- Contact less Smart Card\nFig. 6 – Types of Smart Card\nContact Smart Card\nIn a Smart-Card with contact-type interface, the pins of the card reader’s connector must physically touch the contact pad on the Smart-Card during data transfer.\nContactless Smart Card\nA Smart-Card with a non-contact type interface does not require a physical connection for data transfer. This type of interface may be implemented using capacitive plates placed inside or on the surface of the card and the communication occurs via radio frequency signals.\nApplications of Smart Card\nThe field areas for applications of Smart Cards include:\n- Medical Health cards\n- Satellite TV\n- Access control systems\n- Electronic cash\n- Wireless (mobile) communications\n- Government identification\n- Ticketless travel systems\nAdvantages of Smart Card\n- Security: Smart cards are more secure as they are programmed with encryption and the user’s personal information and the transactions are safe.\n- Convenience: Smart cards are small in size and hence convenient to carry.\n- Economy friendly: Smart cards help in our economy by reducing transaction costs by eliminating paper.\n- Multifunctional: smart cards can be used for multi functions like paying bills, booking tickets, paying for food etc.\n- Reliable: Smart cards are more reliable than magnetic stripe cards.\nDisadvantages of Smart Card\n- It is prone to damage easily.\n- Smart cards are expensive to manufacture.\n- Availability of Smart-Card reader is necessary."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:19bfeb08-4e4d-473c-89ff-361db703c70a>","<urn:uuid:03f058c1-1e0f-4141-b1c5-84e058dc579a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is effect of exercise training on poor swimming salmon? Como afecta el entrenamiento a los salmones que nadan mal?","answer":"Training has the greatest impact on poor swimming salmon. When subjected to optimal training regimes, poor swimmers can achieve similar disease resistance levels as good swimmers. However, under non-optimal regimes, their condition can worsen, indicating they have a lower capability to adapt than good swimmers. Research showed that while good swimmers naturally have higher disease resistance, the weakest 50 percent of fish may actually have the greatest potential benefit from swimming activity.","context":["Aerobic exercise gives more robust smolt\nFarmed salmon smolts become more robust and more likely to survive if they undergo optimal aerobic exercise training prior to sea transfer. This was the main message from Chilean Vicente Castro in his doctoral defense in Norway recently.\nRobust smolts are characterized by Castro as smolts that have improved disease resistance associated with a strengthened cardiovascular system and better growth.\nStart while they are young\nCastro and his colleagues at Nofima measured the extent to which these parameters were improved by different physical training regimes in salmon juveniles (pre-smolts) in fresh water, thereby improving smolt robustness.\nOverall, his work demonstrates that by subjecting pre-smolts to physical exercise, there is a strong potential for the aquaculture industry to produce more robust smolts.\nThis can in turn result in lower mortalities caused by infectious diseases. Production losses are particularly high the first months after sea transfer, so preventive health measures must be initiated in juvenile fish during the freshwater stage.\nHow to train a fish\nAs salmon swim constantly, aerobic exercise training is achieved by changing the water velocity and flow conditions in the tanks so that the fish are motivated to swim in a controlled way and at higher speeds than normal over time.\nIn the trials at Nofima (the Norwegian Institute of Food, Fisheries and Aquaculture Research), several different training regimes with intervals and continuous flow were tested.\nGreatest benefit for poor swimmers\nIn one trial, Castro split the salmon population into two groups: good and poor swimmers. Interestingly, the fish that were categorized as good swimmers had an overall higher disease resistance than poor swimmers on a controlled infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) challenge test. After undergoing the physical training programs, the largest effect on disease resistance was recorded in the group of poor swimmers, with two outcomes.\nTheir performance was either improved through an optimal regime (achieving similar resistance level as good swimmers), or worsened through a non-optimal regime. This suggests that poor swimmers have lower capability to adapt than good swimmers.\nThe range of swimming velocity that appears to be optimal for improving overall robustness has been narrowed down by Castro and the research group. While it was earlier thought that 0.5-1.5 body lengths per second was optimal, they now have data that shows that 0.8-1.2 body lengths per second is optimal when including improved disease resistance.\n“In conclusion, aerobic exercise is good for all salmon but the weakest 50 percent of the fish may have the greatest benefit from swimming activity,” says Castro.\nPhysical exercise improved the growth rate, mainly because of an increased feed intake, meaning that fish will reach a given size faster when undergoing training programs than if they are not subjected to such programs.\nWhy training is good\nTo understand why training strengthens the disease resistance of the fish, Castro performed functional genomics studies, which uses genetic information to describe the functions and interactions of genes.\nThese studies showed that favorable physical training reduced inflammation levels in the heart and the innate immune system was strengthened through activation of several responses. These responses were probably instrumental in the researchers being able to find a lower reproduction of the virus in fish that had undergone physical training. Furthermore, results suggested that physical exercise had a strong effect on enhancing the cardiovascular capacity of the fish, an important factor in achieving high levels of robustness.\n“In future research, we need to further optimize the physical training regimes, so we can implement protocols with the potential of large benefits for the fish, the industry and the consumers,” Castro emphasizes.\nPossible utilization of this knowledge may also include improving the genetic material in breeding programs by sorting fish based on swimming performance.\nVicente Castro is 31 years old and is from Chile. On 29 June 2012, he defended his thesis entitled “Aerobic exercise training for improving robustness of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)” at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

Kauffman\nSaturday, March 9, 2019 | 6-9 PM\nPerkins Center for the Arts\n30 Irvin Avenue | Collingswoood, NJ\n[su_button url=”http://perkinsarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Photography-37-Opening-Perkins-MYP-Comm-Final-2.28.19.pdf” target=”blank” background=”#bfb3e4″ size=”9″ text_shadow=”0px 2px 5px #000000″]PRESS RELEASE[/su_button]\nAbout the Artists:\nJohn Clarke’s interest in photography developed while he was an architectural student at Cooper Union in the late 1960s. The Cooper students were generally, very talented, poor, living in rundown lofts on the lower east side and struggling to find their way into the design world. The first year architectural students took all their classes with the art students, so they got a great introduction to freehand drawing, two and three dimensional design. At the suggestion of one of his design professors, John bought a used Nikon and began to shoot black and white film around New York City. Slowly photography began to be part of John’s architectural presentations.\nAfter receiving a master’s degree from Columbia University, John was offered a position as an assistant professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture teaching first year year design. The subject of his photography shifted from urban landscapes to rural landscapes and traditional building structure. John’s photo medium changed from black and white film to color slides. The slides left no room for post processing. The crop and exposure you got at the time of taking the photo was the end of the story. You had to get the image right in the camera.\nFast forward some years, John moved to New Jersey and founded Clarke Caton Hintz, a high recognized, award winning architectural and planning firm based in Trenton. During the time John was practicing architecture, the world changed from analog to digital. When he started, architects drew everything by hand. Now, virtually everything an architect designs is drawn with the aid of a computer. The same dramatic change has occurred in photography. Architects and designers went from having vast color slide collections to using digital cameras, Lightroom and Photoshop to illustrate their design intentions.\nWhile in architectural practice, John specialized in the design of large scale, mixed use communities. This interest in urban design gave him a reason to travel extensively both in the U.S and abroad. Photography became critical to his urban design work and documenting his travels became a source of great enjoyment.\nSince retirement from architectural practice, John has devoted his artistic talents to fine art photography. His background as an architect is evident in the composition and structure of his photos. A life time of looking intensely at his surrounding is evident in the quality of his images.\nAnnarita Gentile – As a photographer, I aim to reflect the world around me as I experience it. That is saying a lot, to try to show in an image a personal experience. Some of this aim is accomplished through composition and editing are a result of an individual process and a lot of luck.\nWe carry emotional narratives deep within our internal world. The narrative holds the meaning to what we see. The mind reacts to an image in .33 seconds. Once we registered what we see, our own meaning is applied to the image.\nMy work as an artist coincides with my psychoanalytic career. I approach all of my endeavors with a desire to understand my own motivations and how my perspective is formed by my feelings. My emotional perspective and hopefully, expressed production is evident in both my artistic pursuits and professional hours.\nFor me, the creative process on a shoot occurs in a seamless process from the drive that comes from inspiration to the act of composition. Studio work is an attempt to continue the messaging by selecting certain images and editing which involves a variety of choices.\nThe message in this portfolio is one of glorious celebration through shapes and colors. For me, this work symbolizes a part of the story of the natural journey from hibernation, and germination, to the blossoming period shown here. What is expressed through the colors, shapes textures and the infinite possibilities of these flowers is a triumph and celebratory victory. And as brilliant as it is, there is some darkness and the sense that change is not far away. This is about the immediacy of the moment. The photos in this collection are flowers in Botanical Gardens in Pennsylvania and Maine, as well as various wooded locations.\nAubrey J. Kauffman is a photographer living and working in New Jersey. He received his BA in Media Arts from New Jersey City University and his MFA in Visual Arts from Rutgers University’s Mason Gross School of the Arts. He has taught photography at Mason Gross, Middlesex County College, Mercer County Community College and Community College of Philadelphia.\nHe was Guest Curator for “Landscapes: Social Political Traditional” at Rider University, in Lawrenceville, NJ, and was Co-Curator for “On Photography: Culture, History and the Narrative” with LaToya Ruby Frazier at the Mason Gross Galleries in New Brunswick.\nHis photography has been included in group exhibitions including: The Newark Museum, Newark, NJ; The Biggs Museum of American Art in Dover DE, The Griffin Museum of Photography in Winchester MA; The 38th Annual Wind Challenge Exhibition Series at the Fleisher Art Memorial in Philadelphia , PA and Expo 35 at the b.j. spoke gallery in Huntington, New York.\nHe has exhibited in solo shows at The New Jeresey State Museum, Trenton, NJ; Enfoco at 7th and 2ND Street Gallery, New York, NY; Southern Light Gallery in Amarillo, Texas; the Marguerite & James Gallery Hutchins Gallery at the Gruss Center of Visual Arts in Lawrenceville, NJ and the Rider University Art Gallery in Lawrenceville, NJ.\nHe was awarded the Brovero Photography Prize by Mason Gross.

{"question":"Hi! I'm studying the Olympic movement and I'm curious - what's the key difference between nationalism and ultranationalism in sports events like the Olympics vs GANEFO?","answer":"The key difference is that nationalism in sports typically promotes national pride while respecting international cooperation, while ultranationalism pursues national interests at the expense of other nations. The Olympics exemplify nationalism through inclusive international competition, while GANEFO demonstrated ultranationalistic tendencies by explicitly excluding certain nations and being created as a politically-motivated retaliation against the IOC. A key indicator of ultranationalism is when actions become unfairly detrimental to other nations' interests or international cooperation, as seen in GANEFO's deliberate exclusion of Taiwan and Israel from participation.","context":["Students learn to distinguish nationalism from ultranationalism by categorizing specified events and by designing a visual display representing the point at which a nationalistic event becomes ultranationalistic.\nA. Categorize historical and contemporary examples of nationalism and ultranationalism.\nDistinguish various scenarios\nProvide students with several brief synopses of two kinds of events: nationalistic actions and ultranationalistic actions. See Examples of Nationalism and Ultranationalism (Background Information) for sample descriptions. Without identifying each kind, organize the descriptions into two sets and invite students to consider the following questions:\n- How are the events in Set A similar?\n- How are the events in Set B similar?\n- What distinguishes the events in Set A from those in Set B?\nPossible Examples of Ultranationalism\nPossible Examples of Nationalism\nApartheid in South Africa\nFront de Libération du Québec (FLQ)\nWorld Fairs, such as Expo '67\nConscription during World War I and II\nTo meet the diverse needs of learners, consider reducing or increasing the number of events.\nFor more detailed instructions on how to complete this activity, see Concept Attainment (Support Material).\nCreate an individual definition\nAfter sufficient discussion to clarify ideas, provide students with the labels \"nationalism\" (examples in Set B) and \"ultranationalism\" (examples in Set A). Ask students to identify common features of the examples of nationalism and of ultranationalism. For each concept, invite students to suggest defining attributes that they will use to distinguish whether an action reflects nationalism or ultranationalism.\nCheck for understanding\nTo check for understanding of the two concepts, present students with new events that they have not previously discussed that may be considered to be either nationalism or ultranationalism, or both.\nSee \"Tester\" Examples of Nationalism and Ultranationalism (Background Information) for descriptions of the following events:\n- Space Race\n- World Cup of Soccer\n- The Oka Crisis\n- Internment in Canada.\nAsk students to classify these events in one category or the other and explain their reasoning.\nClarify the divide between nationalism and ultranationalism\nUsing the sample situations and the definitions generated, ask students to identify the turning point at which nationalism becomes ultranationalism. In deciding this point, encourage students to consider this possibility: Is it when the focus of the effort is mainly in the interest of one nation at the expense of another?\nIs there a point at which legitimate pursuit of nationalism might turn to ultranationalism? For example, was the invasion of Iraq by the United States in 2003 an example of a turning point? A key difference may be that ultranationalism is extreme nationalism to the stage where it is unfairly detrimental to other individual nations' interests, international interests or cooperation.\nB. Create a visual display to represent the point at which a nationalistic action becomes ultranationalistic.\nPrepare a visual representation\nInvite students to represent their understanding visually as a concept map, word web, collage, political cartoon or as a continuum of events from Clearly Nationalistic to Clearly Ultranationalistic.\nEncourage students to consider the following criteria when developing their visual representations:\n- accurately represents credible principles for distinguishing the two concepts\n- clearly represents and explains this difference.\nArrange for students to explain their representations to the class and discuss the different dividing lines.","Introduction to GANEFO\nThe Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO) was a sports event created by former Indonesian president Sukarno in 1963 as a retaliation to the Olympic Games. The event was created with propaganda in mind and invited other nations of the “emerging nations”, mostly newly independent socialist countries such as China, North Korea, and North Vietnam that opposed imperialists and colonialists such as the United States.\nThis may sound similar to the Friendship Games hosted by the Soviet Union in Moscow because it is. The Friendship Games was the Soviet’s way of creating their own Olympic Games after they decided to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles because of political tensions in regards to the Cold War.\nYou could say that GANEFO gave the USSR the idea of running their own Olympics because Indonesia did it 21 years prior.\nGANEFO’s anthem used in Jakarta, Indonesia 1963\nThe beginning of GANEFO\nIn 1962, Jakarta in Indonesia hosted the fourth Asian Games in which Taiwan and Israel were not permitted to join. Indonesia did not recognise Taiwan as country, and Indonesia’s Islamic views conflicts with Israel’s and both nations to this day still have no formal diplomatic ties.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) response to this was to indefinitely suspend Indonesia from all IOC events such as the Winter and Summer Olympics. This was the very first time the IOC had chosen to directly enforce a suspension to a nation.\nWith politics heavily influenced, President Sukarno wanted to create this unique sporting event to give socialist countries and newly independent nations an opportunity to show and voice their solidarity. The IOC condemned this event as they are incredibly strict with allowing politics into sports.\nPosters and propaganda used to promote Indonesia’s new international sporting events and to criticise the IOC. GANEFO’s motto: “Onward! No Retreat!” Or “Forward, Never Backward!”\nSukarno responded saying the IOC contradicted themselves as they did not allow the People’s Republic of China or North Vietnam in as members of the committee as he believed this was also politically backed. The IOC later announced that athletes attending GANEFO would be ineligible to participate in the Olympic Games, the next being held in 1964 hosted by Tokyo in Japan.\nThis led most nations who wanted to participate in GANEFO to not send their top tier athletes to compete or allowed their own Olympic Committee to be involved. Instead, these nations sent their best pro-amateur athletes so their best athletes would not risk losing out in competing in the Olympic Games.\n1st GANEFO – the first event\nThe first GANEFO event was held in Jakarta, Indonesia from the 10th to the 22nd of November, 1963. 2.700 athletes from 51 countries attended and competed in 21 men’s and 12 women’s athletic events.\nOne of the most unusual participants was Japan. They allowed their pro-amateur athletes to attend the first GANEFO event to show good sportsmanship as they would be hosting the 1964 Summer Olympics. However, their efforts to participate led to a light threat from the American IOC President at the time, Avery Brundage. Nothing came of it though.\nChina at the time was not competing in the Olympics as they were protesting against Taiwan’s involvement in the IOC. This allowed China to send their very best athletes to compete in GANEFO. China won all but three of the women’s events and eleven gold medals in the men’s category, with a total victory of 171 medals in total.\nNorth Korea shocked the world as they were the second most successful nation to compete. Both China and North Korea were excluded from the previous Asian Games, including the Jakarta Games held a year earlier. The DPRK had not yet entered the Summer Olympics but did so for the first time the following year in Tokyo. North Korea won four gold medals, led by a triple gold medal performance by Sin Kim-dan – a track and field athlete.\nAt third place was the United Arab Republic (combining Egypt and Syria), which swept the men’s distance track events, and won four gold medals in separate events. The USSR were one of the many nations to send their ‘second best’ athletes and had a total medal tally of 57 medals.\nThe following countries competed in the 1st GANEFO event:\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Cambodia, Chile, Ceylon, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, DPR Korea, the Dominican Republic, Finland, France, the German Democratic Republic, Guinea, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy, Japan, Laos, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine (then divided to Jordanian West Bank and Egyptian Gaza Strip), People’s Republic of China, the Philippines, Poland, Republic of Mali, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Thailand, Tunisia, Soviet Union, North Vietnam, the United Arab Republic, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, and a team representing “Arab Palestine.”\n2nd GANEFO – the second event but the 1st Asian GANEFO\nThe second GANEFO event was to be held in Cairo, Egypt in 1967 but were cancelled for political reasons and wars. The hosting country was then awarded to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and it was decided the games would focus on participant countries being from the extended Asian region as the facilities and infrastructure in Cambodia could not accommodate an event large enough for 50 or more countries.\nPrince Sihanouk opened the games on the 25th of November to the 6th December, 1966 and welcomed 2000 athletes from 17 countries including Cambodia, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), China, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, North Korea, Laos, Lebanon, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Singapore, Syria, North Vietnam and Yemen to compete in 21 men’s and 12 women’s events.\nOpening Ceremony of GANEFO in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Similarities shard with North Korea’s Mass Games\nThe events served as a counterpart to the athletics at the 1966 Asian Games, which featured largely Western-allied Asian nations such as Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and the territory of Hong Kong.\nChina again dominated the competition, winning 19 gold medals. North Korea second again with 10 gold medals. Cambodia, North Vietnam, and Syria each won one gold medal each.\nThe most successful athlete of the event was Sin Kim-dan, the North Korean track and field athlete who won the 200 metres, 400 metres and 800 metres titles. She managed to successfully defend all her GANEFO 1963 titles.\n3rd GANEFO – 2nd Asian GANEFO – never happened\nThe third GANEFO event, which again was focused on the extended Asian Region making it the 2nd Asian GANEFO were to be hosted in Beijing, China in 1970. At the time China was struggling through the Cultural Revolution and the PRC decided to drop out of the opportunity of hosting the games. It was then awarded to Pyongyang; North Korea and the games would be opened by North Korea’s leader Kim Il Sung. These plans did not go ahead.\nSoon after the first GANEFO event, the IOC allowed Indonesia to compete in the Tokyo 1964 Summer Olympics and interests from participating nations faded. GANEFO was never to be heard of again in the international community.\nHowever, GANEFO lives on in Indonesia, and the 10th of November is celebrated as GANEFO day with sports competitions held locally and on a much smaller scale."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bfe042a1-1486-4b4e-9896-e2369cb4b3c8>","<urn:uuid:d6a6b9e2-512b-4eee-bc65-7f50a223da36>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the dual relationship between humans and the ocean - both in terms of psychological benefits and environmental threats?","answer":"The ocean provides remarkable psychological benefits to humans - looking at it can alter neural activity and induce a light meditative state, while living near the coast improves physical health. The color blue from the ocean can boost creativity, and coastal environments can reduce stress and anxiety. Throughout history, humans have maintained deep cultural and spiritual connections with the ocean, as evidenced by sea deities in various civilizations. However, human activities pose serious threats to this vital resource. Overfishing has led to marine ecosystem imbalance, disrupting predator populations and coral health. Unsustainable fishing practices result in bycatch that threatens endangered species and destroys marine habitats through methods like trawling. Additionally, fishing vessels contribute to water pollution through oil, liquid, and chemical spills, causing significant disturbance to both aquatic and terrestrial life.","context":["The ocean covers more than two-thirds of the planet. It is the source of all life on Earth and continues to play a vitally important role in supporting that life. The ocean produces around half of the planet’s oxygen, is a natural carbon sink, is home to most of the Earth’s species, and is the primary source of protein for over a billion people. It is also a job creator for more than 40 million people. Humans are deeply connected with our oceans, whether they live near the sea or not. We rely on it to support our basic existence, and now, more than ever, we need to respect the ocean and help protect and restore it.\nImage Credit: ESB Professional/Shutterstock.com\nThe Human: Ocean Relationship\nHumans are drawn to water. New research has revealed that looking out onto the ocean can alter our neural activity. When watching the ocean, the frequency of our brain waves change, putting us into a light meditative state. Another found that those who live by the coast have an improved sense of physical health.\nThe relationship between humans and the ocean is complex. Water impacts every aspect of human life. The oceans supply a source of fresh water and oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, moderate the climate and impact our weather, provide a source of food and means of travel, and even impact our health.\nIn a panel commissioned by A Sustainable Ocean Economy, it was discussed that the values that underpin our relationship with the ocean are usually non-monetary and contribute to “non-material dimensions of wellbeing”. Broader human flourishing often results from nurturing our relationship with the ocean. Enhancement to our cultural and social identity, a sense of place, occupational pride, self-respect, spirituality, mental and physical health, and a sense of security are the common positive outcomes of nurturing our relationship with the ocean.\nHow is Pollution Changing the Chemistry of the Ocean?\nOur Connection to the Ocean\nAbove, we discussed how the ocean has the power to change our brain waves, inducing a light mediative state. This connection, it seems, runs deep. Studies have also shown that the color blue can boost our creativity, which may explain why, throughout the ages, artists and writers have been inspired by the sea. It is believed that being by the sea can reduce stress and anxiety, and there are many theories that being by the sea or in it can help cure several ailments. In many ways, humans seem to have an ancient affinity for the sea.\nIn fact, humans throughout history have often believed that the sea was a form of a god, the Greeks believed in Poseidon, Hydros, and Ceto, the sea goddess, and the ancient Egyptians believed in Anuket, Goddess of the Nile. The Hindu religion has Lord Varuna, the sea god. The Mayans, the Aztecs, and ancient Chinese mythology also have sea gods in their history.\nThe Ocean’s Sustenance\nThe ocean provides an essential source of sustenance for humans. Each year, around 17% of our total annual protein consumption is accounted for by seafood. This figure is much higher in coastal communities that account for around 40% of the world’s population.\nBy 2050, the world will need to produce double the amount of food it currently does to feed the growing population. With limited space on land to expand agricultural practices, the ocean may come to our rescue. Early humans relied upon the sea as a primary food resource much more than we do now. It is suggested that a shift back to relying on the sea as our primary source of nourishment will be important in helping the world meet food security goals. However, sustainable fishing practices must be adopted to protect our precious oceans.\nImage Credit: SergeUWPhoto/Shutterstock.com\nHow does the Ocean Support Human Life?\nThe ocean is a powerful body. It supports human life in a plethora of ways. Not only does it provide us with an expansive source of food, but it brings us water by feeding into the rivers that irrigate the land; it produces the oxygen we need to breathe and mitigates the impact of human activities on the Earth by absorbing the carbon dioxide we produce.\nThe ocean also provides jobs and supports coastal economies. Aquatic plants, such as mangroves protect these coastal communities from extreme weather such as hurricanes and tsunamis.\nThe ocean supported our development as a species. Before planes and trains, humans explored the world via boat. Cultures and religions were shared, wars were fought, and the history of humans was written. Even now, 11 billion tons of freight are transported across the oceans each year. Due to its smaller carbon footprint, sea freight will likely become more important than air.\nThe ocean has always been a source of sustenance and support for humans, and there is an ancient connection that will likely endure and become even more important in the future.\n- A Sustainable Ocean Economy.

About 85% of the world’s fisheries could be over-exploited, totally depleted, or recovering from exploitation.\nFor this article, the purpose is to explore the major causes and effects of overfishing. Shall we start with the causes first?\nCauses of Overfishing\nThere are numerous reasons for overfishing. The major ones include:\n1. Poor Fisheries Management\nThe fishing industry has long been weighed down by a lack of management oversight and proper government regulations. Traceability of fishing activities has been a great challenge as well.\nThe rules and regulations we have today have proven to be ineffective when it comes to limiting fishing capacity to sustainable levels. And the high seas are the most affected.\nNamely, there are insufficient fishing regulations in the high seas. And the existing regulations are normally not enforced. Most fisheries management organs lack the capacity to adequately apply scientific advice of fish quotas.\nMoreover, customs agencies and fish retailers can’t always ascertain the fish coming into their country is caught through proper channels.\n2. Unsustainable Fishing\nUnsustainable fishing encompasses the use of nets, fishing methods and other fishing gear that catch so much fish to a level that they are endangered.\nIt may also involve catching other sea creatures other than fish in the process. The unwanted animals are called By-catch. And they are normally destroyed and discarded into the sea, hence the name Discards.\nDiscards may include turtles, cetaceans, young fish, sharks, corals, and seabirds. Invertebrates such as crabs, starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins, sponges, mollusks, and warms could also be caught, destroyed, and thrown back into the sea.\nSome fishermen also catch tiny fishes, depriving them of the opportunity to grow and reproduce.\n3. Illegal and Unregulated Fishing Activities\nIllegal fishing activities include poaching, taking more than the allowed amount of catch, and fishing out of season. According to WWF, illegal fishing accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s catch and up to 50 percent in some fisheries.\nUnregulated fishing practices that result in grave harm include by-catch (as explained in the previous point) and Trawling. Trawling involves scraping along the bottom of the sea to gather fish. This practice is one of the major causes of destruction to marine habitats.\n4. Economic and Food Needs\nMarket availability and consumer demands are the major factors that determine the amount of fish that fishing companies bring ashore.\nIn the last 100 years, human population has increased in many folds. This has, in turn, pushed the need for food and fish up significantly. Coupled with economic aspirations of fishing industries, these factors have compelled fishers to catch more fish than the seas can replace.\n5. Government Subsidies\nMany governments around the world continue to subsidize their fishing equipment. This allows unprofitable fishing entities to survive, eventually leading to overfishing. Today, fishing fleet across the globe is estimated to be up to 250 percent of the actual capacity needed to catch what the world needs.\n6. Open Access Fisheries\nThe ‘open access’ nature of fisheries is another major problem of overfishing. In light of the fact that there are no or limited property rights, fishermen lack the motivation to leave fish in the water.\nMoreover, only about 1.5 percent of water bodies have been declared protected areas. And most of those areas still remain accessible to fishermen, exposing them to destruction and depletion.\nNow, let’s let quickly look at some of the effects of overfishing.\nEffects of Overfishing on the Environment\nAt the beginning of this article, we pointed out that overfishing has impacted at least 85 percent of the world’s fish resources. The fact that most fisheries are harvested far beyond their sustainable capacity is poised to have wide-ranging effects on marine life and the socio-economic well-being of humans.\nThat said, here are some of the major effects of overfishing:\n1. Marine Ecosystem Imbalance\nTargeted catching of essential predators such as sharks, tuna, and billfish disrupts marine ecosystem in the long run. This results in increased numbers of smaller marine animals below the food chain.\nThis ends up affecting the rest of the ecosystem, with issues such as the increased growth of algae. Coral health becomes compromised as well. Overfishing is also associated with bycatch, one of the major threats to marine life as it causes unnecessary loss of massive fish population along with other marine animals like turtles.\n2. Dwindling Harvests of Targeted Fish\nThe population of fish that is worth consuming is increasingly reducing, thanks to overfishing. Overfishing has led to a decrease in the population of productive fish, resulting in lesser stocking of the fish.\nThere is urgent need to curb overfishing in a bid to restore the dwindling marine population in a couple of years. Limiting fishery activities will allow fish to breed and reproduce, and well will eventually have a great supply of fish available again.\n3. Fishing of Untargeted/Endangered Marine Species\nBycatch leads to the capturing of marine animals that are not used or required. The animals may include protected or endangered species or species that are of little or no economic value. If caught, they are normally destroyed and discarded either in the water or ashore.\n4. Unsustainable Aquaculture\nFish farming requires feed for reared fish. For example, you will need between four and eleven pounds of prey fish to raise just one pound of farmed salmon.\nWith the rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry, prey fish population is reducing at alarming and untenable rates. According to some researchers, if this trend continues, fish farming will have outstripped the supply of fishmeal by 2020.\n5. Socio-economic Impact\nMillions of people around the world have pegged their livelihood and nutritional needs on fishing. Oceans have supplied us with sufficient seafood for years, but that is no longer the case.\nOverfishing and untenable fishing practices over the last couple of decades have stripped the oceans of their fish supply. And this has affected many people’s everyday way of life and source of income. With no valuable fish left in the waters to fish, the fishing industry is on the verge of collapse.\nFishing boats, trawlers, and vessels hurt marine life not only through overfishing but also through oil and liquid, and chemical spills.\nYou may think that oceans are so expansive that these are not significant threats. However, a slight pollution by thousands of fishing vessels every day results in a massive disturbance. And water pollution has grave consequences to both aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms.\nWe may dismiss overfishing as a harmless practice oblivious to the fact that it is causing untold harm to the world’s ocean and marine life. Overfishing depletes the population of adult fish and doesn’t leave enough fish to reproduce and replenish their dwindling numbers. This can be attributed to poor fisheries management, unsustainable fishing, economic needs, as well as illegal and unregulated fishing. And its effects include marine life imbalance, loss of income, and harvesting of endangered marine species.\nPhoto by: pixabay\nLatest posts by Sonia Madaan (see all)\n- Raised Floor System: The Need for Adaptive Whole Building Design - January 13, 2020\n- Sustainability Matters to Long Term Guests - December 5, 2019\n- 25+ Disturbing Facts About Water Wastage That Will Leave You Highly Disturbed - December 1, 2019"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f8f1ff94-31d6-49a6-b134-4112674c4ef8>","<urn:uuid:14da101e-6008-4330-b50e-0e7c2b52be04>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the two main approaches to achieving nuclear fusion (magnetic confinement and inertial confinement) differ in their technical challenges, and what parallels can we draw with the infrastructure challenges facing electric vehicle adoption in urban versus rural areas?","answer":"The two fusion approaches face distinct technical challenges: magnetic confinement fusion uses tokamak chambers with magnetic fields to contain plasma, while inertial confinement fusion uses laser-driven shockwaves to compress tiny fuel pellets. Each has specific limitations - tokamaks struggle to reach ignition despite longer containment times, while NIF's approach achieves higher pressures but only for trillionths of a second. Similarly, EV infrastructure faces different challenges across locations - while urban areas are beginning to adapt with anti-idling laws and charging stations, rural areas lag behind in charging infrastructure. This rural-urban divide is particularly problematic for companies like Amazon and UPS that need to service both areas, leading to initiatives like the National Highway Charging Collaborative's plan to install charging stations at 4,000 highway-side locations.","context":["Last week, politicians and leaders met in Glasgow for COP26 to iron out policies that might alleviate the climate crisis. Because the need for energy is fueling that crisis, it might be tempting to look at the burning sun and wonder whether we could do what it does—that is, nuclear fusion.\nScientists have been trying for decades to achieve fusion. Actually doing so, though, requires overcoming an immense number of logistical challenges. Although fusion is a science that moves slowly, scientists are inching ever closer to achieving the dream.\nThey’re splitting their efforts between two types of fusion reactors. One approach goes big and tries to trigger fusion in a room-size chamber. The other goes small and tries to do the same in a pin-size pellet. But both, ultimately, try to mimic what happens in the sun.\nOur star produces its immense heat and blinding light by fusing hydrogen atoms, which crunch together to create helium and an incredible amount of energy. That’s what fusion researchers ultimately want to do: If we could create even a pale shadow of a star on Earth, that would open the door to incredible amounts of clean energy.\nThese are the two most promising approaches.\nThe sun can fuse hydrogen atoms with ease because of the infernal conditions in its center. At temperatures of tens of millions of degrees, atoms overcome the electromagnetic forces naturally keeping them apart. They fuse. That reaction produces no greenhouse gases.\nAt such temperatures, the atoms are so hot that they lose their electrons and become a scalding soup of electrically charged particles, called plasma. By applying electric and magnetic fields, scientists can manipulate and stir this soup.\nCreating plasma on Earth is doable. But that’s only the first step. Next, physicists must compress the plasma into sufficiently high densities. One way to do this is to put the plasma in a harsh magnetic cage. That’s called magnetic confinement fusion.\nThe best-known vessel for this method is the tokamak: a doughnut-shaped chamber typically about as large as a medium-size room. The walls of the chamber are home to powerful magnets, which help corral the plasma until it reaches the densities high enough for fusion to launch.\n[Related: Humans just generated nuclear energy akin to a star]\nFusion’s long-sought goal is a threshold called “ignition,” when the reactor puts out more energy than required to start it—a necessary benchmark to make a fusion power plant viable. But even though magnetic confinement fusion has been around since the 1950s, so far, no such reactor has come close to that mark.\nBut that date, scientists hope, may be in sight. Under construction, nestled in the hills of the south of France, is the largest and most powerful tokamak the world has ever seen: the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER. Its tokamak will be ten times roomier than today’s largest. Having been in the works for more than a decade, ITER hopes to begin operations in 2025. It’s been called the most expensive science experiment ever.\nPartway around the world from France, in August 2021, another sort of reaction was underway. At the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, scientists announced they’d conducted fusion at an efficiency so high it nearly reached ignition.\nThere is no tokamak in NIF’s successful experiment. Instead, NIF uses a type of reaction called inertial confinement fusion. This relies on taking a tiny pellet of hydrogen fuel, typically the size of a pinhead, and jolting it with powerful shockwaves. As those shockwaves wash over the pellet, they compress and broil the hydrogen inside to pressures and temperatures high enough for fusion to launch.\n[Related: We still don’t really know what’s inside the sun—but that could change very soon]\nPhysicists can create those shockwaves in multiple ways, but nearly all of them rely on aiming high-energy lasers at the pellet. Some facilities directly blast the pellet with those lasers. NIF, instead, converts the laser’s energy into X-rays, which in turn strike the pellet.\nThat takes more energy, but it also makes the setup less delicate and more manageable by giving scientists just a little more leeway to work with. “The process of getting one of these things to compress…is very finicky. Everything has to be really, extremely precise,” says Doug Larson, NIF director.\nNIF and its counterparts can create immense pressures, more than is possible in a tokamak—but the pressures in a tokamak last much longer.\n“On NIF, we can create pressures up to something like a hundred billion atmospheres—really, really, crazy extreme pressures—but these things exist in our target chamber for trillionths of a second,” says Larson.\nNIF is the only inertial confinement fusion facility of its size, although other such facilities, such as the Laser Mégajoule in Bordeaux, France, and the proposed Shenguang IV in China, may one day match it.\nA sunnier future for fusion?\nPhysicists say it’s an exciting time in the world of fusion. “Over the past year, a lot of understanding has kind of come together in a way that the progress has really accelerated” at NIF, says Larson.\nFusion reactors offer the promise of near-unlimited power–but they are far from an immediate remedy to the climate crisis. The August experiment at NIF relied on a laser that can pulse every few hours, for instance. But for an inertial confinement fusion power plant to be commercially viable, says Larson, that laser needs to fire every few seconds. NIF plans to upgrade that laser.\nAs for ITER, the giant tokamak under construction in France, it’s only an intermediate step toward making fusion power feasible. Its builders hope the knowledge from ITER will improve the next generation fusion reactors, called the Demonstration Fusion Power Plant, or DEMO. DEMO, they hope, might be what brings fusion to the people. Those power plants won’t start construction until the 2030s.","Electric vehicles (EVs) hold a lot of promise for the private sector — especially as consumers, who are increasingly aware of the relationship between emissions and climate change, are starting to demand eco-friendly delivery options. EV adoption, however, has been slowed down by a few different challenges — the US’s poor EV charging infrastructure in particular.\nNow, however, we’re beginning to see signs that major businesses are willing to buy into EVs, despite potential road bumps.\nHere are the businesses that are leading the way when it comes to EV adoption.\nAmazon and UPS Lead Way on EV Adoption\nTwo delivery giants — Amazon and UPS — have begun to aggressively add EVs to their delivery fleets.\nEarlier this year in January, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from EV manufacturer Rivian, as well as 10,000 electric delivery rickshaws for their operations in India. Then, around the end of the month, UPS announced that it had ordered 10,000 electric trucks from the UK-based manufacturer Arrival Ltd., and would soon be teaming up with self-driving car manufacturer Waymo for a pilot test of self-driving delivery vehicles.\nThe moves are part of broader pushes towards carbon neutrality and self-driving delivery by the two companies. Last year, Amazon announced the company’s plan to be 100 percent carbon-neutral by the year 2040. UPS already offers carbon-neutral and carbon-offset delivery options.\nThe moves also come as more cities around the U.S., including New York and Philadelphia., have begun to adopt anti-idling laws that allow the city to fine companies over idling delivery vehicles.\nSome cities have even developed apps that allow citizens to report idling vehicles based on that vehicle’s DOT number — making these policies even more costly for delivery companies. Because electric vehicles produce no emissions, they’re typically free from being fined — meaning savings for businesses that adopt EVs for city deliveries.\nThe announcements are both historic. While other companies have announced EV purchases — like Lyft, which plans to deploy 200 EVs in Denver as part of its rental vehicle program there — there’s been nothing near scale of these announced by Amazon and UPS.\nWhile neither UPS nor Amazon has plans to go fully electric any time soon, the purchases are a welcome sign for the EV industry. Coupled with similar positive signals from the individual consumer side of the industry, they likely demonstrate that despite early growing pains, EVs may be on track for widespread adoption in the near future.\nChallenges Facing Further EV Adoption\nHowever, there still remain significant barriers that may slow or prevent full EV adoption, primarily the weak EV charging infrastructure in the US and limited number of charging stations — although this, too, seems like it’s starting to change.\nChargePoint, in coalition with the National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO) has formed the National Highway Charging Collaborative, which plans to install new charging stations at more than 4,000 highway-side locations in the U.S., in order to increase the availability of EV charging stations in rural areas.\nAt the same time, legislative support for stronger EV infrastructure is beginning to build. In February, Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives announced a new bill that would create a nationwide EV charging network within the next five years.\nUpgrades to existing infrastructure would likely encourage further adoption. They may also be especially beneficial for businesses like Amazon and UPS, as both companies regularly make deliveries to rural parts of the country — areas that don’t always have the charging infrastructure needed to support EVs.\nThe Future for EVs in Business\nEV adoption in the private sector, which has lagged in the past, seems to be accelerating. Two major delivery companies have now announced that they will be adding significant numbers of EVs to their delivery fleets, with more likely to come in the near future as both pursue low-carbon delivery options.\nWhile challenges remain that may slow down EV adoption — primarily the nation’s weak EV charging infrastructure — the purchases are likely a good sign for the industry and the future of EVs in the private sector."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:16df7f09-ea5a-439a-acfa-30e0694ca11b>","<urn:uuid:a3b2914f-bfcd-4107-a76d-db9ca5d880cd>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Western mindfulness vs traditional Jhana practice - what are the key differences in how these approaches are used and viewed in Buddhism?","answer":"While Western Buddhism has embraced mindfulness as a key meeting point with modern culture, applying it broadly to mental health treatments and daily living activities as part of a 'mindfulness boom', traditional Jhana practice is a more structured and comprehensive meditative system. Jhana involves progressive states of concentration requiring elimination of five specific hindrances and cultivation of positive mental states, eventually leading to deep meditative absorption (Samadhi). Traditional Jhana practice is seen as a transformative spiritual discipline aimed at achieving specific verifiable mental states, whereas Western mindfulness applications tend to focus more on practical benefits and modern living applications while being just one aspect of Buddhist practice.","context":["Home Dharma Dew\nHow western Buddhism has changed in 50 years\nby Vishvapani Blomfield, The Guardian, March 16, 2012\nA western Buddhist shares 10 insights into how the religion and its followers have moved on since its arrival in the west\nLondon, UK -- It's 50 years since Buddhist teachers started arriving in the west in the early 60s and Buddhism crash-landed into the counterculture. So what have we learned about western Buddhism?\n<< Gathering of the largest number of American Buddhist teachers at any one time, held in June 2011 at the Garrison Institute. Photo courtesy of Roshi Joan Halifax\n1. It's not all about enlightenment. Many who found Buddhism in the 60s saw nirvana as the ultimate peak experience. A decade later these recovering hippies were painfully finding out that Buddhism is more concerned with reshaping character and behaviour than big, mystical experiences. Younger Buddhists are often more fired by social action than mysticism.\n2. It doesn't focus on monks. In most Asian countries Buddhist monks are the real practitioners, focusing on meditation and study while lay people support them. Distinctions between monks and lay people does not fit in with modern society and western monastic orders are relatively scarce. Non-monastic practitioners are often very serious and they power the various Buddhist movements.\n3. Tibetan Buddhism has baggage. Tibetan lamas arriving in the 1970s seemed to fulfil our Shangri-La fantasies. But, along with inspiration and wisdom, they also brought sectarian disputes, shamanism, the \"reincarnate lama\" (tulku) system, tantric practices and deep conservatism. Westerners love Tibetans, but we notice the baggage.\n4. The schools are mixing together. Most Asian Buddhist teachers assumed they would establish their existing schools in western countries. Hence we have western Zen, western Theravada etc. But the boundaries are breaking down as western Buddhists, motivated by common needs, explore the whole Buddhist tradition. The emerging western Buddhist world is essentially non-denominational.\n5. People take what they need, not what they're given. For all the talk of lineage, transmission and the purity of the teachings, western Buddhism is driven by students' needs as much as teachers' wishes.\n6. Mindfulness is where Buddhism and the west meet. Buddhist mindfulness practices are being applied to everything from mental health treatments to eating out, and we're now seeing a \"mindfulness boom\". These approaches apply core Buddhist insights to modern living, making this the biggest development in western Buddhism since the 1960s. It will probably shape the next 50 years.\n7. But it's not the only meeting point. The mindfulness movement is hyped as the \"new Buddhism for the west\". But, unless you're following the noble onefold path, there's more to Buddhism than mindfulness. Buddhist influence on western culture is strong in the arts, social action, environmentalism, psychotherapy and practitioners' lives.\n8. Westerners can meditate and maybe even get enlightened. Numerous Buddhists I know who have been practising for several decades have made the teachings their own. Westerners can definitely do Buddhism, and are its future.\n9. But sex doesn't go away. Scandals and anguished life stories show that, even for people who prize celibacy, sex doesn't go away. Is this really a surprise?\n10. And we still don't know if western Buddhism is secular or religious. A growing movement (as Julian Baggini has discussed) wishes to strip Buddhism of \"superstitious\" elements such as karma and rebirth to distil a secular Buddhism that's compatible with science. That raises a big question: does following science mean ditching enlightenment? Is Buddhism an alternative source of authority that challenges the west? Ask me again in 50 years.","Jhana, The Rapturous State of Stillness in Buddhist Meditation Practice\nSummary: This is a comprehensive essay on Buddhist Jhanas, the meditative states experienced by the Buddhist monks during their practice of Right Concentration on the Eightfold Path\nBuddhism is a practical religion. Its philosophy and practice are rooted in the mundane lives of common people who are subject to transience and suffering. The Buddha presented his teachings in clear terms, and set achievable and verifiable goals so that there was little scope for ambiguity or speculation. Therefore, Buddhism sets itself apart from the speculative philosophies and complex theologies of other religions.\nFor the same reason, although you may find identical words in Hinduism and Buddhism, they may not carry the same meaning, intent or purpose. Hinduism is primarily focused upon the eternal Self (Atman) and Buddhism upon the objective reality or the not-Self (Anatma). Hence, they fundamentally differ in their interpretation of various spiritual concepts and experiences.\nFor example, liberation in Buddhism does not mean immortality. It only means liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. Buddhism does not believe in the eternality of anything, nor does it view the world as unreal or illusory. The illusion arises in the mind due to unwholesome thoughts, desires and expectations. Buddhism also acknowledges the existence of devas (gods) in heavenly realm, but does not consider them to be immortal or immutable.\nAnother important concept where Buddhism differs from others is Samadhi. Samadhi in Buddhism does not mean absorption in the eternal self, but absorption within the mind or entering the unified states of awareness in which neither any thought nor emotion nor any other modification of the mind remains active.\nTo achieve this state, Buddhism prescribes the attainment of Jhanas through the transformative practices such as right actions, right thinking, right awareness, right concentration, etc., on the Eightfold Path. In the following discussion we focus upon the importance of Jhanas in Buddhist meditative practices and their distinguishing features.\nJhana is the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit word Dhayna. In Hinduism Dhyana refers to the practice of meditation or contemplation, which can be done with or without concentration. However, in Buddhism Jhana refers to both concentrated meditation and any meditative state which arises from it. In Buddhism, the practice of Jhana forms part of the Right Concentration on the Eightfold Path. By practising it one overcomes the hindrances of unwholesome and evil states of the mind and attains one pointedness, peace and happiness.\nThe practice of Jhana has a great significance in Buddhism. It is central to many Buddhist Practices. The Buddha constantly advised his followers to practice Jhanas to attain Nirvana. Jhana is also frequently mentioned in many Buddhist texts. They attest to its popularity and importance in Buddhist spiritual practices.\nThe Buddha identified four progressive states of Jhanas, which arise from the practice of Right Concentration and which lead to meditative absorption (Samadhi). He also explained their characteristic features and how to identify them and distinguish them. From the Buddhist perspective, Jhana (Concentrated meditation) is neither an abstract concept nor an aesthetic, mental exercise. It is a transformative practice, which is difficult but practicable. Regular practice of jhana leads to verifiable and distinguishable mental states, which can be discerned to know the progress one has made.\nThe Jhanas are attained by a two-pronged approach. One is by eliminating the unwholesome factors, which need to be removed to purify the mind such as negative thoughts and emotions, and the other is by cultivating factors that need to be acquired such as positive thoughts and states of mind. However, as we see later, when a monk advances into the higher Jhanas, he has to abandon even the positive aspects of the mind to end up with just one unified mental state in which one-pointedness, equanimity, discernment, sameness, etc., work in tandem.\nTo enter the first state of Jhana, the initiate has to begin the journey by abandoning the five hindrances (pañcanivarana) so that he can experience five positive states or modifications. These too he has to abandon as he advances into higher states, so that in the end he remains with nothing but sheer discernment (buddhi). The five hindrances are sensual desire (kama), ill will (vyapada), sloth and torpor ((thina and middha), restlessness and worry (uddhaca and kukkucca), and doubt (vicikiccha). Detailed description of the Jhanas is found many Buddhist texts. The Buddha himself described them to the monks for guidance. A brief description of the same is provided in the following section.\nThe first Jhana\nThe Buddha: “There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.”\nExplanation: The practitioner enters the first jhana when he wholly gives up the aforementioned five hindrances or unwholesome states of mind and cultivates the five “factors of possession” or the mental features that need to be cultivated. They are the directed thought (vitarka), evaluative thought (vichara), one pointedness (ekagrata), rapture (priti) and happiness (sukham). To attain this the practitioner has to follow a strict monastic discipline and live in a suitable dwelling place amidst likeminded people. It may be noted that vitarka and vicara are differently defined by different scholars. As their names suggest vitarka is associated with controlled thought, and vicara with analysis and evaluation. Together, they represent the whole thought process.\nThe second Jhana\nThe Buddha: \"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.”\nExplanation: When he is fully stabilized in the first Jhana and perfected the five factors of possession, with mastery in strengthening, attaining and sustaining those factors (which may involve considerable time), the practitioner qualifies to enter the second Jhana. In this stage, he has to abandon both types of thought so as to silence the mind and free it from all thoughts, and remain stabilized in the remaining three factors of possession namely rapture, pleasure and one pointedness. With the mind freed from thoughts, with unified and one-pointed awareness, and with the feelings of assuredness, composure, confidence and tranquility which arises from it, he experiences rapture and pleasure as they permeate and pervade his whole body. Thus, in this Jhana out of the five factors of possession, only three are retained.\nThe third Jhana\nThe Buddha: “And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains in equanimity, mindful and alert, and physically sensitive to pleasure. He enters and remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.'”\nExplanation: After mastering the second Jhana in different ways and having succeeded in attaining, strengthening, sustaining the three factors of it, the practitioner is now ready to practice and enter the third Jhana. In this state, he comes to realize that rapture is also a form of unwholesome disturbance only and needs to be abandoned or eliminated to advance further into the deeper states of stability and tranquility. Thereby, he cultivates indifference towards it. To achieve mastery in its practice, he resorts to mindfulness (sati), sameness or equanimity (upeksha) and discernment (samprajnata). Thus in this state, out of the five factors of possession, only two are retained and the rest are abandoned as unwholesome.\nThe Fourth Jhana\nThe Buddha: \"And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain.”\nExplanation: The Fourth Jhana begins with the realization that one cannot completely abandon rapture without abandoning happiness. Since both are interlinked and have close affinity, the initiate realizes that since it is difficult not to experience rapture when one is happy, he is vulnerable to the risk of falling back to the previous Jhana and remaining stuck there. Further, he also realizes that abiding in prolonged happiness may lead to habitual clinging, which in itself is an unwholesome hindrance. Therefore, contemplating upon the state of equanimity or sameness and abandoning happiness along with its accompanying physical and mental feelings, he enters the four Jhana. With the neutral feeling of sameness firmly established in his mind in the place of happiness, with peace and stability reigning his mind, he abides in unified awareness more than ever. Having abandoned happiness, pleasure and pain, he practices unwavering concentration. Thus, in this Jhana, he retains only one pointedness, with equanimity and pure mindfulness (parisuddha sati), and abandons the remaining factors of possession as gross and unwholesome.\nThe subtle Jhanas\nThe Jhanas are usually four, since it is not practically possible to abandon one pointedness also and practice discernment. Once the four Jhanas are attained, there is nothing else to be abandoned or attained. The practitioner’s unified mental state becomes stabilized, without the risk of reversal or falling back. He cannot easily be disturbed or tempted with unwholesome thoughts and distractions.\nHowever, it is not the end of the road. The Buddha described the fifth state of concentration as the practice of one pointed concentration which is refined, improved and perfected with discernment. It arises from the attainment of the four Jhanas. The Buddha also spoke about the supernatural powers that arise from the perfection one achieves in the fivefold practice of Right Concentration.\nApart from the four Jhanas, the Buddhist texts also refer to four subtle Jhanas or non-material Jhanas, which are named after their respective objects of concentration. They are, mindfulness of space (akasa chetana), mindfulness of consciousness (Vijnana chetana), mindfulness of emptiness (akincana chetana), and mindfulness of neither perception nor non-perception (nevasaññana saññayatana). Some describe them as variations or modes of the fourth Jhana.\nFrom the names ascribed to them, it becomes clear that in these Jhanas the objects of the concentration are fixed, unlike in the previous Jhanas where one may choose different objects to practice concentration. The factor of possession, one-pointedness, also remains constant since it cannot be abandoned. The four objects of concentration are also progressively subtler. For example, consciousness is subtler than space, emptiness subtler than consciousness, and that which is neither perception nor non-perception is even more subtler than emptiness. By practising concentration on the subtle objects, one reaches the end of the objective world, the not-Self and attains the indescribable state of Nirvana.\nSuggestions for Further Reading\n- Right Concentration on The Eightfold Path of Buddhism\n- What is Dhyana?

{"question":"What are the best practices for managing cognitive load in educational content, and what are the risks of using attention-grabbing elements in learning materials?","answer":"Best practices for managing cognitive load include chunking information hierarchically from simple to complex, eliminating repetition, using mnemonics for memorization, and providing pre-work opportunities. Graphics should be designed with appropriate colors to ease distraction, and related visual and auditory content should be synchronized. As for the risks of attention-grabbing elements, research demonstrates significant negative impacts. When seductive augmentations are added to multimedia narrated animations, there's an average reduction of 19% in recall and 33% in problem-solving transfer. Arousal for cognitive tasks should be kept low to maintain learners' full attention on the subject matter. Any augmentation that diverts cognitive processing away from the core learning material can be detrimental to learning outcomes.","context":["Remember the old joke about goldfish memory? Not too long ago, it was thought that a goldfish had a 3-second long-term memory (This has since been disputed). The joke centers around a conversation that occurs as two goldfish are swimming around their bowl:\nGoldfish 1: oooh look, a castle.\nGoldfish 2: what's a castle?\nGoldfish 1: dunno, why d'ya ask?\nGoldfish 2: ask what?\nGoldfish 1: hey look, a castle.\nDuring the 1980s, cognitive load theory was born from the extensive research produced by John Sweller in the area of problem solving. We won’t get into the nuts and bolts of the cognitive load research here, but you are welcome to read Sweller as well as the duo of Richard Mayer and Roxana Moreno. Overall, the theory of cognitive load suggests that learning happens best under conditions that are beneficial to the human’s own cognitive structure. Yes, cognitive load can be an “individual thing,” but there still are common techniques that we, as instructional designers, can use across the board. One simple method is allowing the learner to self-pace so that they can digest the information within their own cognitive structure. Most of us look at memory using three easy terms: Short-term, long-term and working. The cognitive load theory looks into memory as intrinsic extraneous and germane.\nExtraneous cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner. This is short term memory. Obviously, this can be altered depending upon how one presents the material. It is up to the instructional designer to alter extraneous cognitive load so that the intrinsic won’t be overloaded. Things like unnecessary information, animations or images that don’t line up with the instruction, too much information or poorly designed training may cause an overload in the working memory and will negatively affect the learner’s storage of information.The intrinsic cognitive load refers to the effort that it takes to understand a certain topic. This is working memory, where content is being learned. The content is the content…it cannot be altered. The best example of this is a mathematical formula or, perhaps, music.\nSpeaking of storing information, germane cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a schema. Yes, this is long term memory and it can be altered as well. Germane cognitive load contributes to learning in that it can affect the other two elements. For example, as instructional designers we may request prerequisite knowledge from the learner to place them in beginner, intermediate or advanced academic levels. However, it is tapping into one’s long-term memory storage. This may create “extra information” that would contribute to extraneous cognitive load.\nAs you can see, managing cognitive load is like a high-wire act. You have to put the right information out there in such a way that it reduces extraneous cognitive load, which will allow the information to be processed in such a way so that the intrinsic and germane loads can facilitate schema acquisition. Now if you understood what I just said, and you began reading this article as a novice, bravo! You’ve just witnessed cognitive load!\nExcuse the pun, but it’s a “no-brainer” that extraneous and intrinsic loads need to be reduced in order for the learner to absorb, because the long-term memory is waiting to take it all in. Yes, we want to maximize the germane!\nSo here are some things to remember (or put aside and go back to later so you don’t experience intrinsic load):\n- Use audio, when available, to reduce working memory. Having people read contributes to intrinsic load.\n- Now that you’re using audio, reduce text. Do not place your script on the slide and have it read to the learner. You can bullet point major points as the script is read. How do I know this? By sitting through a Cognitive Load Theory presentation and having the slides read to me by the instructor. Irony of ironies.\n- Use visuals. Make them reflective of what is being learned, not just to include them to make it “look good.” Place them close to the corresponding text.\n- Learn graphic design. Synchronize the related visual and auditory content to appear together. Use colors that ease distraction. Even just the foundations of graphic design can help your layout in such a manner that reduces cognitive load.\n- One quote that has been attributed to Albert Einstein, as well as many others: “I really don’t remember all of these things, I just know where to look them up.” Review your learning and ask, “What should the learner commit to memory and what should they resource?” Then fill the resource file with job-aids and such.\n- Want to eliminate extraneous cognitive load? Eliminate repetition and redundancy, eliminate repetition and redundancy, eliminate repetition and redundancy. It may be important for baseline knowledge, but it’s a lot more useful if you introduce new information and allow the learner to apply it. It’s called “practice.” That’s that “interactive” thing that we keep talking about.\n- Chunking: Sorry…I know you’ve heard this term a million times, but it doesn’t just mean breaking down the learning into smaller, more memorable pieces. It also means to organize the chunks in a hierarchical manner (simple to complex) so that they are easier to remember.\n- Is there an opportunity to allow the learner to “learn before learning?” If so, give them a little pre-work before they take your lesson.\n- Do they need to memorize something? Use mnemonics when you can.\nOverall, be the goldfish and QC your course with this in mind: “If there is too much going on in your design, then the learner won’t learn.”","One of the most important, difficult and common decisions that designers of learning make is whether to add interesting text, sounds, or visuals to learning material. We want to arouse interest,curiosity, engagement but it’s important to know when these elements seduce learners and when they become a distraction.\nLearning Design and The Art of Seduction\nThe first step in our seduction process is arousal. We can arouse interest in our learning solutions in 3 ways mentally, emotionally and physically.\nThe Impact of Pedagogical Agents\nA pedagogical agent is considered to have higher social presence than other online mediated media because pedagogical agents provide emotional context, which can lead to affective arousal\nBeware The Anti Climax\nIt’s so easy to arrive at a disappointing end to an impressive series of events. It takes just one developer to create an anti climax by not realising how carefully the art of seduction has been thought through and failing to embrace it with inappropriate misleading, or irrelevant content.\nIn multimedia learning, seductive detail is usually called seductive augmentation the term seductive augmentation refers to text graphics,narratives, voice, and animation, with the purpose of arousing a learner’s interest\nA wonderful piece of research provided by Will Thalheimer helps us to understand the impact of seductive augmentation on learning recall and retention:\nWhen adding additional elements to content that has been designed to describe or explain something there was an average reduction in recall of 47%\nWhen adding photos/illustrations alone to content that has been designed to describe or explain something. There was an average reduction of 42% for recall and 34% for transfer\nWhen adding photos/illustrations and printed seductive details there was an average reduction of 65% for recall, 56% for transfer\nWhen adding visuals or printed or narrated seductive details to multimedia narrated animations Narrated Seductive Details to Multimedia Narrated Animations – 4 of 6 comparisons showed a seductive augmentation effect for recall of main ideas. 6 of 6 showed an effect for problem-solving transfer. Average reduction is 19% for recall, 33% for transfer\nTo summarise……When learners are faced with seductive augmentations, they seem to have difficulty creating the memory structures they would need for longer retention\nWhat is interesting is that the seductive augmentation effect does not occur when printed seductive details were added to to Narrative Biographical Text 6 of 6 comparisons showed no seductive augmentation effect.\nArousal factors that are beneficial to learning\nAs a blended learning designer I am aware that arousal for cognitive tasks must be kept low this is because you need the learners’ full attention on the subject matter but that’s not to say the learning that is presented should be bland.items such as labelled illustrations or questions added to text helps learners with both recall and problem solving transfer tasks.\nIt’s not any augmentation that will hurt learning. It is only those that divert the learners’ cognitive processing away from the information that should be learned.\nResearch and Credits\nThalheimer, W. (2004, November).

{"question":"How do South African and EU approaches differ in implementing child-friendly justice systems and monitoring their effectiveness?","answer":"South Africa's system, while progressive on paper, lacks effective monitoring and implementation, with officials often poorly versed in children's specific vulnerabilities and protections, particularly regarding foreign children. The EU, however, has established systematic monitoring mechanisms and emphasizes the need to collect data to measure and monitor implementation at regular intervals. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights actively monitors children's access to justice to prevent discrimination, while South Africa's system struggles with short-term planning and implementation gaps that put children, especially foreign minors, at risk. The EU also focuses on interdisciplinary cooperation and training of professionals, while South Africa's system shows significant gaps in officials' understanding and application of relevant laws.","context":["Caught in a Catch-22: Child Migrants in South Africa – Are short-term plans and implementation gaps putting foreign children at risk?\nIn 2004, a court case brought by the Centre for Child Law reflected the severe challenges and restrictions that children face in the South African migration landscape. Responding to the detention of over 100 children at Lindela, including some who were illegally held with adults, the Pretoria High Court ruled that such detention of minors was unlawful and a shameful transgression against the children’s rights and interests. In spite of this, approximately 50 children have been discovered at Lindela since 2016.\nThe ongoing arrest and detention of foreign children underlines the need to address the adversity that they face upon entering South Africa, especially given that civil conflicts and trans-border migration have brought more and more child migrants into the country in recent years. Though South Africa has accepted international obligations to act in children’s best interests and arguably possesses one of the strongest and most progressive foreign child protection frameworks in Africa, severe gaps in implementation and interpretation often make foreign children’s long-term welfare an unattainable ideal rather than a reality.\nIn their recent review of the legal and political structures that deal with different categories of foreign children, Ncumisa Willie and Popo Mfubu highlight the deficiencies in the state asylum-seeking and child protection systems, drawing attention to the practical challenges that foreign children face in accessing documentation and social services. They find that the lack of long-term focus or flexibility in the current system especially hurts unaccompanied and separated foreign children, forcing them into a vulnerable “legal lacuna” or void as soon as they reach majority age. Here, it should be noted that a separated child may have a non-parent adult accompanying her, but an unaccompanied child has no adult with her. Across all foreign child categories – including accompanied foreign minors with refugee claims, as well as unaccompanied or separated children without them – it is concluded that children’s situations are approached in a narrow and short-sighted way that is crippled by poor understanding of the relevant laws among involved officials.\nAs a signatory of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, South Africa is internationally obligated to pass and implement laws for the realization of children’s interests. At the same time, Section 28 of the South African constitution establishes the duty to protect, fulfill, and promote children’s rights, and the 2005 Children’s Act gives effect to those rights and sets principles for children’s care and protection. As neither document distinguishes between foreign and South African children, South Africa is duty-bound to protect all children regardless of nationality or status . Moreover, under the 1998 Refugees Act, the Children’s Court can order that a child with a valid refugee claim be assisted in applying for asylum and documentation. In theory, several basic steps are followed when a foreign minor is discovered. While identifying the nature of the child’s situation, it is determined whether she is unaccompanied or separated from her parents or guardians; if so, she is assumed to require care and protection and arrangements are made to improve her situation. Also, if she is found to have a strong refugee claim, involved officials help her to apply for refugee status documents. Meanwhile, the child’s social worker should find out both why she left the home country, why she is alone, and whether there are parents, caregivers, or extended family members able to care for her and provide for her needs. The child is reunited with these relatives if they are found and if repatriation serves her best interests. Otherwise, alternative care arrangements are recommended to the Children’s Court. Throughout this process and afterward (if alternative care is necessary), the child can be placed in foster care, temporary safe care, a Child and Youth Care Centre, or other forms of care.\nUnfortunately, children navigating this process face a host of challenges in accessing social and economic services, applying for documentation, and securing their long-term future wellbeing. Unaccompanied children often remain undocumented because status determination officers assume that they can only deal with children as dependents of an adult or part of a family. The same is true for unaccompanied/separated children without refugee claims, who are dealt with under the Immigration Act and cannot receive permits because they are not traveling as dependents of an adult. Across both the Refugees and Immigration Act, this practice leaves unaccompanied children with no place to turn in seeking documents. The lack of documents can then bar them from accessing education, healthcare, and other services, as well as leave at risk for detention and arrest. Additional problems include social workers and other officials’ failure to account for child-specific refugee claims (such as risks of forced service as child soldiers or forced child marriage) and a short-sighted emphasis on children’s placement in secure but temporary care. Lacking documentation and often considered resolved cases as soon as\nthey are placed in a safe environment, unaccompanied children lose all protection once they come of age. Overnight, they are shunted from enjoying safety and protection under the Children’s Act to suffering risks of being arrested, detained, and deported as illegal migrants.\nSeparated foreign children with refugee claims face many of the same problems in gaining documentation, though they are not specifically catered for in the Refugees Act. According to court precedent, however, every separated child should be documented as soon as possible, with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) helping the child with her asylum application before the Children’s Court releases its findings. The unfortunate reality is that in practice, the DHA often leaves children undocumented and vulnerable while the Children’s Court performs the inquiry. Meanwhile, accompanied foreign children with refugee claims are considered under their parents’ asylum applications as dependents. This means that a refugee minor is only able to apply for derivative asylum status and cannot have her independent asylum application adjudicated. Then, once she reaches 18 and is no longer a dependent, she can only stay in the country if she applies for asylum in her own right and receives a valid permit. To do this, she must base her application on the refugee claim that she possessed when first entering the country, which is often no longer reliable grounds for status.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nWhether a child can be classified as unaccompanied, separated, or accompanied, and whether she has a refugee claim or not, she faces a number of barriers in securing a stable future in South Africa. Willie and Mfubu make a number of recommendations for better implementation and adaptation of the political and legal frameworks, urging measures that will more effectively serve children’s best interests and futures. In the current situation, the intensive focus on short-term social welfare for undocumented and unaccompanied children has a large consequence: especially in the long-term, the children are denied access to services such as health care and education and suffer the risk of being arrested and deported. The children’s position as foreign nationals and lack of documentation are held against them when they try to access their rights\nand services. Children’s Court officials and social workers are poorly versed in the children’s specific vulnerabilities as foreigners and the full protections they are entitled to. Within the legal framework of children’s protections, a step to remedy this could be to insert the clause “irrespective of nationality” and mentions of unaccompanied/separated foreign children in the Children’s Act. Moreover, when evaluating whether a child needs care or protection, the DSD should be more systematic in determining whether the child needs legal documents, recognizing that a lack of documents makes the child more vulnerable to exploitation or unlawful detention. The Children’s Court should likewise play a more active role in deciding whether a child needs care and protection and in enlisting legal experts to provide input about a child’s qualification as a refugee. Overall, implementation of the frameworks in place must shift from a short term emphasis on children’s\nimmediate welfare and temporary care to forward-looking efforts that prioritize children’s need for documentation and recognize the distinct vulnerabilities and claims to residency in the country that children have. Until this transition effectively takes place, the present and future security of child migrants and asylum seekers is in jeopardy.","Written by Anna Dimitrova-Stull, Ulla Jurviste and Irene Penas Dendariena,\nEvery year hundreds of thousands of children across the EU are involved in judicial proceedings. They may enter into contact with justice systems in many different ways: for family issues such as divorce or adoption, in administrative justice for immigration or nationality matters or in criminal justice, as victims, witnesses or suspects/offenders. It is essential that they are met with a system that respects both their particular vulnerability and their rights. To that purpose, a set of international standards has been developed to ensure that children are heard and protected in the process.\nThe EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) reveals that child participation practices in the EU vary not just across but also within Member States, and these practices are not always child-friendly. It points out that in recent years respect of the child’s right to be heard has improved particularly in criminal proceedings but in civil ones children are not always heard. There is a need to ensure that children’s access to justice and their treatment in legal proceedings is effectively monitored to prevent any discrimination, says FRA.\nIn January 2016, the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) endorsed the agreement reached by the Parliament and the Council last December to set new rules designed to make legal protection of children who are suspected or accused of a crime more consistent within the EU, providing a set of rights that meet their specific needs.

Use this directory to find criminal justice scholarships that are right for you using various filter criteria. Some scholarships are only available to specific segments of the population. For example, high school students are only available to those who are a certain number of years into their criminal justice degree programs. So, take advantage of the sorting options below to customize your search.\nFor example, choose the minimum GPA for the scholarship and display only those scholarships for which you qualify. You can also decide what sort of sponsorship the displayed scholarships have. Such as school-sponsored scholarships and state-sponsored scholarships to ensure you receive the available funds at your school. If you are only interested in renewable scholarships, you can also sort those out. Finally, you can filter based on ethnicity, as many scholarships are only available to those of a particular ethnic heritage.\nYou can find other online scholarship opportunities by using search engines and approaching colleges you would like to go to. Some employers may also be willing to sponsor your studies in an offline or online criminal justice program. However, this resource is designed to save you time and effort by compiling some of the top criminal justice scholarships in one place.\nIdentify Trends in Criminal Justice Scholarships\nMost scholarships for criminal justice majors focus on students who have already finished an undergraduate degree. Also, the students who intend to use their criminal justice degrees to pursue graduate-level law programs.

Three sites (BL88, RFSB and SCCB) consist of a strong-motion accelerometer and a 24-bit digital data logger. The ocean-bottom station MOBB is equipped with a three component broadband seismometer with integrated digitizer and a differential pressure gauge (DPG).Most BDSN stations have Streckeisen STS-1 or STS-2 three-component broadband sensors (Wielandt and Streckeisen, 1982; Wielandt and Steim, 1986).\nData from all BDSN stations are transmitted to UC Berkeley using continuous telemetry, including the ocean-bottom site, MOBB. In order to avoid data loss during utility disruptions, each site has batteries to supply power for three days. The combination of high-dynamic range sensors and digital data loggers ensures that the BDSN has the capability to record the full range of earthquake motion required for source and structure studies.\nTypical Recorded Channels\nNetwork State of Health\nAs part of routine quality control, the results of continuously performed power spectral density (PSD) analyses are available on the Internet (http://www.ncedc.org/ncedc/PDF/).

Considered by many to be an Australian icon, Murphy was the artistic director of Sydney Dance Company for 31 years. But he is equally renowned for his work in the realm of classical ballet. To celebrate the 50th year since Murphy began his professional dance career, The Australian Ballet is celebrating all things Murphy with the opener to its 2018 season, titled, of all things, Murphy.\nBack in 1971, when he began his career in the corps de ballet of The Australian Ballet, Murphy never imagined that he would be in this position 50 years later. He has been lauded by The Australian Ballet as “an Australian dancemaker of unparalleled talent”, and a “master storyteller” with a “peerless place in Australian dance history” who has had an “incandescent career”.\n“When you’re a student, you’re full of wide eyed hope. I hoped to make it to soloist. I only made it to the rank of coryphée,” Murphy reveals. “But to have this happen? In my wildest dreams, and I had some wild dreams…never!”\nHe continues, “When David [McAllister] asked me, I was flattered and amazed. It doesn’t seem like 50 years. My life has flown joyously by. My connection with The Australian Ballet has always been there. Right from the Australian Ballet School days.”\nFrom the ranks of The Australian Ballet coryphée, Murphy took his first steps as a choreographer with The Australian Ballet’s Choreographic Workshop in 1971. From there, he has gone on to create countless works with Sydney Dance Company, The Australian Ballet, and dozens of other companies of international note. The program for Murphy will feature the full version of his retelling of Michel Fokine’s Firebird, along with excerpts from The Silver Rose, Air and Other Invisible Forces, Ellipse, Grand, and the complete Shéhérazade.\nMurphy initially created his version of Firebird in 2009. It was during a year-long celebration of legendary Ballets Russes, the company that staged and toured Fokine’s original Firebird.\n“I love the Stravinsky score,” Murphy says of the decision to create his own version, and to include it in Murphy. “I saw the original, and I wanted to take it on a journey and see what I could do with it.”\nAt 45 minutes long, Firebird will fill most of the hour-long program for Murphy. As you can imagine, it was a tough choice to decide what other works to include.\n“David [McAllister] gave me a choice of which works to choose for the 50 years,” Murphy explains. “I had an hour to fill, and had to choose from so many works. I could have made it 15 hours long. At one stage, we thought about selecting them chronologically. But when you try to put it all into an hour, it’s very hard. In the end, I thought about the dancers in The Australian Ballet and based the choices around their potential and that would challenge and inspire them. I didn’t want it to be an hour of snippets. I wanted there to be good hunks of works so the audience and dancers get a chance to be more involved in each work. They get to see a beautiful moment, and then their brain has to change gear for the next piece.”\nHe continues, “A lot of work I did in that period were full-length narrative works. But I needed to find a significant part of each one. Sometimes an individual character takes a journey, and I want to show a key point in that. Or sometimes it’s a couple of characters. But I also wanted to show large group pieces. And The Australian Ballet has so many dancers, so it’s possible to stage those group pieces. I also wanted variety, in the type of work but also the era of the work. The works we’ve selected are from the late ’70s into the 2000s. The next step is to take that original movement and put it on different bodies than the original ones. Sometimes a work is made on bodies that are very special. David, Janet [Vernon] and I sat down to work out the casting. I’ve worked with the company so much that I’m very aware of who is in the company. It’s a bit like choosing from a chocolate box. It will be fun. A couple of works are really monstrous and driving. But dancers do love a challenge. I find that they enjoy being pushed to work harder and higher.”\nIn his half century as a choreographer, Murphy has seen the expectations of both dancers and dance works skyrocket.\n“People don’t realise dance is about evolution, choreographically and physically. Standards go through the roof with each generation. It’s not just physical. The level of artistry grows. Just to be in The Australian Ballet company, you need amazing strength, power and the ability to do incredible tricks. Then you have to add artistry on top of that. Amazing tricks catch the audience’s eye, but when the technique and artistry mix, then you have someone that will be a really big star.”\nHe has had his share of opportunity to work with those big stars, including Nureyev, Baryshnikov and Fonteyn. Closer to home, Murphy mentions Madeleine Eastoe from The Australian Ballet and, of course, his life partner and muse, Janet Vernon, as some of the few he’s worked with who had both technical talent and artistry.\n“I was so lucky to find someone who was my muse as well as my life partner,” he says of Vernon. “You create movement for them that you have in your mind, and then see what they do with it. That is gold. I’ve been lucky to see such a broad spectrum of talent. It continues to amaze me. It’s like a spectrum of colour. I’ve been lucky to work with so many different people. Today’s dancers are a different breed. They specialise, but they know they have to be well rounded. Choreographers are so demanding. And both dancers and audiences need constant surprise and development.”\nWhen speaking of why the classic ballets are still being performed and reinterpreted today, Murphy speaks of the importance of appreciating both the old and the new.\n“It’s my job to make people aware that you can take a much loved classic and add to it, see it through different eyes,” Murphy says. “It’s about growth. Audiences are forced to change their opinion. I love finding a generation of audiences who aren’t biased. There are only two types of dance – good and bad. I stopped defining dance styles, and people and beauty, a long time ago.”\nHe likens the continued popularity of classic ballets to the longevity of the great composers. “You can’t just choose only to listen to Bach,” he says. “You have to listen to what came after it. But by listening to and understanding Bach, you learn something. And you can take that into what you create, or into how you appreciate something newer.”\nMurphy is most certainly an artist who enjoys, and values, the element of bringing things together that are different. The old and new. The collaboration between choreographer and dancer, and between different types of artists and creatives.\n“I love the collaborative element of dance,” Murphy says. “You commission the score, work with designers, nurture the performers and communicate with the audience. I feel sorry for artists who have to create alone, like novelists. One of the greatest privileges of being a choreographer is taking someone who is not known. You see a spark, or find something in them. You nurture it and release it. And then it is appreciated by others. And then that artist starts to flower. You’ve helped free that strange, eccentric spirit inside them that is screaming to be free. That’s been the highlight of my career. If you are a dictator as a choreographer, it stops that person having that experience. It’s all about the process. The interaction between the choreographer and dancer is when the magic happens.”\nWhen he started out, Murphy says he didn’t know he wanted to be a choreographer. He simply knew he wanted to be involved in dance.\n“I knew my life journey wouldn’t take me out of the magic world of dance,” he recalls. “At the age of five, I knew that’s where I wanted my life to be. I nagged my parents really early. It must have been strange to them to think of me wanting a life in the world of ballet. At that time, The Australian Ballet company didn’t exist, so dance was something that happened in Europe and America. Of course, I wanted to be the magical prince. Then I realised I would never be the prince, but I discovered I had other things that other dancers didn’t. In early days at Sydney Dance Company, I’d choreograph on myself. I found truth in myself and found my voice. That then freed me to help others to find their voice.”\nMurphy continues, “I didn’t think about it. It was an unfiltered, joyous thing. Children dance to music without thinking about it. I just never grew out of it. I don’t hear music; I see it as movement. I wasn’t told to stop doing it. My parents must have thought I was a strange creature from another planet. But I was very lucky. I left school at 14 to dance. My parents were teachers, and it was amazing that they allowed me to escape the education system and be an artist. They saw my glowing eyes and scrimped and saved so that I could do that.”\nWe all know that Murphy creates wonderful, imaginative, compelling dance works, but the way he speaks about his work and his life reveals a person whose creativity is not limited to dance. His words create an imagery all of their own. When asked what he’ll do next, Murphy’s aim is simple.\n“I want to paint and write and be a human poem. The essence of life is poetry.”\nThe Murphy program will light up the stage in Melbourne at Arts Centre Melbourne from 16 to 26 March 2018, and in Sydney at Sydney Opera House from 6 to 23 April 2018.

{"question":"What design features enabled high-speed performance in the IROC Porsche and McLaren Formula 1 car?","answer":"The IROC Porsche utilized Fuchs wheels that were wider for better control at high speeds, along with bigger brakes and a whale tail spoiler for increased downforce and stability. The McLaren MP4-17 featured a sophisticated Mercedes-Benz FO110M V-10 engine producing 845 horsepower at 18,500 rpm, combined with a McLaren-designed seven-speed sequential gearbox. It also had double wishbone suspension with an inboard torsion bar and damper system, plus specialized Hitco brake discs and AP Racing brake calipers for optimal performance.","context":["IROC Porsche Type 911 Carrera RSR, 1974\nWilliam E. (Chip) Connor Collection\nLet’s learn something about the intersection of nature and design.\nLet’s do something new for this entry. Let’s focus on design instead of art and discuss the relationship between nature and design. First, what is this? It is a car—a race car to be exact. It is called an IROC Porsche Type 911 Carrera RSR. For those of you who love racing competitions, you probably know what IROC stands for. IROC stands for International Race of Champions. In the day, invited IROC drivers who were at the top of their game raced virtually identical car models on oval race tracks in order to determine who was the best race car driver. IROC was similar to an all-star game, in which the best players or “stars” of a sports league are showcased in a game. For the inaugural series in 1974, fifteen Porsche Type 911 Carrera RSR cars were chosen, twelve of them for the competition and three spares. The cars came in a rainbow of colors so TV viewers could easily follow the cars as they raced around the track. Our Porsche Type 911 Carrera RSR model here is in a lovely hue called Mexico Blue. David Pearson, NASCAR Rookie of the Year, drove this car in the inaugural series along with Denny Hulme and Roger McCluskey. For those of you who are fans of David Pearson, I’m sure you are familiar with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). Pearson currently holds the second position on NASCAR’s all-time win list with one hundred and five victories.\nDesigners follow what is called the design cycle. Do you know what the design cycle is? The design cycle is a series of steps designers follow. In formulating a design, a design team will first ask themselves what the problems and constraints are. Next they will imagine or brainstorm ideas and choose one idea. Next they will carefully plan out their design. After this, they will make a diagram or model and gather the necessary materials. Next they will create a model and test it. Lastly, if problems arise in the testing phase, they will start the design cycle over and improve upon their design.\nWhat is most obvious about the body design of the IROC? The IROC has a large rear spoiler. What is this type of spoiler called? It is called a whale tail. Why was such a spoiler necessary? As engines became more and more powerful, designers had to come up with solutions to neutralize problems in instability and handling. Two solutions were wider tires and bigger breaks. The IROC race car has what are called Fuchs wheels, which are wider and allow for greater control and handling at increased speeds. Another solution was to attach a rear spoiler. What is the function of a spoiler? A spoiler provides downforce. What is downforce? Downforce is a downward thrust that allows a car to travel faster around a corner. Essentially, it increases the vertical force on the tires and creates more grip against the surface of the road. It is the same principle that allows an airplane to rise off the ground by creating lift from its wings. Keep in mind that the greater the downforce, the greater the drag. Drag is important to aerodynamics. What is aerodynamics? Aerodynamics is the study of how the shape of an object moves air aside. It is a problem in fluid dynamics. If a vehicle has low drag in that the air flows freely across its body, it will have good aerodynamics and speed. Since in designing a race car a design team seeks to minimize drag—not increase drag, designers of the IROC had to find the optimum balance between downforce and drag, just two problems they had to tackle in the design cycle.\nWhy do you think people called the large, rear spoiler on the IROC a “whale tail?” What can you tell me about a real whale’s tail? A whale’s tail is made of two flukes, which propel a whale by vertical movement, as opposed to the horizontal movement of a fish tail. Since the flared shape and force of this type of spoiler was similar to that of a whale’s tail, it was only fitting that it be named as such. After all, a spoiler increases vertical force to reduce rear-end lift, while a whale’s tail propels the animal with a vertical force through the water. You may be interested to learn that today engineers are studying the shape and function of a whale’s fins and tail to come up with a more efficient way to generate wind power. When designers deliberately use nature as a source of inspiration in the design cycle, they are practicing what is called biomimicry. Do you know what “biomimicry” means? Let’s break the word down into parts. “Bio” means life and “mimicry” means imitate. Biomimicry means to imitate or copy nature. Designers practice biomimicry when they closely observe how nature works and copy nature to solve problems that arise in the design cycle.\nCan you think of any examples of biomimicry? One example is a very fast train in Japan called the Shinkansen, referred to as the bullet train. At first, engineers followed the design cycle and came up with a design for a train that could travel at 200 miles per hour. However, when they tested their model, they discovered the train created a piercing sonic boom when exiting a narrow tunnel. The main part of the problem was the blunt, bullet-shaped nose that pushed air in front rather than slicing through. To solve the problem, the engineers looked to nature for inspiration. They took their cue from the beak of the kingfisher. What is the function of a bird’s beak exactly? Birds use their beaks to eat and groom, manipulate objects, kill prey, fight, and feed their young. What is so special about the kingfisher’s beak? A kingfisher is able to dive into water without barely making a splash. Essentially, a kingfisher wedges itself into a body of water with little displacement of water, because its streamlined beak gradually increases in diameter from tip to head. Engineers realized that a similar design for the nose of their train would push air aside the way water flows past the kingfisher’s beak. By going through the design cycle more than once, the engineers were able to redesign the nose of the bullet train to imitate the kingfisher’s beak. By practicing biomimicry, the engineers were able to solve several problems and come up with a design for a much quieter and faster train that also used less electricity.\nAnother example of biomimicry is Velcro. What is Velcro? Do you know? Velcro is a special material with a hook and loop design. An electrical engineer came up with the design after returning home from a hunting trip with his dog in the Alps. He removed the many little prickly seeds called cockleburs of burdock that stuck to his clothes and his dog’s fur and examined them under a microscope. He was struck by the natural design. The cockleburs were composed of hundreds of tiny hooks that easily caught on anything with a loop such as clothing and animal fur. So he set out to imitate nature and invented Velcro. Essentially, Velcro consists of tiny hooks on one side and even smaller and “hairier” loops on the other. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten together. To separate the two sides, all one has to do is pull the two sides apart. Perhaps you have seen sneakers or shoes that are fastened by Velcro instead of shoe laces? If you have, I am sure you remember the ripping sound the Velcro strips made when being pulled apart.\nThe designs of the Shinkansen and Velcro are only two examples of biomimicry. For those of you who love design, why don’t you search for more examples of biomimicry on your own? For those of you who are more interested in art than design, be patient. We will return to the topic of art in our next entry. However, keep in mind that art shares many characteristics with design, which is especially true in the case of architecture and sculpture. For example, artists have to consider shape, materials, and implied movement when designing sculpture. Like a Porsche designer, the Italian Renaissance artist Michelangelo had to take into consideration dimensions, proportions, dynamics, materials, means of construction, surface treatment, display space, and audience when designing his masterpiece David. We will study sculpture in a future entry. Until then, remember the design cycle. It is important. Also remember the design of the IROC. To many observers, it gives the impression of movement so smooth, it appears to glide through space!","- Raced 12 times during the 2002 and 2003 Formula 1 Seasons\n- Piloted by legendary drivers Kimi Räikkönen and David Coulthard\n- Driven to victory at the 2003 Australian Grand Prix; a further three 2nd-place and two 3rd-place finishes on its record\n- Currently configured in 2002 MP4-17A specification\n- Presented in West McLaren Mercedes livery\nThe McLaren MP4-17 was introduced for the 2002 Formula 1 season, featuring a chassis designed by the experienced team of Adrian Newey, Mike Coughlan, Neil Oatley, and Peter Prodromou. The race team turned to Mario Illien of Ilmore Engineering to create a bespoke and honed version of the newly launched 3.0-litre Mercedes-Benz FO110M V-10 engine. This engine was first run on the dyno on 21 November 2001, and it produced an eye-watering 845 horsepower at 18,500 rpm.\nThe aerodynamics of the car were developed at McLaren’s new, state-of-the-art wind tunnel facility that had recently been completed in Woking, England. Newey altered the front wing on the MP4-17, making it thinner on the downside to draw air under the monocoque. The esteemed David Coulthard set time records in test runs at Barcelona, giving the team hope of victory for the 2002 season. The MP4-17 was the sixth McLaren to appear in the distinctive West McLaren Mercedes livery, which was introduced at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix.\nMated to the Mercedes-Benz engine was a McLaren-designed seven-speed longitudinal automatic sequential gearbox, and the MP4-17’s electronics were produced by TAG Electronic Systems. The front and rear suspension was fitted with double wishbones and an inboard torsion bar and damper system, which was pushrod- and bell crank-activated. The dampers were manufactured jointly by McLaren and Penske, while the car wore Enkei wheels clad in Michelin tyres. Stopping power was provided by Hitco brake discs and AP Racing brake callipers.\nFor the 2002 Formula 1 World Championship, McLaren’s selection of MP4-17 cars made 17 appearances overall, securing 10 podium finishes, including one 1st place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix. McLaren placed 3rd in the Constructors’ Championship that year behind Ferrari and Williams-BMW. For the 2003 season, the chassis was lightly adapted, culminating in the MP4-17D. Enhanced as a result of learnings from the previous season, the cars earned 13 podium finishes and two victories. McLaren again placed 3rd in the Constructors’ Championship in 2003, narrowly missing out on 2nd place to Williams by a mere two points.\nCHASSIS NUMBER MP4-17A-06\nThis MP4-17, chassis number MP4-17A-06, raced seven times in the 2002 season (having been used as a spare car for the first three races of the season). Its debut race was the Grand Prix of Europe from 21 to 23 June 2002 at the Nürburgring in Germany. Kimi Räikkönen drove chassis number MP4-17A-06 on its first outing, qualifying 6th and finishing in 3rd place behind Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. The car would race at the British Grand Prix but failed to finish due to engine trouble.\nThe third outing for chassis number MP4-17A-06 would be the car’s most successful—not just for this car, but for the McLaren team that season. Driven again by Räikkönen, the Finnish driver would secure 2nd place and David Coulthard in chassis MP4-17-08 would take 3rd on 21 July 2002 at the Grand Prix de France on Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours.\nChassis number MP4-17A-06 failed to finish at the German Grand Prix due to a puncture Räikkönen suffered on lap 59 while in 3rd place, causing him to spin off and leaving the car with underbody damage. Returning for the Malaysian Grand Prix, Räikkönen missed out on a podium finish, passing the chequered flag in 4th place. MP4-17A-06 did not race at the Belgian Grand Prix, but Coulthard would drive it to 3rd at the subsequent United States Grand Prix. It ended the season with a DNF at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka.\nFor 2003, the West McLaren team drivers were Räikkönen and Coulthard. Chassis number MP4-17A-06 was upgraded to MP4-17D specification. It ultimately raced five times and was used as a test car on five occasions, with these refinements helping secure improved results. At the debut race that year, the car was driven to 1st place by Coulthard at the Australian Grand Prix on the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne—an immediate reflection of the improvements McLaren had made to the car, and a foreshadowing of the results for the remainder of the season.\nChassis number MP4-17A-06 next served as a test car at both the Malaysian and Brazilian Grands Prix. Räikkönen subsequently drove MP4-17A-06 at the San Marino Grand Prix, finishing in 2nd place on the Imola circuit. For the Spanish Grand Prix at the Catalunya Circuit, Räikkönen failed to finish after colliding with Antonio Pizzonia’s Jaguar R4. With Coulthard driving, chassis number MP4-17A-06 would take 7th place at Monte Carlo. It was then used as the test car for the European, French, and German Grands Prix. For the car’s final competitive outing, Räikkönen was again behind the wheel, ending the 2003 season on a high note as he finished 2nd at Suzuka in Japan.\nOverall, across the 2002 and 2003 Formula 1 Seasons, chassis number MP4-17A-06 raced 12 times and was used as a test car on eight occasions, with a 1st-place finish at the 2003 Australian Grand Prix, with a further three 2nd- and two 3rd-place finishes to its name. Presently configured in its 2002 MP4-17A configuration and wearing its original West livery, this Formula 1 car has an excellent race history at the hands of two storied drivers and highlights the competitive nature of McLaren’s engineering prowess."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1dfe651a-1ac1-4a0c-846a-63dab300068d>","<urn:uuid:e4779e9c-3a2d-4495-809a-716051f84ed9>"],"error":null}

However, the War Office\nargued that the RAF should have its own ranks and the Admiralty\nopposed any use of their rank titles.\nBadges of Rank\nOn 1 April 1918\n, Air Force Memorandum 2 specified rank insignia for the newly established independent force. Rank was to be worn on the jacket cuff and was derived from the Royal Navy's rings, each equivalent rank having the same number of rings. However, Second Lieutenants\n(now Pilot Officers) displayed a crowned eagle only and the Navy's loop was not used for any rank. Depending on the uniform, either gold or pale blue on grey braid was worn.\nIn August 1918, Air Ministry Weekly Order 617 added a single band of 1/4 inch braid below the Second Lieutenant's eagle and all other officer ranks also received a crowned eagle above their braid.\nIn 1919 the colour of the rank braid was changed to black with a central pale blue stripe. However, on RAF mess dress rank continued to be displayed in gold.\nAs mentioned above, it was originally proposed that the RAF ranks were to be derived from existing Royal Navy and Army ranks. Both services were consulted and both reacted unfavourably - the Navy unhappy about the use of its higher ranks and the Army complaining it provided the \"junior ranks\". This resulted in a compromise whereby the officer ranks were proposed to be Ensign\n, Flight Leader\n, Squadron Leader\n, Fourth Ardian\n, Third Ardian\n, Second Ardian\nand Air Marshal\n. A further proposal was Ensign\n, Flight Ardian\n, Squadron Ardian\n, Wing Ardian\n, Air Marshal\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, these contrived ranks were rejected and on 1 August 1919, Air Ministry Weekly Order 973 introduced new rank titles for RAF officers. They were based on Royal Navy ranks and their titles were influenced by the usage in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) during World War I. For example, the RAF rank of Flight Lieutenant was based on the RNAS rank of the same name. The rank of Squadron Leader derived its name from the RNAS rank of Squadron Commander. Initially the highest rank was titled Marshal of the Air. However, only a few days after it was promulgated and at the request of King George V, this rank title was changed to Marshal of the Royal Air Force.\nRAF officers typically wear composite braid rank slides with their working and operational uniforms. Composite braid consists of a single piece of fabric, where the 'background' between the rank rings is made from blue-grey material. Composite braid rank slides are often referred to as 'bar-code' in RAF slang.\nDistinction between ranks and appointments\nMany RAF ranks do not imply the appointment or duties of an officer.

{"question":"How has Japan's approach to military cooperation evolved from its Cold War stance, and what new technological capabilities is it developing to address current security challenges?","answer":"During the Cold War, Japan had limited military capability and didn't need to extend protection to others, including US forces. However, the post-Cold War security environment prompted changes, leading to the 1997 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, which clarified alliance cooperation within constitutional limits. In terms of new capabilities, Japan is now developing various electronic warfare systems, including standoff jammer aircraft, non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse weapons, high-energy laser weapons, and high-power microwave weapons. The country has deployed a vehicle-mounted network electronic warfare system and is establishing dedicated electronic warfare units. These developments are part of Japan's 'multi-domain defense force' strategy, combining conventional fields with new domains like space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic operations.","context":["Japan Chair Platform: Japan and Collective Self-Defense: An American Perspective\nNovember 13, 2013\nJapan’s policy to deny the right of collective self-defense presents an obstacle to alliance cooperation because it limits the use of force by the Self Defense Force. Over the years the U.S. and Japanese decision-makers took various means to realize security cooperation while respecting this prohibition. An evolving security environment to include rising tensions in the region challenge Japan’s security posture, and provide ample reason for Japan to do more for its own defense as well making greater regional and global security contributions.. In this regard, Japan is considering a reinterpretation of its constitution as it applies to collective self-defense. A more permissive policy—if not doing away with this prohibition completely—would enable greater cooperation and more integrated planning with the U.S., which would be welcomed by most Americans.\nThis self-imposed restriction on cooperation limits the efficacy of the U.S.-Japan alliance in several critical ways. First, it limits our potential and therefore detracts strength from deterrent capability. Second, it limits our ability to prepare for contingencies. Finally, and perhaps less appreciated, this overarching restraint on allied cooperation not only precludes the possibility of Japanese forces protecting U.S. forces in the case of a crisis, but it also constrains alliance contingency planning. In other words, this restriction on Japan’s military limits how we prepare for crises, and therefore detracts from our preparedness.\nAddressing a conference of defense executives, President Eisenhower in 1957 spoke of the importance of planning. “Plans are worthless,” he said, “but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of \"emergency\" is that it is unexpected; therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.” Eisenhower’s point emphasized the value of analysis in the planning process itself as preparation for emergencies that cannot be fully envisioned. Overarching restrictions placed on this process before it even begins, constrain our ability to prepare for contingencies.\nSecurity policymaking is a dynamic process, one that adjusts to meet challenges presented by the environment. Furthermore, policy formulation occurs within a legal framework—international and domestic—and it is within Japan’s legal and policy arenas that an important debate is taking place of how adjustments may be made to these restrictions.\nThis is not the first time the right of collective self-defense has been considered in Japan. Previous governments have already taken various measures to clarify the impact of this interpretation of Japan’s constitution. Japan has taken various measures to deal with its prohibition on collective self-defense in the past, to include steps clarifying areas for cooperation, studying areas for reinterpretation, and exercising collective self-defense by another name.\nAuthorization of the concept is recognized by international law. Article 51 of the UN Charter authorizes all member states the use of collective self-defense declaring “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.” Put more simply, all member states have the right to use force in coming to the defense of another state under attack. Although one would consider this an inherent element of a security partnership, it is a right Japan chooses not to exercise, in the U.S.-Japan alliance or with any other nation. It is a right that no nation other than Japan declines.\nThe Government of Japan expressed its position on collective self-defense in 1972, reiterating it again in 1981 by stating “ . . . Japan as a sovereign state inherently possesses the right of collective self-defense under international law, but the exercise of the right of self-defense as allowed under Article 9 of the Constitution is limited to what is minimum and necessary to defend the country, and exercise of the right of collective self-defense exceeds that range and therefore is not permitted under the Constitution.”\nSince this formulation alliance managers have lacked an operational understanding of how to abide by Japan’s policy on collective self-defense while at the same time making sure we were doing all that we could to secure our mutual national interests. At the political, policy and operational levels of our two governments, alliance managers were limited in their ability prepare for contingencies.\nDuring much of the Cold War, Japan did not have the need to extend itself to the protection of others, including U.S. forces. Moreover, until the latter part of the Cold War, Japan had only a limited military capability. The restrictions on collective self-defense therefore had minor consequence. After the Cold War ended, however, Japanese policymakers were confronted with a rapidly changing security environment. In April 1996, Prime Minister Hashimoto and President Clinton met to issue their Joint Security Declaration, directing their respective governments to review the 1978 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation. Describing Japan’s position during the Cold War, Prime Minister Hashimoto explained “We did not think much about a contingency situation . . . Today, however, we must consider those possibilities and consider what can be done and what cannot be done.” Regarding Japan’s prohibitions on collective self-defense Prime Minister Hashimoto said, “People are bogged down in conceptual discussions. But I think that there are certain things that we can do under the present Constitution. I think it is our responsibility to make clear what can and cannot be done.”\nThis Guidelines review was essentially a task to clarify how the alliance could cooperate given Japan’s restrictions on collective self-defense. It was not an effort to redefine the existing legal and policy constraints imposed on the security relationship. As a result, the revised 1997 Guidelines outlined various areas in which the alliance could work together, while respecting Japan’s prohibition on collective self-defense. Though limited in our ability to cooperate, both sides gained some political clarity on how to proceed with contingency planning.\nA decade later, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe commissioned a study by leading Japanese security experts, headed by Ambassador Shunji Yanai, to consider the limits imposed by the existing interpretation of the right of collective self-defense. This expert panel did not seek to clarify the parameters under the existing interpretation, but rather argued for a significant step toward a reformulation of Japan’s prohibition on collective self-defense. The “Advisory Panel on Reconstruction of the Legal Basis for Security” studied four military scenarios confronting Japan’s Self Defense Force that were prohibited under the existing interpretation of collective self-defense:\n- Defense of U.S. vessels on the high seas;\n- Interception of a ballistic missile that might be on its way to the United States;\n- Use of weapons in international peace operations;\n- Logistics support for the operations of other countries participating in the same operations, such as PKOs, and the integration of logistical support for the use of force.\nThe commission recommended reinterpretation to allow action in each of these scenarios. In the first two scenarios, the commission recognized these as alliance missions and considered ramifications for future alliance cooperation if the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) failed to take action. In the third scenario, Japan’s growing responsibility to participate in international peace keeping operations meant that the SDF was operating with forces of other nations, and the limits on the SDF use of force was incompatible with Japan’s interpretation of its Constitution. The commission again recommended a reinterpretation to allow the SDF to defend forces from other nations involved in the same operation. The report stated, “Basically, the Constitution should be interpreted to permit participation in such activities under collective security.” Finally, in the fourth scenario—referred to as the integration of the use of force, or ittaika—the commission concluded that interpreting JSDF logistical support for other nations’ military forces as being equal to the use of force was unreasonable and inimical to Japan’s relationships with the U.S. and others. Though the recommendations of this advisory group’s report were presented to Prime Minister Abe’s successor in 2008, the Japanese government did not act upon its recommendations.\nJapan’s most extensive departure from its policy on collective self-defense is an ongoing operation in the Gulf of Aden. It is a collective self-defense action in all but name. Since 2008 Japan Self-Defense Forces have operated as a Joint Task Force of Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) helicopters and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) P-3s and destroyers to protect ships from piracy. This Joint Task Force is authorized to use force to prevent or defend against attack any ship, regardless of their flagged registry. Although the basis of Japan’s authorization rests on the rationale of law enforcement, it demonstrates an application of collective self-defense.\nThe alliance is once again poised to revise the Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation. At the October 3, 2013 Security Consultative Committee (SCC/2+2) meeting the ministers directed the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC) to recommend changes to the 1997 Guidelines. Japan’s consideration to adjust its interpretation on collective self-defense will shape the outcome of this second revision of the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation.\nPrime Minister Abe has once again commissioned a panel of experts to review Japan’s position on collective self-defense headed by Ambassador Yanai, and over this past year, the new panel of experts has reviewed the implications of Japan’s current interpretation of the right of collective self-defense. Their recommendations are due by the end of the year. As a baseline, the four areas outlined in the 2008 report are likely to be included, as well as additional new insights on how to consider Japan’s current defense needs.\nAn American Perspective\nThe alliance would benefit from a relationship without overarching restrictions on military cooperation. In an alliance where full mutual support could be possible, the relationship would indeed be strengthened in the eyes of both partners, as well as in the eyes of others.\nSome in Japan argue that relaxation of the policy makes Japan vulnerable to entering conflicts that extend beyond their interests. A similar argument was raised prior to concluding the 1997 Guidelines, a warning against collaboration in bilateral contingency planning. These critics argued that bilateral planning would automatically commit Japan to execute a given plan. This is false. Operational planning, as many in Japan’s security planning community have come to realize, is not a political commitment to action. While political and policy directives drive operational planning, a separate and distinct political decision is required to authorize national commitment to any plan. As the 2008 panel headed by Ambassador Yanai reported, “Japan can make policy decisions whether to participate in a particular activity in accordance with its national interests.”\nShould Japan decide to adjust its interpretation for collective self-defense to the four scenarios outlined in the earlier report, it would be welcome progress toward strengthening the alliance. The difficulty with framing security policy to scenarios, however, is that future challenges cannot be limited to the scenarios we may envision today. As Eisenhower astutely observed, scenarios beyond those envisioned are bound to occur.\nEisenhower’s emphasis on the analytical process afforded through continuous ‘planning,’ however, retains its value today. Movement toward an alliance unconstrained in its ability to plan for and defend each other during emergencies, manmade or otherwise, would indeed be a great step toward strengthening the U.S.-Japan security relationship. It would also enhance Japan’s contribution to regional and global security.\nRobin “Sak” Sakoda is a partner at Armitage International L.C.

The Ministry of Defense of Japan moreover plans to establish an electronic warfare capability unit of 80 personnel as part of the GSDF at Camp Kengun of Kumamoto Prefecture, located in Kyushu, southwestern part of Japan in April 2021. The unit will collaborate with the amphibious rapid deployment brigade at Camp Ainoura in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, which has a mission for recapturing remote islands in an event of military emergency. Previously, a cybersecurity unit consisting of some 40 personnel was set up as part of the GSDF at Camp Kengun in March 2019. The electromagnetic spectrum has become a strategically critical domain in the defense of Japan, and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) intends to strengthen its electronic warfare (EW) capability in the upcoming years.\nIncreasing Significance of Electronic Warfare Capability\nElectronic warfare, or electromagnetic warfare, is defined as “military action involving the use of electromagnetic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.” In an electronic warfare, it is important to use the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of three major areas: 1) electronic attack (disrupting, denying, degrading, destroying, or deceiving opponents), 2) electronic protection (preventing a receiver from being jammed or deceived), and 3) electronic support (sensing of the electromagnetic spectrum). For instance, Russian Peresvet as a mobile laser system can emit high-power laser beams to destroy multiple unmanned aircrafts, and Sweden’s Giraffe 8A is capable of automatically selecting frequencies that are invulnerable to jamming. Although electronic warfare includes the term “warfare”, it has been regarded as an appropriate operation for Japan, because “electronic warfare doesn’t involve weapons that kill people” as mentioned by an SDF official.\nHistorically, Japan’s EW capability dates back to the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). In the actual combat, Japan intercepted and analyzed Russian naval radio transmissions, and the ability of signals intelligence is thought to be one of the critical factors to the Japanese victory in the war. In the Cold War period, Japan deployed an EW unit to Camp Higashi-Chitose of Hokkaido in order to intercept signals of the Soviet Union. Even after the end of the Cold War, the EW unit has been considered to be able to intercept signals and collect information from Russia as well as the interior of the Asian continent. Evidently, Japan’s EW capability was developed as a countermeasure against the military threats of Soviet Union/Russia in the past.\nMeanwhile, EW capability of Russia has evolved to the extent that astonished and overwhelmed western European countries, especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states. During the invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia conducted a hybrid war against Ukraine, which combined information warfare, cyberattacks, and EW operations. The hybrid operations by Russia damaged and destroyed command-and-control networks, radar systems, and signals of global positioning system (GPS) of Ukraine. During the 2018 combat in Syria, moreover, the Russian EW system nullified a swarm of drones carrying explosive munitions directing at Russian soldiers, showcasing the significance of EW superiority in modern armed conflicts.\nSimilarly, it has been observed that China has steadily enhanced its EW capability commensurate with is economic power. Indeed, the People’s Liberation Army has strengthened its EW capability as an important “force multiplier.” Given the increase of its military modernization with a massive military budget, it is no wonder that Chinese EW system could be a game changer in cases of southern remote islands of the Japanese territory. In this sense, Russia’s EW operations in Crimea and Syria have strategic implications for the case of a Sino-Japanese territorial conflict in the East China Sea, although the Japanese government does not admit the existence of such a bilateral dispute.\nThe Development of Japan’s EW Capability\nAccording to a senior GSDF official, it has been recognized that “Japan is lagging far behind China and Russia in building up [electronic warfare] capability.” In an effort to improve its defense capabilities in the electromagnetic domain, the Ministry of Defense has attempted to acquire EW capabilities, such as, F-35A/B fighters equipped with EW systems and to add EW equipment to the existing F-15 fighters. The Defense Ministry, moreover, has developed a standoff jammer aircraft that can emit disrupting radio waves, non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons that could be a game changer by paralyzing opponents’ basic infrastructure system, high-energy laser weapons, and high-power microwave (HPM) weapons which could instantly destroy or nullify electronic components of adversary’s weapons systems. Furthermore, it has been reported that Japan has considered acquisition of the Boeing EA-18 Growler which could enhance Japan’s capability of electronic attack and protection.\nWith a view to deterring a possible invasion of remote islands, the Japanese government has planned to deploy surface-to-ship missile units to the Nansei Islands. In Amami-Oshima Island of Kagoshima Prefecture, a surface-to-ship missile unit was already deployed, and it is scheduled that a similar unit would be deployed to Ishigaki Island of Okinawa Prefecture, to which the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands belong in accordance with the recognition by the Japanese government. In essence, therefore, the establishment of Japan’s new EW unit is to improve the defense of Japan facing security challenges and threats in the East China Sea where Chinese vessels enter into the waters surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Clearly, Japan’s EW capability has been evolving in response to the rise of Chinese military power and a possible military emergency in the remote islands.\nA Possible Game Changer in the Electromagnetic Domain\nThe electromagnetic spectrum became one of the most critical domains in the defense of Japan. Japan’s EW capability has been developed as countermeasures against the military threats of Russia and China. EW operations are regarded as integral part of Japan’s “multi-domain defense force” and its “cross-domain operations” that would include conventional fields (land, sea, air) in combination with new domains (space, cyberspace, electromagnetic). Japan’s defense budget for the fiscal year of 2020 has therefore prioritized the development and acquisition of EW systems, including stand-off EW aircraft and NEWS.\nSince Japan has adopted the so-called “exclusively defense-oriented policy” while depending upon the strike capability and extended deterrence of the United States, the development of Japan’s electronic warfare capability has profound strategic implications for the defense of Japan as well as the Japan-U.S. military alliance in the Indo-Pacific. Now that Japan has developed and deployed the EW systems, it is imperative to enhance its training/exercise and education in the electromagnetic domain. Although EW capability is regarded as a nonlethal defense system in Japan, it has an unmeasurable potential to become a game changer technology for its multi-domain defense force."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:da6ef0f5-d983-45ac-b863-c77399b2d083>","<urn:uuid:7eb21fc0-1d87-424a-ac66-2b6dd1c45559>"],"error":null}

These three test data boundary changes include: shift in standards; effects of HIPAA; and protecting test security.\nOn this section, we will discuss three controversies created by HIPAA and its possible breach of ethical boundaries. These three HIPAA privacy controversies include: governmentally accessed information; contradictory language; and employer access.\n3 HIPAA Privacy Controversies\n♦ Controversy #1 - Governmentally Accessed Information\nThe first HIPAA privacy controversy is governmentally accessed information. The branch of the government, Health and Human Services, otherwise known as HHS, in addition to taking on the responsibility of writing the legislation, also takes on the responsibility of monitoring it. However, to do this, the HHS demands unlimited access to clients’ records with or without consent of the client. Upon the inception of HIPAA, the HHS facilitated the federal government’s admittance to the records of millions of mental health clients.\nFor the first time in history, an act of legislation makes it legal for the United States government to retrieve medical information about its citizens, often without the knowledge of the citizens themselves. In addition, HHS has created what HIPAA expert Michael Freeny terms \"a holy trinity of insurers, providers, and claims clearinghouses\" who can exchange information freely between each other without the client’s knowledge.\nEssentially, the information that the client only wanted and thought would be shared just between him or herself and the clinician becomes a free-for-all among these HIPAA approved entities. However, clients are never aware of these transactions and believe their information to be perfectly confidential because, as we discussed in section 3, the Notice of Privacy Policies are so convoluted and obscure that they cannot cipher through it all. Therefore the federal invasion of privacy remains undetected unless a client extensively researches HIPAA for him or herself.\nI have found that many clients who have undertaken the laborious task of sifting through HIPAA legislation feel cheated and betrayed by the government and most significantly by their therapist. This puts an unnecessary strain on the client-therapist relationship so that is why I try and make the language of my NPP as clear as possible to my clients from the beginning so they are not surprised by newly discovered and interpreted legislation.\nThink of your clients. Can you think of any clients who may be shocked by the extent to which the government has access to his or her records?\n♦ Controversy #2 - Contradictory Language\nThe second HIPAA privacy controversy is contradictory language. Although the legislation presents all appearances of attempts to protect a client’s privacy, upon closer scrutiny, it becomes apparent that certain passages may contradict each other.\nMost specifically, Michael Freeny points out a specific section within the legislation which guarantees consumers the right to see and copy their health records and request corrections of mistakes that may be contained in those records. However, providers are obligated by HIPAA to inform clients that they are not bound to fulfill such requests. Therefore, the client’s rights may not be recognized by the provider if the provider deems it unnecessary.\nIn addition, the guidelines stipulate that clients maintain the right to restrict the distribution and transmission of their medical information. However, Freeny points out, \"It’s not true because the next sentence says that the provider is under no obligation to give you that information.\" Even further, although the client may retain the right to restrict the distribution of their information and the provider consents, there are certain entities to which the provider cannot deny access, specifically the federal government, police, and public health agencies.\nSo although HIPAA may appear to be more restrictive regarding the distribution of records, this restriction only applies to certain individuals not among the HIPAA approved agencies. Many clients and clinicians are not aware of these contradictions due to the convolution of the regulations themselves. Michael Freeny believes that many therapists prefer to do the bare minimum in regards to HIPAA compliance due to the time it would consume to actually understand the guidelines at a deeper level. Do you agree?\n♦ Controversy #3 - Employer Access\nIn addition to governmentally accessed information and contradictory language, the third HIPAA privacy controversy is employer access. As we discussed in section 4, certain authorities may access information illegitimately and use it to the disadvantage of the client. However, certain employers who operate under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act as insurers for their employees have access to their employees' health records.\nThis information includes symptoms, medication, and even diagnoses. According to HHS, employers are not allowed to use this information in any business transaction. However, there are no consequences implemented to force the employer to take responsibility for his or her action.\nJohnny, age 32, suffered from alcoholism. He had just obtained a job with a packing company who acted on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and had access to his mental health records. After about a month at this company, he was fired, even after a positive evaluation. His employer stated that Johnny had been a part of a series of cutbacks, although no other employees, even those with less experience and worse evaluations, had been let go. Johnny believes that his supervisor had been told about Johnny’s drinking problems through this act, but there was no way to prove he had been the victim of this discrimination.\nThink of your Johnny. Could he or she run the risk of losing his or her employment due to his or her disorder?\nIn this section, we discussed three controversies created by HIPAA and its possible breach of privacy boundaries. These three HIPAA privacy controversies included: governmentally accessed information; contradictory language; and employer access.\nPeer-Reviewed Journal Article References:\nBenefield, H., Ashkanazi, G., & Rozensky, R.

{"question":"Cuáles son los lugares más importantes donde se encuentra rock crystal nowadays?","answer":"Currently, Brazil is the most important exporter of rock crystals, particularly from the state of Minas Gerais. Other significant locations include the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas (USA), the Herkimer Area in New York State (USA), the Polar Ural in Russia, and various mines in China and Peru where rock crystals are found as byproducts of other mining operations.","context":["last modified: Monday, 02-Nov-2009 14:58:38 CET\nDocument status: complete\n\"Rock Crystal\" is the name for clear, colorless quartz. In a sense, rock crystal is the ideal image of quartz.\nThe term crystal goes back to the Greeks, who once thought that since the crystals came from high in the mountains, they might be ice frozen so deeply that it is can't melt again (another interpretation says they meant crystals to be some substance frozen very deeply, but not necessarily water). Of course it was already known that rock crystals can also be found at places that never see snow or ice. But the lack of a better theory let the bad theory survive.\nThe specimen to the right is from the Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh, India.\nNote: Rock crystal translates into Bergkristall (mountain crystal) in German.\nIn the Alps, the notion \"Bergkristall\" is associated with colorless, clear, long, prismatic crystals attached to the host rock. So a Herkimer diamond would not be called a Bergkristall and short-prismatic colorless quartz from druses wouldn't either. The notion of Bergkristall is not only more specific in physical terms than \"rock crystal\", the word also has a \"romantic\" or \"mythic\" sound in it, not unlike \"Edelweiss\".\nOf course there is no strict rule, and you may call a Herkimer \"Bergkristall\" if you want.\nRock crystals have also been a source of income in the central Alps since Roman times. To give you an idea of how much rock crystal is part of the alpine culture: If you drive up the Furka Pass from the Upper Wallis in Switzerland, you will see an engraving of rock crystals in the concrete walls in one of the curves.\nExcept for being colorless and clear, there is no feature specific to rock crystal that cannot be found in other macrocrystalline varieties.\nRock crystal from many locations can be artificially turned into smoky quartz by high energy radiation. The aluminum necessary for the formation of smoky quartz color centers is already present in sufficient amounts in these rock crystals.\nRock crystal can be found in some form in any geological environment that allows the formation of quartz in general. Large, well-formed and transparent crystals can be found in some pegmatites, in alpinotype vugs, and hydrothermal veins. For nice crystals to form, conditions in a geological environment need to change more or less gradually and slowly over a long period of time. A single rock crystals from the Alps may have grown over a period of several million years during the uplift and folding of the mountains.\nLocations and Specimen\nRock crystal can be found at many places all over the world, but few are commercially exploited:\nOuachita Mountains in Arkansas, U.S.A.\nHerkimer Area, New York State, U.S.A.\nMinas Gerais, Brazil\nPolar Ural, Russia\nOf the Strahlers in the Alps, very few can make a living from selling minerals, and Strahlen always used to be only a secondary source of income for the local farmers. A lot of specimen enter the market as a byproduct of other mining operations, for example from:\nChina (Iron Ore & Fluorite)\nPeru (Lead and Zinc ore)\nThe chances of getting nice specimen from mines in developed countries were once much better, because the working conditions were different: a lot of work was done manually and nice finds were put aside by the miners, whereas nowadays large parts of the work is done by autonomous machines.\nrock crystals from Madan, Bulgaria, grew in a vein along with sphalerite (metallic black) and dolomite (light reddish-brown). Rock crystals can be found frequently in certain ore deposits.\nCurrently the most important exporter of rock crystals is Brazil. Most of them come from pockets and quartz veins in pegmatites in the state Minas Gerais. On Toni Imhof's Web page you can find a report (in German) about Corinto, Minas Gerais\n, probably the best known Brazilian rock crystal location.\nrock crystals are from Gouveia, about 30 km south of Diamantina, Minas Gerais. As you can tell from the name of the district capital, this is also one of Brazil's diamond mining areas.\nThere is a very faint phantom in the large central crystal.\nlarge crystal from Corinto, Minas Gerais, about 180 km north of Belo Horizonte. It has grown on a thin quartz matrix. Quartz from the Corinto area often shows peculiar patterns on the clear prisms, as can be seen on the back side of the large crystal, the small one pointing to the right.\nquartz crystals from Joaquim Felício, Minas Gerais, about 200 km east of Montes Claros, show an unusual crystal face on three of the six sides of the prism. The thinner, darker prism face in the center of the large crystal is one of the three m-faces, and the two neighboring faces are so called steep rhombohedra\nwith their typical surface structure. The morphology of these crystals and the underlying crystal forms are explained in the Crystal Forms\nLots of rock crystal comes from china, mostly from mines in ore deposits.\nrock crystals on hematite roses, Daya, Ganzhou, Jianxi Province. Many \"cuts\" run through the crystals, traces of hematite roses that hindered the growth of the quartz and that disappeared later. In the central right part of the image you can see small pieces of hematite that are still present in the crystals.\nspecimen to the right was sold as being from Grenoble. The crystals show a so-called Dauphiné habit, with a single prominent rhombohedral face at the tips. The Dauphiné is the old name for the French Alps around Grenoble. Some of the best Alpine rock crystal specimen came from a classical locality 50km south-east of Grenoble: the old gold mine La Gardette, at Villard Notre-Dame, south of Bourg D'Oisans, that has also been exploited for rock crystals since the early 18th century. This is also the location where Japan law twins have first been described as \"La Gardette twins\".\nthe village of Ramsbeck, Sauerland, there is a famous lead zinc mine that was still in operation in the 1970s, but now is a mining museum. Many interesting minerals have been recovered from the mine, and of course also rock crystal. The typical Ramsbeck rock crystal specimen on the image shows nice prismatic rock crystals intergrown with saddle shaped dolomite and chalcopyrite. Ramsbeck is also renown for its \"Messerquarz\" (\"knife quartz\"), platy faden quartz, presented in the faden quartz section\nof the growth forms chapter.\nsmall rock crystals from the Piesberg mountain near Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, qualify as needle quartz. They are from a quarry in sedimentary rocks from the carbon ages, a location that is actually more known for its plant fossils. Many of the perfectly clear crystals have developed a Dauphiné habit, which is a bit unusual for quartz from sedimentary deposits. There are signs for an uplift of the Piesberg of about 2000 m, so their formation has perhaps taken place at much greater depth and under the influence of a nearby (but deeply situated) magmatic intrusion, the \"Bramscher Intrusiv\".\nterm \"rock crystal\" also includes quartz crystals that have very little in common with the ideal image of an Alpine \"Bergkristall\". These tiny stubby double terminated quartz crystals grew on top of dog-tooth calcite crystals in a hydrothermal vein in limestone that was mostly filled with calcite. The largest crystal does not even measure 3 mm, but the crystals are eye-catching, because they are much more shiny than the mostly dull calcite crystals. From a limestone quarry at Suttrop, Warstein, Sauerland. Crystals from that and similar locations in sedimentary rocks never show any accessorial faces (like s- or x-faces, for example) and are usually twinned.\nNote: The following specimen were once presented as being from Nepal, and from Arkansas, U.S.A., and I bought them from two different dealers. The first specimen was labeled \"Korur, Indian Nepal\", and after talking to the dealer that sold me that piece, it was meant to be from India, not Nepal. The first dealer had more specimen from India with a striking similarity to the one labeled \"Mount Ida, Arkansas\", with characteristic x-faces that are rather uncommon in Arkansas quartz. However, I could not find a \"Korur\" on any map of India. After comparing these with other specimen at Indian dealers and talking to collectors who have visited the area, I'm certain that both specimen are from the Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh.\ngroup of clear rock crystals from the Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh. The Himalaya has just recently been discovered as a source of excellent rock crystals. Lots of material comes from alpine-type fissures in gneisses and metamorphosed schists of the Ganesh Himal region north of Kathmandu in Nepal, but rock crystal can apparently be found along the whole west-eastern extension of the Himalayas. This specimen comes from quartz veins in quartzite, and I do not know yet if these are alpine-type fissures or \"ordinary\" hydrothermal quartz veins.\nsmall group of quartz crystals also comes from the Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Three perfectly clear left-handed crystals stand out and show the typical fine striation on the prism faces. The specimen has a flat bottom with a grainy surface, and was retrieved from a vein in quartzite.\nThe larger crystals carry very large x-faces that replace a big portion of the frontal prism faces and lack s-faces. The forms on these crystals are discussed in the Crystal Forms section.\ndouble terminated rock crystal is a faden quartz from Mont Chaz Dura near the Piccolo San Bernardo pass at the border to France in the Italian Alps. The \"faden\" (German for \"thread\") is the white cloudy structure in the middle of the crystal pointing upwards. It's indicating that the crystal was initially attached to opposite walls of the vug while it was slowly widening. More about faden quartz can be read in the growth forms section\nrock crystals from Antsirabé have a most interesting surface structure, possibly due to etching, followed by incomplete healing. A detailed view of the left crystal's tip is shown in the \"growth forms\" section, where I will also discuss possible causes of the brick-like pattern on the rhombohedral faces.\ncrystals from Amputofiamendia in Madagascar with unusually large bipyramidal diamond-shaped s-faces. Similar to the specimen from Antsirabé, there is still a lot of a reddish, very sticky powder attached to it, something that you can see at many rock crystals from Madagascar.\ntypical specimen from a Peruan mine, elongated rock crystals on nice pyrite cubes and black sphalerite.\nvery beautiful group of Dauphiné habit rock crystals. They are perfectly clear, but as it is typical for Dauphiné habit crystals, their back side is covered with smaller shiny rock crystals that precipitated on the prism face. Some of those that developed into larger crystals peek out behind the prism of the large crystal. The specimen comes from an alpine-type fissure in gneiss at the Halsensee, Binntal valley, Wallis.\nof Dauphiné habit rock crystals from the same alpine-type fissure at the Halsensee as the previous specimen. The crystals are clear and colorless but covered by a thin yellow coating of iron oxides and hydroxides that has intentionally been left on the specimen. Such a yellow is very common on rock crystals from many different environments, but is usually removed in an acid bath.\nis so called needle quartz from the Val Bedretto, Ticino. Most of the crystals on this specimen have developed a Dauphiné habit with one of the rhombohedral faces enlarged. This specimen is also described as needle quartz\nin the \"Growth Forms\" section.\nrock crystals on dolomite matrix from Wyssi Flue in the Binntal, Wallis. The location is just 2 kilometers east of the famous Lengenbach pit. The quartz crystals occur in long fissures that cut through the dolomite rock.\nrock crystal with Tessin habit from the Fäldbachtal, Binntal, Wallis. While an \"ideal\" Tessin crystal has very small rhombohedral faces or lacks the altogether, such crystals from the Binntal often show well developed rhombohedral faces.\nrock crystal from the Turbe-Alp, Binntal, Wallis, shows the typical Binntal habit that can be seen at many specimen from this valley. It is a Tessin habit that has a very wide prism. The typical Tessin habit crystal has an elongated look, while crystals of Binntal habit look rather short and have relatively large rhombohedral faces.\ngroup of small parallel-grown crystals with Binntal habit from the Holzjihorn in the upper Fäldbachtal, Binntal, Wallis.\nsmall group of rock crystals from southern slope of the Holzjihorn, Feldbächtal, Binntal, Wallis. The specimen was retrieved from a pocket in \"Bündnerschiefer\", a weakly metamorphosed mica schist that has been subject to enormous stress and strain during the uplift and folding of the Alps, leading to the formation of alpinotype vugs.

{"question":"How do condition rarity and absolute rarity differ in coin collecting, and what recent market trends illustrate these concepts?","answer":"Condition rarity refers to coins valuable primarily due to their grade, like an 1887-S eagle in MS65 which would command five figures despite being common in lower grades. Absolute rarity refers to coins rare in all grades, like the 1862-S eagle which is desirable regardless of condition due to its low mintage and survival rate. Recent market activity shows this distinction - at the Simpson sale, condition rarities like the 1908-S Indian Half Eagle in MS68 brought $192,000, while absolutely rare pieces maintained strong values regardless of grade.","context":["By Doug Winter – RareGoldCoins.com ……\nCoinWeek Content Partner\nThe auction sale of Part One of selections from the collection of Bob Simpson was recently conducted by Heritage on September 17 in Dallas. While the sale was not notable for its number of gold coins, there were some important pieces included; coins that we will focus on in this article.\nThe coin market in the United States is in a quandary at this unique time in history. With literally hundreds of six-figure, and as many as a dozen seven-figure coins coming up for sale in the next few months, can the market absorb all of these?\nIf the first Simpson sale is any indication, the demand for really good coins remains stronger than most observers–myself included–realize.\nIn my opinion, prices ranged from pretty strong to very strong on the US gold in the first Simpson sale. Let’s look at a few series–and a few specific coins–to analyze the prices realized.\nTwo old friends of mine, the finest known 1849-C Closed Wreath graded MS64 PCGS/CAC and an 1852-O graded MS65 by PCGS and approved by CAC began a small but impressive selection of gold dollars. I had sold both to Steve Duckor and they were later purchased by Simpson in a 2015 sale.\n1849-C CLOSED WREATH $1.00 PCGS MS64 CAC, Images courtesy Heritage Auctions (HA.com)\nThe 1849-C had last sold for an aggressive $49,300 USD. It brought $48,000 this time around, which I think is a very solid price for the issue. The 1852-O cost Simpson a record-setting $37,600 and it brought $33,600. Again, I think this a ton of money for this specific coin.\nThe Simpson sale featured two important Dahlonega gold dollars: one of the two finest known 1855-Ds, graded MS64 by PCGS, and an 1861-D graded MS64+ by PCGS that is, in my opinion, among the finest known.\nSimpson acquired his 1855-D dollar from the Stack’s January 2009 sale where he paid $143,750. Eleven years later, the coin brought a nearly identical $144,000 including the premium. In my opinion, this coin was hurt by its lack of a CAC sticker and the fact that it has a weak “8” in the date; collectors seem to prefer examples with a full date.\n1861-D $1.00 PCGS MS64+\nThe 1861-D is the single-highest-graded numerically of this fabled date by PCGS and it had brought $149,500 (as an NGC MS65) back in the Heritage January 2008 auction. This time around, it sold for $180,000.\nOne final gold dollar is worth looking at.\nLot 10117 was a PCGS/CAC MS66+ 1875, a coin famous for its low mintage of just 400 business strikes. The coin was purchased for $109,250 in the Heritage February 2010 auction; a price that, at the time, I thought was approaching “crazy money”. This time around, it brought just $72,000.\nYou can infer that the gold dollars went weakly based on what Simpson paid and these were surely not close to his best performers. But I still think that given the current market for high-quality gold dollars, these prices were quite strong.\nThis denomination was not of much interest to Bob Simpson, although he had a very nice set of Indian Head issues. He had just two early quarter eagles in the sale but, man, they were exceptional.\n1808 $2.50 PCGS MS63 CAC\nThe first was his 1808 graded MS63 by PCGS and approved by CAC. This is a very significant one-year type and there are only two pieces known that unequivocally qualify as Uncirculated: this piece and the famous Pogue MS65, which brought $2.35 million when last sold at auction in May 2015.\nI was the successful bidder of this coin at $576,000 as I acted as an agent for a specialized collector from the East Coast. I thought the price was just right – not a bargain, but not too aggressive. Simpson had paid $517,000 for this coin in late 2008 and that was before the huge price realized by the Pogue Gem.\n1831 $2.50 PCGS PL66+\nThe second was a fantastic Gem 1831 graded MS66+ by PCGS and designated as “PL” by this service. It was odd that Heritage had sent this coin to PCGS for redesignation so close to the date of the sale that the catalog didn’t properly note its “new” grade. At any rate, it sold for $240,000 – which, I felt, was very strong for the date and for the type.\nSimpson’s 1911-D, graded MS65+ and approved by CAC, realized $87,000. Only a month ago, Legend Auctions sold a PCGS MS65 CAC for $64,625. In this instance, the addition of a “plus” grade was worth nearly $25,000.\nIn every great collection, there are winners and losers, and the PCGS MS66 1929 (lot 10134) was most certainly in the latter category. It had last realized a startling $54,625 as lot 2197 in the Heritage March 2010 auction. This time it limped to a new home at $20,400. This is likely due to the fact that the population of this date in MS66 has increased enough to fill the few Registry Sets that need one and also due to its lacking CAC approval.\nAdd to this the fact that a collector can find this date in PCGS/CAC MS65 for around $5,000, which strikes me as MUCH better value.\nIndian Half Eagles\nIf you were thinking of beginning a really world-class set of this challenging series, you couldn’t have chosen a better time to start than at the Simpson sale. While not complete, the offering was really exceptional, with a number of Condition Census pieces present.\nLot 10145, the 1908-S graded MS68 by PCGS, was acquired by Simpson in the Heritage 2012 ANA sale for $164,500. It sold last week in Dallas for $192,000. Had this coin been approved by CAC, it likely would have flown past the $250,000 level.\nThe 1913-S, graded MS66 by PCGS, sold for $180,000. It had last realized $258,000 in January 2013. Here was another famous and important coin that, with a CAC sticker, would have brought considerably more.\n1914 $5.00 PCGS MS66 CAC\nI was blown away by the price realized by the 1914, graded MS66 by PCGS and approved by CAC. The coin was the object of a street brawl between two bidders on Heritage Live and it hit a new price record for the date of $168,000. But a few seconds of internet searching led me to discover that this coin had cost Simpson a hefty $126,500 back in 2011.\nGiven the relative availability of this date in MS65, I’m somewhat surprised that PCGS has still only graded a single coin in MS66 and if this ever happens (and the coin is actually really nice), this condition rarity could lose some luster.\n1916-S $5.00 PCGS MS66+ CAC\nLot 10151, a 1916-S graded MS66+ by PCGS and approved by CAC, remains the single best example of this date I’ve seen. It last sold for $92,000 in January 2012; it brought a very strong $132,000 in the Simpson sale.\nAnd lastly, an exceptionally nice PCGS/CAC MS65 which cost Simpson $51,700 back in 2005 brought $102,000 this time.\nLessons learned from this small but important group of Indian Head eagles? Whenever possible, buy PCGS/CAC examples and study changes in populations as these are still mostly grade rarities whose populations can be adversely influenced by new coins coming onto the market. And when great collections are offered, do what Bob Simpson did and cherrypick the very best coins for your set.\nThe first Simpson sale brought over $14 million and there are lots more great coins to come.\nFor more information on auction representation at the Simpson sale or at any other auction, please feel free to contact me at (214) 675-9897 or by email at [email protected].\n* * *\nAbout Doug Winter\nDoug has spent much of his life in the field of numismatics; beginning collecting coins at the age of seven, and by the time he was 10 years old, buying and selling coins at conventions in the New York City area.\nIn 1989, he founded Douglas Winter Numismatics, and his firm specializes in buying and selling choice and rare US Gold coins, especially US gold coins and all branch mint material.\nRecognized as one of the leading specialized numismatic firms, Doug is an award-winning author of over a dozen numismatic books and the recognized expert on US Gold.

Coke versus Pepsi. Good versus evil. You get my point: two camps competing for your heart, your affection or your soul. Its not that far-fetched to stretch this analogy out to some of the basic issues in coin collecting. No, its not the Satanic Verses; its the Numismatic Versus.\nOK, to be a bit more serious: there are basic issues in numismatics that split collectors down the middle. There is no real right or wrong when it comes to collecting and I am a big advocate of doing what “feels right” for the collector. That said, I think my 30+ years of experience as a dealer qualify me to render an opinion on some of these issues and that’s what I’d like to do here.\n1. Specialist Collecting versus Type Collecting\nI have many customers who are specialists and many who are focused more in a “generalist” fashion. I respect both camps.\nA specialist picks a small area of collecting and focuses on this. Dahlonega quarter eagles. New Orleans half eagles. First year and last year of issue coins. All of these are great choices for the specialist.\nWhat I like about specialist collecting is that by having a more narrow focus, the collector can become knowledgeable more easily. As I have written before, if your collecting focus revolves around 25 half eagles from one mint, you are far more likely to learn this series as well as the typical dealer than if you are trying to learn about all the half eagles produced during the 19th century.\nBut there is something to be said for a more general approach. I love the concept of collecting by type. I love the fact that a type collector buys something different every time he pulls the trigger.\n2. Condition Rarity versus Absolute Rarity\nA coin that is a “condition rarity” is one whose primary value is based around its grade. An example of this would be an 1887-S eagle in MS65. Such a coin is extremely rare and it would sell for five-figures if available. But the same date in MS60 is extremely common and it sells for essentially no date premium.\nA coin that is an “absolute rarity” is one that is rare in all grades and is desirable whether it is quite worn or superb. An example of this would be an 1862-S eagle. This is a low mintage issue with a very low survival rate to its Civil War date of issuance. This coin is desirable if it grades Very Fine or if it grades Uncirculated.\nWhat a collector should always ask himself is “would the coin that I am buying have value if third party grading were to suddenly end?” A coin like an 1887-S eagle in MS65 might not carry a great premium if third-party grading ceased to exist. A coin like an 1862-S eagle in EF45 would still be considered desirable no matter what dictates the future of grading.\nThe best coins are the ones that combine absolute and grade rarity. If a coin like an 1862-S eagle in Mint State were to be discovered in Europe (I have never seen one close to Uncirculated) it would be very desirable as it combined both types of rarity in one neat package.\n3. Business Strikes versus Proofs\nBusiness strikes are coins that were made for circulation. Proofs are coins that were specially made for collectors and VIP’s. The coin weenie in me likes business strikes more than Proofs because of the fact that these were coins that were used as coins are supposed to be used.\nBut the coin snob in me likes Proofs as well. There is no getting around the fact that a Gem Proof Liberty Head double eagle is incredibly impressive. And you have to like the Proof issues that were struck in such tiny quantities during the 1860′s, 1870′s and 1880′s.\nI tend to be a more selective buyer when it comes to proofs than business strikes. I vastly favor very rare Proofs (example: an 1878 gold dollar) than a not-so-rare Proof in a mega-grade (example: a 1904 quarter eagle in PR67 Cameo).\nCan a collector buy business strikes and Proofs simultaneously? I don’t see why not. In certain series, like Type Three Liberty Head double eagles, there are Proof-only issues that are collected side-by-side with business strikes. Like owning a dog and a cat at the same time, I say “yes!” to the collector who buys interesting Proofs and business strikes together.\n4. Gold versus Silver versus Copper\nYou are reading this article on a website whose URL is raregoldcoins.com so you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure which of these three coinage metals I favor.\nBut let me at least explain why I do.\nGold is a precious metal with strong demand around the world. Egyptian Pharaohs were buried with spectacular gold ornaments. The last time I checked, there were no silver or copper trinkets in the pyramids.\nTry to explain to a wealthy Chinese collector why he should spend $100,000 on an Indian Cent. Not easy, right? But don’t you think this same individual would more likely “get” the concept of an Uncirculated 1871-CC double eagle at $75,000?\nCopper coins are great and I personally collect Liberty Seated silver coins and love them. However, as far as being a dealer goes, I’m pro-gold and more so now than ever.\n5. 19th Century versus 20th Century\nWhen I began specializing in United States gold coinage back in the early 1980′s, I decided to focus on 19th century coins because they were more affordable and because they seemed like better value. Three decades later I still believe this.\nNow don’t get me wrong. I think 20th century coins are great. I think St. Gaudens double eagles and Indian Head eagles are the most beautiful regular issue coins that the U.S. Mint ever produced. And the incuse designs of the Indian quarter eagle and half eagle series really appeal to me. But 20th century gold tends to be the ultimate in condition rarity and, as I discussed in #2 above, I have always been more of an absolute rarity kinda guy.\nI look at 20th century gold as the Contemporary Art of the numismatic world. Its fairly regularly available, its pretty macho to collect, the market is fluid due to collectors coming and going rapidly and the value levels don’t always make sense.\nI personally like 19th century gold better as I view it as a more cerebral area to collect. It’s clearly not as pretty (there is no doubt that Gobrecht and Longacre couldn’t hold a candle to St. Gaudens as far as artistic talent is concerned) and it more monotonous as it goes on and on (and on). But if you have a budget of, say, $5,000 to $10,000 per coin, you can be a big player in 19th century gold while still being pretty much a nobody in the 20th century arena.\nWhat are your takes on the Numismatic Versus that I compared and contrasted above?

{"question":"How do military-focused computer games and meditation techniques differ in their approaches to preventing PTSD in soldiers and veterans?","answer":"Computer games and meditation techniques take different approaches to PTSD prevention. The Israeli military's computer game trains soldiers to actively focus on threats, as research showed those who avoided threats on screen were at greater risk of developing PTSD after combat. In trials, only 2.6% of soldiers who played the game developed PTSD compared to 7.8% of their peers. In contrast, Transcendental Meditation (TM) focuses on achieving mental relaxation and inner calm through 15-20 minute meditation sessions twice daily. TM has been shown through studies to reduce PTSD symptoms in veterans, with one study finding those who practiced TM twice daily had a 30% greater reduction in symptoms compared to once-daily practitioners.","context":["THE Israeli army has announced that by the end of the year all new infantry soldiers will play a computer game designed to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder. The US military is also reported to be testing the game.\nBlocking out the details of a traumatic event is thought to be one of the causes of PTSD. The game is designed to train soldiers not to do this.\n“On a psychological level, a soldier that does not process threats in real time is more likely to develop PTSD later on in life,” says Yair Bar-Haim at Tel Aviv University. “Flashbacks, overstimulation and an attempt to avoid anything that resembles the traumatic experience are all results of the inability to properly process events as they unfold.”\nThe roll-out is based on the game’s success in a small trial. It’s not the first time a game has been shown to tackle PTSD. A 2015 study showed that playing Tetris after a traumatic experience could prevent the onset of flashbacks. But the new game seems to work differently.\n“Soldiers who did not pay attention to threats on a computer screen were at greater risk of PTSD“\nThe game itself is simple. Players must press a key whenever a dot appears on the screen next to one of two images. One of the images is always threatening – angry faces and negative words like “explosions” and “wounded”–and the other neutral.\nThe game is based on previous work by Colin MacLeod at the University of Western Australia, who was one of the first to use such a game to test for attentional biases in people with anxiety disorders. People react more quickly to dots that appear next to images they are already looking at, he says. So, if someone is slower at responding to dots near threatening images, it suggests they are avoiding them.\nBar-Haim adds a twist. Rather than testing for bias against threatening images, his game trains soldiers to focus on them.\nThat’s because preliminary work in 2008, which tracked infantry soldiers from basic training to deployment, “found that soldiers who did not pay attention to potential threats on a computer screen were at greater risk of developing PTSD after actual combat”, Bar-Haim says.\nTo develop the technique, Bar-Haim teamed up with the Israel Defense Forces’ Medical Corps, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research – the US Department of Defense’s largest biomedical research facility – and the US National Institutes of Health.\nThey then asked 719 Israeli soldiers to play the game in four, 10-minute sessions, as part of an advanced training programme. In July 2014, 14 months later, the same troops were involved in the Israel-Gaza conflict. The team measured symptoms of PTSD in the four months following combat. They found that after 50 days of intense fighting, only 2.6 per cent of the soldiers who had played the game developed PTSD compared with 7.8 per cent of their peers (Psychological Medicine, doi.org/bmk6).\nThat a single round of training showed an effect after 14 months is surprising, says Bar-Haim. “Given the nature of the training we thought it might be necessary to provide booster sessions imminently prior to combat,” he says. “However, the effects are deep and basic.”\nBar-Haim says that the training procedure targets a very specific neuro-functional system involved in threat monitoring – and that neuroimaging shows that such training, even if brief, can induce changes in both brain structure and function. “More research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of change in our preventative intervention,” he says.\nMacLeod thinks the results are exciting. The value of such cognitive training could extend across a wide range of situations where people are exposed to traumatic events, he says.\nHowever, there may be long-term consequences of heightening a person’s attention to threats, he warns – especially when soldiers return to civilian life. “Perhaps the training should be reversed once deployment has been completed.”\nThis article appeared in print under the headline “Brain training for troops”\nMore on these topics:","A sustained commitment for addressing our national crisis of posttraumatic stress (PTS), substance use disorder, and suicide among law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other first responders\nPTSD Program: Developing Resilience for Law Enforcement\nOur law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other first responders experience first-hand some of the most traumatic events that happen in our communities. The cumulative effect over time of the stress caused by both witnessing and responding to these events can have a significant impact on their physical and mental health and well-being. Police and firefighters, when compared to the general civilian population, are at heightened risk for depression, posttraumatic stress (PTS), and suicide. An estimated 400,000 first responders in America have at least some symptoms of PTSD. The health and wellness of our first responders is critical not only to themselves, their families, and their brothers and sisters on the job but also to our public safety as a nation.\nIf we can identify major risk factors that cause PTSD and treat them before they have the chance to develop into full-blown posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, we can improve the quality of life for police officers and perhaps other emergency responders, and better help them deal with the stressors of their work,\" according to researcher Charles Marmar, MD, the Lucius N. Littauer Professor of Psychiatry atNYU Grossman School of Medicine.\nFor more than 15 years, the Center for Resilience of the David Lynch Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, has successfully delivered the evidence-based, trauma-healing Transcendental Meditation ® (TM) technique to several targeted populations, including military veterans, the New York City Firefighters, the New York Police Department, and the Herndon (VA) Police Department. Extensive research, including numerous randomized controlled trials, has documented the benefits of TM for reducing symptoms of PTS, stress, anxiety, depression, substance use disorder and hypertension.\nTM is a simple, easy-to-learn, effortless technique, which allows the body to gain a unique state of profound rest and relaxation while the mind simultaneously settles down to a state of inner calm and wakefulness—without concentration or effort. The TM technique is practiced sitting comfortably for 15 to 20 minutes twice a day. To date, more than ten million people of all ages, nationalities, and religions have learned the technique.\nMore than 400 peer-reviewed published studies on TM have documented improvements in a wide range of stress-related disorders as well as significant improvements in cognitive function and overall health and well-being. The National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense have awarded nearly $35 million in grants to research the benefits of TM on posttraumatic stress, anxiety, bumout, and resilience.\nSalvatore Cassano was a chief with the New York City Fire Department during September 11th. He saw the Twin Towers come down. He remembers everything that day. He can’t forget. He doesn’t want to. After the attack he led FDNY’s effort to rebuild the Fire Department after they lost 343 members of the FDNY on Sept 11th. In 2011, he was promoted to FDNY Commissioner and learned TM. “Meditating is easier than I ever imagined. I get more done in the hours after meditating than I would if I just worked right through the day. I am clearer, more focused, and I enjoy my life much more—an unexpected benefit that I never saw coming.” Commissioner Cassano helped bring a pilot TM program to NYC firefighters through a partnership between the Center for Resilience and Friends of Firefighters, a nonprofit that provides wellness services to active and retired FDNY firefighters and their family members.\nMichael | Retired Senior Investigator | New York State Police Special Federal Agent DEA Task Force | 22 years service\nThe Center for Resilience has instructed thousands of veterans, active-duty personnel and military families in TM, including through the Bronx VA Resilience and Wellness Center (RWC). The RWC is an innovative program focused on suicide prevention. The RWC targets vulnerable veterans by augmenting traditional treatments with complementary and integrative health interventions. The Center for Resilience has partnered with the RWC since its inception in October 2018 and since then more than 150 high-risk veterans have learned to meditate.\nMulti-year partnerships also include many Veteran Administration hospitals nationwide, including Manhattan VA, Bronx VA and Brooklyn VA; National Defense University in Washington, DC; UCLA Veterans Family Wellness Center; EOD Warrior Foundation; New York City Veterans Mental Health Coalition; City University of New York Office of Veterans; New York City-based residential substance abuse treatments centers; and numerous military bases, including Fort Bragg, Fort Gordon, Fort Belvoir, and Fort Hamilton.\nHundreds of peer-reviewed studies have been conducted on the benefits of TM at over 100 independent universities and medical schools during the past 50 years. The National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense have provided nearly $35 million to fund research on TM and stress, heart health, and PTSD. The most recent third-party validation of this research came in January 2020 when the Journal of the American Medical Association published an article on the current state of VA treatments noting that TM is as effective as the VA’s first line recommended treatments for PTSD. This was based, in part, on the findings of a $2.4 million DoD-funded randomized control trial at the San Diego VA which the New England Journal of Medicine’s “Journal Watch” listed as one of 2019’s top 10 psychiatry publications. This study of 203 veterans with PTSD compared TM with Prolonged Exposure (PE), one of the VAs first line treatments for PTS, and a PTSD education active control. The study was published in The Lancet Psychiatry in November 2018 and found TM to be at least as effective as PE and significantly more effective than a PTSD education control group.\nNidich S, et al. Non-trauma-focused meditation versus exposure therapy in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial. The Lancet Psychiatry 2018 5:975-986.\nIn 2023, the David Lynch Foundation’s Center for Resilience launched the largest study ever to be conducted on the impact of meditation on veterans and first reponders with PTSD. The study is a multi-site randomized controlled trial that will evaluate whether the Transcendental Meditation ® (TM) technique is effective as a first line treatment for PTSD. Secondary outcomes will include depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol craving/usage, sleep quality and quality of life. The 6-site study will take place at research universities around the U.S. with approximately 300 subjects.The goal of the study is to secure long-term government funding for TM.\nThe primary outcome measure in this clinical trial will be the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) for DSM-5. Secondary outcome measures will include the Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)-5, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 for depression, Insomnia Sleep Index, Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) interview of alcohol consumption and other non-prescribed substance usage, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLES-Q). A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to determine the cost-saving value of the TM program in the treatment of PTSD.\nThe impact of this study will be substantial. The research will be used to secure government approval for the implementation of TM as a treatment option in VA healthcare and other military settings. The availability of an alternative and evidence-based PTSD therapy will benefit patients by offering a greater range of treatment options and by serving as a secondary modality for those not responding to prior therapy. In particular, because TM is a non-trauma focused treatment it is often preferred to other existing treatments for PTSD therapies that involve confronting anxiety-provoking thoughts and stimuli. TM is relatively low cost and provides a life-long tool for promoting mental and physical health. Other advantages of the TM treatment for veterans is that the technique is less emotionally demanding for practitioners than other PTSD therapies, it produces documented benefits within the first month of practice, and it is more self-empowering to veterans because of the component of regular daily home practice.\nTM decreased multiple features of post-traumatic stress disorder in US war veterans, with reductions indepression, anxiety, insomnia, severity of delayed stress syndrome, emotional numbness, alcohol consumption, family problems, and difficulty in obtaining employment.\nRosenthal JZ, et al. Effects of Transcendental Meditation in veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom with posttraumatic stress disorder: a pilot study. Military Medicine 2011; 176:626-630.\nTM practice decreased PTSD symptoms in war veterans to below clinical levels after one month, withfurther reductions after three months. The study found those veterans who practiced TM twice a day (recommended schedule) had a 30% greater decline in symptoms of PTSD than veterans who practiced TM only once a day, a dose-response effect that suggests causality.\nHerron RE and Rees B.

{"question":"Comparing traditional pain management with complementary approaches, which is more focused on medication?","answer":"Traditional pain management tends to be more medication-focused, as indicated by the mention that 'the first instinct may be to open the medicine cabinet or ask for a prescription to find relief.' In contrast, complementary approaches like biofeedback, massage therapy, and reflexology focus on non-medication techniques to manage pain. These complementary methods work to reduce pain and improve relaxation without relying on pharmaceutical interventions.","context":["New model to help patients holistically manage pain established at UF Health Jacksonville\nA new program to help people manage pain by using a combination of traditional methods mixed with new coaching and education has been established at UF Health Jacksonville. The new initiative is a collaboration between emergency medicine providers and a grant from the Florida Department of Health.\nFor those battling pain, the first instinct may be to open the medicine cabinet or ask for a prescription to find relief. For many living with pain, the use of medication alone is not always the best solution. Recent estimates indicate chronic pain affects 50 million adults in the U.S. and this does not take into account cases that are acute in nature based on injuries commonly seen in the emergency room.\nRetail pharmacies and stores are not always easy to navigate due to dozens of products on the shelf marketed for pain relief. Amid the opioid epidemic in the U.S., many patients and providers are also searching for non-medication pain management options with fewer side effects and risk for addiction. Where do you turn when you are flooded with options and the need to return to work or activities of daily living?\nThe Pain Assessment and Management Initiative Pain and Opioid Stewardship Education program, or PAMI POST-Ed, was established through a 2020 Overdose Data to Action award to develop and implement a novel pain coaching and education model. Launched in January, it is the first known pain coaching program implemented in a U.S. emergency room.\nOverdose Data to Action, or OD2A, is part of a cooperative agreement to address the drug overdose epidemic with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention providing funding to the Florida Department of Health in Duval County. PAMI POST-Ed is sponsored by the state of Florida Department of Health.\nDouglas Suffield, MAcOM, DiplOM, L.Ac., was hired in October 2020 as the program’s pain education specialist. He is a former emergency medical responder and is board-certified in acupuncture and oriental medicine. In his role, he provides patient consultations in the emergency department at UF Health Jacksonville and UF Health North and hospital inpatient units.\n“My hope is to educate, coach and guide patients toward a better understanding of the way they identify and experience their pain,” Suffield said. “By utilizing my experience as an integrative health provider, our toolkit of multimodal pain management interventions, and interdepartmental communication and cooperation, I have no doubt this initiative will be a success and improve the way patients understand and manage pain.”\nAn integral part of the coaching experience is the hands-on training Suffield brings to patients — teaching them about pain neuroscience, topical analgesics, deep breathing exercises, virtual reality and other complementary health approaches. Often viewed as Eastern medicine, Suffield and the POST-Ed team will work to integrate this approach alongside traditional pain management practices to holistically guide patients in achieving an improved approach to pain management.\nThe program is a joint multidisciplinary effort with stakeholders and advisors from pharmacy, rehabilitative services, nursing, chaplaincy, palliative care, pain management, emergency services and trauma.\n“This program is a winning strategy and collaborative partnership for patients and health care providers. It has been well received by our faculty, staff and patients and provides valuable adjuncts to incorporate into a more comprehensive pain management treatment plan while reducing the dose or need for opioids,\" said Ashley Norse, M.D., associate chair of operation for emergency medicine.\nSuffield also provides patients with a toolkit of pain self-management options and educational materials for use at home. The toolkit is tailored to patient interest, type of pain and individual needs. Toolkit options include a virtual reality viewer, aromatherapy inhaler, pain analogy and stress device called “A car with four flat tires,” a hot and cold reusable gel pack, hand acupressure device, pain journal and a choice of 17 educational brochures.\nEstablished in 2014 by Phyllis Hendry, M.D., a professor and associate chair for research in the department of emergency medicine and Sophia Sheikh, M.D., an assistant professor of emergency medicine, medical toxicologist and medical director of the Florida/USVI Poison Information Center – Jacksonville, the PAMI program has previously developed toolkits and patient resources to assist with patient discharge planning for pain. The POST-Ed project is the newest addition to PAMI and continues the program’s mission of advancing innovation and safety in pain education, patient care and research.\n“We are appreciative of having been selected as an OD2A grantee by DOH-Duval for this innovative project aimed at curbing the pain and opioid epidemic,” Hendry said. “Doug was the ideal candidate for our first pain educator position especially given his extensive integrative education and patient experience. Our team looks forward to expanding the program and sharing pilot materials and lessons learned with other health care systems.”\nMedia contact: Dan Leveton at firstname.lastname@example.org or 904-244-3268.","ARTICLES / General / Effective Pain Management /\nShare This Article\nEffective Pain Management\nBy Cheryl Ellis, Staff Writer\nCONTROLLING PAIN IN CANCER\nThe National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov)\noffers an online booklet to assist cancer patients and\ntheir caregivers with pain management.\n“Cancer pains” may arise from\nchemotherapy or radiation, creating nerve damage or\nphantom pain from body parts that have been removed.\nRadiation can cause painful “sunburn” during treatment.\nWhenever there is surgery performed,\ntemporary pain may be experienced because skin and\norgans are cut and maneuvered around.\nPost-surgical pain fades with time and appropriate\nmanagement, which may include physical therapy and\nresuming daily activities.\nThe growth of cancer within the body\ncontributes to pain, also. As cancer is being\ntreated, therapeutic levels of controlling the growth\nare sought, but patients may still experience pain while\nwaiting for the abnormal cells to be eradicated.\nThis is where pain control offers a great deal to assist\nin stress reduction and continuing patient compliance\nwith therapy. It’s difficult to ask a loved one to\ncontinue with treatment when pain makes them feel they\naren’t getting better, and the goal is to quickly assess\nthe level of pain to begin pain control. It makes\nthe treatment much easier to cope with, for caregiver\nand loved one.\nDifferential pain assessment in cancer\nis important also, to help the treatment team to discern\nif new pain is from cancer that has moved to a new area,\nor if there is an acute condition that must be addressed\n(such as appendicitis or gall bladder stones). It\nmay seem unlikely that cancer patients may experience an\nacute episode of pain unrelated to their cancerous\nprocess, but it is possible. It may help to keep a\nwritten record of pain to offer feedback to the\nphysician during visits, or if a call must be placed\nSwelling, itching and rashes cause pain,\nand while minor when examined against pain from cancer,\nthey can actually make it harder to tolerate pain levels\nif the minor pain is left unaddressed.\nCOMPLEMENTARY PAIN TREATMENTS\nBiofeedback has been around for some\ntime, and there are competent technicians able to\ninstruct patients in controlling their breathing and\nheart rate. The technique has worked well for\npersons who have an ability to focus on these measurable\nparameters, which can help reduce pain and the anxiety\nthat comes from being in pain.\nMassage therapy can work in almost any\ncase to reduce pain and improve the relaxation effect.\nIt is not necessary to “work” the area where pain is\nfelt to provide comfort and a sense of healing.\nPatients with swelling from radiation or\nsurgery (such as removal of lymph nodes) can look for a\nLymphedema Therapist, who is trained in proper technique\nfor massaging swollen areas as well as the rest of the\nReflexology can be performed on the\nhands or feet to help release tense areas which may be\nrelated to painful spots. The body in pain will\ntense itself in a variety of ways in response to pain,\nand by relaxing one part of the body by massage, the\nrest of it can follow.\nMassage can be combined with\nbiofeedback, imagery or other alternative therapies\n(such as aromatherapy) to diminish stress response."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:713b559d-e123-49d8-b92b-0e225b993f3b>","<urn:uuid:751a487c-1bd5-4d2b-a141-2f6dc886bed0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do workplace distractions affect productivity differently in open offices versus designated meeting rooms?","answer":"In open offices, workplace distractions significantly reduce productivity, with employers believing employees lose 2-5 hours per day (up to 3 days weekly) due to distractions like cell phones, texting, and social media. High-performance employees take about 25 minutes to regain focus after a distraction, with just 4 distractions adding up to 2 hours in lost productivity. In contrast, using designated meeting rooms helps maintain productivity by providing appropriate spaces for activities like video meetings, conferences, and lengthy conversations, reducing noise disruption to others in the workspace.","context":["Noise is usually defined as any disturbing sound. In practice, however, it is referred to as ‘sound’ when pleasant, and ‘noise’ when annoying. Generally, the acceptable levels of noise in office areas are below those levels known to pose a risk to hearing.\n- Monitor how loud you speak.\n- Keep ringtone levels to a minimum.\n- Use office rooms for lengthy conversations.\n- Worker distraction\n- Reduced productivity\nIdentified hazards and controls\nWorker distraction, stress and headaches\n- Hearing other people’s conversations in the work area.\n- Loud ring tones on mobile phones.\n- Noises from office equipment, such as printers, photocopiers and phones.\nWhat workers can do\n- Be mindful of the volume of your voice.\nMany people don’t recognise that they can unconsciously raise their voice when speaking on the phone. We tend to think speaking louder makes us clearer to understand.\n- Be mindful of the volume of your personal devices.\nIf you listen to music using headphones while working, you shouldn’t have the volume too loud as this introduces new noise risks. Your co-workers should not be able to hear your music. Try and have the volume at a level so you can still hear colleagues who need to talk to you and emergency warning sounds.\n- Make sure you keep your mobile phone volume low while at work, as a courtesy to others. Go to a quiet room to take these calls.\n- Use a meeting room for video meetings and video conferences rather than at your desk.\n- Get away from the noise by taking temporary breaks. For example, you could get a drink of water, go to the printer or take a quick walk outside.\n- Tell your colleagues if you have an important deadline to meet and need a quieter environment to concentrate.\nWhat employers can do\n- When purchasing printers and photocopiers consider purchasing ones with lower noise output.\n- Listen to worker complaints and take action to identify the source of the noise.\n- Implement some noise-related policies which describe appropriate levels of noise, and when and where it acceptable to have loud conversations and conference calls.\n- Locate printers and photocopiers away from workers, preferably in a separate ventilated room.\n- If necessary, measure the noise levels in the office. It is likely, however, that the level will be lower than the level that causes hearing loss. You will need to consult an audiometric expert before taking this option.\n- Design the workplace with the functions to be performed in mind. For example, a call centre has different requirements regarding noise than administrative functions. The types of materials used in construction or refurbishment of the workplace should provide adequate sound absorbing properties, such as carpet, partitions and plants.\n- Stop Noise from Ruining Your Open Office by Christopher Calisi and Justin Stout\n- Decibel Exposure Time Guidelines.\n- Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011 – Refer to part 3.1 Managing risks to health and safety and part 3.2, division 2 General working environment.\n- How to Manage Work Health and Safety Risks Code of Practice 2015\n- Managing Noise and Preventing Hearing Loss at Work Code of Practice 2015 – Although not aimed at office work, this code does provide an understanding of source of exposure.\nPage last reviewed: 03 May 2021","The modern workplace is alive with distraction. The open floor plan office so common today means that everyone in the office is susceptible to practically every beep and ping from computers and smartphones, every overly odiferous microwaved lunch, whispered conversations or boisterous storytelling, and on and on. It’s a wonder any work gets done when the distractions come fast and furious.\nMany people are trying to find ways to deal with distractions and maintain personal productivity. What exactly happens when we’re distracted? How do you deal with distractions? Any quick fixes? The answers to these questions are rather surprising and point to the many ways we can remain focused and productive in even the most distraction-filled workplaces.\nHow do distractions impact the brain and memory?\nResearch shows that short-term memory is linked to the ability or inability to ignore distractions. When you’re hard at work, your brain is taking information into its short-term working memory, processing it, then outputting ideas, results, thoughts, and so on. Whatever it is you’re working on. Any stimulus outside of your zone of focus depletes your mental “bandwidth,” reducing the amount of working memory at your disposal. Like a computer trying to handle too many commands at the same time, everything slows down. And your productivity suffers.\nHow big a problem are workplace distractions?\nA survey of 3,000 office workers and 2,000 managers identified the biggest workplace distractions. At the top of the employers’ list of employee time wasters were cell phones and texting, the Internet, and social media. No surprises there. But what is alarming is that 3 in 4 employers believe employees lose 2 to 5 hours per day to distractions. That’s up to 3 days of weekly productivity lost to distractions.\nWhat do employees say they need to counter distraction?\nOne insightful way to learn about workplace distraction is to examine so-called high-performance employees (HPEs), professionals who are unusually productive as they work on high-value problems. An anonymous online survey of high-performance employees found that, “58% of HPEs need more private spaces for problem solving, and 54% of HPEs find their office environment ‘too distracting.’” It was estimated that HPEs take 25 minutes to regain their focus after a distraction; suggesting that just 4 distractions per day add up to nearly 2 hours in lost productivity.\nDo workplace distractions affect our experience of work?\nResearchers from the University of California, Irvine investigated the costs of interrupted work. They initially set out to determine whether the context of an interruption had a meaningful impact on a person’s productivity. Picture someone is working on a creative project and is interrupted with a question: Is there a productivity difference if the question is about the creative project versus about something completely unrelated? What they found was surprising—and telling. First, after an interruption people completed tasks faster because they compensate for the distraction by speeding up. All without any loss of quality. The surprise finding was how extensive the emotional cost was. Distracted people experienced more stress and frustration than their focused peers.\nWhat can be done to minimize the impact of distraction?\nHarvard researchers outlined advice for what to do when you’re feeling distracted at work. Some of those action items include:\n· Understand the negative impact of multitasking\n· Don’t let feelings like anxiety get the upper hand\n· Actively gather your focus and attention\n· Understand what distracts you and establish boundaries\n· Interact with supportive colleagues\nUltimately, combating workplace distraction is a very individual effort. But by understanding how the brain and body respond to distraction, we can make great strides towards retaining focus in even the most distracting environments. And don’t be afraid to throw on headphones and play your favorite productivity-boosting music."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e21acd18-f813-4822-9954-67fda922a904>","<urn:uuid:20764942-cf31-4da7-a612-ca97412f02df>"],"error":null}

In 1918, in response to increased traffic, the building was renovated and an extension was added onto the original structure. The exterior of the 1876 section still retains its distinctly Gothic bargeboard which reflected the very popular features of English gatehouses and stables of the time. This style of architecture and its accompanying decorative features was very unusual for 19th century industrial buildings constructed in the outports of Newfoundland and Labrador.\nWhile there remains no equipment from the period the 1876 section does retain the much of the original layout and the distinctive wainscoting. The interior layout, which is primarily intact, also reflected the close relationship between the social and work world of the staff with space for the library made available in the original 1876 section of the building.\nWith the extension in 1918 a whole new section, reflecting the changing technology, was added to the structure. In addition a second washroom for the female staff, the only tangible evidence of a female presence and role in the history of the site, was also added.

Also located on the property is a piece of the original radio tower and foundation blocks used to support the towers. The designation is confined to the property.\nThe Admiralty House Museum and Archives has been designated a municipal heritage structure because of its historical, architectural and environmental values.\nThe Admiralty House Museum and Archives, formerly known as the H.M. Wireless Station, is historically significant due to its associations with the British Admiralty, its involvement in the Florizel Disaster of 1918, and the evolution of wireless communication both Newfoundland and beyond.\nIn 1914 the British Admiralty proposed the building of the wireless telegraphy station at Mount Pearl in efforts to improve its war time intelligence gathering and weather reporting capabilities. This building was one of 13 wireless stations built throughout the world by the British Admiralty during the First World War. The Admiralty designated H.M. Wireless Station at Mount Pearl as its North Atlantic Intelligence Centre. Members of the Marconi Company were recruited in to the British Navy and sent to work in the wireless station under the command of Officer Lieutenant G.L.J. Wolley. In comparison to other wireless stations in Newfoundland during that time, the H.M. Wireless station was among the most powerful, employing state-of-the-art equipment that allowed transmission and reception of signals over 1000 miles away. Following the conclusion of World War One, the H.M. Wireless station was used for the transmission and collection of information regarding shipping and the weather. In 1918, the station played an important role in the Florizel Disaster when it received and relayed the only S.O.S. signal from the ship after it had run aground off Newfoundland’s south-eastern shore. In 1939, the H.M. Wireless station was again utilized for communications, only this time it was spear-headed by the Commission Government of Newfoundland who broadcasted the Voice of Newfoundland (VONF) station out of the west end of the wireless station. Currently, the building is still being utilized for radio communication in addition to being the location for Mount Pearl’s museum and archives.\nThe H.M. Wireless Station is architecturally significant due to its style of construction. When the British Admiralty proposed the construction of the thirteen wireless buildings they opted to use prefabricated buildings, giving the Admiralty control over the style and shape of the building. This style of building also allowed for rapid construction of the project. Original features still remaining include the original roof trusses and chimneys.\nThe Admiralty House Museum and Archives is environmentally significant because of its strategic placement within the city of Mount Pearl. Due to its usage as a wireless communication site during the First World War, it was necessary that the H.M. Wireless Station be placed in an area that was good for wireless communication but at the same time safe from incoming fire from enemy ships.\nSource: Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, unnumbered file – Mount Pearl – Admiralty House Museum and Archives\nAll original features which relate to the age and style of the building including:\n- Low pitched gable roof with original trusses\n- Original chimneys\n- Prefabricate construction style\n- Size, shape and location of windows excluding those in modernized entranceway\n- Size, dimensions and location of museum\n- Original features of the buidling related to its use as a telegraphy station\nElements relating to environment including:\n- Location of the wireless communication building relative to the location of the museum\n- Remnants of wireless tower and concrete base\n- Location within the city of Mount Pearl\nNewfoundland and Labrador\nCity of Mount Pearl\nCity of Mount Pearl Act\nCity of Mount Pearl Heritage Building, Structure or Land\nTheme - Category and Type\n- Governing Canada\n- Military and Defence\nFunction - Category and Type\n- Military Support\nArchitect / Designer\nMarconi Wireless and Telegraphy Company, Chelmsford, England for the Royal Navy\nLocation of Supporting Documentation\nAdmiralty House Museum And Archives\n23 Old Placentia Road\nMount Pearl, NF\nCross-Reference to Collection"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f76773aa-6dfd-414e-8b76-062a68f47d3b>","<urn:uuid:4bcb9c2c-e283-4550-9ef1-642c124f1d66>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do brake maintenance requirements compare between bikes and automobiles, particularly regarding brake fluid and cable systems?","answer":"Bikes and automobiles have different brake maintenance requirements. Bikes primarily rely on cable systems, where gear and brake cables run from the levers to the derailleurs and braking system, requiring regular checking for smooth operation and possible replacement if dirt accumulates or cables become worn. In contrast, automobiles use a hydraulic system with brake fluid that needs to be replaced every few years during brake service. The brake fluid in cars transfers hydraulic pressure and can be compromised by time, heat, moisture, road grime, brake dust, and rust, which can reduce braking efficiency. While bike maintenance focuses on cable tension and pad wear, car maintenance must address fluid levels, seals, brake lines, and the master cylinder to maintain proper hydraulic pressure.","context":["As the sun has started to pop out more often, I’ve seen more and more bikes on the roads which appear to have emerged from sheds and been thrust into the cold light of day without a thought for their feelings. Dirty, un-lubed and sometimes making creaky noises, these poor bicycles are squealing for some love.\nI’m sure most London Cyclist readers are hardy souls, commuting year-round through wind, rain and snow – in which case this is not entirely directed at you, though you may find it useful.\nHowever, there may be a few readers out there who put their bikes away six months ago, and are now emerging from a long hibernation, wiping tired eyes in disbelief as the sun streams through the windows. If that’s you – we’ve missed you! This post is just for you, and it’s all about helping you get the bike back on the road, and riding smoothly.\nAs always, our bike maintenance app Bike Doctor is available and if you prefer your bicycle tuition face to face, then here’s how you can find free bike maintenance classes in London.\nHere’s a look at some of the items that might need a refresh if you’re bike has been left unridden:\nGear and brake cables\nGear cables run from the levers to the deraillers, which (should) move when you want to change gear. Gear cables run again from the levers, to the braking system. If you find your gears are not changing smoothly, they may just need indexing, and brakes that don’t act smoothly and quickly could just need tightening or adjusting.\nHowever, if you’ve ruled this out as a cause, the next is to see if the cables need replacing. If you’ve left the bike dormant for 6 months (or indeed ridden it through rain and mud) it is quite likely. Over time, dirt and crud can get caught in the housing, which will limit their effectiveness – and if that isn’t the problem, they could have become worn.\nYou can pop the bike into a bike shop for a service, and ask them to replace the cables. However, it isn’t too hard to yourself, and we published a guide on how to replace gear cables here. Brake cables are very similar, and there is a handy step-by-step tutorial by Park Tool here.\nFirstly – make sure your brakes are working. This is pretty simple – hold your hands on the brakes, and try to roll the bike forwards – if it moves, you may need to adjust your brakes.\nDisc brakes can’t get out of alignment, but V and calliper brakes can. To check this, spin the wheel and squeeze the brake. If the pad doesn’t engage with the braking surface, you need to adjust them- and there is a guide here.\nIf the bike doesn’t move when you roll it forwards with the brakes engaged, but you’re still finding the braking isn’t crisp as it used to be, you may need new pads.\nBrake pads wear down over time. You’ll be able to see it very clearly on v-brakes or calliper brakes as the pads will look much slimmer than they used to – there is usually a marker to show when they’re worn down too. If you have disc brakes, you’ll be able to tell the pads are worn if the brakes are squealing, grinding, or noticeably less powerful.\nIf you’ve got v or calliper brakes, you just need to undo the bolt on the brake pad shoe, slide out the old pad, replace with a new one, and tighten the screw. You may have brake pad shoes that don’t have removable pads, in which case you’ll need to replace the whole shoe, but this is still fairly simple and just requires an allen key – there is a guide on brake adjustment here.\nIf you’ve got hydraulic dic brakes, we have a guide on how to replace hydraulic disc brake pads here.\nIf you’ve been riding your bike all winter, it’s likely the tyres have ridden over the odd gravelly section, passed through a few puddles and rolled over the odd bit of glass. If you haven’t ridden in months – you’ll have very little idea what road conditions were like last time the bike ventured outside, so it’s best to check the tyres.\nTyres don’t last forever, they see the worst of the road, and along the way the can accumulate nicks that can lead to punctures.\nYou can check your tyres quickly by just looking at the surface – if there are no nicks or marks – well, they’re either really new or you live near lovely roads. If you notice a few imperfections, it’s worth giving them a more thorough check.\nFor a proper tyre check, remove the tyre from the wheel, and check the outside surface. Where you find any little nicks, check the same area on the inside of the tyre. Any little cuts that don’t go right through are not much of a problem – but if you can the hole goes right through the tyre, you need to replace it, or you risk Repetitive Puncture Disorder (RPD).\nNext- run your hand, carefully, around the inside of the tyre. Be aware there could be glass or sharp objects you can’t see – so watch your fingers. The same rule applies – shallow cuts are not an issue, but anything that goes through the tyre is a pucture risk.\nClean and lube the bike\nA clean bike is efficient, a pleasure to ride (usually), and faster. You can clean a bike with water and a toothbrush, but some light degreaser will make a world of difference.\nDegreasing and scrubbing the drivechain will make mean that shifting is smoother, and doing this regularly will make the components last longer. We published a detailed guide on how to do this here.\nDo make sure you apply chain lube, or it won’t be long before a familiar rusty orange glow collects on the chain, and your bike will begin to squeak.","Complete Guide to Disc Brakes and Drum Brakes\nWhen it comes to driving safety, your brakes are critical. We’ve compiled a guide to help you understand your brakes. This includes disc and drum brakes, how they work, how they’re different and alike, why you may have both types on the same vehicle, what kind of wear to expect, and what parts will need maintenance.\nWhat you’ll find in this guide:\nWhat Is a Simple Brake System\nMaster Cylinder: Contains a piston assembly and brake fluid.\nBrake Fluid: Transfers the hydraulic pressure.\nDisc Brake Assembly: Includes caliper, pads, and rotor.\nBrake Lines and Hoses: Carries the brake fluid to the brake assemblies.\nDrum Brake Assembly: Includes shoes, wheel cylinder and drum.\nBraking System Basics\nDisc and drum brakes are based on a hydraulic pressure system. Braking starts with a mechanical force — your foot pressing the brake pedal. The end result is that your vehicle safely stops. Below is a quick explanation of the five points of the system.\nA piston compresses brake fluid inside the master cylinder located under your vehicle’s hood near your engine. This creates hydraulic pressure, generating a much bigger force than that of the small effort of pressing down on the pedal. See above image.\nThe pressure is transferred via the brake fluid through the brake lines and/or brake hoses (flexible tubes) that connect the lines with brake assemblies at each wheel.\nThere, wheel cylinders convert that hydraulic pressure back to mechanical force. Brake friction material is pushed against the brake disc or drum, slowing or stopping your vehicle.\nThe disc brake assembly is designed to safely stop your car when activated. More details about how this works below.\nThe drum brake assembly, equipped on some vehicles, is also designed to stop your vehicle when other points on the system are activated. More details below.\nBasics of Disc Brakes\nDisc brakes are found on most vehicles today. They are mounted on the front and/or rear axle. To stop a wheel (and your car), a disc brake uses a caliper fitted with brake pads to grab a spinning disc or rotor.\nWhat is a caliper?\nThe caliper is an assembly mounted to the vehicle with a bracket. It frames the rotor, looking and functions like a c-clamp. It contains the following components:\nBrake pads are a friction material bonded to a metal plate that helps stop your vehicle.\nOne or multiple pistons to push the brake pads against the rotor when you brake.\nA bleeder screw to allow for servicing the brakes and replacing the fluid.\nA rubber piston seal that prevents brake fluid leakage and retracts the piston when the brakes are released.\nA dust boot to keep contaminants out of the cylinder.\nAnti-rattle clips that add stability.\nWhat is a rotor?\nThe rotor is made of cast iron or a steel/cast iron composite. It’s attached to the wheel hub and turns with the wheel. This is the surface that the brake pads make contact with to slow your vehicle. Here’s how it works: when you step on the brakes, pressurized brake fluid pushes against the pistons inside the caliper, forcing the brake pads against the rotor. As the brake pads press against both sides of the disc, the friction stops the wheel’s rotation.\nRotors can either be solid or vented. Vented rotors have more surface area and can more easily dissipate heat.\nTwo Types of Disc Brakes: Floating & Fixed\nThere are two types of disc brakes. They are floating and fixed, named for the type of brake caliper used.\nA floating caliper (also called sliding) is the most common type. It has one or two pistons. When the brakes are applied, the inner brake pad is forced against the disc while, at the same time, the caliper body moves closer to the rotor. This action forces the outer brake pad against the rotor.\nThe fixed caliper design has one or more pistons mounted on each side of the rotor. The caliper itself doesn’t budge or move. It’s rigidly fastened to a brake caliper bracket or spindle. When the brakes are applied, only the caliper pistons move, pressing the brake pads against the disc.\nBasics of Drum Brakes\nDrum brakes are most often used on the rear axle of today’s vehicles. They are also very common on trailers. Manufacturers don’t use brake pads as the friction material in drum brakes. Instead, a drum brake system has a wheel cylinder with pistons that push brake shoes out against the inside of a spinning drum. This contact slows and stops the rotation of the brake drum and the wheel, bringing your vehicle to a stop.\nDrum vs. Disc Brakes\nMany of today’s vehicles have disc brakes on all four wheels. However, some models still have disc brakes on the front axle and drum brakes on the rear.\nWhy are discs put on the front? It’s due to weight factors. A typical, unloaded vehicle is about 10 percent heavier in front due to the engine. When you hit the brakes, the weight of the car transfers to the front. Therefore, more braking power is needed in the front, making disc brakes the perfect option for the job.\nDisc vs. Drum Brakes: Servicing\nServicing disc and drum brakes is important. When it comes to repairs, drum brakes have more hardware and can be more complex to service. But the materials typically cost less than disc brake pads, calipers, and rotors. Disc brakes generally consist of fewer components and are easier to service.\nBrake Maintenance: What Needs to Be Checked\nA lot of heat is created when you apply the brakes. When you press on the brake pedal, you’re converting the kinetic (moving) energy of the vehicle into thermal energy (heat), subjecting many parts to very high temperatures. This means a lot of wear and tear even in normal conditions. Some brake components will need to be replaced over the life of a vehicle, including:\nBrake Pad or Brake Shoe Friction Material: Disc brake pads slow the rotor through friction and wear with normal use. Eventually, they become too thin to function properly. The same applies to drum brakes. The friction material gets worn out and braking can become compromised. These components should be inspected regularly to avoid wearing them to the point that they cause damage to additional parts of your vehicle (rotor or drum).\nBrake Fluid: The brake system should be checked regularly for leaks and fluid should be replaced every few years (usually when the brakes are serviced). Any leak in the master cylinder, the brake fluid reservoir, the wheel cylinders, lines or hoses will reduce the hydraulic pressure that’s created when the brakes are activated. If the system can’t generate sufficient force needed to create braking power, you’ll notice your brake pedal needs to be pressed a lot further in order to slow or stop.\nHow often should I replace my brake fluid?: The brake fluid should be replaced every few years. This is usually done when brakes are serviced. While brake fluid is specifically formulated to prevent corrosion of the brake hydraulic components, time, heat, and moisture can lower the boiling point of the fluid. This results in less pressure in the hydraulic system forcing you to push down farther on the brake pedal to slow your vehicle. Other impurities, such as road grime, brake dust, rust, and more can get into the brake fluid, reducing braking efficiency and possibly damaging parts of the braking system.\nSeals: These rubber rings keep the hydraulic fluid from leaking and protect it from moisture and contaminants. They also cause the piston to return to its off position so the brake pads disengage properly when you release the brake pedal. If this doesn’t happen, you could experience brake drag, premature wear, and the vehicle may pull to one side when you brake.\nBrake Lines/Hoses: Brake lines and hoses are an essential part of the braking system. Rubber hoses can wear over time, while brake lines can be subject to corrosion or other damage. When this happens, it may compromise brake efficiency, loss of hydraulic pressure, pulling to one side, etc. Routine inspections, including hoses and lines, are critical to avoiding these issues.\nRotors: Rotors should be inspected regularly for even wear, physical damage, or cracking from excessive heat. These conditions can compromise braking power and efficiency. Brake rotors should be resurfaced or replaced when you have your brakes serviced (brake job or pads replaced). If you are experiencing any of the previously mentioned issues, your rotors may need to be repaired or replaced sooner.\nDust Boots: Brake components are constantly exposed to road debris and brake dust. The dust boot prevents grime from entering the caliper piston. If it fails and can’t do its job, piston damage can occur, causing brake drag, pulls and premature wear.\nMaster Cylinder: Regular fluid maintenance is important for prolonging cylinder life. Failing master cylinders can leak internally. In this case, you may get a low or soft pedal feel. You might not notice any visible fluid loss.\nNOTE: There are different approaches to brake service. See our Brake Servicing 101 and learn why it’s important to maintain more than just the brake pads or drum brake shoes.\nHow Often Do Brakes Need to Be Serviced?\nThere’s no set timeframe. The need to replace or service your brakes depends on your vehicle, driving style, climate and road conditions. To ensure proper braking when you need it, get your brakes checked regularly.\nStill have questions about your brakes? Review these frequently asked brake service questions.\nDisc and drum brakes are built differently, with somewhat different advantages. Both work as part of the hydraulic brake system. This system is constantly under high pressure, subject to heat, and can be compromised by road grime, air, brake dust and moisture. It’s important to get regular brake inspections to keep everything in proper working condition. Refer to your owner’s manual for a recommended schedule. Remember that odd brake sounds, smells or performance are indicators you need to get your vehicle to Les Schwab right away."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0f0ad445-0a77-4948-b863-6cc64744088d>","<urn:uuid:88e9c02a-59ac-4cb0-a6f7-64420ed04c98>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Between robotic welding and friction stir welding, which offers more versatility in terms of material compatibility and application flexibility?","answer":"Friction stir welding offers greater versatility in material compatibility as it can join a wide range of materials, including aluminum, copper, and other non-ferrous alloys, and can even join dissimilar materials - making it particularly valuable for applications like heatsink production where different materials might be needed for bases and fins. While robotic welding using GMAW is a standardized process focused primarily on traditional welding applications, requiring specific programming for each joint type and careful control of welding parameters. The robotic welding process needs detailed programming considerations for different joint conditions and multiple weld locations, with specific settings for wire feed speed and voltage for each type of joint.","context":["When it is done correctly, robotic welding can provide manufacturers with significant productivity gains, as well as an excellent return on investment (ROI). However, robotic welding can be a complex process, especially if you are a new robot programmer.\nWhile the best course of action for learning robotic programming is to acquire training from your robot brand OEM, it never hurts to implement expert-proven robotic welding tips and tricks from the start. As with any specialty process, there are steps that you must take when programming a weld sequence and certain things to avoid.\nGeneral Do’s and Don’ts of Robotic Welding Programming\nThe gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process is the same for robotic welding as it is for semiautomatic welding. Some of the practices outlined in welding codes can help to “control” the application of robots for the fabrication and manufacturing world. Examples include the setup and use of established weld procedures for various joint conditions common in your operations. Other welding-related tips can help simplify the process.\nCreate an Arc File library based on weld size, and name each file clearly and concisely. For example, ASF#1 is a 3⁄16-in. horizontal fillet; ASF#2 is a 3⁄16-in. flat fillet; ASF#3 is a ¼-in. horizontal fillet; and so on. Use corresponding numbers for arc start and end files.\nWeave files should match the arc files for each weld size. For example, ASF#1 uses WEV#1; ASF#2 uses WEV#2, etc.\nRemove speed tags on process moves if you want to use the weld speed specified in the arc\nKeep weld programs small (less than 100 to 200 points). Having too much in one program can make editing confusing. Always label each weld with a line comment on the move before the arc start. Use logical subroutines to keep program size manageable, such as a program for each positioner orientation if there are many weld locations on a multisided part.\nFocus on torch/arm posture for weld joints, and then add air-cut moves in between welds that flow smoothly.\nKeep a master part for programming. This part should be labeled with weld numbers and arc size file numbers, which allows for a quick reference for weld adjustment. A part print with weld locations and program points noted can serve the same purpose.\nKeep a log or change record for the robot workcell where technicians can note the date, time, and reason for changes. Robots may have the ability to log changes to programs, but they may not include the reason for changes.\nDo not create programs with improper control axes, especially if the system is equipped with coordinated positioners or multiple robots.\nDo not create or use multiple weld settings (wire feed speed and voltage) on many different weld locations with the same joint type. Use travel speed to adjust the heat or fill for various joint fit-ups. Wire feed speed and voltage control the “burn” of the wire and can be adjusted to reduce spatter. Travel speed has the most pronounced effect on heat, as noted by heat input:\nHeat Input = (Amps x Volts) / Travel Speed\nWelding Torch Do’s and Don’ts\nA critical factor for robotic welding is choosing the right weld gun for the task at hand. More so, the ability to program and maneuver a weld torch with the utmost efficiency is equally important. Here are some tips to keep in mind for the business end of the robot.\n• Use a torch alignment tool. Most manufacturers sell them and most will work for multiple torch models. The reason is a 45-degree torch from a manufacturer is not always the same as a 45-degree torch in a robot workcell. Before doing any programming, place the torch in the tool and ensure the bend is correct. If it is not, use the tool to bring the bend in line, guaranteeing a correct angle on the torch. Moreover, if you should ever need to replace the torch, you can place the new torch in the alignment tool before you install it.\nCreate and maintain a good tool center point (TCP), as well as a check job, which confirms the TCP location and alignment before touching up points. Robot suppliers and integrators may have gauges or tools to help automate this process.\nIf you are searching for weld joints, go through your search routine and shift “on” before touching up points. If you don’t do this you will lose the relationship between your searches and your weld points.\nProgram all weld points with the same wire stick-out length (the distance between the contact tip and the weld joint). You can create a “teach tip” by drilling out a contact tip and inserting a sharpened tungsten or drill bit with the desired stick-out. The teach tip will be straight and can help negate the effects of wire cast on TCP location. If you are using the actual weld wire, be sure to clip the wire to the same length when programming with either welpers or a gauge.\nNever touch up a position for one defect on one part. Ensure there is no defect in the part or upstream process. You do not want to change a point to fit an out-of-spec part, as in-spec parts will not weld correctly after the change.\nDon’t select your robotic torch based on which consumables are in your tool crib. While it is convenient to have the same parts in a plant, many continue to use different torch neck angles or dated designs because maintenance keeps the same spare parts lists.\nDon’t use extended torch necks or narrow nozzles unless it’s absolutely necessary. Extended necks will result in less repeatability and are more prone to damage. Smaller nozzle diameters will clog with spatter more frequently and require more reaming.\nPower Source Considerations\nAdvances in inverter technology and faster processors have led to more precise weld process control, which has benefited robotic welding. Power source brands offer unique technologies with powerful yet easy-to-use interfaces that help achieve high-quality welds.\nMost manufacturers offer multiple process variations for a given wire type, size, and gas combination. These generally can be changed by the robot program to provide optimal welding characteristics for a variety of joint conditions, even if they exist on the same part. Additional considerations include:\nKeep track of the welding process selected from the power source in addition to the individual weld settings, such as wire feed speed and voltage. This may be a comment in the weld program if it is not associated with the instructions for weld settings.\nSet up or program the weld processes that apply to your operation into the power source programs or robot selection tables. Even if they are not used on a specific part today, they will be in a known program location for future use.\nDo not make changes locally from a power source panel if you are relying on the robot to control the sequence. A process or parameter may be changed on the power source for temporary or expediency reasons, but older programs may reference this changed setting and result in unexpected results.\nWhile you may be familiar with how important using proper torch angles are in welding, robot programming adds the variable of creating the motion most efficiently and quickly. A good robot program will prevent the robot from performing exaggerated positions/postures and balance the motion of the torch orientation with the robot arm position.\nAll nonprocess moves should be joint moves (noninterpolated motion). Moves where an axis is moving more than 180 degrees should be made in two moves to ensure smooth motion.\nKeep the robot posture as close as possible to the home position. Try to keep the default posture and don’t wind up the robot into an odd posture if it is not absolutely necessary.\nKeep the wrist—more specifically, axis 5—pointing downward so that the angle of the torch creates the work angle with the weld joint (if the joint is horizontal).\nDo not use major axes (such as axis 1, 2, and 3) movement to position the torch angle. The most efficient motion will use the wrist axis to orient the torch, while the motion of the base axis performs translational motion only.\nDo not use excessive torch motion creating a singularity of any axis (axis 4 and 5 mainly) during the weld process.\nImplementing robotic welding is not a task to take lightly. Any steps you take to make programming a smoother, more effective process can optimize production. This is particularly true when you have multiple personnel maintaining multiple robotic workcells.\nFrom better weld quality to improved consistency, you can experience many benefits when using robotic welding. Using these tips and tricks should help you reach your goals more efficiently.\nBy Chris Anderson","Benefits of Friction Stir Welding for Heatsink Production\nHeatsinks play an essential role in electronic devices by dissipating heat from high-power components, such as power convertors, batteries and processors. The thermal management of electronic devices is crucial for their reliability and longevity. Therefore, the manufacturing process of heatsinks requires a high degree of precision and consistency to produce high-quality products that meet the demands of the industry.\nFriction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding process that offers significant advantages over traditional welding techniques, such as TIG and MIG welding, in producing heatsinks. FSW has emerged as a popular choice for the manufacturing of heatsinks due to its unique properties and characteristics that result in high-quality joints. This article will explore the benefits of using FSW for manufacturing heatsinks.\n- Strong and Durable Joints\nOne of the most significant benefits of using FSW for manufacturing heatsinks is the ability to produce strong and durable joints. FSW involves a rotating tool that is plunged into the workpiece, generating heat that softens the material. The softened material is then mechanically stirred to create a joint. Unlike traditional welding techniques, FSW does not involve melting the workpieces, which eliminates defects like porosity or cracking that can weaken the joint. The resulting joint is highly robust, which is critical as heatsinks are exposed to constant thermal cycling that can cause stress and fatigue.\n- Minimal Distortion\nAnother significant advantage of FSW for manufacturing heatsinks is that it produces minimal distortion. The heat-affected zone (HAZ) in FSW is much smaller than in traditional welding techniques, resulting in a joint that is less likely to warp or bend during the welding process. The smaller HAZ also helps ensure that the heatsink maintains its shape and structural integrity, which is crucial for proper thermal management.\n- Excellent Material Properties\nFSW produces joints with excellent material properties, including good corrosion resistance, fatigue strength, and toughness. These characteristics are particularly important for heatsinks, which must withstand harsh environmental conditions and constant thermal cycling without degradation. FSW also produces a refined grain structure in the weld zone, which results in improved mechanical properties and a reduction in residual stresses.\n- Reduced Post-Welding Processing Requirements\nFSW reduces post-welding processing requirements, saving time and reducing costs. Since FSW does not produce fumes or spatter, there is no need for post-welding cleaning or surface treatment. This results in faster processing times and lower overall costs, making FSW an attractive option for heatsink manufacturing.\nFSW is a versatile welding technique that can join a wide range of materials, including aluminum, copper, and other non-ferrous alloys. This flexibility makes it an ideal choice for heatsink production, as different materials can be used depending on the application. FSW can also join dissimilar materials, which is important for heatsinks that require different materials for their base and fins.\nIn conclusion, FSW is a highly beneficial welding technique for the manufacturing of heatsinks. Its ability to produce strong and durable joints, minimal distortion, excellent material properties, reduced post-welding processing requirements, and versatility make it a cost-effective and efficient option for producing heatsinks that meet the high demands of the industry. FSW is a reliable and innovative solution for the thermal management of electronic devices, and its benefits make it an attractive option for manufacturers looking to optimize their heatsink production processes."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:54920608-fe5c-4918-b7c5-b193da6ee062>","<urn:uuid:e8620990-efc4-49cf-ae92-15cc02d9c243>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between passive solar heating and thermal mass techniques for maintaining temperature in greenhouses?","answer":"While both methods help maintain greenhouse temperature, passive solar heating primarily relies on capturing sunlight through south-facing glazing materials to heat the space, while thermal mass involves storing heat energy in specific materials. Passive solar heating focuses on maximizing sun exposure through proper greenhouse orientation and glazing material selection, requiring 2-4 gallons of water per square foot of south-facing glazing. Thermal mass, on the other hand, uses materials like water, stone, concrete, and cob to store heat, with water-filled drums being a common and simple implementation. Both techniques work together, as thermal mass helps store the heat captured through passive solar design for temperature regulation, especially at night.","context":["There are a few key fundamentals when it comes to maintaining an effective year-round greenhouse in a northern climate: a deep structural foundation, an ideal location with maximum sun visibility and orientation, and a glazing material with strong insulating and light transmitting qualities. Beyond these considerations though, there are a few simple yet comprehensive methods for fostering an acceptable climate for your plants when the outside temperatures are very low. This month we’ll look at some easy ways to get the most out your greenhouse this winter.\nIf you want to keep your greenhouse both self-sufficient and uncomplicated, you probably don’t want to deal with an elaborate heating system. Passive solar heating is the ideal solution, with little upfront cost, no monthly costs, and virtually no maintenance, a high thermal mass material is the perfect way to get some extra heat from sunlight. If you are planning to use solar energy, you may want to visit sites like https://www.nexamp.com/power-purchase-agreements/ to learn more how solar energy can help reduce your costs. 100% renewable energy is by far the cleanest form of energy, so I suggest you try it now, we all just need to learn how to start a movement. What’s more, the best material for heat retention is also super cheap: water. Many winter growers use filled 55-gallon plastic drums to line or stack directly against the north-facing walls of their greenhouses– this provides a solid thermal wall that insulates from the cold and radiates trapped heat back into the greenhouse.\nDepending on how cold the climate is where you live, you’ll want to use at least 2 – 4 gallons of water per square foot of south facing glazing material. So, if your greenhouse is 14′ x 16′ with 6′ high walls and 10′ roof sections, you’d roughly need 550 to 1100 gallons of water for the proper thermal retention. Also, regardless of your heating source, be sure to use low horsepower circulating fans, which are an energy efficient way to keep the warm air moving to avoid cold spots from forming.\nThe right soil will keep the ground temperatures up, and even generate heat to get trapped in your thermal wall. Soils high in nitrogen, or compost-rich mixes are great candidates. Using mulch, straw or other crop coverings can also help keep the heat in the soil to prevent freezing.\nSuper hardy plants:\nEven if your greenhouse is under 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime, there’s a number of veggies that can thrive. Many root vegetables, such as carrots, beets, radishes, leeks and turnips can grow in temps as low as 0 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s well known that kale and chard are very cold tolerant, but other types of leafy greens have cold-hardy varieties too: spinach, cabbage, arugula, lettuce, collard greens, and Asian greens such as bok choy can thrive in temps anywhere from 40 to 0 degrees Fahrenheit depending on type / variety. Other veggies that can take cooler temps include cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, parsley and celery. Just note that the seed germination will require warmer temps, but you always can start your seeds in your house, then move them to the greenhouse once the seedlings begin to grow.\nWe hope this helps spark some ideas about how to get the greenhouse ready for winter– with just a little extra work you can enjoy fresh vegetables all year round!\n[bn_product title=”Snow Minded Models” subtitle=”Here are some staff picked models that were designed to keep snow from piling on top of the greenhouse and/or to withstand snow loads of up to 35 lbs.” ids=’11440,23079,21462,20991,22561′]","Thermal Mass In Greenhouses\nThermal mass is a technique of storing heat energy in certain materials within the greenhouse. Most commonly used are water, stone, concrete, and cob. Installing thermal mass can be as simple as placing drums of water in your greenhouse. Its an essential practice for all greenhouses, but especially important in solar-electricity greenhouses.\nOrient The Greenhouse Toward The Sun\nThis is where solar greenhouse design begins: the sun. The sun is not only your source of light for growth in the greenhouse, but your source of heat. Thus, if growing year-round in cold climates, you need to capture enough solar energy through your glazing to heat the greenhouse. Glazing is just a word for transparent materials, such as glass or clear rigid plastics. All these light-capturing materials should face where light is coming in: the South if you are in the Northern hemisphere . The sun moves higher and lower throughout the year, but it is always South. A very small percentage of light comes directly from the North, and thus these sides are better off insulated.\nMaximize Light And Heat In The Winter\nSolar greenhouse design and passive solar design in general relies on the premise of strategically controlling light and heat gain. Namely, you want to maximize light when it is absolutely needed and reduce light when it is abundant and creates too much heat .\nIts important to keep in mind the angle of the sun during different seasons, as shown in the graphic above. In the winter, light comes in at a low angle and in the summer it is much higher in the sky . Thus, on vertical South surfaces, you want to use a high light-transmittance material, such as glass, to absorb as much of this light and heat as possible. You do sacrifice insulation at night, but at this time of year light and heat gain are the top priority. Thermal mass should be used to store some of this heat for temperature regulation. You can also angle the South face of your greenhouse so that it absorbs more light as shown in the commercial solar greenhouse below. More on choosing the best angle for your greenhouse glazing in this blog.\nYou May Like: How To Make Solid Background On Instagram Story\nAmenities For The Greenhouse: Water Power And An Internet\nWe ran one-inch flexible PVC water pipe from a tee in a pipe that supplies a nearby pole barn. Water lines here have to buried below the frost line, which involved trenching deep enough to get us under the greenhouses foundation. We terminated the water line in a frost-free hydrant, even though the temperature in the greenhouse should never get below freezing.\nWe happen to like the height of these hydrants. We think a lot about aging in place, and any opportunity to avoid crouching or stooping is welcome.\nWhile the whole point of the greenhouse was to avoid the use of fossil fuels, we decided to run two 20 amp circuits from the pole barn, mainly for lighting, but also to give us options if we ever needed to plug something in.\nAll of the wiring we used in the greenhouse is the direct burial variety, meaning that its sheathing is thick and waterproof. This made running the wiring somewhat more difficult Im speaking here as the chief electrician but I liked the idea of extra protection from the extreme humidity inside the structure. We chose heavy-duty exterior grade ceiling fixtures for the same reason.\nWe were keenly interested in remotely monitoring the temperature and humidity levels in the greenhouse. The SensorPush wireless thermometer has proven to be rock solid.\nSolar Panels Provide An Efficient Heating Source\nWhen the greenhouse is in use, the solar panel will heat up and release infrared radiation. This radiation will warm up the objects inside of the greenhouse. The solar panel should be placed on the roof of the greenhouse so that it can receive direct sunlight. The angle of the panel should also be adjusted throughout the day so that it can absorb as much sunlight as possible.\nRecommended Reading: How Much Is The Sunflower Solar System\nHow Do You Power A Greenhouse With Solar Panels\nSolar panels can be used to power a greenhouse by providing energy to run the lights, fans, and other equipment necessary to keep the plants growing. The amount of power required will vary depending on the size and type of greenhouse, but solar panels can be a great way to reduce or eliminate the cost of powering a greenhouse.\nPV panels, or solar panels, have become a popular way to generate renewable energy. A lot of people think that you can use these panels to heat a greenhouse and you can. However, its not as simple as just slapping some PV panels on the roof of your greenhouse!\nIn order to produce enough power to heat a greenhouse with solar panels, you would need a lot of them and even then, it would be difficult to achieve. PV panels are designed for the production of renewable electricity, not for the generation of heat. The conversion of sunlight into electricity, then electricity into heat produces an enormous loss in energy during the process!\nBatteries are great for supplementing solar panel energy at night. If you want to try and heat your greenhouse with solar power, make sure you have a large battery capacity!\nThe size, rating of the panels, battery capacity, and cost all depend on what youre trying to achieve in your greenhouse. Do your research before investing in any equipment its important to know what will work best for your needs.\nSolar Greenhouse Ideas That Work\nWant to make use of solar energy to create a warm environment for plants or your pleasure? Here are the ideas for the ultimate solar greenhouse. Read on!\nYou might now it as simply a greenhouse, but its referred to as solar greenhouse because it traps solar energy. Anyone can build it too. Your success will depend on how much sunlight you get in your location. If the answer is not much, dont let that discourage you there are solutions for every climate zone. Well go over that in a bit.\nWhy would you want a solar greenhouse anyway?\n- Growing plants is an obvious one\n- But you can also create a warm environment to spend time in during the cold season.\n- Hang a hammock!\n- Create a place for a hot tub all year round.\nHow To Build A Solar Greenhouse\nIf youre ready to get your hands dirty, heres what you need to know to build your own little piece of gardening heaven.\n1. Pick the perfect spot\nBefore strapping on your tool belt, make sure the patch you pick receives optimal sun exposure. Situate your greenhouse so that it faces south, with a slight orientation to the east. This helps maximize early morning sunlight and offers some protection from overheating in the late afternoon. It also ensures full sun exposure during the winter when the sun rises in the southeast.\n2. Create a workable footprint\nDetermine the square footage you need and plot out the layout of your garden. Consider things like the room you will need to comfortably move between planting beds and rows. The overall size of your greenhouse should be based on how much planting area you need to produce the amount of food you want to grow.\n3. Select the right materials\nBecause solar power runs the whole show, you need to use a material that will let at least 70 percent of the light through while minimizing energy loss . You will maximize your gardens production when you have a balance between those two variables. Polycarbonate is a sustainable material that can provide the appropriate amount of transmissivity and R-value.\n4. Insulate your space\n5. Let some air in\n6. Use thermal mass\n7. Get soil and irrigation right\nNow that you know the basics of building a solar greenhouse, look for plans that meet your needs and get started. Happy planting!\nHow And Why To Build A Passive Solar Greenhouse\nThe decision to build an eco-friendly greenhouse on our little farm in Pennsylvania was really an afterthought.\nMy wife Shana and I had just bought our first piece of heavy equipment, a used Caterpillar skid steer, and I was looking for a big project to teach myself how to use it.\nMaybe we should build a greenhouse, she said.\nSounds good, I said. But greenhouses need to be heated. Propane is pretty expensive. Not to mention the pollution.\nTake a look at this. She tilted her iPad to show me a building that looked like a cross between a glass barn and a Superfund site.\nWhats inside those steel drums? I asked. Chemicals?\nNope. Fresh water. Thousands of gallons of it. The water heats the greenhouse in winter and cools it in summer.\nTheres no heater? Or fans?\nNo fossil fuels required. Sounds good, no?\nIt did sound good. A little too good.\nI dont know I said.\nWell, I think we should build one, she said. Youll be an expert with that loader by the time its done.\nAnd just like that, I was persuaded.\nAlso Check: How Long Before Solar Panels Pay Off\nHow The Climate Affects Your Greenhouse\nGreenhouse gardening can be affected heavily by climate change. It will be easier to maintain the house in hotter climates as you only have to be alert about letting the excess heat out. In colder temperatures, it takes extra effort to maintain the heat and the plant. It might need more time in colder climates than usual to grow a plant as the weather is cold. Ensure the structure hotter in the colder climates, or tropical plants may suffer in growth. Be sensitive to the weather and climate changes.\nHow Do You Go About Building One Of Cords Greenhouses\nFor this kind of greenhouse to stay warm through the winter, it must maximize passive solar gain and minimize heat loss.\nThose two simple principles drive all of the material choices and construction techniques. The water barrels are capable of acting as giant thermal batteries, but only if the greenhouse is properly sited, thoughtfully built, and extremely well insulated.\nA tight building will protect your trees and plants in the winter, but in summer, the greenhouse needs to be vented like any other. In keeping with the theme of sustainability, Cord has developed a way for the greenhouses vents to open and close as the temperature rises and falls without having to rely on electric motors.\nThe more we learned about this crazy greenhouse that heated and cooled itself without burning a drop of fuel or using a watt of electricity, the more intrigued we were.\nWhat Is A Solar Greenhouse\nAll greenhouses use the sun, but solar greenhouses harness that solar power for more than just growing tasty veggies. Traditional greenhouses made of glass or plastic usually rely on fossil fuels to provide additional heating needs during colder months. A solar greenhouse, on the other hand, creates a warm, nurturing environment all year long using nothing more than natural materials, energy-efficient design and the power of the sun.\nDriftless Farm Pit Greenhouse Wisconsin Usa\nThe Driftless Farm greenhouse in winter\nAlso known as a Solar Cold Climate Greenhouse , this greenhouse is made from site-harvested black locust trees, which is fast growing, strong and rot-resistant.\nThe 2800 square feet greenhouse, owned by Roald Gundersen, is insulated with straw-bales and lowered into the ground for efficiency.\nInside the Driftless Farm Greenhouse\nRecommended Reading: Is My Business A Sole Proprietorship Or Llc\nSolar Panel Batteries For Greenhouses\nYour panels are collecting the suns energy, your greenhouse is heating up from the suns raysgreat! But where is all that energy going? You need a battery!\nThere are an array of electricity-storing batteries on the market. Your particular choice will be determined both by what kind of solar panels you choose and how much energy youre harvest and storing.\nBut consider using a thermal battery for your solar greenhouse. Just as a regular battery stores and distributes electrical energy, a thermal battery stores heat. This is a little bit of a trick because thermal batteries are technically just thermal mass but with the optional addition of an extra heating device, powered by your solar power harvesting.\nFor example, the drums of water sitting in a passively powered greenhouse serving as thermal mass heat storage might be lined with copper coils. Another option is a cute powered heat-wrap jacket like this one.\nA top-notch greenhouse design incorporation subterranean insulation with a below-ground thermal battery, whether thats made of soil, water, concrete, or even wax.\nWhat Is The Cheapest Way To Heat A Greenhouse\nA solar greenhouse is a passive form of heating that can provide enough heat to keep plants alive during winter months with little or no other energy input. A solar greenhouse is an unheated building constructed to collect, store and distribute solar energy. These greenhouses are generally made of glass or clear plastic and allow the suns light to pass through to heat the interior. The solar energy is trapped by a dark material, such as soil or water and then radiated back into the greenhouse to keep temperatures warm enough for plants to grow.\nRead Also: How Much Solar Power Per Square Foot\nThe Sun Country Greenhouse Is Solar Ready\nFor those of you who have some building experience and are looking for a great woodworking project check out our detailed DIY greenhouse plans.

All greenhouses are solar heated to some extent, anyone who has been inside for a few minutes on a summer day knows how warm the sun can be. A greenhouse acts as a natural solar collector but it can’t retain the sun’s heat at night. Consequently 75% to 80% of the cost of heating a greenhouse by conventional energy sources is expended at night. To retain the sun’s heat you need something the heat can be stored in a heat sink. Heat sinks can consist of barrels of water, rocks, concrete walls or some other thermal mass. At night stored heat radiates throughout the greenhouse.\nFoundations Kneewall Ventilation & Glazing Part 2 Of 4\nHere we are going to talk about foundations, knee-walls, ventilation and glazing in the greenhouse.\nThe author in front of his passive solar greenhouse\nStep 5 Foundations\nFoundations are a crucial component that dictates the success of any building. It is a component and we often dont think about, yet a ton of energy goes into the design and construction of a foundation. There are literally enough foundation options out there to write about them for years so I am going to stick to my top 3 options, but first lest start with a few principles specific to greenhouses.\nPrinciple 1) The foundation of a greenhouse should connect the greenhouse to the soil. Plants love getting into the actual earth, not growing above it. A good foundation should allow the plants to dip their roots into subsoil.\nPrinciple 2) The greenhouse foundation should start below the frost line to prevent heaving or, should prevent the frost from entering the greenhouse.\nPrinciple 3) The foundation option you choose should align with your goals.\nPrinciple 4) The foundation should not be toxic to the soil.\nMy greenhouse ignores the first three of these three principleshere is why. I built a greenhouse on top of a car parking stall and I did not have the heart to rip up the concrete. I was also not has far along in my permaculture career and did not realize the effects of ignoring all these principles.\nStep 6 The Kneewall\nStep 7 Ventilation and Air Movement\nStep 8 Glazing\nAlso Check: Are Solar Panels Worth It In Oregon\nCan They Be Used In Greenhouses\nWell, that all sounds pretty interesting, but what does it have to do with greenhouses and crops? Very much, actually. Greenhouses are great for conserving the heat and warming the environment, but if you want to keep your production of, for example, tomatoes all year round a simple greenhouse is not going to be enough.\nUntil a few years ago, agricultural companies used to use oil-fired boilers to produce energy. However, todays high oil costs and their effects on the environment have forced these companies to use other alternatives. Currently, many universities and agricultural companies are beginning to change the type of electricity they use to cause less environmental impact and conserve the beautiful blue planet we live on. An incredible example is NEIKER-Tecnalia.\nNEIKER is a public institution of the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. It focuses on research and innovation projects that seek to incorporate technology into agriculture to make it more efficient, clean, and environmentally friendly. Since 2009, they have been working on a system that incorporates solar energy to power their greenhouses.\nTo heat a greenhouse, they use energy from solar panels. In this experimental greenhouse, worthy of any mad scientist, researchers are constantly testing to find the best way to keep plants warmed up.\nSubscribing our Newsletter"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f4d2e30e-ef2f-41fe-b77e-f825ba3f9fef>","<urn:uuid:79eb893c-dab8-45f6-bd22-7a7ede4eb0e2>"],"error":null}

Taoism became well-known in the eighth century C.E. as the religion of the Tang dynasty. In the following centuries, it existed alongside Buddhism and Confucianism (another philosophical religion ).\nWhich religion is followed most in China?\nNational surveys conducted in the early 21st century estimated that some 80% of the population of China, which is more than a billion people, practice some kind of Chinese folk religion; 41.58 are Buddhists; 10% are Taoist; 2.53% are Christians; and 3.83% are Muslims.\nIs Taoism the oldest religion in China?\nTaoism has no founder and no founding date. It grew out of various religious and philosophical traditions in ancient China, including shamanism and nature religion. Taoism was first recognised as a religious system during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE.\nWhat was the first religion in China?\nTaoism (“Tao Jiao,” Religious Taoism) is an indigenous religion of China and is traditionally traced to the composition of the Tao Te Ching or to the founding of the Way of the Celestial Masters by Zhang Daoling, although some Taoist schools trace their origin much earlier.\nDoes Taoism have a God?\nTaoist pantheon Taoism does not have a God in the way that the Abrahamic religions do. There is no omnipotent being beyond the cosmos, who created and controls the universe. In Taoism the universe springs from the Tao, and the Tao impersonally guides things on their way.\nWhat religions are banned in China?\nMost ethnic Tibetans practice a distinct form of Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism. The Uighurs, who primarily live in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, are predominantly Muslim. Over a dozen religious or spiritual groups are banned in China as “evil cults,” including Falun Gong and the Church of Almighty God.\nDoes China allow religion?\nCitizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.\nIs Christianity legal in China?\nChinese who are over the age of 18 are only permitted to join officially sanctioned Christian groups which are registered with the government-approved Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church, the China Christian Council and the Protestant Three-Self Church.\nWhich God does China worship?\nThere are three main systems of belief in China: Daoism (sometimes written Taoism), Buddhism and Confucianism.

Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion, its practitioners often regard it as Japan’s indigenous religion and as a nature religion.","For many outsiders, looking at China’s religion would reveal a rather sterile landscape when compared to other cultures’ spiritual practices. Ancestor worship and other folk practices at family shrines pale when compared with the lavish churches, cathedrals, and temples used by the world’s major religions. Some may even feel that China is actually lacking in native spiritual beliefs altogether. But nothing could be further than the truth. Religion in the People’s Republic of China is diverse and quite interesting.\nIn ancient China, religion may have begun thousands of years ago with shamanistic practices that honored the spirits of nature. Fortune was believed to be a result of living in harmony with these spirits, so it was in a person’s best interest to forge a good relationship with then. Otherwise, misfortune could follow a person, his or her family, and spoil all of their endeavors.\nFrom these beliefs eventually Taoism emerged. Although it was China’s religion centuries ago, Taoism (pronounced Daoism) was originally more of a philosophy. It proposed following the flow of nature, moving with its flow and cycles, as the path to being in harmony both with oneself and the world. This philosophy spread throughout China, forming the basis of such arts as Feng Shui, the use of the I Ching, or Book of Changes, as a source of divination, Tai Chi, and the healing arts.\nAlong with Taoism, Confucianism emerged as another one of the famous beliefs systems practiced in China. It was not a religion originally but it opposed Daoism. While it proposed that following laws, strict moral codes, and obeying authority were the path to a harmonious society, Taoism supported individual responsibility and morality. Both of these philosophies enjoyed periods of popularity, and in some ways even blended over time.\nThe arrival of Buddhism also showed the way China’s religion and spiritual practice adapts to new concepts. The only foreign religion to become a widespread practice in China, Buddhism became so popular that at one time it was considered a threat to those in power. Buddhism spawned two schools that even now are the most popular sects in China, Ch’an or Zen Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism. In China the main religion may well be Buddhism.\nTogether, these three philosophies formed the main branches of China’s religion with Taoism and Buddhism continuing strong to this day. Even Confucian ethics are still an important part of the lives of many people.\nOther Outside Influences on China’s Religion\nBuddhism is not the only religion to arrive in China and make an impression. With trade and exposure to the outside world came both Islam and Christianity. While the indigenous religions and philosophies are a part of daily life for many people, Christian and Muslim Chinese are a minor but influential part of China’s religion.\n- Taoism (Daoism)\nArab traders brought Islam with them in the seventh century AD. As time went on, people converted to Islam from Buddhism and the Nestorian Church, and increased the influence of the religion in the northern regions. A community, called the Hui, grew as male settler arrived and married Chinese women, while maintaining their beliefs and practices. Today nearly half of the Muslims in China are Hui. As China seeks to maintain relations with the Middle East, Islam is tolerated although there have been disputes. These have been based more on the need for autonomy, however, than actual persecution.\nAlso arriving in the seventh century, the Nestorian Church was established in the foreign quarters of large cities. These did not survive the end of the Tang dynasty. In fact, even during the Mongol dynasties, the Church served the Mongols more than the native Chinese. This changed in the late 1500s, when churches began to establish themselves as a growing part of China’s religion and actually gained a sizable number of Chinese converts.\nEven an edict in 1721 by Qing Emperor Kang XI failed to eliminate Christianity, so when missionaries returned in the mid nineteenth century they found Christian communities that were still thriving well. At this time, however, due to the forced opening of China’s borders, many rejected this ‘invading’ religion at first. Christianity continued to grow, however, and despite a crisis during the Liberation of 1949, a resurgence of growth on the 1970s to 80s, greatly expanded its influence, making it a powerful part of China’s religion.\nThe following article, The Growth of Buddhism in China, explores the philosophies arrival and how the Chinese mindset altered its practices. It will also explore its core beliefs and the most popular sects in China today.\nThe Growth of Buddhism in China:\nFinally, The Core Beliefs of Taoism will discuss how that way of life evolved, its practices and its relevance today in Chinese culture.\nThe Core Beliefs of Taoism:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b48e6c8f-6d47-4e29-af80-a60881099423>","<urn:uuid:fc82cd3c-4c32-47b7-9d6b-8bbcdeafd75b>"],"error":null}

Children with special needs may need special scissors that can help them to cut in spite of deficits in strength or coordination.\nFiskar Scissors: These scissors have one hole for thumb and a larger hole for a few fingers. They are good for children to start learning.\nSpring Scissors: These scissors open on their own after every snip. It is ideal for children who are learning to cut or children with special needs with hand function deficits.\nTable Scissors: These scissors require the adult to guide the paper while your child presses down on the top of the scissors. The bottom of the scissor rests on the table. This scissor too, is very useful for special needs children with hand function difficulties.\nLeft Handed Scissors: These scissors are designed for left- handed students. The blade is positioned differently so that the student can see the line which they are cutting.\nTraining Scissors: This type of scissors has an additional pair of holes that a teacher can use to guide the child. They too are ideal for beginners and special needs children.\nIn addition, preschool scissors should be light, and must fit the hands of the child well. The blades should not be too tight or too loose. Scissors that allow more than one finger in one of the loops are more comfortable to use.\nTeaching Scissor Use Step- by Step\nScissor use develops in stages, and understanding these stages can help us to teach children. Here are the various stages, and the age at which they occur. Not all children in preschool learn to use scissors at the exact some time. Some children may develop them a little early, and some a little late. However, they all go through these stages. Providing activities that help them practice skills of the stage they are in, and introducing them to skills of the next stage, can help them learn scissor use without feeling overwhelmed.\nStage 1: Child learns to hold the scissors. (18- 19 Months)\nStage 2: The child learns to open and shut the scissors. (20- 23 Months)\nStage 3: The child learns to make random snips on paper (23-29 months)\nStage 4: The child learns to push the scissors forward to cut across a piece of paper (30-35 months)\nStage 5: The child cuts on a straight line (36-41 months)\nStage 6: The child learns to cut on a curved line (42-47 months)\nStage 7: The child cuts out simple shapes like circles and squares (42- 47 months)\nStage 8: The child cuts complex shapes and figures (48- 57 months)\nGeneral teaching Strategies for Scissor Use\n- Adapt paper thickness. Thick paper is easier to hold and cut. These work best for beginners learning to snip. Construction paper is good for practicing cutting on lines.\n- Grade paper width. When a child is starting to learn, use narrow strips of paper and have them cut on short lines across the width of the paper. Slowly increase the width, as they learn.\n- Start teaching children by asking them to cut on thick, bold lines. As they master this skill, you can make the lines thinner.\n- Help children to practice wavy and curved lines before they learn to cut shapes.\n- Make it easier for children to handle paper by cutting off the excess paper on the sheet.\n- When children in preschool learn to use scissors, don’t worry if they are messy and can’t cut neatly. Cutting is a skill that comes with a lot of practice, and will develop over time.\nPreschool Scissors Activities\nThe best way to motivate children to learn and develop their scissor skills is to provide lots of fun and interesting preschool scissors activities. Help them cut out strips of paper, or shapes on colored construction paper, and help them stick pierces together to make interesting art. You can add glitter glue, stickers, yarn or other materials to be creative. For children just learning to cut, glue the pieces of paper they have snipped and make designs. You can also glue together large strips of colored paper that have been snipped and hang them for decorations. A final activity that you can do is to give children colorful magazines and ask them to cut out pictures around a theme and glue them.\nTeaching Scissor Safety\nTeaching scissor safety is a important part of teaching scissor use. When you first introduce scissors to the children discuss these rules, and make sure children follow them at all times.\n- Teach children to wrap their fingers around closed blades with the blades pointing down.\n- Make sure the children walk slowly while carrying scissors.\n- Teach children to pass scissors by wrapping fingers loosely around the blades.\n- Store scissors in a safe place and teach children to return scissors to a specific place after their work is done.\nHope these ideas help you to introduce scissors in a fun and safe way to preschool children.\nCalder, T.

New mothers realize their babies may begin to walk at 10 months of age or not until they are 15 months old; they may begin to talk at 12 months of age or not until they are 18 months old. Young children reach the milestones of walking and talking at different ages. Before children begin to walk, they crawl and sit up; before they talk, babies babble and coo.\nLearning to read is also a developmental process; all children do not begin to read at the same age. Children reach literacy milestones along the way. For example, children develop a basic oral vocabulary and understand the alphabetic principle before they begin to read. Although children may enter school at about the same chronological age, they are at various stages of reading development. A child's conceptual understanding of spoken words and his or her knowledge of print have an impact on his or her beginning literacy instruction. As a result, teachers need to be cognizant of the Developmental Stages of Learning to Read so all of their young students are successful learners.\nWhat Are the Developmental Stages of Learning to Read?\nMost children follow a similar pattern and sequence of reading behaviors as they learn how to read-from print awareness to pretend reading, to identifying alphabet letters, and to beginning reading. There are distinct stages of development across this continuum of learning to read, and there are specific reading behaviors that can be identified at each of these stages. Researchers have used various labels and terms to identify the stages of reading development, but the literature indicates there are five stages of learning to read (Chall, 1983; Dorn & Soffos, 2001; Fountas & Pinnell, 1996; Snow, Burns & Griffin, 1998). These Developmental Stages of Learning to Read give teachers an estimate, based on observations of reading behaviors, of each student's beginning instructional level:\n- Awareness and Exploration of Reading Stage (typically pre-K)\n- Emergent Reading Stage (typically pre-K to early Kindergarten)\n- Early Reading Stage (typically Kindergarten to early Grade 1)\n- Transitional Reading Stage (typically late Grade 1 to Grade 2)\n- Fluent Reading Stage (typically Grade 3 and higher)\nWhy Should K-3 Teachers be Aware of the Developmental Stages of Learning to Read?\nAn understanding of the Developmental Stages of Learning to Read and how these stages fall along a continuum of learning is helpful, especially at the beginning of the school year. It is well known; however, that developmental growth, whether physical, emotional, or cognitive, is uneven and is greatly influenced by a child's environment and experiences (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000). Teachers of K-3 students need to be careful not to associate a child's intellectual ability with his or her developmental stage.\nChildren who come from literature-rich home environments where parents read and play word games with them on a daily basis will most likely be at a higher developmental stage of reading than a child who lives in a home environment that lacks books and reading experiences. Additionally, cognitive development is uneven, marked by alternating spurts of growth and regression. A child may appear to know something one day but the next day will be unable to answer the same question or demonstrate the same skill. The Developmental Stages of Learning to Read give the teacher a starting point, an idea of where to begin instruction. Using the analogy of painting a picture, the Developmental Stages are the broad strokes of the brush as the artist begins to paint the background. Later, the artist will use a fine brush to paint the details, just as a teacher will use ongoing assessment to target specific learning needs for each student.\nHow Do the Developmental Stages of Learning to Read Assist Teachers as They Plan Reading Instruction?\nThe Developmental Stages of Learning to Read enable teachers to estimate each child's instructional needs. Remember that this is a first look. Screening, diagnostic, and ongoing progress monitoring assessment will provide a more in-depth understanding of the student's learning needs. Once the assessment data has been gathered, instruction can be designed according to the child's zone of proximal development in the literacy strands (Vygotsky, 1978). The Gradual Release of Responsibility Model (Pearson & Gallagher, 1983) will then be used for the delivery of instruction, moving from high teacher support to low teacher support as the child develops mastery in the multiple areas of literacy.\n- Chall, J.

{"question":"What are the key differences between GEV Wind Power's Ventura Blade Habitat and FORCE Technology's AMS-64 scanner for on-site blade maintenance?","answer":"GEV Wind Power's Ventura Blade Habitat creates a controlled environment around the blade that eliminates weather-related limitations by controlling temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions, enabling extended working hours and reducing maintenance downtime. FORCE Technology's AMS-64 is a fully integrated portable scanner solution that focuses on inspection rather than environmental control, offering comprehensive ultrasonic scanning capabilities that can be used with various blade access technologies like mobile cranes, sky-lifts, and suspended platforms.","context":["When a job requires a worker to dangle from a rope hundreds of meters above the ground, it’s a sure bet that worker wants his company to have the best safety protocols in place in order to make it back to Earth in one piece.\nThat’s an important philosophy for GEV Wind Power, where strict and comprehensive safety measures are tightly woven into the fabric of its daily operations.\nGEV Wind Power is one of Europe’s leading wind-turbine maintenance companies with teams working on more than 40 wind farms both on and offshore every year. To meet those demands, GEV’s workforce must react quickly and efficiently in order to reduce the cost of lost production.\n“The whole industry has been terribly slow to recognize the criticality of wind-turbine blades,” said Alastair Gadney, managing director of Specialist Divisions at GEV Group. “These blades take more of a hammering than anyone anticipated.”\nThe experts and expert positions at GEV Wind Power who deal with blade maintenance help drive down that O&M cost.\n“For the moment, it’s all an increase,” Gadney said. “There’s no doubt about it. Overall, O&M is on an increase, and certainly the blades are turning out to be a much, much bigger and faster growing area.”\nMaking it Safe, Keeping it Safe\nAn integral part of how GEV Wind Power stays competitive in its field is through its safety program, 1st4Safety, which stems from its desire to empower its workforce, Gadney said.\n“Workers are encouraged to report anything they feel is unsafe by literally waving a red ‘stop card’ to their supervisor,” he said.\nBut it doesn’t end there.\n“The guys can actually say, ‘no,’” Gadney said. “Below that, you’ve got to have a culture in your company that is open to reporting and encourages feedback that supports our technicians when they say that they have issues and when they come back and say they’re not content. And in order to do that, you have got to have a really robust and professional set of protocols in place.”\nMany of those safety protocols find their origins in the oil and gas industry. Umbrella company GEV Group started in oil and gas when the company was founded in 2008.\n“It was the core business,” Gadney said. “It started in 2008 supplying services and personnel to oil-and-gas assets.”\nAbout two or three years later, the company realized the access skills used in oil and gas were transferable to wind farms and wind turbines, he said.\n“The oil industry, I guess, if we’re being honest, learned from its mistakes,” Gadney said. “It’s endeavored to enforce a really rigid and appropriate safe working environment. And we’ve adopted that. We already have that knowledge from oil and gas, and we’ve pushed that into wind.”\nAdding to that safety environment is the experience to keep it current.\n“We also bring in the fact that we’ve got extremely qualified technicians,” Gadney said. “All our guys are trained in the highest OEM standards.”\nA surprising takeaway from a business that repairs and maintains turbine blades is that, although the industry recognizes qualifications from different OEMs, there is no set standard of blade-repair protocol, according to Gadney.\nA growing base for GEV Wind Power is utility-scale owners. GEV is offering its predictive maintenance planning, Blade247, to these clients across the U.S. Blade247 takes the worry of blade maintenance away from clients and allows them to predict their cash flow with the knowledge that GEV is maintaining their blade fleet.\nIn order to land those big contracts, GEV backs up its reputation with the scale of workers it’s developed.\n“We probably have the largest number of workers in Europe,” Gadney said. “We can call on about 120 technicians and currently have about 85 of these deployed. And for an independent service provider, that’s pretty impressive.”\nThe safety protocols at GEV Wind Power also enable its workers to grow and advance.\n“Within our 1st4Safety program, we’re creating a bronze, silver, gold, platinum standard,” Gadney said.\nAccording to Gadney, all GEV Wind Power workers come in with a basic safety understanding. The first level of that includes its rope-access workers, who already are focused on safety by the nature of their daily routine.\nBut if some workers want to take on more — becoming adept at first aid, for example — they advance to the next level. More experience on top of that would advance a worker to an even higher standard.\n“We would only expect to have one or two of these in the company, and they would be our platinum go-to person,” Gadney said.\nThose standards are important to GEV Wind Power workers, and those workers proudly display badges that let others know what they’re capable of.\n“What it’s saying to people externally is ‘I’m part of GEV Wind Power, and I’m part of this fantastic safety culture.’” Gadney said.\nInnovation is Key\nIf a robust safety culture is the crux of GEV Wind Power’s success, it is its innovation that drives it.\nFor years, technicians accessed turbines using ropes, but the industry is moving toward platforms. In the U.S., platforms have been the norm, but in Europe, it’s been more rope access, according to Gadney.\nPlatforms give a technician much more flexibility where larger repairs can take place.\n“But you are still limited by the weather — the humidity, the temperature, and of course, the daylight hours,” Gadney said.\nThis is where the patented GEV Wind Power Ventura Blade Habitat comes in. It creates an artificial environment around the blade area where outside conditions are no longer a random factor that can adversely affect repair schedules, he said.\n“I can control temperature; I can control humidity,” Gadney said. “Then I can introduce artificial lighting, and I can extend my working day. Then, I’m suddenly offering massive benefits to clients.”\nKeeping a Repair Schedule\nIn a blade-repair environment, a customer will allocate a number of days required for repair, according to Gadney. Of those days, about half of those could be lost to wind conditions, and the other half might succumb to poor weather conditions.\n“If I can extend my working day or my repair season because I can undertake repairs in otherwise prohibitive conditions, then I’m allowing the owner-operator to maximize productivity during the downtime he allocates to blade repair,” Gadney said.\nAdverse wind conditions are a factor beyond a technician’s control, but now, with the Ventura Blade Habitat, potential repair times that might be lost to temperature, humidity, or even shorter daylight hours are no longer a problem, which, in turn, makes a massive difference to the wind farm’s owner-operator, according to Gadney.\n“His turbine is productive for longer, so therefore AEP goes up, and he reduces the maintenance costs because we’re undertaking the repair with the days he’s already allocated and not having to reschedule a maintenance,” Gadney said. “So, not only are we improving the AEP, but we’re also decreasing the O&M costs, so we’re making a bigger contribution to improving the levelized cost of energy (LCOE).”\nMaking Inspection More Efficient\nAnother critical area born from GEV Wind Power’s innovation is the general reporting of blade inspection, blade-repair work, lightning-protection system maintenance, and power-curve upgrade programs, according to Gadney.\nThe standard protocol for inspection has been to take a photograph of a problem area, download that into a paper report, and send the report off to be reviewed. If it’s under warranty, then it goes back to the OEM, where it could be weeks or sometimes months before a repair campaign is finalized.\nGEV Wind Power has developed the Intuitive Repair and Inspection System (IRIS) to help cut those inspection-to-repair times to a fraction of what they used to be.\nIRIS allows the technician to completely digitize the inspection report using a tablet such as an iPad.\n“We are giving the technician the ability to take photographs and report in a consistent manner,” Gadney said. “You don’t have to worry about legibility, because all information is entered on a keypad. The technician has a connectivity that is almost global; he can send that information straight back to the expert who nominally, could look at that report in the next 24 hours and could have repair advice back to the technician within 48 hours. That’s a massive difference.”\nIn addition, the technician also has a history of the repairs and inspections for an individual turbine at his fingertips in the field, he said.\n“The repair report you’ll get out will be consistent; it will be very timely, enabling us all to invoice quickly, turn the job around much faster than ever before,” Gadney said. “And with greater accuracy of data as well. We’ve introduced IRIS this year, and we’re finding it to be a huge benefit to us.”\nGEV Wind Power also has made advances with blade inspection using remote cameras.\nBy combining a camera with a telephoto lens and innovative computer software, the inspection system can index the blades and check for potential problem areas much quicker than a technician on a rope, according to Gadney.\n“Offshore, we can inspect two turbines a day; onshore, we could inspect up to five turbines a day,” Gadney said. “The remote camera is a great alternative to the traditional alternative of sending a technician up a rope, which can take a whole day to look at one turbine.”\nA main goal of GEV Wind Power’s innovation programs is to help keep the bottom line down for owner-operators.\n“That’s another area where GEV Wind Power in particular is bringing innovation to the marketplace, keeping the pressure on driving the cost down, increasing productivity and reducing the O&M costs, and at the same time positioning us as the go-to company,” Gadney said. “It’s a two-branched approach that we take.”\nGEV Wind Power is constantly contributing to and adding efficiency to the supply chain, and it’s doing it through innovative products such as its Ventura Blade Habitat and the IRIS tablet-based reporting system, he said. Those, in addition to its comprehensive maintenance programs offered to owner-operators, all contribute to driving the cost of wind power down.\n“There’s a lot of damage out there,” Gadney said. “And so our purpose is to truly help the industry try to drive down these costs of O&M and pass on savings to clients.”","FORCE Technology Wind Energy Inspection and Consultancy, Rotor Blade and Tower Testing\nFORCE Technology provides international consultancy, inspection, and testing for rotor blade and towers for the wind energy industry.\nFor more than 30 years, FORCE Technology has been a technical leader in the wind industry sector, and has provided clients with cost-effective, tailored solutions to their onshore and offshore wind farm projects.\nAutomated ultrasonic blade inspection\nFORCE Technology is one of the industry leaders in identifying turbine damage and faults. By using ultrasonic inspection, our highly skilled staff can identify critical faults to systems, such as delamination, lack of adhesive or bond, laminate thickness variations, and porosities in adhesives.\nScanners for the wind power industry\nFORCE Technology provides automated ultrasound inspection systems to the wind power industry to document manufacture defects in wind turbine blades, and turbine towers. Using a wide array of scanner technologies, FORCE Technology can provide customized scanner solutions for any feature or model of turbine blades and towers.\nThe blade scanner program includes:\n- MWS-6 manual scanner: a manually operated scanner used to inspect composite materials on structural flaws and fiber waviness (wrinkles), often occurring in reinforcement girders and spar caps.\n- AMS-40 automated track scanner: An efficient precision scanner that is compact in size, allowing it to adapt to a wide range of testing requirements and ultrasound testing techniques. Often applied for QC on internal Spars.\n- AMS-46 automated crawling scanner: Examines the integer fiber-reinforced composite structure on assembled blades and sub-components. Easy to apply to any horizontal rotor blade, with very few pre-installations.\n- AMS-57/69 mobile automated blade track scanner: Inspects sections up to 4 – 5 meter, where the basic ultrasonic scanner equipment is handled and manipulated with a fork lift truck chassis along a pre-programmed scan path.\n- AMS-60 mobile blade scanner: A self-propelled autonomous mobile scanner device, assembled on a fork lift truck chassis. May execute full and complete blade inspection even on the largest multi-MW wind turbine blades. May accommodate blades oriented vertically.\n- AMS-71 mobile blade array scanner: An advanced revolutionary scanner concept, based on a multi-channel sensor array, covering the whole inspection area in one stroke. The array comprises 24-32 individual line scan channels, capturing the structural information simultaneously. The inspection speed is unbeaten high, often a requirement with contemporary multi-MW rotor blades. Accommodates for vertically oriented rotor blades.\nNot only is FORCE Technology’s services confined to inspections, the company also provides third-party risk management advisory services to help clients assure the quality and delivery of all components of their turbines. This includes regular inspection visits to manufacturers’ premises, monitoring of turbine component transportation and installation, takeover of all inspections and surveys during the commissioning phase, and finally, full in-service support.\nInspection of fiber waviness in UD fiber reinforcement layers in composites\nIn composite unidirectional fiber layers, it is important to identify any signs of undulations and waviness in the primary load-bearing layers. Fiber waviness with wrinkles will induce fatal blade accidents caused by fatigue loading in time. Applying A-scan ultrasonic data, FORCE Technology can identify, monitor, size and review any waviness through proprietary B-scan presentations.\nFiber waviness in UD layers, above a blade design specific level, will induce a proportional reduction in service life-time. The residual blade life, until a fatal accident, may be estimated quite well. Records have shown, that even minor UD fiber disorientations of 4° angle, may introduce a knock-down factor of three. The normal 20 year life-span of a certain blade will come out as only seven years. And it is a predictable manufacturing defect, which may be monitored in advance.\nWind power NDT inspection services\nFORCE Technology also specializes in non-destructive (NDT) inspection services on wind turbine blades. Using our P-scan technology, FORCE can provide high-resolution documentation of any signs of damage or defects on blades. Our services include periodic maintenance inspection and condition testing of installed blades to identify any minimal damage or defects, and enabling turbine managers to anticipate any further damage.\nIn addition, FORCE can also carry out warranty inspection and expiration documentation reports before a handover, accident analysis and evaluation of any damage caused by natural elements.\nOn-site blade testing\nFORCE Technology understands that wind farm owners must receive the maximum operational performance from wind turbines with minimal downtime for repairs in order to see a return on investment. Our highly trained staff can provide several scanning solutions to ensure damaged or faulty blades are working again. Some of optional inspection systems are:\n- AMS-64 fully integrated portable scanner solution: offers a comprehensive ultrasonic scanner solution which may be applied with various blade access technologies, e.g. platforms on mobile cranes, dedicated sky-lifts, and suspended platforms.\n- ATS-1 portable ultrasonic track scanner: provides general purpose solutions for contract inspection, testing and documentation services, generally recommended for multipurpose scanning evaluations of blades\n- MWS-6 ultrasonic manual scanner: a manually operated scanner that accommodates ultrasound techniques for multipurpose inspection work, recommended for random spot checks of rotor blades.\nTower testing in production\nManufacturers of traditional tubular steel towers must process the right steel materials and weld the tower segments with optimum conditions to ensure reliable tower structures. Licensed welding has to be verified by ultrasonic NDT inspection, according the current standards. FORCE Technology provides an array of scanning and consultancy solutions to help tower manufacturers choose the correct production capacity, speeds, dimensions and construction for their project.\nFORCE Technology conducts automated testing of circumferential welds on towers using the AMS-41 and AMS-41 Light scanning systems, as well as the testing of all welds and door frames on a turbine system using the AGS-1 and AGS-2 systems."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ae6f4595-29ee-4e01-9a95-bd0bc9b62639>","<urn:uuid:6c73e066-195a-477a-906c-b8e1c87f1079>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the difference between Hume's phenomenalism and Peirce's pragmatism in terms of how they view the relationship between ideas and practical effects?","answer":"Hume's phenomenalism asserts that substance is merely a relation between ideas, and that these ideas are associated according to laws in consciousness, with no necessary connection to reality beyond appearances. In contrast, Peirce's pragmatism states that ideas are known through their practical effects on behavior - specifically, how they might lead us to act. While Hume focuses on how substance can be explained as frequent conjunction of ideas in the mind, Peirce argues that the whole meaning of a thought lies in what habits of action it produces and how it might cause us to act under possible circumstances. For Peirce, if an idea makes no difference in someone's disposition to act, then it makes no meaningful difference at all.","context":["Help support New Advent and get the full contents of this website as an instant download. Includes the Catholic Encyclopedia, Church Fathers, Summa, Bible and more all for only $19.99...\nPhenomenalism (phainomenon) literally means any system of thought that has to do with appearances. The term is, however, usually restricted to the designation of certain theories by which it is asserted: (1) that there is no knowledge other than that of phenomena — denial of the knowledge of substance in the metaphysical sense; or (2) that all knowledge is phenomenal — denial of the thing-in-itself and assertion that all reality is reality is reality directly or reflectively present to consciousness.\n(1) The first form of Phenomenalism reaches its full statement in Hume, though its logical development can be traced back through Berkeley and Locke to Descartes. It consists in the theory that substance is merely a relation between ideas; that its existence, as a reality, is incapable of intuitive or demonstrative certainty. The origin of the idea of substance can be explained on the basis of the imagination (Hume). The transient mental, or world, phenomena are related in the imagination to a supposed substrate — a fictitious ground, permanent and inert — which accounts for their appearance. The theory destroys metaphysics and replaces it with epistemology. This is quite in keeping with Hume's Associationism in psychology. The \"Treatise on Human Nature\" admits ideas and impressions, together with the association of these elements according to the well-known laws (see Association; Psychology); and nothing more than this is given or is necessary to explain whatever is found in consciousness. For substance (as well as causality, etc.) can be explained adequately as the result of ideas that have been frequently present in conjunction. Hume restricted these views to exact experimental science, and safeguarded the ordinary experience of life by asserting that the concepts of substance, etc., are accompanied by a natural belief, or conviction, of their reality arising from feeling. His doctrine was widely accepted in France, and in Germany became the ideological forerunner of Kant's \"Kritik\". Though at once labelled Scepticism in England, on account of its consequences in natural theology, it is frankly consistent Empiricism quite in place in the evolution of the school of English thought. Where Locke, criticizing the ideogeny of Descartes, and admitting the part of empirical experience in the formation of ideas, left the metaphysical material substance and the metaphysical soul, as realities, uncriticized, Berkeley, developing his position further taught that the supposed existence of the material world was not only indemonstrable, but false. Only spirits, with their ideas and volitions, exist. Esse of the material is percipi: and the regularity of nature is no more than the order of ideas as produced in us by another spirit, namely, God. Hume's position is but a step further than this. Soul, or mind, as substance, is no more real than body. Here the Phenomenalism of Berkeley becomes logically complete.\nQuite consistent with this conception is the statement of Huxley that mind is only the collection of perceptions united by certain relations between them (see Huxley, \"Hume, a Biography\", II, ii, p. 64), or that of Taine, the Positivist, that the Ego is no more than a luminous sheaf, having no other reality than the lights that compose it (see Taine, \"De l'intelligence\", I, pref., p. 11). As we shall show, the opposition of Hume to the concept of substance seems to rest upon a misunderstanding: for he admits (Treatise I, part 4, sect. 1) \"something\" that is accountable for impressions and \"something\" that is impressed (body, mind). Huxley seems but to popularize by his simile the conception of the Scotch philosopher, that there is no mind or soul (as substance) apart from its acts. Huxley compares the soul to a republic in which the members are united by their manifold ties and mutual relationships as citizens. This leaves the impressions and ideas substantial and makes of the mind what Scholastics would call an \"accidental\" unity, and of the substance (soul) a \"permanent possibility of sensations\", as Mill expresses it. Max Müller has dealt with this notion in his \"Science of Thought\" (248) where observes that such terms as possibility express a common quality that is always of something, from which we have abstracted them. To call mind a \"possibility\" is at the same time to deny that it is a substance and to asset of it a quality belonging to substance, which would seem to be contradictory.\nThe idealistic standpoint of Hue, together with the doctrine of Positivism, has had so great an influence upon modern thought that it will be well to show in what the misunderstanding, already referred to, consists. As Cardinal Mercier points out (\"Ontologie\", 1902. p. 263), it is incredible that such thinkers as Hume and Kant, Mill, Spencer, Wundt, Paulsen, Comte, Renouvier, Bergson, and others, should have so totally misunderstood the substantiality of things and of the Ego as to profess a Phenomenalism contradictory to the doctrine of the school. On the other hand, it is no less incredible that philosophers like Aristotle, St. Thomas, and the Schoolman, should have \"been at fault in their interpretation of an elementary truth of common sense\". On the face of it, a misunderstanding seems probable. To what was this due? First, to the doubt cast by Descartes upon the truth and validity of our notions of substance; second, to the observation of Locke, that we are incapable of directly attaining to substance. If thought could immediately conceive the substance of a thing, we ought to be able to deduce all its properties from that conception. Third, to the explanation advanced by Hume, of the origin of the idea of substance by habit. These three steps form a sequence in the development of idealism. Fourth, to the Positivism, for which this paved the way, as expressed by Comte and Mill. The various schools of thought that may be grouped under Phenomenalism: plain Empiricism, as taught by Hume; Agnosticism, as advanced by Spencer and Huxley; Positivism, Represented by Comte, Littré, Taine, and Mill; all share in the misunderstanding initiated by Descartes with regard to the nature of substance as put forward by the School. The Criticism of Kant may well be included with them, as limiting the object of human knowledge to experience, or phenomenal appearance — although some knowledge as to the noumenon is reached by way of the postulates of the practical reason — the three ideas, soul, world, God. So also may be included the neo-critical movement of Renouvier.\nIt is important that this misunderstanding should be cleared up. Scholasticism indeed maintains that we have a direct but confused and implicit intuition of substance. We grasp the reality of \"something that can exist by itself\". \"Every perception is a substance, and every part of a perception is a distinct substance\" (Hume, \"Treatise\", I, part 4, sect. 5). Thus far the Empiricist agrees with the Scholastic. But upon analysis and reflection, the latter maintains, the distinction between substance and accident emerges. What at first appeared to exist in itself, is seen to exist in something else. That something else is then perceived to be substance; and what before was taken for it, is seen to be accident or phenomenon. Further, as against the criticism of Locke, it is to be remarked that Scholastic philosophy does not claim for the intelligence a direct experience of the specific nature of substance. On the contrary, it relies entirely upon induction to establish such nature. To the objection that induction gives us no knowledge other than of the phenomenal, it answers that we know at least this of the specific substance — that it is the subject of certain observed modifications and the cause of certain observed effects. One further point that is interesting in this connexion is the unfortunate attribution of inertia to substance. Paulsen writes that the soul is not inert as is the atom, thereby sharing the opinion of Wundt. This idea of substance as an inert substrate is also traceable to the Cartesian philosophy, which is thus upon two counts the parent of Phenomenalism. It is hardly necessary to point out that Scholasticism does not regard either the soul or the material atom as inert, except by a mental abstraction which is practiced upon the idea of nature (as immanent activity) to reach the simple conception of \"that which is capable of existing in itself\" (see Substance).\n(2) The second form of Phenomenalism may be found in the doctrine of Fichte and of the school that develops his ideas; as well as in certain tendencies and developments of the system of thought known as Pragmatism. With Fichte, the thing-in-itself of Kant disappears as the ground of experience, and its place is taken by consciousness determining itself. That things are and are known implies a double series, real and ideal, for which Dogmatism is incapable of accounting. There is nothing else, as a ground, than a \"being posited\" by consciousness. But consciousness is aware of itself, knowing is activity, and the nature of this activity. In this conception the real — the functions of consciousness — is paralleled by the ideal — knowledge of these functions. The thing-in-itself is no longer necessary to explain the possibility of knowledge, which here becomes the explanation of the original relation of consciousness to itself. The object has no existence, save for the subject. Fichte's philosophy has much influenced later thought in Germany as elsewhere. The attempt made by Schelling to avoid the contradiction between his doctrine and that of Kant resulted in a form of idealistic Phenomenalism (developed further by Novalis and von Schlegel), and ultimately in a neo-Spinozaistic Pantheism. Hegel's Idealism is a logical, or metaphysical, one, in which the only reality (spirit) \"becomes\" in a process-form of dialectic. In the thesis, antithesis, and synthesis of Absolute mind, the return to consciousness takes the form of phenomena, as spirit becoming apparent to itself. With Schopenhauer, who begins his \"Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung\" with these words: \"'The world is my idea':— this is a truth which holds good for everything that lives and knows. . .\" it would seem that a transition from idealistic Phenomenalism to modern \"scientific\" Realism is in progress.\nPragmatism is the most recent form of Empiricism, and as such belongs to the first form of Phenomenalism noticed above; but its psychologic attitude, and the subjectivist developments it displays, make it perhaps more fitting to mentions it here. For the system as a whole the truth of reality rests upon the subjective feeling of certainty (see EPISTEMOLOGY). The answers given as to why this should be are because of (1) an a priori constitution of mind, of transcendental order and for all individuals; (2) utility, coherence, or vital experience (James, Leroy, Schiller); or (3) an act of the will (Ribot). The first two accounts of the psychological fact of certainty insensibly give place to the third, which is the last word of psychological Subjectivism, except one: and that one is the theory of Solipsism. It will be observed that this line of development is one of an elaboration of a voluntaristic form of Phenomenalism. Where Schiller (Studies in Humanism) writes that the basis of fact accepted by Pragmatism depends upon its \"acceptance\"; \"that it (acceptance) is fatal to the chimera of a 'fact' for us existing quite independently of our 'will'\", and James (Pragmatism) \"Why may they (our acts) not be the actual . . . growing-places . . . of the world — why not be the workshop of being where we catch fact in the making, so that nowhere may the world grow any other kind of way than this?\" Solipsism goes but one step further in declaring that there is no absolute Ego nor absolute non-Ego. There is no more than the individual consciousness (cf. von Schubert Soldern). Admitting the principles, an escape from such a conclusion is difficult. The pure experience of Avenarius, the reine Erfahrung for you and for me, is theoretic and inevident. Indeed Humanism itself, as advanced by Schiller, seems to be but a kind of Solipsism. The data of thought are immanent, and we only organized them; but Schiller gives no indication of their origin; indeed he says it is absurd to ask whence the given of thought derives. The whole modern school of Immanence belongs to the development of this form of Phenomenalism.\nST.

Rule #1 was concerned with the origin of the message. Rule #3 is concerned with its impact.\nThis rule derives from pragmatism as originally outlined in 1878 by Charles Peirce (pronounced “purse”). Today many consider Peirce to be the greatest American philosopher. He was a path-breaking logician who, in addition to founding pragmatism, made wide-ranging contributions from statistical sampling theory to evolutionary love, which he called “agapeism.” Though highly productive in logic and philosophy, he seldom held a university post due to lapses in his personal finances and departures from social mores. He earned his living not as a professor, but as a practicing scientist with the U.S. Coastal and Geodesic Survey. In his final years, he begged and received handouts from friends including the Harvard professor, William James.\nJohn Dewey and William James, both closely influenced by Peirce, brought pragmatism into academic and even popular culture in the United States, but they also veered from the initial logical conception. By 1905 Peirce felt that his own version of pragmatism had been corrupted, and he curtly proposed renaming it “pragmaticism,” hence the title of this blog. Philosophers today mostly agree that Peirce hit the mark. They accept his original conception of pragmatism as arguably the greatest contribution of any American to philosophical thought. We’ll simply call it pragmatism henceforth.\nPut aside, then, whatever offhand descriptions of pragmatism you may have heard, and let’s see how Charles Peirce defined it. Here is the most commonly quoted statement from his 1878 paper:\nThe rule for attaining…clearness of apprehension is as follows: consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\n“Effects… [with] practical bearings” or more concisely practical effects are the words we tend to remember. Practical, instead of pointing toward Peirce’s initial concept of practice or habits of response, came to signify in the writings of James and Dewey “real-world” or “this-world” applicability. James almost equated pragmatism with empiricism. “Practical” evolved to mean almost the same thing as “objective” or even “testable,” and pragmatism morphed heedlessly into an on-the-street version of positivism. It became a kind of self-centered utilitarianism, focused on tangible goods and prone to crass compromise of principle.\nBut what exactly did Peirce mean by his use of the word “practical”? We can look back to another passage in his same 1878 article on “How to Make Our Ideas Clear”:\nFrom all these sophisms we shall be perfectly safe so long as we reflect that the whole function of thought is to produce habits of action; and that whatever there is connected with a thought, but irrelevant to its purpose, is an accretion to it, but no part of it. If there be a unity among our sensations which has no reference to how we shall act on a given occasion, as when we listen to a piece of music, why, we do not call that thinking. To develop its meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what habits it produces, for what a thing means is simply what habits it involves. Now, the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead us to act, not merely under such circumstances as are likely to arise, but under such as might possibly occur, no matter how improbable they may be. What the habit is depends on when and how it causes us to act. As for the when, every stimulus to action is derived from perception; as for the how, every purpose of action is to produce some sensible result. Thus, we come down to what is tangible and practical as the root of every real distinction of thought, no matter how subtile it may be; and there is no distinction of meaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice.\n“Practical” in Peirce’s language is not to be conflated with “objective” or “testable.” Instead it derives its meaning from practice or the Greek praxis, signifying “how we shall act.” Pragmatism, therefore, means that a thought is known only through the impetus it provides to a person to form a habit of responsive action. Notice that the effects described in the passage are decidedly effects on a person, not effects on some set of natural objects.\nAs an example, Peirce turned to the doctrine of transubstantiation, which is affirmed by Roman Catholics, but denied by Protestants. Catholics, he said, believe that the elements of the Eucharist taste like bread and wine, but their effects on the recipient are completely as if they are the body and blood of Christ, and furthermore, they are at that moment the body and blood of Christ. Protestants believe that the elements taste like bread and wine, but their effects on the recipient are completely as if they are the body and blood of Christ, and even so, actually they are just bread and wine.\nBy the pragmatic criterion, all that follows “and furthermore…” and “and even so, actually…” bears no distinction of meaning, because all of the effects on the participant have already been described.\nIt was hardly a momentous example, but it served to introduce the principle. The Catholic and Protestant views on transubstantiation are an example of what we might call a pragmatic pair. Let’s define a pragmatic pair as two answers to a question (“Are the elements really the body and blood of Christ?”) that seem to be distinct, but lead to no difference in practice – that is, no change in the way someone acts.\nThe Peircean notion of pragmatic pairs is a stunning contribution to philosophy, an extraordinarily powerful tool for putting useless arguments to rest. When you start to look around, pragmatic pairs begin to pop up everywhere. Here is a question, for which I think the answers compose a pragmatic pair:\nDoes God exist?\nI’m referring here not to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Ishmael, nor to the God of Christians, Muslims, or Bahá’is. Instead I’m referring to the God of Mortimer Adler. In the next blog we’ll look at Adler’s God, and you can decide for yourself whether the existence of such a God is meaningful.\nPrevious post: Agreement Not Required\nNext post: Does God Exist?\nSearching for GSOT outline: Home\n How to Make Our Ideas Clear, first published in Popular Science Monthly (Jan. 1878), pp. 286-302, reproduced in Charles S.

{"question":"Como puedo aplicar for el prison programme en Prague o Central Bohemia?","answer":"To apply for the prison programme, you must be over 18 years old and reside in Prague or the Central Bohemian Region. You can apply in two ways: either directly on your own, or through a specialized social worker in the prison. The service is provided free of charge.","context":["Field Programmes – Prison Programme – Central Bohemian Region\nCriminal offenders. People living a high-risk way of life or endangered by such a way of life.\nDealing with a person interested in the service:\nA person interested in the service can apply for our programme on his own or via a specialized social worker in the prison where we commute. The interested person must be older than 18 and reside in Prague or the Central Bohemian Region.\nDetailed description of service implementation:\nThe goal of our programme is to prevent a person being released from prison from relapsing into crime, and work with his/her family in such a way that we would create better conditions for integrating this person into society and thereby support the integration of the whole family. The “prison programme” is unique in its interconnection of services for the person serving a prison sentence or about to finish serving a prison sentence and his/her family.\nThe programme aims especially at increasing the function and stability of the user´s family ties, improving the user´s orientation in society and its functioning, improving the level of communication with institutions and authorities, the development of skills and proficiencies necessary to fulfil living needs (housing, employment – financial security, satisfactory relations with others, and the like), increasing motivation to find employment, and improving the user´s communication skills, his/her self-confidence and self-reflection abilities.\nThe programme consists mainly of the following four activities: professional social counselling for the target group directly in prison, assistance in communicating with authorities and other organizations, providing legal advice; supporting the user´s contact with his/her family, working with families of convicts while the family member is serving his/her prison sentence; assistance with housing and employment, procuring civilian clothes for field social work in families immediately after release.\nMethods of work:\n• absence of charges\n• low threshold – the service is intended for people who have no access to regular social and other services due to social exclusion\n• a complex approach towards dealing with the user´s situation and his/her relationship with family and society\n• equal access to the service – the service is provided to everyone without bias regarding gender, age, disabilities, nationality, religion, language, political ideology or sexual orientation or social situation\n• individual approach – the workers approach the service user with regard to his/her unique personality, situation and wishes, taking the user´s individuality into account when acting\n• the workers protect confidential information obtained from the client throughout the service, they lead the client towards autonomy so that he/she takes responsibility for his/her life situation and stops being dependent on the social worker\n• mediating contact with the social environment\nWhen concluding the contract, the client always receives and is informed about the procedure regarding the handling of complaints. The client can file a complaint in several ways, either in verbal or written form. The client can also file a complaint anonymously by inserting the complaint into the Romodrom mailbox located on the outer wall of the house where the service is provided.\nTermination of service:\nEach contract on the provision of a social service is concluded for a fixed period, usually one year, so if a client has not been cooperating for an extended period of time, cooperation ends when the contract expires. The client is also always informed about the ability to end cooperation with us any time and without stating their reason. On the other hand, we may terminate the service only for serious reasons (e.g. a client´s aggressive behaviour) or if the client has stopped fulfilling the conditions for the provision of services (moving to a different place).\nPayment for services:\nThe social service is provided free of charge.\nPremises, material and technical equipment:\nOur service has the option to utilize a contact room (office) where the client can come, either during office hours or at a different time after making an appointment with the worker. There is a notice board in the contact room where the client can read all the information about our organization as well as information about follow-up organizations.

{"question":"Got a new house with balloon flowers in the backyard. What's their optimal growing environment, and how do I protect them from slug damage?","answer":"Balloon flowers thrive in well-draining loamy soil with good organic content and prefer slightly acidic soil (pH 6-7). They need full sun for best flowering, though they can tolerate partial shade, and do well in temperatures between 60-80°F. For slug protection, several effective methods can be implemented: creating physical barriers with copper tape or wire around garden beds, applying diatomaceous earth as a barrier, using beer traps, and maintaining good garden hygiene by removing debris where slugs hide. Additionally, maintaining a relatively dry environment through proper drainage and avoiding overwatering can discourage slug activity, as slugs prefer moist conditions.","context":["Balloon flowers come in a number of attractive varieties, though none will bloom the first year.\nThe biggest problem to look for is snails and slugs, which will make the plant unsightly as they eat on it.\nThese flowers are not hard to care for though they have some toxicity problems that you need to know. Here in this article, we'll go over this beautiful plant in great details.\nBalloon Flower Overview\n|Origin||Korea, China, Japan, Russia|\n|Scientific Name||Platycodon grandiflorus|\n|Type||Clump-forming herbaceous perennial|\n|Common Names||Balloon Flower, Chinese Bellflower, Japanese Bellflower|\n|Height||Around 2 feet|\n|Toxicity||Some toxic elements|\n|Light||Full sun to partial shade|\n|Watering||Moderately moist soil|\n|Pests||Slugs and snails|\nThe balloon flower has become incredibly popular in American gardens due to its impressive hardiness, low maintenance needs, and the surprising flowers it produces. There are a whole host of varieties to choose from if you are looking to invest in some balloon flowers, with all of them having plenty to offer the keen gardener.\nThis dwarf variety grows to a maximum of just 8 inches tall, making it perfect for growing in container pots on the patio or as bedding, edging, or a border plant. Its small stature means that unlike many balloon flowers, it won’t need to be staked, yet still produces large, vibrant blue star-shaped flowers of up to three inches in diameter. The stems of this plant emerge from the ground each spring but can be easily disturbed if you forget where they were planted. It’s a good idea to mark them out so that you can leave a clear space for them to arrive each year, as even minor disturbance of this plant can cause it to die. It does not cope well with being moved, and as it is a smaller variety, it would be best grown directly in the container, which will also be its final home.\nThese balloon flowers are another dwarf variety that grows up to 8 inches in height. They work well in containers and also as cut flowers in bouquets. The buds of this variety appear as puffed up white balloons, which transform into star-shaped flared flowers. The flowers are white with subtle striping hints of pink.\nFuji Blue is a medium variety of balloon flowers. It grows to around 20 inches tall, making it an impressive height but still small enough to not require the stems to be staked. The flowers of this variety are slightly smaller than other balloon flowers, typically measuring two inches across, and appearing in a vibrant shade of blue with some darker blue veining.\nThis variety of balloon flower features double blooms, with two full layers of star-shaped blue petals. The plant grows to around 24 inches in height and is a variety that may need to be staked when mature. The plant is deer-resistant, mostly disease-resistant, and is not frequently a victim of insect infestations. However, slugs and snails need to be watched out for as these can sometimes cause a problem for the plant.\nCaring for Your Balloon Flower\nThis plant should be grown in well-draining loamy soil because it enjoys a good amount of moisture but does not like to be sitting in soggy soil. A high-quality, well-draining soil with good organic content will encourage water to drain away from the roots, protecting the plant against root rot while ensuring it gets all of the moisture and nutrients it needs. The plant would prefer to be in slightly acidic soil, ranging between 6 and 7 pH, though it will tolerate alkaline or neutral soil as well. Avoid heavy or waterlogged areas when planting the balloon flower as it will struggle to survive in these conditions.\nFull sun is best for this plant, especially if you want it to produce an abundance of flowers. If you aren’t able to offer the plant a full sun position, then it will settle for partial shade, ideally with several hours of direct sun in the morning.\nThis plant is hardy in zones 3 to 8, and it will thrive in temperatures ranging from 60 to 80 ºF. It can tolerate temperatures exceeding 8 0ºF but will need some protection during the hottest part of the day. If you live in a hot climate, you should position this plant so that it receives morning sun but is sheltered in the afternoon from the intense heat. The afternoon shade will drop the temperature a few degrees and give the plant some relief from the high levels of heat.\nBalloon flowers grow well from seed and can be sown anytime within the growing season. If you want to get a head start on growing these plants, you can sow the seeds indoors in early spring. Use a tray of moist, well-draining soil and sit the seeds on top, lightly pressing them into the soil. Be careful not to cover the seeds over with soil or press them in too deep, as they need light in order to germinate.\nKeep the soil moist but not soggy and sit them in a bright and warm spot. Germination should occur within two weeks. Once seedlings have developed, you can thin them out, moving the strongest among them to slightly larger pots to allow their roots to spread and gain strength. Once the final frost has passed, you can transplant the seedlings outside to their final positions. You will need to take care as balloon flowers have particularly delicate root systems, which, although fleshy, can be very easily damaged. Do not expect all of your seedlings to survive the move, so grow more than you need initially. Alternatively, you can sow seeds directly in the ground during late spring or summer. This will likely result in a higher success rate as the plants won’t need to be transplanted, but they will have less time to grow during the growing season, so it won’t become as large as when started earlier. Balloon flowers typically won’t flower in their first year.\nThis plant is also fairly successful in self-seeding, so you can benefit from extra balloon flowers for no effort at all. Spent flowers develop into seeds, some of which will be dispersed and settle into the soil where they will grow into new plants. To allow this to happen, you need to refrain from deadheading the flowers as this is where the seeds are. Allow them to naturally drop to the ground when they are ready, and you should see a handful of new balloon flowers emerging next spring.\nThe blooms of this plant are commonly known as balloon flowers because of the way the buds swell up like balloons, and then seemingly burst into starry bell-shaped flowers. Each flower has five points and measures between two and three inches across. The flowers are reliable bloomers and are available in white and various shades of blue and violet. They bloom profusely throughout the summer, sitting on top of tall stems in clusters of flowers, with serrated foliage below.\nIn the winter, the foliage itself can provide some colorful interest in the garden, with the leaves often fading to shades of purple and red. Some stems may need to be staked to prevent them from falling over when flowering, as stems tend not to be very strong and become more likely to bend over the taller they get. If you are opposed to staking plants, an alternative method would be to clump plants together so that they can support each other. Another option is to prune back stems after the flower, as this will encourage a bushier pattern the following season and prevent stems from becoming so tall (University of Illinois Extension).\nThe scientific name actually translates to ‘broad bell,’ which is a good description of the flower. ‘Platycodon’ is derived from Greek, with ‘platys’ meaning ‘broad,’ and ‘kodon’ meaning ‘bell.’ ‘Grandiflorus’ literally translates to large flowers.\nThis is a low-maintenance plant that doesn’t necessarily require pruning. However, you can prune it if you wish to train it to grow in a particular way. To keep the plant from getting leggy, you can trim the stems back by just a few inches, though be sure to do this after flowering has occurred to prevent inadvertently disturbing the flower production. Pinching back stems will result in more growth at the base and a bushier looking plant. It will also help to prevent the flowering stems from becoming so tall that they need staking.\nOther than this, the maintenance of this plant is very minimal. You can deadhead the spent flowers if you wish, as this will encourage more flowers to bloom and result in a longer flowering season.\nSome parts of this plant are toxic, namely the roots and the basal leaves. However, some other parts of the plant are edible and can be used in soups or for flavoring (Plants for a Future).\nBalloon flowers are mostly disease-free. They are also deer-resistant and pest-resistant, very rarely being affected with insect infestations. The exception to this is slugs and snails, which can sometimes cause problems for the plant. Snails and slugs feast on the foliage of plants, leaving unsightly holes in your plant's leaves and negatively affecting their health. There are ways you can naturally deter these pests from inhabiting your balloon flowers, such as planting garlic or chives nearby, which are slug and snail repellents.\nAre you ready to get festive by growing your own balloon flowers?

These slimy creatures have a knack for devouring foliage, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. However, with the right knowledge and strategies, you can effectively get rid of slugs and protect your garden oasis. In this article, we will explore various methods to eliminate slugs from your garden, from natural remedies to cultural practices and integrated pest management.\nMaintaining a slug-free garden is essential for the health and vitality of your plants. Slugs can cause significant damage to both ornamental and edible plants, ruining months of hard work and dedication. Their feeding habits can lead to unsightly holes in leaves, seedlings being decimated overnight, and the frustration of seeing your favorite flowers and vegetables being devoured. To ensure the success of your garden and preserve its beauty, it is crucial to take proactive measures to control and eliminate slugs.\nBefore diving into the methods of slug control, let’s take a moment to understand these slimy intruders. Slugs are soft-bodied mollusks belonging to the class Gastropoda. They have long, muscular bodies and move by gliding on a slimy trail produced by their foot. Slugs thrive in moist environments and are particularly active during damp and cool weather conditions. They are hermaphrodites, meaning they possess both male and female reproductive organs. Slugs lay clusters of gelatinous eggs in damp soil or hidden crevices, which eventually hatch into tiny slug larvae.\nIdentifying Slug Infestation\nTo effectively combat slug infestation, it is important to identify their presence in your garden. There are several signs that indicate a slug infestation. Look out for chewed leaves with irregular holes or jagged edges, slimy trails on plants or the ground, and the presence of slugs during early morning or after rainfall. Additionally, you may come across the slugs themselves, which can vary in size, color, and pattern. Common slug species include the gray garden slug, the black slug, and the leopard slug. By familiarizing yourself with these signs and species, you can take appropriate action to control the slug population.\nPreventing slug infestation is key to maintaining a healthy garden. Here are some effective prevention methods to consider:\na. Creating physical barriers to deter slugs: Install barriers such as copper tape or wire around the edges of garden beds, pots, or raised planters. Slugs dislike the electrical charge created by copper and are deterred from crossing the barrier.\nb. Choosing slug-resistant plants for your garden: Select plants that are less appealing to slugs. Varieties such as lavender, rosemary, geraniums, and begonias are known to be less attractive to slugs.\nc. Implementing proper garden hygiene practices: Keep your garden clean and free of debris, as slugs tend to hide in dark, damp areas. Regularly remove fallen leaves, mulch, and weeds that can provide hiding spots for slugs.\nIf slugs have already invaded your garden, you can employ various natural remedies to deter and control them:\na. Using copper tape or wire to repel slugs: As mentioned earlier, copper creates an unpleasant sensation for slugs. Encircle pots, raised beds, or specific areas with copper tape or wire to prevent slugs from reaching your plants.\nb. Applying diatomaceous earth as a barrier: Diatomaceous earth is a natural substance made from fossilized remains of aquatic organisms. Sprinkle a thin layer of diatomaceous earth around your plants. Its sharp particles will deter slugs as they crawl across it.\nc. Making beer traps to catch slugs: Bury a container, such as a shallow dish or jar, partially filled with beer in the ground. Slugs are attracted to the scent of beer and will crawl into the container and drown. Empty and refill the traps regularly.\nOrganic Slug Control Products\nIf natural remedies alone aren’t sufficient, you can explore organic slug control products that are safe for both your plants and the environment. Some effective options include:\na. Iron phosphate-based baits: Iron phosphate baits are organic and pose no harm to humans, pets, or wildlife. Scatter the pellets around your garden, following the instructions on the packaging. The slugs will consume the bait, which will eventually cause their demise.\nb. Nematodes as a biological control method: Nematodes are microscopic worms that naturally occur in soil. Certain species of nematodes, such as Steinernema carpocapsae, are effective in controlling slugs. Apply nematodes to the soil according to the instructions to target slug larvae and adults.\nModifying the environment in your garden can create conditions that are unfavorable for slugs. Consider the following methods:\na. Creating a dry environment to discourage slugs: Slugs thrive in moist conditions, so ensuring your garden has good drainage can make the environment less appealing to them. Avoid overwatering and provide adequate airflow to keep the soil relatively dry.\nb. Using companion planting to repel slugs: Certain plants, such as garlic, fennel, and mint, have natural repellent properties against slugs. Interplanting these repellent plants among your vulnerable plants can help deter slugs. Additionally, planting slug-resistant flowers like marigolds can act as a natural barrier.\nNon-Toxic Chemical Solutions\nIf natural and organic methods are not achieving the desired results, you can consider non-toxic chemical solutions for slug control. It’s important to choose products that are safe for the environment, beneficial insects, and other wildlife. Follow these guidelines for safe and effective use:\na. Safe chemical options for slug control: Look for products containing iron phosphate or ferric sodium EDTA as active ingredients. These substances are considered safe for use in gardens and pose minimal risk to non-target organisms.\nb. Understanding the proper application of chemical solutions: Read and follow the instructions provided with the chemical product carefully. Apply the solution as directed, focusing on slug-prone areas of your garden. Avoid over-application and use chemical control methods as a last resort.\nImplementing certain cultural practices can help minimize slug infestation in your garden. Consider the following techniques:\na. Using mulch to deter slugs: Apply a layer of coarse mulch, such as straw or wood chips, around your plants. This creates a barrier that slugs find difficult to cross. Avoid using fine or moist mulch, as it can provide a favorable environment for slugs.\nb. Regularly removing hiding places for slugs: Inspect your garden regularly and remove potential hiding spots for slugs, such as boards, rocks, and plant debris. By eliminating these hiding places, you make your garden less inviting to slugs.\nMaintenance and Monitoring\nMaintaining a slug-free garden requires consistent effort and monitoring. Follow these tips for ongoing maintenance:\na. Regularly inspecting the garden for signs of slugs: Check your plants and the surrounding area for slug damage, slime trails, and the presence of slugs. Early detection allows for prompt intervention and prevents further damage.\nb. Maintaining slug control methods throughout the season: Continuously apply preventive measures and monitor slug activity throughout the gardening season. Regularly replenish barriers, refresh baits, and adjust cultural practices as needed.\nIntegrated Pest Management (IPM)\nAdopting an integrated pest management approach is crucial for effective slug control. Integrated pest management combines multiple strategies to minimize pest damage while minimizing the use of harmful chemicals. Incorporate the following practices:\na. Adopting an integrated approach to slug control: Combine various methods discussed in this article, such as physical barriers, natural remedies, cultural practices, and organic slug control products. By using multiple techniques, you create a comprehensive and effective defense against slugs.\nb. Combining multiple methods for effective results: Implement a combination of slug prevention, natural remedies, environmental modifications, and other strategies tailored to your specific garden. This holistic approach increases your chances of successful slug control while maintaining a healthy and balanced garden ecosystem.\nImportance of Early Intervention\nTaking prompt action at the first sign of slug infestation is crucial to prevent their population from multiplying and causing significant damage. By addressing the issue early on, you can minimize the impact on your garden and ensure the well-being of your plants.\nDealing with slugs in the garden can be a challenging task, but with the right strategies, you can effectively control and minimize their presence. By implementing preventive measures, utilizing natural remedies, considering organic slug control products, modifying the garden environment, and practicing integrated pest management, you can create a slug-free haven for your plants. Remember to monitor your garden regularly, adjust your methods as needed, and take action at the first sign of slug infestation. With perseverance and proactive care, you can enjoy a flourishing and beautiful garden, free from the nuisance of slugs.\n1. Are slugs harmful to my plants? Yes, slugs can cause significant damage to plants by feeding on leaves, stems, and even fruits. Their feeding can lead to stunted growth, unsightly holes, and in severe cases, plant death.\n2. How can I attract slug predators to my garden? Encouraging natural slug predators like birds, frogs, toads, and certain beneficial insects can help control slug populations. Providing bird feeders, creating water sources, and incorporating native plants can attract these natural predators to your garden.\n3. Can I use salt to get rid of slugs? While salt can effectively kill slugs, it is not recommended as a control method. Salt can also harm plants and soil, so it’s best to use alternative slug control strategies that are safe for your garden ecosystem.\n4. Should I use chemical pesticides to eliminate slugs? Chemical pesticides should be used as a last resort and only if they are specifically labeled for slug control. Opt for non-toxic options like iron phosphate-based baits and follow the instructions carefully to minimize environmental impact.\n5. How often should I check my garden for slug activity? Regular monitoring is essential to catch slug infestations early. Check your garden at least once a week, especially after rainfall or during periods of high slug activity, and take necessary measures to control them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:724ae6d8-2a9e-454e-b211-e600f000438e>","<urn:uuid:f053d7ca-5ab1-46ba-b62f-0e44ed1e297a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do language contact situations differ between the Swiss German-French bilingual communities described by Weinreich and the Israeli Sign Language development studied by Sandler? Could you compare their approaches to studying these language interactions?","answer":"In Swiss German-French bilingual communities, Weinreich documented a stable bilingual situation, particularly in Fribourg canton, where no observable language shift was taking place. His research showed organized separation of the languages across different domains like schools, churches and administration, with a 'conservatory, stabilizing effect'. In contrast, Sandler's work on Israeli Sign Language represents a case of language emergence and development, where she studies how linguistic structures like phonology, morphology and prosody emerge in a new sign language. While Weinreich focused on documenting existing patterns of bilingual usage and interference between established languages, Sandler's approach examines how fundamental language structures develop from the ground up in a new sign language.","context":["LINGUIST List 23.3396|\nTue Aug 14 2012\nReview: General Linguistics; Sociolinguistics: Weinreich (2011)\nEditor for this issue: Joseph Salmons\nFrom: Ilaria Fiorentini <ilafiorelibero.it>\nSubject: Languages in Contact\nE-mail this message to a friend\nDiscuss this message\nAnnounced at http://linguistlist.org/issues/22/22-4961.html\nAUTHOR: Weinreich, Uriel\nTITLE: Languages in Contact\nSUBTITLE. French, German and Romansh in twentieth-century Switzerland\nPUBLISHER: John Benjamins\nIlaria Fiorentini, University of Pavia/Free University of Bozen, Italy\n\"Languages in Contact: French, German, and Romansh in Twentieth-Century\nSwitzerland\" is Uriel Weinreich's (1926-1967) doctoral dissertation, defended in\n1951 with the title \"Research Problems in Bilingualism, with Special Reference\nto Switzerland\" and until now unpublished. 60 years later, William Labov and\nRonald I. Kim have edited this faithful reproduction of the original typescript\n(the text has been digitized and reproduced in full), with an introduction,\nnotes and comments. The introductory chapter presents the life and legacy of\nWeinreich, as well as the background of his fieldwork in Switzerland, and shows\nhow \"Languages in Contact\" (1953, henceforth LiC), perhaps Weinreich's most\nimportant work, grew out of this dissertation; finally, it summarizes the\ndevelopments of multilingual situation in Switzerland up to 2011.\nThe volume is divided into four parts. The first (Chapters 1-3) deals with\ngeneral research problems: large parts of it will be incorporated in LiC. In\nChapter 1, Weinreich discusses psychological and neurological theories of\nbilingualism, enumerating methods for characterizing and measuring it, such as\nrelative proficiency, which, by means of a formula, calculate the bilingual\nquotient, \"a highly useful basis for comparing and grouping bilinguals\" (p. 5).\nThis \"new tool\", however, was still at its starting point, and, as Weinreich\nnotes, it had never been tried out on Swiss bilinguals (even if a few pilot\ntests had shown its applicability there). The author analyzes reasons for\npositive attitudes toward languages and describes the circumstances surrounding\nthe learning of languages. Then he deals with the alleged effects of\nbilingualism on language learning performance, intelligence, group\nidentification, character formation and emotional adjustment (in the latter\ncase, he concludes that there is no evidence for detrimental effects of\nbilingualism on emotional life). Weinreich also analyzes educational problems\nwith regards to bilingualism, especially the organization of schools in\nbilingual areas and the best pedagogical methods for teaching two languages,\ngiving a partial bibliography on educational difficulties.\nIn Chapter 2 the author outlines patterns of bilingual communities, in which the\nfunctions of the two languages may be diagrammed for the various levels of use\n(such as literature, church, administration, etc.). Nevertheless, the division\nbetween two languages is not always clear: this is the problem of intermediate\nlanguages, \"intermediate forms existing between the mother-tongue and the\nother-tongue\" (p.23). Weinreich defines mother-tongue groups, i.e. those\nsegments of the population including \"all those who speak language A AS THEIR\nMOTHER-TONGUE, whether or not they also use language B in other functions\"(p.\n21), and points out that most bilingual communities often have two mother-tongue\ngroups within them , with a socially higher-standing group that \"claims for\nitself the levels of use which are endowed with social and cultural prestige\"\n(p. 25). The author then introduces the notion of counter-prestige, \"which\nevolves as a reaction to prestige\" (ibidem), foreshadowing the notion of covert\nprestige, expounded later most famously by Peter Trudgill (1972) and William\nLabov (2006). Finally, he stresses the difficulty in obtaining satisfactory\nstatistics and maps on bilingual populations.\nChapter 3 deals with linguistic problems of bilingualism. After sketching\ntheoretical questions on bilingualism, Weinreich discusses the distinction\nbetween borrowing in speech and borrowed elements in language. He points out\nthat borrowing includes not only words or morphemes generally, but also\n\"phonetic, morphological and syntactic patterns. Where there is no introduction\nof segmental material from one language into the other, it is sometimes more\nconvenient to speak of interference\" (p. 40). While discussing the challenge of\nobserving the act of borrowing, he introduces what would now be called the\nobserver's paradox (Labov 1972). As for interference and borrowings, he\ndescribes phonetic aspects, morphological aspects (in his opinion, the\npossibility that morphological patterns can be borrowed \"cannot be excluded on\nprinciple, unless the possibility of language change is denied\", p. 48),\nsyntactic and lexical aspects. As for the last, he lists reasons for borrowing\n(the need for names for certain objects or concepts, social prestige, and so\non), concluding that all these motivations still do not solve \"all the problems\nof lexical borrowings\" (p. 54), like the fact that some words are never borrowed\nand \"neither cultural, structural, nor social (prestige) considerations account\nfor this difference\" (ibidem). At the end of the chapter, the differences in the\ntotal amount of borrowing (individual differences, different types of\nbilingualism, monolingual or bilingual interlocutors), the structural and\ncultural resistance to borrowing, substratum and convergent development are\nThe second part (Chapters 4-5) deals with the bilingualism in Switzerland, the\ndissertation's main focus. In Chapter 4 the author describes the different\ncontact situations which can (or could) be found in quadrilingual Switzerland:\nGerman-French (only between Biel and Fribourg), German-Italian (almost no\ncontact), Italian-Romansh (generally no communication), German-Romansh\n(discussed later). Weinreich sketches a revised map of language territories,\nfrom which it seems evident that \"the contact between language territories and\nlanguage communities in Switzerland is considerably smaller than is usually\nassumed on the basis of misleading maps\" (p. 70). Then the author outlines the\nfeatures of the federal government, cantonal governments and communal\nadministrations in Switzerland.\nChapter 5 deals with intralingual relations in Switzerland. First Weinreich\noutlines the regional and social differentiation of Schwyzertütsch and the\nlanguage patterns of German Switzerland, where Schwyzertütsch was used as the\nspoken language while \"the functions of a written language are generally\nfulfilled by Standard German\" (p. 84). The author describes the prestige factors\nof Schwyzertütsch (such as its status as a mother tongue), the attempts to\nbroaden its functions, and the linguistic effects of German-Swiss bilingualism,\nsuch as the slow but steady impact of Standard German on the dialect. Then he\ndeals with the contact situation between Standard French and patois, a case of\nirreversible language shift: patois had been driven out completely from the\nschools, and had thus become associated \"with lack of education and peasant\nbackwardness\" (p. 109), even if there were efforts to preserve it, at least as a\nvehicle \"for lyrical expression and of local patriotic sentiment\" (p. 111). In\nItalian Switzerland, Standard Italian was in contact \"not only with local\ndialects corresponding to the French patois or to the several varieties of\nSchwyzertütsch, but also with a Common Lombardic dialect\" (p. 114). Finally,\nWeinreich deals with Romansh and its dialects: Upper and Lower Engadinian,\nSutsilvan, Protestant and Catholic Sursilvan, Surmiran, each one with a standard\nfor writing (the creation of a single supradialectal written standard -- the\n\"Rumantsch Grischun\" by Heinrich Schmid -- did not come about until 1982).\nPart III (Chapters 6-8) deals with the stable, long term language contact\nbetween German and French. Chapter 6 describes general features of French-German\nbilingualism. Weinreich details these bilingual segments of the Swiss\npopulation, dividing them according to geographic zones and providing a history\nof the bilingual populations inside French territory. He describes the\nlinguistic effects of bilingualism on vocabulary and grammar, and notes that the\nFrench-German grammatical cross-influence had not yet been investigated, as well\nas the phonetic influences; in his opinion, it was \"certainly to be expected\nthat German settlers who learn French will have traces of their native sounds in\ntheir French speech, and vice versa\" (p. 141).\nChapter 7 presents a case study on the static bilingual situation in the canton\nof Fribourg, \"where no observable language shift is taking place\" (p. 143). The\nlanguage patterns of the area are described in detail, and, for each of the 22\ncommunes, the total population and numbers of mother-tongue speakers are given.\nWeinreich identifies seven predominantly German communes, six highly mixed\ncommunes and nine communes with predominantly French-speaking populations, and\ngives for each commune a rate of bilingualism (none, slight, widespread, very\nwidespread). The author then describes the religious dominations of the area,\nbecause \"in the particularly mixed villages, the difference in denomination may\nbe even more prominent than that in language\" (pp. 153-154) and the organization\nof schools, which appears to have a \"conservatory, stabilizing effect on the\nbilingual situation\" (p. 160). He takes into account also the organization of\nchurches and administrative activities and concludes that, even diachronically,\nthis region can be termed \"a stable bilingual area\" (p. 175).\nChapter 8 describes the linguistic effects of bilingualism in Fribourg.\nWeinreich first analyzes the nature of bilingualism of the area and its\nsociocultural context and then speech mixture and mutual influence between the\ntwo languages involved (French and Schwyzertütsch), outlining and comparing\ntheir sound systems and investigating morphological, syntactic and lexical\nPart IV (Chapters 9-14) deals with the contact between German and Romansh in a\nsituation of ongoing shift. Chapter 9 describes the general features of\nGerman-Romansh bilingualism. First of all, Weinreich sketches a brief history of\nthe receding Romansh language territory. He states that since the 1870s native\nspeakers of Romansh had ceased to be linguistically self-sufficient due to the\neconomic development of the canton, so that knowledge of German had become\nvital. Nonetheless, it appeared that Romansh enjoyed a \"very strong prerational\n('mother-tongue') prestige\" (p. 209). Weinreich's conclusion was that the area\nwas rapidly approaching complete bilingualism. Finally, he describes the\nlinguistic effects of German-Romansh bilingualism on vocabulary, grammar and\nChapter 10 is a case study on the dynamic bilingual situation in Central\nGrisons, where \"an observable language shift is taking place\" (p. 215).\nWeinreich describes the area and the population, as well as the language\npatterns, identifying eight communes with Romansh majorities and eleven with\nGerman majorities. As already pointed out, knowledge of German was essential to\nthe population, while the local Romansh variety was considered an inferior,\n\"substandard\" language: it was not taught in school and it was almost entirely\nexcluded from local administration. Language shift was visible both\ndiachronically, by looking at the changing proportions of mother-tongue\nsegments; and synchronically, as the percentage of Romansh mother-tongue\nspeakers was declining and they were, on the whole, \"OLDER than those of German\nmother-tongue\" (p. 251-252); the Germanization in the area was therefore \"a\nself-accelerating process\" (p. 265). There were, however, rationalized motives\nfor retaining Romansh, as the alleged advantages in learning other languages and\naccessibility to the Romansh cultural heritage.\nChapter 11 deals with Raetoroman actions aimed at containing language shift and\nhalting Germanization, e.g. the attempt to standardize Sutsilvan dialects, the\nfoundation of Romansh kindergartens (the so-called \"scolettas\" which, in\nWeinreich's opinion, had demonstrated that local Romansh could \"be taught to\nchildren and be made a source of pleasure for them\", p. 289), and the proposal\nfor a language conservation law. A broad plan for revitalizing Romansh Sutselva\nwas made by Dr. Gangale, a Romance philologist and scholar of Romansh, and\nincluded even \"psychological treatments\": \"At first it is hard to decide whether\nthis scheme is ridiculously foolish or frighteningly ingenious\" (p. 295). Thanks\nto the campaign \"to contain and reverse the language shift\", according to\nWeinreich many Raetoromans were convinced \"that they had responsibilities toward\ntheir language\" (p. 298).\nChapter 12 deals with the linguistic effects of bilingualism in Central Grisons,\nwhere there was a real bilingual speech community, since \"the two languages\noverlap in certain functions\" (p. 302). Weinreich describes this bilingualism\nand the types of mixture (incidental speech mixture -- \"while German elements\nare tolerated practically without any limit, the reverse possibility … is kept\nstrictly within bounds\", p. 302 and habitualized mixture -- for German, \"there\nIS a tendency for borrowing to become habitual, and thus a part of the\nlanguage\", p. 303). The phonetic influences between the two languages, with a\ncomparison of the two sound systems, and the morphological, syntactic and\nlexical influences are described at the end of the chapter.\nChapter 13 is a short description of German-Italian bilingualism: there was \"no\nGerman-Italian border bilingualism to speak of\" (p. 325), only scattered\nbilingual minorities in both German and Italian Switzerland.\nChapter 14 summarizes what has been laid out in the four parts of the book with\ngeneral conclusions on intralingual and interlingual relations, concluding that\n\"it seems that bilingualism can be studied properly only on an interdisciplinary\nbasis\" (p. 336).\nThe appendices report excerpts from interviews with bilingual children (appendix\nA), the questionnaire for students of the Cantonal school in Chur (appendix B),\ninformation about the Romansh League's language poll (appendix C) and a guide to\nbilingual placenames (appendix D).\nThe importance of this volume lays first in the fact that, until now, few\nlinguists have been aware that the main themes of LiC were first proposed in\nembryonic form here and even fewer had access to it. Besides its undeniable\nutility, the book is pleasant reading also thank to the inclusion of photos,\nhand-drawn diagrams and other material personally prepared by the author. The\neditors specify that, although this is a faithful reproduction of Weinreich's\ndoctoral dissertation, they have made some adjustments to the original,\nreplacing old-fashioned linguistic usages and obsolete or idiosyncratic terms\nsuch as \"morphologic\", \"unilingual\", or \"bilinguality\" with \"morphological\",\n\"monolingual\", or \"bilingualism\" respectively (although in the whole Chapter 10\n\"bilinguality\" is used instead) and dividing the original \"unwieldy\" third\nchapter of Part II \"into several more easily digestible pieces (chapter 6-13)\"\nWeinreich's preliminary research on Romansh Switzerland was coordinated by André\nMartinet, who later wrote the preface to LiC (1968). The author spent two years\n(1949-50) in Switzerland for his fieldwork, travelling throughout the country,\n\"compiling statistics on linguistic knowledge and use\" (Kim 2011: 103), taking\nphotos (some of which are reproduced here), becoming familiar \"with the full\nspectrum of everyday life in the villages and towns\" (ibidem), describing\nhistorical, political and socio-economic aspects of the population which spoke\nthe languages he was studying. This exhaustive research led to a deep knowledge\nof the full context of the speakers' lives, social behavior and interaction and\nto a valuable, detailed and most of all, for that time, innovative analysis of\nthe various aspects of the contact between two languages, whose linguistic\noutcomes, in his opinion, \"could not be deduced from a comparison of their\nstructures alone\" (Kim 2011: 108).\nAmong the many concepts here introduced or foreshadowed by Weinreich are his\ninnovative position on the borrowability of morphemes, the notion of\n\"counter-prestige\", the concept of \"domain of language use\" (developed by\nFishman 1965), the problem of the observer's paradox (developed by Labov 1972),\nthe distinction between \"stable\" and \"dynamic\" bilingualism, the phonemic over-\nand under-differentiation, and so on. Many of these inspired intuitions will be\ndeveloped in LiC, as well as, for instance, what can be considered the\n\"incunabulum\" of contrastive linguistics (Cardona 1974), i.e. his comparison of\nthe phonological systems of Schwyzertütsch and French to establish the effects\non speech of this bilingualism.\nThe importance of the entire Weinreich's work has been remarked on by William\nLabov, regarded as the father of variationist sociolinguistics and who\nacknowledges that many of his own intuitions come ultimately from Weinreich,\nadmitting that \"to this day, I do not know how many of my ideas I brought to\nlinguistics, and how many I got from Weinreich. I would like to think that my\nstudents are as lucky as I was, but I know better than that\" (Labov 2001: 459).\nCardona, Giorgio Raimondo. 1974. Preface to the Italian edition of Weinreich,\nUriel.

She has developed models of sign language phonology and prosody that exploit general linguistic principles to reveal both the similarities and the differences at these levels of structure in natural languages in two modalities. With her colleagues, she is investigating the emergence of phonology, morphology, prosody, and other levels of grammar in the new sign language of a small, insular community with a high proportion of deaf members: Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language. Sandler has authored or co-authored three books on sign language: Phonological Representation of the Sign (Foris); A Language in Space: The Story of Israeli Sign Language co-authored with Irit Meir (Hebrew: University of Haifa Press; English version: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates); and Sign Language and Linguistic Universals, coauthored with Diane Lillo-Martin (Cambridge University Press).\nMy primary research interest is in the discovery of essential properties of natural language through the study of sign languages. My work has charted a particular course in this discovery process, focusing primarily on the linguistic character of components most closely linked to the physical means of transmission: the meaningless units that signs are made of and their organization (phonology) and the rhythmic and intonational patterns that mold and link the utterances of the language (prosody). For the past decade, my colleagues and I have been investigating the emergence of language structure in a new sign language in a Bedouin village. Through this work, we are identifying the most basic ingredients of language and beginning to understand the role of social contact and community in language emergence.\nSandler, Wendy. (1989).

New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\nPhonological Representation of the Sign: Linearity and Nonlinearity in American Sign Language\n|A central goal of Phonological Representations of the Sign is to answer the question: what does it mean to say that a sign language has a phonology? As a point of departure, the author explores claims of some scholars that the phonemes of American Sign Language (ASL) are simultaneously organized, and of other that signs also have sequential internal organization. She concludes that both claims are accurate, and draws on theories of nonlinear phonology and morphology to represent both properties formally. The study aims to make testable claims about ASL structure, and to facilitate meaningful comparison of signed and spoken languages.\nSign Language and Linguistic Universals\nWendy Sandler and Diane Lillo-Martin\nThe authors compare sign languages with spoken languages in order to seek the universal properties they share. Drawing on general linguistic theory, they describe and analyze sign language structure, showing a range of linguistic universals in the phonology, morphology, and syntax of sign languages. The differences between the two modalities that emerge from the study highlight aspects of sign language structure, and of spoken language structure as well, that must be attributed to the modality of transmission. No prior background in sign language linguistics is assumed, and numerous pictures are provided to make descriptions of signs and facial expressions accessible to readers.\nA Language in Space: The Story of Israeli Sign Language\nIrit Meir and Wendy Sandler\n|A Language in Space: The Story of Israeli Sign Language is an introduction to sign language for a general audience, using Israeli Sign Language (ISL) as a model. The authors also offer a glimpse into the Deaf community from its inception to the present, including narratives by members of the community about their experience and their language. An underlying premise of the book is that language is a mental system with universal properties, and that language lives through people. This book is intended for linguists (with or without a background in sign language), psychologists, sociologists,educators, students, and anyone with an interest in the human capacity for language.\nSandler, Wendy (1986).

{"question":"How did the Dart Fellowship help journalists deal with 9/11 coverage and trauma?","answer":"The Dart Fellowship provided crucial support for journalists covering 9/11. For example, Maria Alvarez from the New York Post found comfort in sharing experiences with other reporters, helping her process her grief. Additionally, Elaine Silvestrini mentions that the Dart network helped journalists at her New Jersey newspaper deal with the deaths of hundreds in their community on September 11.","context":["Performance: Theater of War\n2015 Dart Awards Ceremony & Winners' Roundtable\nBook Presentation: Puertos Príncipes - Temblemos Todos\nAsia Pacific Fellows in Hong Kong\nThe Ochberg Fellowship opened a whole new world for me. Discussions during the fellowship seminar led me to an international reporting project in Rwanda and Bosnia. Back at home, the fact that I attended the Fellowship has given me credibility with victims' advocates and mental health professionals. My daily court beat has improved exponentially due to everything I have learned.\n—Gina Barton, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (2000)\nThe chances to stop and take stock are all too rare as a reporter. The chance to stop and take stock with such a lively, open and stimulating group as gathered by Dart was unique. It was humbling to realize what a lot of great journalism there is in an industry that moans a lot about dumbing down. We could not stop talking day and night, and the compassion and humanity on display was refreshing. It was like the best retreat—set apart yet blindingly relevant.\n—David Loyn, BBC (2005)\nThere's a whole dimension to journalism that we've been programmed to ignore: the emotional landscape of a story. The Dart Fellowship, above all, puts a language to this terrain, providing a deeper understanding of trauma and feelings we encounter in sources as well as within ourselves. The benefit is better journalism with a bigger heart. Is there anything better to strive for?\n—Miles Moffeit, Denver Post (2004)\nThrough the Fellowship I have met colleagues whose work inspires and nurtures me: it is nourishing and exciting to discuss our work and share ideas how we might best help influence and support the work of others. When I feel discouraged, remembering that I am an Ochberg Fellow and that I have this wonderful group of other journalists and producers who I know are there for me helps me keep going.\n—Laura Jackson, WHYY Radio (2000)\nMany ideas cross one's mind when working in war zones: how to work and deal with the people around you, your own safety, and what happens when you return. The Dart Center Ochberg Fellows program has helped me think about these issues and find a better way to work.\n—Ron Haviv, VII Photo (2004)\nThe confidence I gained through the Fellowship guided me from reporting on a specific, horribly violent crime in my community to writing a book about the ripple effects of that crime on the families of the perpetrators and victims, and the community at large, placing adolescent violence into a societal context. I don't think I would have had the confidence to approach mothers and fathers of killers and their victims, talking with them about these painful, sensitive issues, had I not learned a lot about traumatic stress and the after-effects of violent crime from fellow journalists and trauma experts through the Dart Center.\n—Kathryn Eastburn, Colorado Springs Independent (2001)\nI recognized how my work as a reporter covering daily crime and tragedy, culminating in 9/11, has affected me as human being. I realized this more profoundly when I shared experiences and heard the stories of reporters who covered the Iraq War. I no longer felt alone and isolated in my grief and that has been a great comfort when I recollect my memories.\n—Maria Alvarez, New York Post (2002)\nGetting a Dart Center Ochberg Fellowship was one of the best experiences of my 20 plus years in broadcast journalism. I learned so much, made so many life long connections, and it helped re-charge my battery. It was an amazing time to share and learn from some of the best and brightest in the business.\n—Mike Walter, WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C. (2005)\nSince artists study light and color, physicians study human anatomy, and lawyers review precedents and rules of evidence, you might think that journalists would pay special attention to crucial elements of their work. Violence and trauma are part of so many stories we cover; yet the Dart Center is the only group that has made a specialty of looking at the effects of trauma on individuals and society, and on the ways that journalists tell stories about violence and loss.\n—Peter Spielmann, Associated Press (2002)\nBeing part of a community of fellows dedicated to treating survivors of trauma with dignity has helped me to write about healing after terror in such countries as Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. I can't think of a more dedicated and generous group of journalists, and I depend on their support and guidance.\n—Julia Leiblich, Chicago Tribune (2002)\nIn more ways than I can describe, being a Dart Fellow taught me how to balance my life ... More than anything else, the stories of which I've been a part or heard have reminded me that journalists are human too, no matter how much we see ourselves as above it all.\n—Jimmie Briggs, Freelance (2000)\nThe Dart fellowship connected me with an international network of journalists who care about the impact their work has on the vulnerable and recognize the effects on their colleagues. They helped me and others at my newspaper in New Jersey when we had to deal with the deaths of hundreds in our community on September 11. And after I moved to Florida, the Dart community galvanized to help journalists grappling with the effects of several major hurricanes.\n—Elaine Silvestrini, Tampa Tribune (2000)\nThe Ochberg Fellowship has brought me in contact with a community of journalists who care deeply about the actual consequences of their work beyond questions of career advancement. It is a fantastic thing at mid-career to find others who share the same ideals that brought us all into this vocation to begin with. This, for me, has been a source of strength and a powerful affirmation of what this calling is all about.\n—Scott Wallace, Freelance (2004)\nA 40-page guide to help journalists, photojournalists and editors report on violence while protecting both victims and themselves.\nThis documentary, available online and on DVD, features a wide range of Australian journalists their recounting experiences covering traumatic stories.\nYour contributions help the Dart Center nurture informed, innovative and ethical news reporting on violence, conflict and tragedy worldwide.\nThe Dart Center is a project of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a6d8149e-0377-4ecf-bbc1-237d4ee24917>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a design professional preparing documentation, I need to understand: how do the rules differ between trademark symbol registration and patent drawings when it comes to using photographs versus illustrations?","answer":"For trademarks, a visual image can be registered in various forms including a word signature, name, device, label, numerals or combination of colors, with no specific restrictions on using photographs versus illustrations as long as the mark can be drawn diagrammatically (in paper form). In contrast, patent applications have much stricter rules about photographs - they are only permitted for utility patents and design patents, and must be in high definition to show invention details. Patent drawings typically require specific illustrations following detailed rules, including use of India ink, proper scaling, and specific formatting requirements. Photos for patents must follow the same rules regarding type, size, and margins as drawings, while trademark registration is more flexible in terms of visual representation format.","context":["A trademark (popularly referred to as complete name) in laymans language may be a visual image which can be a word signature, name, device, label, numerals or combination of colors employed by of commerce to distinguish it from other similar goods or services originating from a different undertaking.\nThe legal needs to register a trade mark below the Act are: the chosen mark ought to be capable of being drawn diagrammatically (that is within the paper form)\nIt should be capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of others.\nIt ought to be used or planned to be used mark in relevance product or services for the aim of indicating about on indicate a association within the right to use the mark with or without identity of that person.\nThe registration of a trade mark confers upon the owner the proper to the employment of the registered trade mark and indicate so by victimization the image (R) in registered registered and seek the relief of infringement in appropriate courts in the country.

Other Considerations\n8. On Your Own vs. Trained Professionals\n9. Common Mistakes\n10. Steps to File a Patent With Correct Patent Drawings\nWhat Are Patent Drawing Rules?\nPatent drawing rules are the requirements set by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for drawings, pictures, flowsheets, and diagrams that go with a patent application. Most patent applications contain drawings. In fact, for a nonprovisional patent, a drawing must be provided to explain better and outline the subject matter associated with the patent request. To increase the likelihood of having a patent request accepted, it's important to follow the patent drawing rules outlined by the USPTO.\nWhen you want to submit a patent to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, it's not as easy as filling out a patent application, paying a fee, and waiting for a response. Though provisional patents don't need drawings, a nonprovisional patent needs at least one drawing to show how the invention works.\nWhen creating your drawings, stay within the rules described in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, such as:\n- Draw in black and white unless color is the only way to show a part of the invention.\n- Use India ink on all drawings.\n- Make sure drawing is to scale when the illustration is reduced to two-thirds the size.\n- Include identification above each drawing, including the invention name, name of inventor, and application number.\n- Submit all drawings on 11-inch by 8.5-inch white paper or A4 paper. This paper must:\n- Be non-shiny, flexible, free of creases or folds, durable, and white.\n- Be free of erasures, alterations, overwritings, and interlineations.\n- Make the margins at least 1 inch on the top and left sides, 3/8 inch on the right, and 5/8 inch on the bottom.\n- Include scan target points (cross-hairs) on two catercorner margin corners.\n- Never superimpose one drawing over another.\n- Use symbols and a legend if necessary to describe the invention.\n- Avoid solid black shading except on bar graphs or to represent color.\n- Use lead lines that guide the reader from the drawing to the associated symbol in the description.\n- Number each page and view in order with Arabic numerals.\n- Avoid holes in the paper.\n- Photographs must follow the same rules regarding the type, size, and margins of the drawing.\nA complete list can be found in Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), specifically § 1.84. Remember that drawings aren't limited to illustrations and can also include charts and diagrams. In some instances, a photograph may work better than a drawing. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office only allows photos for utility patents and design patents. Photographs must be in high definition to show the details of the invention.\nChemical compounds are the only type of non-provisional patent that doesn't require any drawings.\nColor drawings are rare among patent applications, and they are only allowed for design and utility patents. If you think color drawings are necessary, you must file a petition and pay the specified fee of $130 under Title 37 (CFR) 1.17(h) for permission to use them.\nIf you send your petition in the mail, be sure to include two sets of color drawings and one photocopy that shows the same subject matter in black and white. If you are filing online, only one set of drawings is needed. You also need to add the following language to your patent's specification (the written description of the invention): \"The file of this patent contains a least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent with color drawings will be provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee.\"\nWhen creating your color drawings, make sure the quality is high enough that they can be reproduced in black and white on the printed patent without losing any details.\nGraphic Forms in Drawings\nTables, formulas of a mathematical or chemical nature, and waveforms are subject to the same rules as any other type of drawing. Formulas and waveforms also have specific requirements:\n- Formulas: Each formula must be labeled as a separate figure and include brackets to show any necessary information.\n- Waveforms: Waveforms must be presented in a single figure that uses a vertical axis and a horizontal axis that shows time. Each individual waveform must have a letter designation adjacent to the vertical access for identification.\nWhy Is It Important to Follow Patent Drawing Rules?\nIf you don't include patent drawings or don't follow the patent drawing rules, your application is incomplete. Because it's incomplete, the date of filing will be delayed. This could end up costing you a patent, especially if competitors are trying to patent the same type of invention. Photographs and color drawings have their own rules, so take care to follow those, too.\nFollowing the patent drawing rules will also help the patent officer determine whether the invention is non-obvious and novel. These standards are two of the main hurdles to getting a patent.\nFiling with quality patent drawings also helps establish priority of invention with an earlier filing date, which is important in a first-to-file country like the United Staes. To fully benefit from an earlier filing date, the patent application must cover the invention and all of its permutations, and quality drawings make this process easier. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has frequently used patent drawings to help determine what a skilled person would have considered disclosed at the time of application.\nIn addition, a patent drawing may save you if you leave something out of the written description. For this reason, a quality drawing is often the norm, and a professional patent illustrator to draft the drawing is a valuable asset.\nGuidelines to Follow for Patent Drawings\nProcesses, machines, and designs are three of the most popular patent types. Each follows the same general patent drawing guidelines:\n- Clearly show features, including text and illustration.\n- Keep the drawing neat with no signs of erasure or errors.\n- Maintain legibility throughout.\n- Always use the metric system, as it is the preferred measurement throughout the world.\n- Make the drawing visually appealing to grab attention.\nAlthough these guidelines aren't strict rules, following them will help the patent officer better understand your invention. At the application stage, you don't need to fit all the requirements of a formal patent drawing. However, less technical components still apply, such as the correct font to label aspects of the drawing, as well as the margins of the drawing.\nWhat Views Do I Need?\nTo show how your product looks and works, use several viewpoints in your drawings. If applicable, include the following views of your invention:\n- The standard six views (front, back, right, left, top, and bottom). Unornamented surfaces can be omitted.\n- Perspective views with three dimensions.\n- Only the front and back views of a flat object.\n- Sectional views to show function.\n- Exploded views to show how a single part works during operation of the invention.\nShading is another key part of patent drawings. It shows depth, contour, and texture. To do this, you can use dots, lines, and distinctive patterns.\nArrows and lead lines are also important in the patent draw. There are three times to use arrows:\n- On a lead line, a freestanding arrow shows the entire section which it points to.\n- On a lead line, an arrow touching a line shows the surface indicated by the line.\n- To show movement direction.\nEven with all these rules, there are also considerations you should be aware of. Some of these include:\n- Copyright or Mask Work Notices: These can be placed in the drawing directly below the portion they pertain to. However, they must only be 1/8 inch by 1/4 inch. These are only to be used in cases applicable to law and must be included in the specification.\n- Numbering of Sheets: Drawings must be numbered in Arabic numerals in the middle of the top of the sheet, but not in the margin. Numbers can be moved to the top right if they interfere with the drawing. Numbering must also include two numerals separated by a line to show the page out of the total number of pages. Make sure that numerals are also larger than the numbers used to identify portions of the drawing.\n- Numbering of Views: Views must also be numbered with consecutive Arabic numerals, independent of sheet numbering. Partial views must also use Arabic numerals, followed by a capital letter. Numbers and letters must also be clear and not used with brackets, circles, or inverted commas. These numbers must also be preceded by \"FIG.\" When there's only a single view, \"FIG\" is unnecessary.\n- Security Markings: Security markings can be used but must be in the center of the top margin.\n- Corrections: All corrections submitted with the patent drawing must be permanent and durable.\nOn Your Own vs. Trained Professionals\nAs long as you follow the patent drawing rules, making professional charts, illustrations, and diagrams isn't as hard as you may think. You can stick with a pen and paper, or you can use patent drawing software. Options range from free but limited software to expensive, versatile programs. The quality of each depends on your skill in using it.\nIf you don't have the patience to draw, don't have the skill, or don't want the added pressure of making complex drawings, a professional patent illustrator is a great choice. These highly trained professionals will make each page for around $100 to $125. Although this may seem expensive, it's a fair price to pay for the most important part of your patent application.\nMany inventors don't take enough time or care with their drawings. This could result in an incomplete patent application, or the patent office may not have enough information to make a decision. That's why it's always important to include as many drawings as are needed to fully explain the invention.\nOther inventors don't want to shell out the extra cash to hire a draftsman or patent illustrator. Instead, they rely on their own hand. For moderate to strong artists, this isn't a terrible idea. However, poor drawers may be denied a patent without the help of a trained expert.\nSteps to File a Patent With Correct Patent Drawings\nOnce you've filled out the basic patent application and written a full description of the product, it's time to add the drawings. Remember that only provisional and chemical formulas can be submitted without a drawing. For all other patents, include as many drawings as possible to show how the product works.\nIf you need help with patent drawing rules, you can post your question or concern on UpCounsel's marketplace. UpCounsel accepts only the top 5 percent of lawyers to its site.

{"question":"What are the key differences between Shared Space design and one-way couplet systems in urban street planning?","answer":"Shared Space and one-way couplet systems represent contrasting approaches to urban street design. Shared Space eliminates most road demarcations, traffic control devices, and mode separation to foster natural interactions between all users, leading to slower speeds and increased awareness. One-way couplets, however, maintain traditional traffic controls but create a system of smaller intersections that can efficiently handle high traffic volumes while still being pedestrian-friendly through features like shorter crossing distances and synchronized signals. While Shared Space works best in areas with high pedestrian volumes like neighborhoods and central business districts, one-way couplets are particularly effective at managing 'stroad-level' traffic while supporting walkable development.","context":["By Mike Thompson\nImproving the safety of all users on the road is of paramount importance to public officials, city planners, and traffic engineers alike. Last month, the NJ Walk and Bike Blog wrote about improving the safety of bicyclists through bicycle network connectivity and bicyclist (and driver) behavior in the context of side street parking. While Complete Streets and bicycle lanes are emerging as a popular treatment to improve bicycle and pedestrian safety, another technique, Shared Space, is gaining popularity in both Europe and the United States. Although both Shared Space and Complete Street strategies share the same goal of protecting bicyclists and pedestrians while accommodating all users of the road, the tactics to achieve those ends vary.\nA Complete Street usually contains a variety of physical attributes, such as: quality sidewalks, bike lanes (or wide shoulders), special bus lanes, elaborate crosswalks, median islands for pedestrians, pedestrian signals, curb extensions, and the like. While this technique is useful in that it accommodates all users of the road and improves their safety, another street treatment- Shared Space- is an emerging alternative to traditional separation of transportation modes, especially in places with high pedestrian volumes.\nShared Space aims to eliminate most road demarcations including traffic control devices, markings such as crosswalks, curbs, and bike lanes. This counter intuitive idea for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles to occupy a common space in order to improve safety is gaining traction in new designs for the fastest growing American cities.\nIn a Shared Space, the removal of road demarcations and traffic control devices fosters interactions between drivers and pedestrians, which helps to guide movement through the street in a more natural way. Slower speeds, increased driver awareness, and person- to- person interactions improve safety.\nShared Space is based on the notion that traditional streets allocate distinct spaces to different modes, and in turn create a false sense of security leading travelers to behave as if they do not have responsibility to look out for other users in “their” space. This approach works best for improving traffic flow moving at higher speeds, but neglects the bigger picture of a cohesive urban environment. Pictured below is a Shared Space in the downtown of Adelaide, Australia.\nThe idea of Shared Space originated in the Netherlands with traffic engineer Hans Monderman. Monderman spent most of his career as a “traditional” traffic engineer. While this cutting edge engineering seemed to improve safety in theory, in reality, the Netherlands suffered thousands of traffic related deaths throughout this time. The increase in crashes provided the impetus for Dutch politicians to investigate a new way of organizing traffic.\nAt this time, Monderman started to experiment with traffic patterns and vehicle speeds by removing traffic signs and traditional mode demarcations instead of adding more to the already saturated transportation system. In his mind, crashes were a product of deteriorating personal responsibility saying, “We’re losing our capacity for socially responsible behavior. The greater the number of (traffic) prescriptions, the more people’s sense of personal responsibility dwindles.” This added dimension of social commentary from Monderman allowed him to justify, and eventually implement, his idea of Shared Space (pictured below).\nThe opportunities for Shared Space are numerous and diverse. Shared Space is most likely to succeed in areas that already have high volumes of pedestrians, such as neighborhoods, central business districts, and mixed use developments. The higher volumes of pedestrians facilitate Shared Space implementation and allow for justification of redesigning the roadway. One of the best American examples of Shared Space, Market Square in Pittsburgh, is pictured below.\nThe New Jersey Department of Transportation is hard at work improving our streetscapes and safety of road users. This document—Pedestrian Compatible Planning and Design Guidelines– helps to provide some of the context for integrating pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles in the same space. The implementation strategies for NJDOT and their extensive transportation network includes resources for Complete Streets as just one of their tools to improve pedestrian safety. Shared space is emerging as another option for busy, pedestrian-friendly downtowns and residential areas. The future of your neighborhood’s transportation network is sure to see Complete Streets and Shared Space—just keep up your walking and biking!","By Michael Brown, PE, AICP\nMany urban planners believe that one-way couplets are inherently high-speed and auto-oriented, and thus it is in vogue to convert one-way couplets back to two-way streets. There are good reasons to convert lower-volume one-ways to two-way in historic downtown grids, but in many other environments one-ways can manage Stroad-level traffic far more pedestrian-friendly ways. This article discusses the virtues of one-way streets, concedes some weaknesses, and addresses common misconceptions. Part 2 focuses on existing examples and conceptual designs. Also see my StrongTown’s articles: Are One-Ways Really That Bad? and Can One-Ways be a Middle Way for the Suburbs?\nPlease comment or share with anyone who might care. Or you can contact me privately to learn more.\nA Town Center Intersection is created any time one-way streets are involved. Though one-ways are not new or “innovative,” they can achieve high efficiency because there is no need for left-turn arrows, since there is no opposing traffic.\nImagine two typical suburban “stroad” highways coming together (high-speed street/road hybrid). Normally this would result in double-left turn pockets within a single massive auto-oriented intersection, accompanied by excessive congestion. But this diagram by Calthorpe Associates shows how the two highways can each be divided into lower-speed one-way streets as they cross, resulting in four smaller, friendlier intersections, where more parcels will have good access and visibility. The system of four intersections can handle more overall traffic than the double-left intersection it replaces, but importantly it feels like less traffic, because each intersection is small and each does in fact have less traffic than a single huge intersection.\nThis Town Center Intersection in San Marcos, CA shows how a system of four simple intersections replaces what would have emerged as a single huge intersection (16 popular corner parcels, as opposed to just 4). Even though this system can handle much more traffic than a single signal with double-lefts, the photo shows that it does so within an attractive and safe pedestrian context, creating the appearance of less traffic because there IS less traffic at each intersection.\nPavement width is much less; thus easier to cross\nSignal cycles are usually shorter with fewer conflicts; both faster and safer to cross\nPedestrians only need gaps in one direction; thus faster and safer if crossing without a signal.\nNarrow streets have better pedestrian enclosure.\nOne-ways do not require a left-turn lane, which means more space for other uses.\nDoubles parcels with high visibility & good access, for a larger Activity Center.\nSpeed control is easier. Move about as many vehicles at 30 mph as at 50.\nIf a two-way street is small enough (1-lane each dir), then a one-way street with two-lanes in one direction will have higher maximum speeds (since you can’t pass slower traffic on the two-way). But most stroads are 5 to 7-lane cross sections (2 or 3 lanes each direction). In these cases, maximum speeds have little to do with whether it is one-way or two-way, but average speed is definitely affected (drive slower, travel faster). Lane widths, on-street parking, stately trees (or lack thereof), signal spacing, speed limits, and the nature of the urban fabric have much more influence on maximum speed.\nCompared to large stroads, one-way streets with closely spaced signals can achieve perfect signal synchronization. While that may sound “fast and auto-oriented” because green-lights are good for autos, it actually means we can more easily achieve compliance with any desired speed limit. Want vehicles to travel 50 mph? Then make 12-ft lanes, no parking, and time lights to fall like dominoes at 50 mph. Want the same couplet street to be 30 mph? Go with 10-ft lanes, on-street parking, great street trees, paver cross-walks, and set the dominoes to fall at 30 mph.\nDrivers will then drive exactly 30 mph, because at 35 they reach the next signal while it’s still red, but at 30 they hit green right-on. Two-way streets can’t “fall like dominoes” so drivers almost always travel 5-10 mph faster than the posted speed limit as they see no reason not to. Many streets in Portland are timed for roughly 12 mph – and drivers comply because they see it is pointless to go faster. But convert those same streets to two-way, where signals can’t be timed for any discernible speed, and speeds will almost certainly increase.\nWith many one-way to two-way conversions, it is common to hear that business has improved. Everyone’s excited because there is more walking and biking, and renewed development interest. Since the conversion grabbed the headline, people assume one-ways were holding development back. But such conversions often include significant Complete Street beautification efforts, traffic calming, etc. It is a mistake to conclude that one-way vs. two-way was the change of greatest significance when multiple changes occur.\nIn places where a more commercial street needs additional traffic and a more residential street needs less, then conversion may in fact be an element of breathing the right kind of life back into the area. But in areas where you have visions of an ever-expanding Activity Center where commercial viability and multi-family livability on both streets is important, one-ways can support larger, more walkable centers than two-ways.\nYears ago I analyzed a Town Center system of four one-way intersections as a replacement for a single Stroad intersection. The image below is from Synchro, a common software used by traffic engineers. The two stroads are 7-lane arterials (see cross-sections below diagram). At the intersection there is a double-left, three through lanes, and a right-turn lane on each approach: Huge! I increased volumes until it reached Level of Service E, the failure point, which is about 1-minute of delay per vehicle. At that point there were 2,000 vehicles per hour entering the intersection from each direction, or 8000 total.\nThen I analyzed the couplet with the same three through-lanes, and a dedicated right and left (see cross section). In the couplet case, each intersection has 5,800 vehicles (rounded to 6,000). The sum of all four is 24,000, but really represents about 14,000 unique vehicles, as many use more than one intersection. But even at 14,000, which is 75% higher than the stroad intersection, these relatively small intersections are uncongested (Level of Service D).\nBut don’t conclude that 75% higher auto capacity proves couplets are auto-oriented. Consider this…\n- Walkable development is great, but it has to EXIST before there will be any pedestrians, bikers, or transit. And sorry, but in 21st Century American suburbia, the only way to get from strip-malls to the next-level of density is on the back of auto-accessibility.\n- Because the 4-intersection couplet can support almost twice as much traffic, it might support 3-4 times as much density (given a much higher share of walk, bike, & transit trips within higher density).\n- If you’re only planning for 8,000/hr anyway, then you don’t need as many lanes on the couplets as you’d need on the stroads, so it could be even tighter, or include on-street parking.\nHere’s another way to look at it. The cross section below represents the stroad in the previous analysis, where the intersection can serve 8,000 vehicles per hour. It’s huge! 121 feet for pedestrians to cross, intimidated by 10 lanes of traffic! With a road this huge, speeds naturally gravitate to 45-50 mph. There is no chance that a quality walkable environment can emerge here.\nBelow is what the couplet of the previous analysis would look like at each of the four intersections. Remember this system can support 14,000 vehicles per hour, 75% higher, and all of that at just 30 mph! But it is also vastly superior for pedestrians and mixed use development in spite of higher traffic. One caveat: if you allow on-street parking, then it couldn’t support 14,000, but it would still support much more than 8,000. Further, if you have additional connectivity in the area, you might downsize this couplet even more, to just two through-lanes per direction, or include on-street parking, and still support impressive densities without much congestion.\nThere is nothing inherently auto-oriented about one-way streets. Relative to large two-way stroads, they are not high speed unless designed that way, intentionally or unintentionally. They are more efficient at moving more vehicles with less delay, but just because something good has happened for cars need not define that something bad has happened for other modes. When all modes are doing well, there is no drag on a Center’s ability to expand.\nTraffic delay creates the feel of auto-oriented, because vehicles stacked up for blocks annoy everyone, and pressure engineers to “go rouge.” Couplets help vehicles keep moving even at low speeds.\n|Advantages of Couplets||Disadvantages|\n|Impressive vehicle capacity gains||Initial confusion for drivers|\n|Less pavement = Complete Street space||Out of direction travel (offset by less delay)|\n|Shorter signal cycles||Opposition if 2nd street has incompatible uses|\n|Safer for autos and pedestrians||Convenience stores may have initial loss.|\n|Enhances and motivates TOD||Transit boarding stop different than exit stop|\n|Little additional cost if planned from start||Risk of high-speed if designed poorly|\n|Expands grid, enabling larger activity center||Change affects many people (education effort)|\n|If synchronized, low speed limits observed||Unwarranted stigma to overcome.|\n|Narrow streets help pedestrian enclosure|\n|Proven: common feature of thriving Centers|\n|TownCenterIntersections.org has a collection of existing locations (not comprehensive), along with videos, articles, and other links.\nTop-10 Advantages of One-Way Couplets: A short pdf I wrote years ago, with similar points\nTop-10 Arguments Against One-Ways, Addressed: Rebuttals to common arguments against couplets.\nPlease Comment on Couplets, Triplets, and Town Center Intersections!

CCTV technology is now capable of recognising faces of people, vehicles, animals and bags automatically.\nIntegrated with CCTV video analytics, both facial and general recognition software systems are capable of counting, measuring speed and monitoring direction. For example, recognition systems can monitor the duration of time that people are present in a specific area or how long an unattended bag has been left. Some video analytics solutions are even capable of understanding colour.\nIntelligent video analytics software can recognise different behaviours and create an alarm on a user-defined rule, such as “person moving from vehicle to vehicle in a car park” or “large white vehicle parked in controlled zone”.\nIntelligent video can also improve the efficiency of control room operators, automate alarms for non-monitored systems, manoeuvre PTZ cameras to zoom into objects creating alarms and save time when searching CCTV recordings.\nClearView have a wealth of experience in intelligent video applications and can advise on how the power of analytics can best be utilised with cameras, encoders, recorders and security management systems, in both new and existing surveillance networks.\nCommon Video Analytics Applications are described below. Also see automatic number plate recognition for this specific analytics application.\nVideo analytics for perimeter detection\nAnalytics can create a virtual fence which generates an alarm if a vehicle, person or boat crosses a virtual tripwire. The system is capable of categorising objects and can determine their direction. It detects breaches to secure zones, unauthorised activity and movement in specific areas, perimeter intrusion, loitering in sensitive areas, person or vehicle tailgating.\nVideo analytics for people counting\nRetailers and visitor attractions require accurate visitor information as a key requirement for their business. ClearView’s people counting system not only counts the number of visitors to a specific location, but also provides statistics for new and return visitors, average visit duration and visit frequency.\nThe People Counter accurately counts the number of people moving through shops, schools, banks, sports and transport facilities, prisons, museums, visitor attractions, airports and car parks. This data is invaluable to organisations requiring key performance indicators such as footfall, customer to sales conversion ratios, marketing Cost per Thousand, and Shoppers per Square Metre (SSM) which can be measured in real-time. Analysis of these metrics can provide critical profit and efficiency information to the retailer.\nThe system uses standard CCTV cameras which can operate stand alone or be networked together to produce a map of visitor numbers across a shopping centre for a whole retail chain. People counting CCTV cameras connect to a standard central PC over an existing IP network.\nThe system accurately detects and records entries, exits, queues and waiting times allowing you to detect how long people spend in one place and how often that place was visited. This lets you test the effectiveness of new displays, compare one display with another, evaluate new store layouts, monitor queuing times and track people around a store.\nTo verify system accuracy, you can see marker lines flash when the system detects someone crossing the counting zone.\nDetect stopped vehicles and traffic obstacles, vehicle counting for traffic analysis, tailbacks, obstructions to traffic paths, vehicles travelling in the wrong direction, vehicles stopped in restricted zones and vehicle speed monitoring.\nLeft object detection\nUsed to alarm if an object (bag) is located in a public area for a prolonged period without its owner being present.

Birner\", \"Mathias Palme\", \"Anton Skart\", \"Theodor Schwarz\", and \"Pantarhei\") (16 May 1864 – 2 April 1937) was an Austrian writer and journalist, Jewish thinker and nationalist. His life had three main phases, representing a progression in his thinking: a Zionist phase (ca. 1883 – ca. 1900); a Jewish cultural autonomy phase (ca. 1900 – ca. 1914) which included the promotion of the Yiddish language; and religious phase (ca. 1914–1937) when he turned to Orthodox Judaism and became staunchly anti-Zionist.\nNathan Birnbaum was born in Vienna into an Eastern European Jewish family with roots in Austrian Galicia and Hungary. His father, Menachem Mendel Birnbaum, a merchant, hailed from Ropshitz, Galicia, and his mother, Miriam Birnbaum (née Seelenfreund), who was born in northern Hungary (in a region sometimes called the Carpathian Rus), of a family with illustrious rabbinic lineage, had moved as a child to Tarnow, Galicia, where the two met and married.\nFrom 1882 to 1886 Nathan Birnbaum studied law, philosophy and Near Eastern studies at the University of Vienna. In 1883, at the age of 19, he founded Kadimah, the first Jewish (Zionist) student association in Vienna, many years before Theodor Herzl became the leading spokesman of the Zionist movement. While still a student, he founded and published the periodical Selbstemanzipation!, often written in large part by Birnbaum himself. In it he coined the terms \"Zionistic\", \"Zionist\", \"Zionism\" (1890), and \"political Zionism\" (1892).\nBirnbaum played a prominent part in the First Zionist Congress (1897) where he was elected Secretary-General of the Zionist Organization. He was associated with and was one of the most important representatives of the cultural, rather than political, side of Zionism. However, he left the Zionist Organization not long after the Congress. He was unhappy with its negative view of Diaspora Jewry and the transformation of the Zionist ideals into a party machine.\nHis next phase was to advocate Jewish cultural autonomy, concentrating in particular on the Jews of eastern Europe. He advocated that the Jews be recognized as a people among the other peoples of the Austrian Empire, with Yiddish as their official language. To this end he ran (in Buczacz, eastern Galicia) on behalf of the Jews (and with the support of the local Ukrainians) as candidate for the Austrian parliament. Although gaining a majority of the votes, his election was thwarted by corruption of the electoral process by the local Polish faction.\nHe was chief convener of the Conference for the Yiddish Language held in Czernowitz, August 30 –September 3, 1908. This was the first Yiddish language conference ever to take place. At the conference he took the place of his colleague and fellow Yiddish activist Sholem Aleichem who was critically ill.\nFrom about 1912 onwards, Birnbaum became increasingly interested in Orthodox Judaism, and became a fully observant Orthodox Jew in about 1916. He continued particularly to act as advocate for the Jews of eastern Europe and the Yiddish language. From 1919 to 1922 he was General Secretary of the Agudas Yisroel, a widely spread and influential Orthodox Jewish organization. He founded the society of the \"Olim\" (Hebrew for the \"Ascenders\"), a society with a specific program of action dedicated to the spiritual ascent of the Jewish people.\nNathan Birnbaum, decrying political Zionism, 1919:\nAnd is it at all possible that we, who regard Judaism as our one and only treasure, should ever be able to compete with such expert demagogues and loud self-advertisers as they [the Zionists]? It is surely not necessary that we should. We are, after all, still the mountains and they the grain, and all we need to do is to gather all our forces in a world organization of religious Jews, and it will follow of itself, and without the application of any great political cunning on our part, that we shall have it in our power to prevent what must needs be prevented and to carry out what we have to carry out. But there is no need first to create this world organization of religious Jews. It is already in existence. The world knows its name, it is Agudas Yisroel [The Union of Israel].\nHe continued to write and lecture. His most well-known publication of this period of his life was \"Gottes Volk\", 1918 (German) – \"God's Folk\", 1921 (Yiddish)—translated into Hebrew as \"Am Hashem\" (1948\nLast years and legacy\nIn 1933, at the time of the Nazi rise to power, Birnbaum and his wife, together with their son Menachem (an artist) and family, who at that time were all living in Berlin, fled to Scheveningen, the Netherlands, with the help of businessman and diplomat Henri B. van Leeuwen (1888-1973). There Birnbaum, van Leeuwen, and banker Daniel Wolfe published the anti-Zionist newspaper Der Ruf (\"The Call\"). (Menachem and his family were murdered by the Nazis in 1944.) At the same time, their son Solomon (Professor of Yiddish and Hebrew paleography) and his family fled from Hamburg to England. Their other son Uriel (artist and poet) and his family fled from Vienna to the Netherlands in 1939. Van Leeuwen, also an Orthodox Jew, became a Dutch anti-Zionist leader and Bergen-Belsen survivor.\nNathan Birnbaum died in Scheveningen in 1937 after a period of severe illness.\n- \"In bondage to our fellow Jews\", 1919, from Nathan Birnbaum, Series of Essays on Agudas Yisroel, London, 1944, reproduced in Michael Selzer, editor, Zionism Reconsidered, Macmillan, London, 1970.\n- Selbstemanzipation!

{"question":"I'm working on a research paper about architectural preservation techniques throughout history. Could you explain how both ancient Roman buildings in Tivoli managed their structural preservation, and what modern facade retention methods teach us about maintaining historical architecture?","answer":"Ancient Roman buildings in Tivoli demonstrated preservation through adaptive reuse, as seen in the Temple of Vesta, which was converted into the church of S. Maria della Rotonda, and the Temple of Sibilla, which became St. George's church. The structures maintained their original facades while being repurposed for new functions. Modern facade retention techniques have evolved into a more sophisticated approach, offering a systematic methodology that includes detailed structural surveys, temporary support systems, and careful reconstruction processes. This modern approach allows for complete interior renovation while preserving the historical facade, providing both cost benefits and sustainability advantages through reduced waste generation and materials conservation. The technique requires high expertise to ensure proper integration of old and new structures, making it particularly valuable for preserving architectural heritage while meeting contemporary building standards.","context":["All images © by Roberto Piperno, owner of the domain. Write to firstname.lastname@example.org. Text edited by Rosamie Moore.\nPage revised in July 2012.\n- Tivoli - part one: the Roman town\nAccording to Virgil, Tibur (today's Tivoli) was one of the five most important towns of Latium prior to the foundation of Rome in 753 BC.\nHistorians believe that the name of the town meant either \"by the hill\", because Tivoli is situated on a hill commanding a view over the Roman countryside, or \"by the water\" because the town is near a series of waterfalls made by the Aniene River, which empties into the Tiber at Ponte Salaro.\nTibur fought against Rome, but eventually accepted peace conditions by which it retained a certain degree of self-administration. In 45 BC Julius Caesar granted full Roman citizenship to its inhabitants. It was the beginning of a prosperous period for the town during which many wealthy Romans spent the summer at Tibur and eventually Emperor Hadrian built a large villa three miles from the town.\nThe acropolis of ancient Tibur was located on an isolated rock opposite the waterfalls and in the Ist century AD the site was chosen for building two temples right on the edge of the precipice. During the late XVIIIth century Grand Tour travellers could not miss an excursion to Tivoli to see the ruins of these temples. They often commissioned their own portraits with the temples in the background (you may wish to see the portrait of Sir Windham Knatchbull Wynd by Pompeo Batoni - external link).\nThe ten surviving Corinthian columns of Tempio di Vesta are very fine and on top of them there is a nice frieze with festoons and bucrania. The dedication to Vesta, the Roman goddess of family and sacred fire, is not supported by evidence. The dedication was based on the fact that the Temple to Vesta in the Roman Forum was round (on the same grounds a temple near the Tiber was believed to be dedicated to Vesta). The temple at Tivoli was turned into S. Maria della Rotonda, a church having the same name of the Pantheon in Rome, another round temple.\nTempio della Sibilla and Tempio di Vesta form a complex similar to that of Tempio di Portuno and Tempio di Vesta near the Tiber. The dedication to Sibilla Tiburtina is not supported by evidence. There are few references to a Tiburtine Sibyl (seeress) in Classical authors, but during the Late Empire Christian writers claimed that the Tiburtine Sibyl prophesied the birth of Jesus Christ to Emperor Augustus. Another prophecy by this Sibyl, which is reported in medieval documents, describes the advent of a Final Emperor. It is very popular among those who build upon apocalyptic texts to support their religious beliefs. The temple at Tivoli was a church dedicated to St. George until 1884, when the ancient structures were freed from medieval additions.\nTempio della Tosse, most likely a Roman tomb, is located outside Porta del Colle near the ruins of a Roman villa which belonged to Maecenas, a friend of Emperor Augustus. The reference to Tosse (Coughing) is not fully explained. It was used as a church, but in the XVIIIth century it was abandoned and Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who had a penchant for picturesque ruins, depicted it in one of his etchings. The building still exists and it seems to be kept in the same poor state it was in the XVIIIth century.\nGiuseppe Vasi and Piranesi printed and sold their views of Rome in the same period, but they catered for slightly different customers. Vasi started first and with some approximation we can say he targeted a Roman Catholic customer with a large number of views dedicated to churches, monasteries and other religious buildings; besides the text accompanying his prints provided a lot of information about religious orders, lives of the martyrs, parishes, etc..\nPiranesi targeted foreign travellers and many of his views were dedicated to monuments of Ancient Rome: he was particularly fond of Tivoli. The image used as a background of this page shows a detail of Tempio di Vesta in an etching by Piranesi.\nDuring the Roman period Tivoli did not need walls, but in the Vth century AD when the Visigoths and the Vandals plundered Rome, the inhabitants of Tivoli restored the pre-Roman walls which protected the southern and western sides of the town (the other two had natural defences). A section of these walls is visible near the XIXth century Town Hall of Tivoli. Their construction technique is similar to that of the Mura Serviane, the Republican walls of Rome.\nThe entrance to the ancient town was marked by an imposing gate, built with travertine, the stone which was quarried near Tivoli and which was shipped to Rome via barges from Ponte Lucano. The gate is similar to the inner gate of Porta Tiburtina, the gate of Rome from which the road to Tivoli started.\nTivoli shows many examples of reuse of ancient Roman materials. A sarcophagus with the busts of a couple was reused by a wealthy XIIIth century inhabitant of Tivoli for his tomb in the cathedral. In the XVIIth century it was moved to a nearby square where it became part of a small public fountain (a very common end for ancient sarcophagi).\nColumns and capitals taken from ancient buildings can be seen at several locations in Tivoli. In most cases the diameter-to-height ratio of the columns was modified to fit the needs of the new buildings. In general the columns had a decorative purpose; in some instances, such as at Piazza Palatina, they indicated that the palace had asylum rights i.e. the guards could not arrest people inside the building. In other cases columns and capitals were used as construction material and their presence was discovered by chance.\nIn 1883 chance excavations near the Cathedral led to the identification of two Roman buildings: a temple to Augustus and a Mensa Ponderaria, the office where official measurement standards were kept. This has led archaeologists to believe that the XVIIth century Cathedral and the nearby medieval buildings stand on the site of the ancient Forum of the town.\nIn 1948 the opening of a modern road near Rocca Pia, the fortress of Tivoli, led to unearthing the ruins of an ancient amphitheatre dated IInd century AD. Inscriptions found at the site indicated the names of two donors: M. Tullius Blesus who paid for the inauguration ceremony and M. Lurius Lucretianus who paid for a venatio (slaying of beasts) and twenty gladiatorial fights (you may wish to see a mosaic found at Leptis Magna showing venationes and gladiatorial fights).\nExcerpts from Giuseppe Vasi 1761 Itinerary related to this page:\nOther pages on Tivoli:\nMedieval and Renaissance Tivoli\nVilla d'Este - the Palace\nVilla d'Este - the Gardens\nLatium was enlarged in the 1920s with territories from the neighbouring regions: the map on the left shows the current borders of Latium; the map on the right has links to pages covering towns of historical Latium: in order to see them you must hover and click on the dots.","Facade retention is a commonly used term in building construction, especially in urban areas where space is limited. It refers to the practice of preserving and incorporating the existing facade of a building into a new construction project. This technique has gained popularity in recent years due to its numerous advantages, both practical and aesthetic. In this article, we will explore what facade retention is and why it is a valuable method in the world of construction. From cost savings to historical preservation, understanding the benefits of facade retention can bring a new perspective to the ever-changing landscape of urban development.\nTable of Contents\nHistoric Buildings Redevelopment using Facade Retention\nHistoric buildings are an essential part of our cultural and architectural heritage. They tell a story of the past and reflect the craftsmanship and design of a bygone era. However, as cities grow and expand, the need for modern buildings increases and this often results in the demolition of historic structures. To preserve these buildings, many developers are now opting for a technique called “facade retention,” which involves keeping the front or exterior facade of a historic building while completely renovating or rebuilding its interior.\nFacade retention is a cost-effective and sustainable approach to redeveloping historic buildings because it offers both economic and environmental benefits. This method allows builders to retain the unique character and charm of the structure while creating more usable space for modern purposes.\nThe process of facade retention begins with a detailed survey of the existing building, including its structural integrity and the condition of the facade. The retained facade is then carefully dismantled with each element being cataloged and stored for later use. In some cases, the facade may need to be stabilized with temporary supports during the renovation process.\nAfter the facade has been secured, the interior of the building is demolished, leaving only the support structure intact. This structure is then used as the foundation for the new building, which is constructed within the space left by the old structure. The facade is then re-attached to the new building, and any missing or damaged elements are restored using the cataloged pieces.\nOne of the biggest advantages of facade retention is that it allows for the preservation of the historic façade while modernizing the building to comply with current building codes and regulations. This is especially important for buildings that are listed as historic landmarks or are located in historical districts where demolition is not permitted.\nAdditionally, facade retention helps to reduce construction waste, as only the interior of the building needs to be demolished. This is a more sustainable approach compared to completely demolishing and rebuilding a structure.\nIn terms of cost, facade retention can be more economical than building a new structure from scratch. The saved cost of materials and labor for building a new facade can offset the additional expenses involved in the preservation and restoration of the existing facade. Furthermore, since the exterior of the building is not being altered significantly, the overall construction time is reduced, leading to shorter project timelines and cost savings.\nHowever, facade retention does come with its own challenges. Builders must ensure that the old and new structures are properly integrated and that the restored elements match the original design. This requires a high level of expertise and attention to detail. Additionally, the building’s structural integrity must be carefully evaluated and addressed to ensure that it can support the new structure.\nIn conclusion, facade retention is an effective solution for redeveloping historic buildings. It allows for the preservation of important architectural landmarks while meeting the needs for modernization and development. With proper planning and execution, facade retention can breathe new life into old structures, maintaining their historic value and contributing to the overall aesthetic of a city. As a civil engineer, it is our responsibility to promote and implement sustainable and cost-effective solutions like facade retention to preserve our rich architectural heritage for future generations.\nWhat is Facade Retention\nFacade retention is a construction technique used to preserve the external facade or face of a building during renovation or redevelopment projects. It involves the temporary support and stabilization of the existing structure while the internal structure is dismantled and rebuilt or renovated.\nThe need for facade retention arises when a building’s facade holds a significant historical, cultural, or architectural value and needs to be preserved. It can also be necessary when the structural integrity of the facade is compromised due to aging, deterioration, or damage.\nThe facade retention process typically involves four main steps: survey and assessment, structural design and support, temporary works installation, and facade reconstruction.\nSurvey and Assessment: Before any work can begin, a detailed survey and assessment of the building’s facade is carried out. This includes a thorough examination of the external structure, materials, and condition. It also involves identifying any areas of weakness or deterioration that could potentially impact the facade retention process.\nStructural Design and Support: Based on the survey and assessment, a team of structural engineers and architects will design a support system to hold the facade in place during the renovation or redevelopment works. This involves determining the type of support needed, such as scaffolding, trusses, or cantilever beams, and the load capacity required to hold the facade securely.\nTemporary Works Installation: Once the design is finalized, temporary supports are installed to hold the facade in place. This could involve attaching beams, brackets, or hydraulic jacks to the facade and anchoring them to the ground or nearby structures. The temporary works are carefully planned and installed to minimize any potential impact on the existing structure.\nFacade Reconstruction: After the facade is supported and stabilized, the internal structure can be safely dismantled, and the renovation or construction work can begin. Once completed, the facade is reconstructed using the same or similar materials, maintaining its original appearance and heritage value.\nFacade retention is a challenging and delicate process that requires a high level of expertise and precision. It is crucial to ensure the safety of workers and the public while preserving the facade’s integrity. Therefore, it is essential to hire experienced and licensed professionals for facade retention projects.\nIn conclusion, facade retention is a vital technique for preserving the architectural and historical significance of buildings while allowing for modernization and renovation. By carefully planning and implementing this process, developers and engineers can ensure the preservation of a building’s exterior while transforming its interior to meet modern needs.\nFacade Retention and Low Key Rehabilitation\nFacade retention and low key rehabilitation are two commonly used methods in the construction and renovation of buildings. These techniques are often employed when a building’s exterior or facade has significant historical, cultural, or architectural value that must be preserved, while the interior undergoes major reconstruction or renovation.\nFacade retention is the process of preserving an existing building’s exterior facade while demolishing and rebuilding the interior. This approach is typically chosen when the exterior has significant heritage or aesthetic value, and its demolition would negatively impact the character or historic significance of the building.\nThe facade retention process involves carefully removing and propping up the facade, often using steel frames or brackets, while the interior is demolished and rebuilt. This method requires careful coordination between the design team, engineers, and contractors to ensure the stability and safety of the retained facade throughout the construction process. Once the interior is reconstructed, the facade is reattached and restored to its original or improved condition.\nFacade retention is a cost-effective and sustainable solution, as it preserves the embodied energy and materials of the existing building. It also allows for flexibility in the redesign of the building’s interior, without compromising its exterior appearance.\nLow key rehabilitation, also known as exterior restoration, is a similar method to facade retention in that it preserves and repairs the existing facade of a building. This approach is commonly used for buildings with significant historical or architectural value, where major reconstruction or demolition is not necessary.\nLow key rehabilitation involves cleaning, repairing, and restoring the exterior facade to its original condition. This may include repairing or replacing damaged masonry, restoring decorative elements, and repainting or cleaning the facade. The goal is to retain the building’s historical and aesthetic integrity while also improving its durability and functionality.\nSimilar to facade retention, low key rehabilitation is a sustainable approach as it minimizes the use of new materials and maintains the building’s original character. It also preserves the building’s cultural and historical significance, contributing to the overall heritage and identity of a city or community.\nBoth facade retention and low key rehabilitation require careful planning and expertise to ensure the successful preservation of a building’s exterior. As a civil engineer, it is essential to understand these techniques and their implementation to ensure the structural integrity and safety of a building throughout the construction process. By utilizing these methods, we can protect and enhance the character and value of our built environment for future generations.\nAdvantages of Facade Retention in Building Construction\nFacade retention is a construction method that involves preserving and incorporating the existing facade of a building into a new structure. It is commonly used in building construction when the existing building’s facade holds historical, architectural, or cultural significance. This technique is gaining popularity in the construction industry due to several advantages it offers. In this article, we will discuss the advantages of facade retention in building construction.\n1. Preserves the Historical and Architectural Significance\nThe facade of a building is often an integral part of its historical and architectural value. By using the facade retention technique, the original character and charm of the building can be maintained, even if the interior structure is completely renovated or replaced. This is particularly important in cities and towns with a rich architectural heritage, where the preservation of historic buildings is crucial.\n2. Reduces Environmental Impact\nFacade retention is a sustainable construction method as it minimizes the environmental impact of new developments. By preserving the existing facade, there is less waste generated during the construction process, and less energy is consumed in the production of new materials. This helps in reducing the overall carbon footprint of the new building.\nFacade retention is a cost-effective option compared to completely demolishing and rebuilding a new structure. It eliminates the need to construct a new facade, which can be quite expensive, especially if the building has intricate architectural detailing. Facade retention can save up to 60% of the cost of a new facade, making it a more financially feasible option for building owners.\n4. Enables Construction in Limited Space\nIn urban areas, where space is limited, facade retention enables new construction within the existing building footprint. This method allows for the creation of new usable space without the need for additional land. It is particularly beneficial in densely populated cities where land is scarce.\n5. Shorter Construction Time\nThe facade retention technique can significantly reduce the construction time of a new building. As the existing facade is preserved, there is no need to demolish and rebuild the entire structure, saving time and effort. This is especially beneficial for commercial or residential buildings, where timely completion is critical.\n6. Safe for Surrounding Structures\nUnlike traditional demolition, facade retention ensures that the neighboring buildings are not affected by the construction process. The existing facade acts as a protective shield during the construction, reducing the risk of damage to adjacent structures. This is essential in urban areas where buildings are close to each other.\n7. Flexibility in Design\nWith facade retention, there is room for creativity and flexibility in the design of the new building. The preserved facade can be incorporated into the new structure in various ways, creating unique and aesthetically pleasing buildings. It allows for the preservation of architectural features while also incorporating modern elements.\nIn conclusion, facade retention is a construction method that offers many benefits, including preservation of historical and architectural value, sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility in design. It is a technique that allows for the construction of new, modern buildings while preserving the charm and character of the past. With the increasing need for sustainable construction practices and the desire to preserve our architectural heritage, facade retention is becoming an increasingly popular choice in building construction.\nIn conclusion, facade retention is an essential technique in building construction that allows for the preservation of a building’s historical or desirable facade while undergoing major renovations or construction. This method offers many advantages, including cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and preserving the architectural heritage of a building. It also allows for flexibility in design and construction, minimizing disruption to the surrounding area.

{"question":"How does soy supplementation affect abdominal fat in postmenopausal women according to clinical trials?","answer":"According to a double-blinded controlled trial, women given soy supplementation experienced a 7.5 percent reduction in abdominal fat, while the placebo group gained 9 percent more abdominal fat. The effects varied by race - Caucasians primarily lost visceral fat, while African Americans primarily lost total body fat.","context":["Body weight is one of the most basic issues of human life. Self-esteem, acceptance among peers– and perhaps lifelong success or failure—are, unfortunately, all tied to our physical appearance. Medically speaking, not all overweight people are obese. Obesity is defined as weight that exceeds 15 percent of normal weight for height and body type. “Morbid” obesity exceeds 20 percent of optimum weight. An obese or overweight person is at high risk for a number of serious health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, varicose veins, dementia, psychological stress, depression, osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, and diabetes. The detrimental health effects of obesity are more than just a matter of weighing too much. Body composition–the amount of fat in the body compared to the amount of lean muscle–is also important. Body mass index (BMI) is associated with overall mortality.\nSoy Isoflavones are a dietary supplement derived from soybeans containing phytoestrogens. These weak estrogens are chemically similar in structure to naturally produced estrogen hormones. Isoflavones are found in soy foods both with and without a sugar molecule attached. The two primary isoflavones in soybeans are daidzein and genistein and their respective glucosides, genistein and daidzein. Soy foods typically contain more genistein than daidzein, although this ratio varies among the different soy products. In cultures where soy products are consumed in abundance, women’s health problems, certain cancers, and cardiovascular disease are reported to be less prevalent.\nA double-blinded controlled trial was performed to determine the effect of soy supplementation on abdominal fat, glucose metabolism and circulating inflammatory markers. Researchers recruited 39 obese postmenopausal women to take a soy supplement which contained 20 grams of soy protein and 160 milligrams of soy isoflavones or a casein placebo without isoflavones. Thirty-three women completed the study and were analyzed at baseline and at 3 months. The results were women given soy supplementation experienced a 7.5 percent reduction in abdominal fat, compared to 9 percent more abdominal fat in the placebo group. No differences were observed between the two groups for glucose metabolism, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leptin or adiponectin. The authors of this study also reported that Caucasians primarily lost visceral fat (fat surrounding the organs in the abdominal cavity) while African Americans primarily lost total body fat. In conclusion, soy supplementation was found to reduce abdominal fat in obese postmenopausal women.1\nSource: American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology\n1 Christie DR, Grant J, Darnell BE, et al.

Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2010.\nA new study finds that the isoflavone in soybeans can prevent a second stroke in individuals suffering from cerebrovascular events. According to the study published in The European Heart Journal, isoflavone reverses endothelial dysfunction in stroke sufferers.\nSimilar to cholesterol-lowering drugs, the chemical, also known as a phytoestrogen due to its estrogen-like effects, can improve the arterial blood flow in patients with a positive stroke history. Previous studies had reported that soy-rich diets can lower blood cholesterol levels and help prevent breast and prostate cancers. Isoflavones are also effective in lowering the risk of arteriosclerosis and other cardiovascular events.\nUniversity of Hong Kong scientists concluded that taking isoflavone dietary supplements can help reduce the risk of future strokes or cardiovascular events in stroke patients.\nA new study suggests that soy supplements can help postmenopausal women shed off pounds, in addition to various health benefits reported.\nPrevious studies had reported that the high estrogen content in soy-rich products can help women during and after menopause in various aspects ranging from treating hot flashes to reducing heart attack risk factors like high cholesterol.\nAccording to the study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, women following a diet rich in soy supplements have less abdominal fat in more precise computerized tomography (CT) scans. The efficacy of the diet, however, varies in different races. While adopting such a diet helps white women lose more visceral and abdominal fat, the use of soy supplements is associated with considerable reductions in the overall body fat in black women. Compared to white women, black women are also reported to lose more weight during the same time, the study found. Scientists, however, stressed that postmenopausal women should not start taking soy supplements just for the sake of controlling body composition or body weight.\nSource: Press TV\n(Via: Natural News) Dr. Daniel G. Clark, author of Colostrum, Life’s First Food states: ” … bovine colostrum rebuilds the immune system, destroys viruses, bacteria, and fungi, accelerates healing of all body tissue, helps lose weight, burn fat, increase bone and lean muscle mass and slows down and even reverses aging.” Colostrum is in the milk that any mammal produces just before giving birth. It becomes part of the mother’s first food for the newborn to provide defenses against pathogens and to stimulate growth. After a short time, this wondrous substance that supports rapid growth and disease prevention is no longer in the milk.\nBovine colostrum is gathered from cows’ whole raw milk, usually within eight hours of a calf’s birth – and not just from any cows. Factory dairies are not appropriate as colostrum supplement sources. It’s important to exclude rBGH and antibiotics. Only cows without added hormones and antibiotics that graze on grass or non-GMO alfalfa in open pastures should be used for colostrum supplements.\nGlutathione Is Provided by Colostrum\nGlutathione, or GSH, is considered the ultimate antioxidant. But it cannot be supplemented orally because it gets disassembled in the gut before it can get into cells where it belongs. It has to be manufactured internally, mostly by the liver. People with serious debilitating diseases, including cancer and AIDS, usually have low glutathione levels.\nGSH regulates other antioxidants and triggers the immune system response with lymphocytes, or T and B white blood cells to counterattack pathogenic invaders in our bodies. Glutathione is composed from three amino acid precursors – glycine, glutamic acid and cysteine. Cysteine is the missing link rarely found in our food.\nCysteine can be toxic in the gut, but cystine, which is two bound cysteine molecules, is abundantly present in colostrum, and it passes through the digestive system for the cells to break it down into two cysteine molecules. Yes, colostrum has these three amino acids raring to produce GSH for you!\nIt appears there are information feuds festering a bit between colostrum providers and whey based GSH precursor providers, each claiming their product outperforms the other. But research has shown no significant difference between properly processed colostrum and whey for glutathione production.\nColostrum outperforms whey in other areas to offer a complete package. Anti-aging depends more on certain hormones that diminish as we grow older. Enter the coveted growth hormones and growth factor isolates. A small amount of Growth Hormone (GH) is available. Since it’s very potent, a small amount is good enough to have an impact.\nIn addition, there are five Growth Factors (GFs) attached: Platelet derived GF, insulin-like GF, transforming GF, epithelial GF, and fibroblast GF. Maintaining an adequate supply of Growth Hormone and associated factors promotes cellular growth and minimizes cellular destruction. Thus healing is promoted more quickly. Anti-aging factors beyond glutathione are very high in colostrum.\nImmune System Enhancement\nWith colostrum you get glutathione plus other immunity factors. Remember, this is first food for just born mammals. They need all the immunity they can get.\nImmunoglobulins found in colostrum destroy bacteria and neutralize microbes and toxins in the lymph and circulatory system. Lactoferrin, a protein in colostrum, is antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory.\nProline-Rich Polypeptide (PRP) in colostrum is a hormone essential to the thymus gland, which regulates the immune system up or down as needed.\nMake sure the colostrum is complete with fats, and is taken from properly raised cows shortly after giving birth. In addition to matching whey’s ability for providing glutathione production, colostrum offers even more anti-aging potential and rebuilds your immune system.\nA new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that consumption of soy, fruits, and vegetables helps reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. Postmenopausal women who consumed plenty of soy, fruits, and vegetables had a 30 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer, compared with those who consumed relatively little of these foods. The research was based on 34,028 women in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. The longer the women had consumed these healthful foods, the less chance they had of developing breast cancer.\nButler LM, Wu AH, Wang R, Koh WP, Yuan JM, Yu MC.

The literature review indicates that soy does not decrease testosterone levels.\nLed by Jill M. Hamilton-Reeves, PhD, RD, of St. Catherine’s University, St. Paul, Minnesota, researchers assessed the effects of soy protein and soy isoflavones on measurements of male reproductive hormones. Findings, just published online in Fertility and Sterility, a publication of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, demonstrate no significant effect of soy protein or soy isoflavone intake on circulating levels of testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin or free testosterone in men.\nThe comprehensive meta-analysis examined the existing scientific literature including all clinical studies examining soy’s effect on male reproductive hormones published before July 1, 2008. Fifteen placebo-controlled treatment groups with baseline and ending measures were analyzed. Thirty-two reports involving 36 treatment groups were also assessed in simpler statistical models. Studies published after July 1, 2008, which were not included in the meta-analysis, support the conclusions of the meta-analysis.\nReproductive endocrinologist William R. Phipps, MD, of the University of Rochester Medical Center, a co-author of the analysis stated, “As a high-quality source of protein that is relatively low in saturated fat, soy can be an important part of a heart-healthy diet and may contribute to a decreased risk of coronary heart disease.” He noted that some men have been reluctant to consume soyfoods due to concerns about estrogen-like effects of soy isoflavones, often referred to as phytoestrogens. But according to Phipps, “it is important for the public to understand that there is no clinical evidence to support these ideas. After conducting a comprehensive review of the existing literature, we found no indication that soy significantly alters male sex hormone levels.”\nMen can benefit from soyfood consumption as a means to meet daily protein requirements and at the same time possibly also reducing their risk of heart disease.\nCiting the research study, Lisa Kelly, MPH, RD, of the United Soybean Board, added,\n“Soy is often praised for the positive role it can play in the diets of women. But, years of clinical research have shown that men stand to benefit from soy, too. I encourage men to incorporate soyfoods into a balanced and varied diet and talk to their healthcare provider about their own unique nutritional needs.”\nSOURCE: United Soybean Board"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:79053b19-c9f7-4334-be60-b780121650ff>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare how Howardena Pindell and Kim Lim explored different artistic mediums in their work? I'm particularly interested in their approaches to multiple art forms.","answer":"Both artists worked across different mediums in complementary ways. Howardena Pindell developed an abstract methodology using grids of punched-out circles with acrylic paint, and she would intentionally create drawings to destroy and reassemble them three-dimensionally using thread. Kim Lim similarly explored the relationship between different mediums, specifically sculpture and printmaking. She would develop forms, textures and ideas through printing that she would then continue to explore in wood carving, and conversely, ideas from her sculpture would inform new directions in her printmaking.","context":["Shows & Exhibitions\n‘I’m Staying Away From Trump as Subject Matter’: American Artist Howardena Pindell on How She Balances Her Abstract and Political Work\nAs her first solo show in London opens, the pioneering artist says she's glad the US president isn't interested in culture.\nThe American artist Howardena Pindell arrived in London for her first solo show in the UK just as the 45th US President landed for a state visit. A veteran activist and co-founder of New York’s pioneering feminist gallery collective A.I.R., Pindell tells artnet News that while her work is often political, Donald Trump will never appear in her art. “I don’t want him to engage me,” she says.\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1943, Pindell studied painting at Boston University and Yale. In 1967, she became one of the first black women to join the curatorial staff of New York’s Museum of Modern Art. During the 12 years she worked at the museum, she continued making art, developing an abstract methodology based on grids of punched-out circles through which she applied acrylic paint to build up shimmering surfaces of color on a shifting grid.\nPindell stepped down from MoMA in 1979, shortly after protesting the use of racist language in an exhibition at New York’s Artists Space. The same year, she suffered a near-fatal car accident: the experience cemented her sense that it was urgent to use her voice to make work and speak out. Her video Free, White, and 21 (1980) presented her experiences of overt and systemic racism, and the dismissive responses she had received from white colleagues.\nPindell, who has taught at the Stony Brook University in New York since 1979, continues to make both abstract and issue-led work. Last year, she was the subject of the major touring retrospective “Howardena Pindell: What Remains to Be Seen,” organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. We spoke to the artist about the evolution of her work, her plans for her legacy, and her distaste for Trump on the occasion of her first solo exhibition in London, which opens this week at Victoria Miro Gallery.\nA lot of us in Europe are better acquainted with your issue-led work and your activism. What’s the relation between that and your abstract work?\nI try to do it to balance out what I’m doing, because doing the research on the issue-related work can be very frightening and very upsetting. So I do both at the same time. The next video I’m doing is about lynching, the civil rights era, and slavery, and I will be the voice. The material is really upsetting, so at the same time, I’m working on the abstract [painting].\nI see Free, White and 21 getting shared a lot by students. Do you feel the issues that you were discussing in 1980 are still very relevant to your students?\nMy students aren’t necessarily aware of the video. I basically teach painting. Where it comes into the classroom is other professors show it: the art historians. Occasionally it’s shown around New York City. For a while, it was on YouTube and then my distributor took it off. I don’t mix my politics in with my teaching. I mean a lot of people are very upset about Trump: it’s almost like an unspoken sadness.\nThe opening of your exhibition here, of course, coincides with Trump’s state visit.\nI’m glad he’s not interested in culture. He has not made any forays into the cultural world, whereas Hitler was an artist, and if you did not live up to his standards for Nazi art you were considered degenerate.\nTrump has put artists who are politically engaged in a very particular position: it’s given them a really urgent role.\nI’m staying away from Trump as subject matter, because I don’t want him to engage me. I don’t want anything to do with him, but I’m empathetic with others who feel very afraid of where we’re headed with him, especially if he gets a second term.\nWhat did you decide to include in your first London show?\nVictoria [Miro] and Garth [of Garth Greenan Gallery, Pindell’s New York dealer] chose to show early work from the 1970s, and then later work on paper, where the circle has migrated from the canvas to actual punched large circles.\nDo you make works with the express intention of punching them out for assemblages or do you re-use older works?\nNo, I make drawings intentionally to destroy them. That’s not true of my earlier work where I made drawings that stood on their own merit. Now the drawings I do are very abstract and playful: I destroy them and re-assemble them in a three-dimensional way. I use thread also. It’s all about playing.\nThe thread relates to your interest in the grid, which comes right from your earliest abstract work.\nThe early interest in the grids was kind of sarcastic, because everyone was interested in structuralism, the golden mean, and the grid and so forth. In a form of rebellion I made a portable grid: literally a grid held together by big grommets. I enjoyed working on graph paper, but I think the early influence in that was my father, who was a mathematician. I remember seeing him write numbers in a journal that had a grid: he liked to record his mileage. I was a child. They didn’t mean anything to me. I saw numbers as functional, but also I saw them as beauty.\nYou’ve also made serial works using numbers.\nSome people would almost think of them as conceptual. I literally saved all the holes I had punched for the paintings that are in the show. An art dealer had come to see my studio and blindly said, “How many circles on the painting?” I started to count them. I had bags of these circles. I would collect them and then I would get graph paper and use matte medium and attach the dots on the graph paper sequentially. Sometimes, depending on the density of the numbers, they would cluster and create shapes or forms.\nThat also happens with the early paintings you’ve done through stencils: in places it feels like there’s pointillist form emerging as well.\nThat’s interesting. Yes, when I worked at the Museum of Modern Art I was very interested in pointillism but I also found inspiration with the color in [Odilon] Redon: in his pastels of flowers, the color was so beautiful. I was really trained as a figurative painter, as an academic painter. Then I made this break into using the circle. I started making drawings on graph paper and spraying the drawings with acrylic.\nWhen your retrospective opened last year, MCA Chicago put a lot of your writing online as an open archive. Are you working toward making more available to view through a foundation or archive?\nAt the Smithsonian my papers will be in the Archives of American Art. That’s already been decided, and Garth [Greenan] will be my art executor. What I’m aiming for is to have a philanthropic foundation, so as [work] sells, [grants] will go out to different charities after I’m gone.\nHow did you feel about that show at the MCA Chicago?\nI was stunned when I saw it. Thirty years ago, I’d probably be very ecstatic, but now I’m more stunned, because I’m old. I’ve had so many different kinds of responses to my work.\nDo you still? Or do you feel that time is catching up with you?\nEvery now and then, maybe there’s a pop or squeak, but it’s interesting to see work that was put down 30, 40 years ago, that now people are able to tolerate and see.\nWhat do you think’s changed?\nI have no idea. The work’s still the same. Maybe the eyes are different? Maybe just the way things have changed has made them different?\n“Howardena Pindell” is on view from June 5 through July 27 at Victoria Miro in Mayfair, London, 16 St George Street, W1S 1FE.\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:\nWant to stay ahead of the art world?

Rothko and Turner is a new route opening to celebrate 50 years since Mark Rothko first gave Tate his iconic Seagram Murals to join the fearless and atmospheric paintings he so admired by JMW Turner. The route through British Art 1540-1920 now includes a new room devoted to weird and wonderful artworks about fairies from the past 200 years including Mat Collishaw‘s magical three-dimensional animation Garden of Unearthly Delights 2009, as well as displays focusing on Gwen John, Stanley Spencer and the Vorticists. British Art 1930-Now has also been expanded with a new display about Kim Lim, including works which have never been seen before, as well as a room of ground-breaking sculptures from the 1980s. All three routes also include access to Tate Archive’s 50th anniversary display, telling stories of new beginnings, historic moments and personal histories. From sketchbooks and drawings to unpublished photographs and letters, visitors can discover a host of treasures from the world’s largest archive of British art, including Vanessa Bell, John Constable, Lubaina Himid, Derek Jarman, L.S. Lowry, Ronald Moody, Marlow Moss, Donald Rodney and Jo Spence amongst many others.\nRothko’s Seagram Murals 1958-9 were originally commissioned as a series of mural-scaled paintings for the fashionable Four Seasons restaurant in New York’s Seagram building. The artist eventually decided to give the paintings to Tate instead, in the hope that they would be seen near the Turner Bequest, Tate’s unparalleled collection of work by British landscape painter JMW Turner. 50 years later, these two artists can now be seen together as part of Tate Britain’s new Rothko and Turner collection route, reflecting the ongoing relationship between British historic art and international modern art. The route begins with the powerful Seagram Mural paintings, before showcasing highlights from throughout JMW Turner’s career. This display also coincides with a landmark exhibition opening at Tate Britain later this month – Turner’s Modern World – which will reveal how Britain’s greatest landscape painter captured technology’s impact on the natural world and the dizzying effects of modernisation on society.\nBRITISH ART 1540 – 1930\nThis route through British art history from the Tudors to the First World War has been expanded with five new displays. One room focuses on the fascinating tradition of “fairy painting” in Britain, a craze sparked in the late 18th century by Romanticism’s fascination with nature and the imagination. This display looks at the way artists used images of fairies to explore tensions between the natural and the supernatural, beginning with William Blake and Richard Dadd and culminating in Mat Collishaw’s Garden of Unearthly Delights 2009. Other contemporary responses to historic art can also be seen in a nearby display of work by Pablo Bronstein and his art school tutor Edward Allington. Both artists in very different ways use the formal language of architecture to engage with history, exploring the clash of traditions and philosophies between classical forms and contemporary realities. Three other new rooms focus on particular artists or movements. One brings together 13 works by Gwen John (1876-1939), best known for her subtle portraits of women – apparently serene paintings which in fact visualise her intense artistic engagement with the sitters and the wider art world. Another room includes highlights from Tate’s extensive collection of Stanley Spencer’s (1891-1959) work, from early self-portraits to later compositions imagining his home village as a location for religious miracles. The Vorticists, a dynamic art movement that emerged in 1914 as Europe descended into war, is also the subject of a new display of works by Wyndham Lewis, William Roberts, Edward Wadsworth, Jessica Dismorr, Helen Saunders, Jacob Epstein and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.\nBRITISH ART 1930-NOW\nTwo new rooms join Tate Britain’s route through modern and contemporary British art. The first explores the relationship between sculpture and printmaking in Kim Lim‘s (1936-97) early work. Born in Singapore, Lim moved to England in 1954 to study art. She explored forms, textures and ideas through printing that she continued to develop in the slower process of wood carving. Likewise, ideas that first appeared in her sculpture informed new explorations in her printmaking. The display also includes a selection of never before seen works such as Split Red 1960 and Sphinx 1960. Another room features a mixture of sculptures and drawings from the 1980s by Shelagh Cluett, Richard Deacon, Anish Kapoor and Alison Wilding, artists who emerged at a moment when methods for making sculpture were being radically rethought. Their works share a focus on the physical construction of art, highlighting materiality, mass and volume in their work."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38310c21-854b-43a9-8e17-de537b609a65>","<urn:uuid:3955e50a-65a3-44b7-ae4f-6b52a651b6d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Qué diferencia hay entre los dos tipos de núcleos galácticos activos? ¡Me tiene intrigado! 😊","answer":"There are two types of active galactic nuclei: ones where we can directly view matter spiraling into the black hole at thousands of times the speed of sound, and others where the inner regions are obscured by dust and we only see more slowly moving gas farther from the black hole. The difference appears to be related to viewing angle - face-on nuclei allow direct observation of the hot gas, while tilted nuclei are blocked by dust.","context":["Members of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of the Lomonosov Moscow State University have been studying changes in the appearance of emission from around the supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy known to astronomers as NGC 2617. The centre of this galaxy, underwent dramatic changes in its appearance several years ago: it became much brighter and things that had not been seen before were seen. This sort of dramatic change can give us valuable information for understanding what the surroundings of a giant black hole are like and what is going on near the black hole. The results of these investigations have been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, one of the world's top-rated astronomical journals.\nMost galaxies such as our own have a giant black hole in their central nuclei. These monstrous holes have masses ranging from a million to a billion times the mass of our sun. The black hole in our galaxy is inactive, but in some galaxies, the black hole is swallowing gas that is spiralling into it and emitting enormous amounts of radiation. These galaxies are called \"active galactic nuclei\" or AGNs for short. The energy output from around the black holes of these AGNs can exceed that of the hundreds of billions of stars in the rest of the galaxy. Just how these galaxies get their supermassive black holes is a major mystery.\nThe nuclei of galaxies where the supermassive black holes are vigorously swallowing gas are classified into two types: those where we get a direct view of the matter spiralling into the black hole at a speed that is thousands of times faster than the speed of sound, and those where the inner regions are obscured by dust and we only see more slowly moving gas much further from the black hole.\nFor decades astronomers have wondered why we see the innermost regions of some active galactic nuclei but not others. A popular explanation of the two types of active galactic nuclei is that they are really the same but they appear to be different to us because we are viewing them from different angles. If they are face-on we can see the hot gas spiralling into the black hole directly. If the active galactic nucleus is tilted, then dust around the nucleus blocks our view and we can only see the more slowly moving gas a light year or more away.\nThe leader of the international research team involved in the investigation, Viktor Oknyansky, a Senior Researcher at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of the Lomonosov Moscow State University says: \"Cases of object transition from one type to the other turn out to be a definite problem for this orientation model. In 1984 we found a change in the appearance of another active galactic nucleus known as NGC 4151. It was one of few known cases of this kind in the past. We now know of several dozen active galactic nuclei that have changed their type. In our recent study we have focused on one of the best cases -- NGC 2617.\"\nOknyansky continues: \"In 2013 a team of researchers in the US found that NGC 2617 had changed being an active galaxy where the inner regions were hidden to one where the inner regions were now exposed. We didn't not know how long it would remain in this new unveiled state. It could last for only a short period of time or, on the other hand, for dozens of years. The title of the paper by the US astronomers was \"The man behind the curtain...\" When we began our study we didn't know how long the curtain would remain open, but we've titled our paper \"The curtain remains open...\", because we are continuing to see into the inner regions of NGC 2617.\nAccording to the authors there is no accepted explanation so far of what could cause us to start seeing down to the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus when it was previously hidden.\nViktor Oknyansky comments: \"It's clear that this phenomenon isn't very rare, on the contrary, we think it's quite typical. We consider various possible explanations. One is that perhaps a star has come too close to the black hole and has been torn apart. However, the disruption of a star by a black hole is very rare and we don't think that such events can explain the observed frequency of type changes of active galactic nuclei. Instead we favour a model where the black hole has started swallowing gas more rapidly. As the material spirals in towards the black holes it emits strong radiation. We speculate that this intense radiation destroys some of the dust surrounding the nucleus and permits us to see the inner regions.\"\nOknyansky continues: \"Study of these rapid changes of type is very important for understanding what is going on around supermassive black holes that are rapidly swallowing gas. So, what we have concentrated on is getting observations of the various types of radiation emitted by NGC 2617.

{"question":"I work in special education and I'm curious about the diagnostic processes for ADHD versus dyslexia. Could you compare how these two conditions are identified and diagnosed in children?","answer":"ADHD and dyslexia have distinct diagnostic processes. ADHD doesn't have a specific test for diagnosis - instead, it requires observing a persistent pattern of behavior across all environments (home, school, and play). The diagnosis involves behavioral checklists completed by various people like teachers, parents, and other adult leaders, and the symptoms must have begun before age 12. In contrast, dyslexia is identified through a formal evaluation process that specifically examines a person's ability to understand and use spoken and written language. This evaluation looks at reading-related skills, including strengths and weaknesses, and takes into account multiple factors such as family history, intellect, educational background, and social environment. While both conditions may involve educational testing, ADHD diagnosis focuses more on behavioral patterns and functionality across settings, while dyslexia diagnosis centers on specific language and reading processing abilities.","context":["ADHD is a common condition, but is often misunderstood. Currently, it’s believed 9% of children ages 3-17 and 2-4% of adults have ADHD. ADHD is an acronym for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which means that the part of the brain that controls attention and prioritizing what a person pays attention to doesn’t develop like others’.\nADHD can involve symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity. Some people may have one or two symptoms, while others may have all. Years ago, there was a term called ADD. That diagnosis actually was ended in 1992 and replaced with ADHD – inattentive, ADHD – hyperactive, or ADHD combined.\nThere is not a specific test that diagnoses ADHD. It is diagnosed after observing a persistent pattern of behavior in all environments. For example, a child diagnosed with ADHD must be having similar issues at home, play and school. ADHD always begins in childhood. Adults can have it, and sometimes people aren’t even diagnosed until they are adults, but it always begins before the age of 12. This is important to note, because sometimes similar symptoms that present themselves in adolescence or adulthood may look like ADHD, but if they weren’t there when the person was a child, it’s not ADHD.\nAlthough testing isn’t required for the ADHD diagnosis, it can be done. It is important to match the information in the test to what is being seen in real life. Symptoms behavioral checklists that are done by different people such as a teacher, a parent, a coach or scout leader gives information about how someone is functioning. That may be more valuable than a specific test. Sometimes there is a question on what someone’s IQ is. It is difficult to be attentive to something when the information is beyond one’s level to comprehend. If testing shows IQ deficits or learning disabilities then addressing these issues may be what is needed rather than treatment for ADHD.\nI diagnose ADHD and also help treat the condition. In my role at Deaconess Cross Pointe, I specialize in the care of children and adolescents with psychiatric and mental health needs. So, I see a lot of kids with ADHD.\nKids with ADHD that are coming to a professional for assessment are probably having trouble with school work, struggling with social skills (making/keeping friends), or may be having some behavioral issues causing them to get in trouble because “they aren’t paying attention.” They also may seem more immature than their peers.\nOnce the diagnosis of ADHD has been made based on the many factors listed above, medication is the gold-standard for treatment. Medications that treat ADHD are stimulants. Many people are surprised by this, because they’re thinking, “Wait, this kid’s hyperactive, and we’re going to stimulate him?” Stimulating the brain makes the poorly working area of decision-making more active and enables the child to think through consequences and resist impulsive behavior.\nSome people worry that these stimulants are addictive. Stimulants CAN be addictive, particularly if they are misused. Medication taken as ordered by physician or other care provider is not the same as if someone were to grind up a pill and inhale it. The key, as with any medication, is to take as directed.\nSomething that may be surprising is that if a person who needs medication for ADHD takes their medicine, they are actually less likely to become a drug abuser. Why? Because the medication they take helps them improve their decision-making. They’re less impulsive, and can think through the consequences of their decisions better.\nLet’s give an example: Say a teenager with ADHD is at a friend’s house after school, and the friend offers him some pot. If he hasn’t taken his ADHD medication, he’s more likely to be impulsive and say, “Sure!” But if he’s taken his medicine, he may be more likely to think, “I’d like to, but I might get caught and not be allowed to go to prom this weekend.”\nI hear a lot of people saying that kids today are getting labeled ADHD. Some think that it is getting over used. Do you think there is a difference in kids today compared to 20 or more years ago? Or is it that there just wasn't a term for what kids might have been experiencing many years ago?\nTwenty years ago, there were probably as many people with ADHD as there are now. But in the past 20 (and certainly 40) years, there has been a major change in the level of attentiveness required in daily life. In pre-computer/technology life, individuals could make a living without having to pay close attention during their education and in adulthood. What I mean is that a person could get a job that was more labor-oriented, and could make enough to take care of their family. Those jobs are fewer now, and schools must focus on preparing students for the technology driven world we live in.\nConditions that can appear like ADHD\n- Sleep Disorder A child may have a sleep disorder that is causing them to not be well-rested every day, resulting in them being inattentive and even becoming hyperactive in an attempt to stay awake.\n- Behavioral Issues Depression, anxiety or other mental illness can cause inattentiveness and “acting out.” This can sometimes be the result of serious problems at home, or some emotional trauma such as a major loss, or abuse.\nTypes of ADHD Intervention\n- Boredom The child may be bored in class because the coursework is either too hard or too easy.\nFor kids who have ADHD, there are three types of interventions that can be considered along with medication.\n1. Family-focused efforts:\n2. School interventions\n- Educating the family about ADHD so they understand how the child is struggling.\n- Stress management techniques. ADHD is a chronic illness, and many families find that the forgetfulness or the need to repeat instructions and steps many times can wear thin. Helping families cope with and understand this is important.\n- Behavioral modification techniques. These are deliberate and planned ways to help the child gradually learn better structure and behaviors. An example may be a sticker chart used to reinforce brushing teeth, bringing home homework, putting clothes in the hamper, etc.—whatever behavior you’re working on. Or if your child consistently forgets the same steps over and over—like leaving their shoes in the middle of the hall—you have a plan to deal with it. You don’t pick up the shoes—you have the child come and get their shoes and put them where they belong.\n3. Child-Focused Interventions\n- Modifying the classroom or work in some way. If you have a child who is easily distracted, move them to the front of the room so all they’re seeing is the teacher and not all the other kids.\n- A smaller classroom fewer students in the class.\n- Organizational help. This may mean that a child with ADHD has their teacher review and sign off on their planner before they go home, and then the parent does the same in the evenings.\n- An IEP—an individual educational plan—is something that many ADHD kids can qualify for. This could include having a timed test broken into smaller chunks so they don’t have to focus for such long spans. They still take the test, but in a way that helps them. (This is only an example of one way an IEP may be used. An IEP is something that a student must qualify for. If you have questions about that, your school counselor may be able to help.)\n- Kids with ADHD are often immature, and they need help with social skills, such as waiting their turn to play or talk. Parents may recognize these lapses and can help address it. Other adult leaders, such as a coach, Scout leader, etc. can be helpful. There are even social skills classes that can be found.\n- Working on a child’s self-esteem may be needed. The child may recognize that they’re “not getting it, and it can make them feel insecure. Help a child identify what they do well, and build on that.\n- Don’t use the illness as an excuse. Instead, the illness is simply a reason that some things are more difficult, and we have to address that illness. It doesn’t mean the child is bad—it means that the illness is causing problems.\n- Anger management skills may also be needed. Impulsivity is a symptom of ADHD, and can result in words being said that shouldn’t be (a “filtering” problem), or even fists being thrown. A child may need help regulating this.\nDoes technology (watching lots of TV, playing video games, etc.) cause ADHD or make it worse?\nVideo games are engrossing by nature—they have a way of “sucking you in.” For people with ADHD, who have difficulty focusing or prioritizing their attention, video games can be even more distracting.\nThere are studies that show too much screen time (TV, video games, computer) can interfere with normal brain development and can cause a child to have trouble paying attention in “every day life,” such as to a teacher in a classroom. Limiting screen time is a good idea. This also creates time for more physical activity. Physical activity has been shown to sometimes help with ADHD symptoms.\nThis blog was updated 10/19/16","WHAT IS DYSLEXIA??\nDyslexia is a reading processing disorder that can hinder reading, writing, spelling and sometimes even speaking. Dyslexia is not a sign of poor intelligence or laziness. It is also not the result of impaired vision. Children and adults with dyslexia simply have a neurological disorder that causes their brains to process and interpret information differently.\n• Dyslexia is often characterized by difficulties with accurate word recognition, decoding and spelling.\n• Dyslexia may cause problems with reading comprehension and slow down vocabulary growth.\n• Dyslexia may result in poor reading fluency and reading out loud.\n• Dyslexia is neurological and often genetic.\n• Dyslexia is not the result of poor instruction.\n• With the proper support, using alternate learning methods, almost all people with dyslexia can become good readers and writers.\nDyslexia occurs among people of all economic and ethnic backgrounds. Often more than one member of a family has dyslexiaMuch of what happens in a classroom is based on reading and writing. So it’s important to identify dyslexia as early as possible.\nWHAT ARE THE WARNING SIGNS OF DYSLEXIA?\nThe following are common signs of dyslexia in people of different ages. If you or someone you know displays these signs, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a learning disability. But if troubles continue over time, consider testing for dyslexia.\nDYSLEXIA: WARNING SIGNS BY AGE\nHOW IS DYSLEXIA IDENTIFIED?\nTrained professionals can identify dyslexia using a formal evaluation. This looks at a person’s ability to understand and use spoken and written language. It looks at areas of strength and weakness in the skills that are needed for reading. It also takes into account many other factors. These include family history, intellect, educational background, and social environment.\nHOW IS DYSLEXIA TREATED?\nIt helps to identify dyslexia as early in life as possible. Adults with unidentified dyslexia often work in jobs below their intellectual capacity. But with help from a tutor, teacher, or other trained professional, almost all people with dyslexia can become good readers and writers. Use the following strategies to help to make progress with dyslexia.\n• Expose your child to early oral reading, writing, drawing, and practice to encourage development of print knowledge, basic letter formation, recognition skills and linguistic awareness (the relationship between sound and meaning).\n• Have your child practice reading different kinds of texts. This includes books, magazines, ads and comics.\n• Include multi-sensory, structured language instruction. Practice using sight, sound and touch when introducing new ideas.\n• Seek modifications in the classroom. This might include extra time to complete assignments, help with note taking, oral testing and other means of assessment.\n• Use books on tape and assistive technology. Examples are screen readers and voice recognition computer software.\n• Get help with the emotional issues that arise from struggling to overcome academic difficulties.\nReading and writing are key skills for daily living. However, it is important to also emphasize other aspects of learning and expression. Like all people, those with dyslexia enjoy activities that tap into their strengths and interests. For example, people with dyslexia may be attracted to fields that do not emphasize language skills. Examples are design, art, architecture, engineering and surgery.\nSOURCE : NATIONAL CENTRE FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES\nFor more information on Dyslexia in Nigeria, please contact\nC.A.D.E.T Academy, 10b Owena Close, Off Yedseram Street, Maitama Abuja, Nigeria\nPhone: 0705 763 0825"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7ea60be8-7475-47ba-80aa-f6feb9596047>","<urn:uuid:6624009d-4aaa-40c0-a666-65156a3e7e50>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Theodore Hughes's study of Cold War literature and Verdi's Rigoletto both explore themes of revenge and political power?","answer":"Both works examine the intersection of revenge and power dynamics. Hughes's analysis reveals how Cold War politics and state power in South Korea led to deliberate cultural erasures and the rise of an 'ethnodevelopmentalist' state, while Rigoletto portrays personal revenge within a political power structure - specifically through the story of Count Monterone cursing both the Duke and Rigoletto for dishonoring his daughter, and Rigoletto's subsequent quest for revenge against the Duke, ultimately leading to his daughter Gilda's tragic death.","context":["- Literature and Film in Cold War South Korea: Freedom's Frontier by Theodore Hughes\nTheodore Hughes's Literature and Film in Cold War South Korea: Freedom's Frontier begins with an original concept that literature is a part of South Korea's \"visual modernity\" and that they are \"instances of visual culture; they are verbal-visual texts\" (p. 205). Using textual examples from the 1910s-1970s period, both canonical and otherwise, Hughes illustrates the connections between Korean cultures before and after 1945 that have been ignored, obscured, deliberately hidden, or continue, disguised through a Cold War \"code-switching,\" addressing \"the ways in which the formation of post-1945 'South Korean' culture is part of a transnational, global, Cold War discourse,\" aiming to \"unpack what has been elided in discussions of modern Asia and the Cold War\" (p. 17). In this way, Hughes writes the cultural history of the layers of purposeful forgetting, elision, and epistemic violence, one that leads to certain invisibilities (of the left and of the North, for instance), which enables the rise of the \"ethnonation\" and \"ethnodevelopmentalist\" state in South Korea. He writes, \"the formation of Han'guk munhak . . . is closely tied to the increasing excision of texts—as well as cultural producers located north of the thirty-eighth parallel\" (p. 11), buttressing his argument (which may be controversial) that \"'North' and 'South' Korean literature is not a divided national literature but an array of texts forming themselves in relation to the colonial past, competing statisms, and global Cold War cultural production\" (p. 90).\nChapter 1 discusses the spatialization according to the ideological division of the Korean cultural field and explains the creation of \"South Korean\" literature and culture that results through the erasures of KAPF and all other leftist writers and their works in the 1945-1948 period, a formation that lasts until 1988, when the ban was finally lifted. The chapter's thesis connects the culture of the late-colonial-era mobilization and Cold War developmentalism, arguing that from 1948 to 1988, cultural producers \"negotiated the visual order, one first deployed under U.S. military occupation\" (p. 12). [End Page 153]\nChapter 2 analyzes works from Selected Stories of Liberation Literature (1948) and in doing so, questions the canon formation of South Korean literature by making visible the workings of the literary establishment, major publishing houses, censorship, and the politics of the intellectuals' (non)response to this collection. This is a valuable input, alerting us to the meanings that lie outside of the texts themselves but nevertheless matter just as much when we consider Korean literature. The chapter does this partly by providing summaries of critical debates between different camps that begin and continue from the 1930s-1940s, the left and the right, and amongst the members of each camp, between pivotal figures such as Yi Tae-jun, Im Hwa, Yŏm Sang-sŏp, Kim Ki-jin, and others. Such discourses are rarely presented today, especially in languages other than Korean.\nIn Chapters 3 and 4, Hughes adds his voice against the old formula of the \"East\" providing raw material/text and the \"West\" culture/theory, to disrupt the traffic pattern of knowledge production and consumption that used to flow mostly in one direction. Hughes fluently cites from the works of writers, artists, filmmakers, and theorists working in Korean and English, suggesting a good model for a new kind of \"area studies.\" Also the book's main focus, the relationship between materiality, visuality, literature, and culture, comes through most successfully in these chapters dealing with films as immediate examples.\nChapter 5 is devoted to the major writer Ch'oe In-hun's works. One criticism of this chapter (and of the book, for that matter, since there are opportunities for considerations of gender in each chapter) is that it doesn't address the utterly masculinist character of Ch'oe's works and its serious implications for the modern Korean literary canon. Some discussions of gender ideology would have made...","Is it possible to bring together the three titles which define the “popular Verdi trilogy” with a common thread that unites them, and a single directing and dramaturgical style? Francesco Micheli, the maestro Fabio Luisi, and the Maggio believe so, convinced that the “trilogy” presents Giuseppe Verdi as one of the nation’s fathers. “That thread that unites, passes and weaves the plots, taking on the colours of our flag, leads the “trilogy” to become a polyptych of intense colours, which tells us what we are, that which we should be, or rather that which we want to be. Green is the colour which portrays Rigoletto: ambiguity, jealousy and anger are green the colour which is often attributed to these conditions and states of mind. (Francesco Micheli, director)\nOpera in three acts\nMusic by Giuseppe Verdi\nLibretto by Francesco Maria Piave from Le Roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo\nFirst performance: March 11, 1851 at Teatro La Fenice di Venezia\nMantua, 16th century. During a ball at the palace, the Duke reveals to the courtier Matteo Borso, that he has decided to meet the beautiful girl he has seen for the past three months in a church. Meanwhile, he is courting the Countess of Ceprano, while the hunchbacked jester Rigoletto mocks the husbands of the women the Count is seducing. The knight Marulla reveals to the court that the jester has a lover. Then Rigoletto derides the sorrow of the Count of Monterone, whose daughter has been dishonoured by the Duke, and the scene ends with the Count cursing both Rigoletto and the Duke. Distraught, the jester heads towards his home and after refusing the services offered by the assassin Sparafucile, he embraces his daughter Gilda who he has kept hidden from the world. When he leaves, the girl's nanny Giovanna lets in the Duke, now dressed as a poor student named Gualtier Maldè, who declares his love for Gilda. When the courtiers arrive set on kidnapping Gilda who they mistakenly believe is Rigoletto’s lover, she sends the young man away, thinking that her father has returned. The jester, believing that they are there to kidnap the Countess of Ceprano, offers his help realising the deception only when he hears Gilda’s desperate cries.\nAt the Palace, the courtiers tell the Duke that they have successfully kidnapped Rigoletto’s mistress, but the Duke realises from their description of the girl that it is Gilda and he runs to find her in the room where she had been locked. The jester enters looking for his daughter and when she tells him of her plight, he swears revenge.\nRigoletto takes Gilda to the tavern on the Mincio where the Duke is courting Sparafucile’s sister, Maddalena. Rigoletto orders his daughter to dress in man’s clothing and leave the city, then pays the assassin to kill the Duke. Instead, Maddalena convinces her brother to keep the money but save the Duke, and kill in his place the first person to knock on the door. Gilda, still in love, has heard everything and decides to sacrifice her own life for her beloved. Rigoletto returns to collect the cadaver to throw it into the river and hears the Duke’s song in the distance. He then opens the sack and discovers the dying Gilda, who begs forgiveness for herself and the Duke.\nGiuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi was born in Le Roncole di Busseto, near Parma, on October 10, 1813. He learned the rudiments of music by playing the organ in the local parish and in 1832, thanks to the patronage of Antonio Barezzi he moved to Milan, despite not being admitted to the Conservatory. Oberto conte di San Bonifacio, his first opera, is staged with moderate success at La Scala in 1839 but it is Nabucco, three years later, that is his first great triumph. After many masterpieces, including Ernani (1844) and Macbeth(1847), between 1851 and 1853 is born the so-called \"popular trilogy\": Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata. He received important commissions from abroad: Les vêpres siciliennes (Paris, 1855), La forza del destino (St. Petersburg, 1862), Don Carlos (Paris, 1867) and Aida(Cairo, 1871). After the Requiem Mass (1874), Otello(1887) and Falstaff (1893), he died in Milan on January 27, 1901."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:60a6b020-4b11-4eb1-9719-26a4f3b05f00>","<urn:uuid:d87689b4-1c16-454a-8797-6c7890a4d9e4>"],"error":null}
