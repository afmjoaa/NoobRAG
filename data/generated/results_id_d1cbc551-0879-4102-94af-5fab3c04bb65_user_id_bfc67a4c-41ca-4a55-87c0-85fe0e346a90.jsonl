{"question":"What are the differences between salicylic acid (SA) and TGA factor interactions with NPR1 in plant defense responses?","answer":"While TGA factors show varying levels of interaction with NPR1 (TGA2 and TGA3 show strong affinity, TGA5 and TGA6 exhibit weaker affinity, and TGA1 and TGA4 display little to no interaction), salicylic acid's interaction with NPR1 shows concentration-dependent effects. SA can suppress or augment jasmonic acid-associated responses depending on concentration - at >250μM it suppresses JA-associated gene expression, while at lower levels it actually enhances it. Additionally, NPR1 confers redox regulation of DNA binding activity to TGA1, and NPR1-mediated DNA binding of TGA2 is critical for activation of defense genes.","context":["Gene Symbol: TGA4\nDescription: TGACG motif-binding factor 4\nAlias: OBF4, OCS BINDING ELEMENT 4, OCS ELEMENT BINDING FACTOR 4, OCTOPINE SYNTHASE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN, T31P16.20, T31P16_20, TGACG motif-binding factor 4, TGACG motif-binding factor 4\nSpecies: thale cress\nKesarwani M, Yoo J, Dong X.

Baulcombe\nThe Sainsbury Laboratory, John Innes Centre, Norwich NR4 7UH, UK\nRx-mediated resistance against potato virus X (PVX) in potato involves a surveillance system detects a virus-encoded protein and a response that has broad spectrum antiviral activity. The Rx protein is a component of the surveillance system that recognizes the PVX coat protein. However, as we have been unable to demonstrate a direct interaction of Rx and the coat protein, it seems likely that the surveillance mechanism is a complex of several proteins. The antiviral response has a primary phase resulting in suppression of virus accumulation and a secondary phase resulting in death of the infected cell. This second phase is activated when the primary phase is too late or too weak to prevent continued virus accumulation.\nTo investigate the signaling components involved in Rx and other resistance responses we are using a system based on virus induced gene silencing. I will describe the basis of this system and its application in different examples of disease resistance system.\nAnalysis of the jasmonate signal pathway in Arabidopsis\nChristine Ellis, Manuela Nieto-Rostro, Daoxin Xie, Ioannis Karafyllidis, Liangying Dai, John Turner\nSchool of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich,England\nJasmonates (JAs), which include jasmonic acid and its cyclopentanone derivatives, are widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom. They are synthesised by the octadecanoic pathway from linolenic acid in undamaged tissues and apparently by a different pathway in wounded tissues. JAs are formed when plants are wounded, and have strikingly diverse effects: they inhibit root growth, promote fruit ripening, senescence, pollen development, tuber formation, tendril coiling, and defence against insect pests and pathogens. They are associated with altered gene expression at the level of transcription, RNA processing, and translation. However, the molecular basis of the JA signal pathway and its regulation by the wounding is only starting to be elucidated.\nWe have started to dissect the JA signal pathway through the isolation and characterisation of Arabidopsis mutants. Of the three mutant classes isolated one, named coil, exhibits no JA-induced responses. We isolated the COI1 gene by map-based cloning and showed that it encodes an F-Box protein. We have used yeast two-hybrid screens to show that COI1 links the JA response to the ubiquination pathway. Six COI1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (CAP) genes were isolated. CAP1, CAP2, and CAP3 are homologues of SKP1, which forms an essential component of the ubiquitination complex. CAP4, CAP5 and CAP6 are candidate repressor protein targets for COI1-mediated ubiquitination. Further evidence for the function of the CAP proteins in the JA pathway was by co-immunoprecipitation and by reverse genetics. The results indicate that selective proteolysis is required for the JA perception-response pathway in Arabidopsis. Other mutants with altered JA responses define negative regulators. These mutants were and were isolated in a screen for constitutive expression of the JA-responsive promoter from the vegetative storage protein (VSP) gene fused to the luciferase structural gene. They formed two distinct types: the CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF VSP1 (cevl) mutant had constitutive expression of JA-induced and ethylene-induced responses, and was generally resistant to pests and diseases. cev2–cev8 had JA-induced overexpression of JA responses. Characterisation of these three types of mutant has enabled us to predict a model for the JA signal pathway, and its interaction with other signal pathways in Arabidopsis during the wound response.\nVariable interactions between salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco\nLuis A. J. Mur1*, Paul Kenton1, Faye J. Sturgess1, John Draper1, Claus Wasternack2 and Rainer Atzorn2\n1Institute of Biological Science, University of Wales- Aberystwyth, Aberystwyth, UK\n2 Institut fur Pflanzenbiochimie, POB 110432 Halle/Saale, Germany\n*Principal investigator: Email email@example.com Tele: 01970 622981.\nSalicylic acid (SA), is a key signal in the establishment of systemic acquired resistance whilst jasmonic acid (JA) is associated with wound-activated events. A well established model suggests that SA and JA signalling is mutually exclusive with SA suppressing JA synthesis at a cyclo-oxygenase step in a manner which is analogous to the reduction of prostaglandin levels by analgesics. We have reported however, the simultaneous accumulation of SA and JA in developing hypersensitive response (HR) lesions (Kenton et al., 1999) and significantly JA levels were not elevated within the HR occurring in salicylate hydroxylase expressing tobacco plants were SA levels are reduced. Reciprocally dosing Arabidopsis with various concentrations of SA, JA and the JA precursor of linolenic acid revealed that the SA-mediated suppression of JA-associated expression of PDF1.2 and thionin only occurred at >250M whilst at lower levels expressed was in fact augmented. Addition of low concentrations of JA was also observed to increase SA-induced PR1a-expression. Furthermore, addition of higher levels of SA or JA resulted in cell-death, an effect that could be suppressed by the apoplastic application of catalase. Significantly, the H2O2-responsive transgene, AoPR1-GUS also exhibited SA/JA synergistic effects in tobacco and Arabidopsis and associated increases in apoplastic H2O2 levels were measured in planta. These data suggests that SA/JA effects are concentration dependent with lower levels probably augmenting the oxidative burst during the hypersensitive response.\nReference: Kenton et al., (1999) MPMI 12:74-78."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6d9b02ca-1858-48be-926e-82043c809ecd>","<urn:uuid:8d88a2ce-fe1a-4de4-9623-cb3e8239883e>"],"error":null}

The report, Coastal Wetlands and Flood Damage Reduction, uses industry-based risk models to study the flooding and storm surge impacts of Hurricane Sandy along the US’s northeast coast.\nHurricane Sandy caused devastating flooding and become the second costliest hurricane in US history. This research finds that coastal wetlands prevented more than US$625 million in property damages during Hurricane Sandy, reducing property damages throughout the Northeast US by 10% on average. The research finds that the benefits of wetland conservation accumulate upstream: some places with few wetlands within their boundaries nevertheless benefited from the cumulative surge reduction of wetlands downstream.\nThe study also examined the benefits of wetlands through the year in Ocean County, New Jersey, and finds that areas behind existing salt marshes have 20% fewer property damages on average when compared to areas where salt marshes have been lost. Properties built on previously existing wetlands, and properties at low elevations, face the greatest risk from flooding, and therefore derive the greatest protection benefits from coastal wetlands.\nAs the likelihood and costs of hurricanes like Sandy continue to increase, coastal communities need for a more effective suite of strategies for risk reduction. Coastal wetlands and reefs provide a natural defense from flooding and storm surge, but these habitats are being degraded or lost at alarming rates. This report provides one of the few existing assessments of the economic costs and benefits of the role of coastal wetlands in reducing flood damage to properties. The report shows that coastal wetlands can reduce property damage from storms, and that these protection benefits can be readily incorporated and accounted for in the insurance industry’s risk models. This research will help inform (i) risk reduction and conservation management priorities and (ii) the development of incentives for the conservation and restoration of natural defenses.\nThis work is supported by the Lloyd’s Tercentenary Research Foundation, and was led by the University of California Santa Cruz, The Nature Conservancy, and the Wildlife Conservation Society, in association with Risk Management Solutions and Guy Carpenter and Company, with additional support from the Science for Nature and People Partnership.\nLearn more at http://www.lloyds.com/coastalresilience\nCaption for Figure 4\nPredicted increases in property losses if marshes had not been present during Hurricane Sandy (click on image to enlarge).\nSandy Census tracks show the percent changes in flood damages that would have occurred during Hurricane Sandy without coastal wetlands. Dark red areas derive the greatest protection benefits from today’s coastal wetlands.\nFrom the Executive Summary:\nThere are three key messages from this report\n- Risk industry-based tools are used to quantify the economic benefits of coastal wetlands for property damage reduction from hurricane-induced flooding in the northeastern USA.\n- It is estimated that during Hurricane Sandy, temperate coastal wetlands saved more than $625 million in flood damages and hundreds of millions of dollars in New Jersey alone. Where they remain, wetlands reduced damages by more than 10% on average.\n- In Ocean County, New Jersey, salt marsh conservation can significantly reduce average annual flood losses by more than 20%.\nWe quantify the economic benefits of coastal wetlands in reducing property damage from storms and flooding in the northeastern United States (USA). In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the northeastern coast of the USA causing devastating flooding and becoming the second costliest hurricane in USA history. As the likelihood and costs of hurricanes like Sandy continue to increase, there is a need for a more effective suite of strategies for risk reduction. There is great interest in the role of coastal wetlands and reefs as natural defenses in reducing some of this risk, especially where these ecosystems are being degraded or lost. While there is substantial evidence for the physical ability of wetlands to attenuate waves, there have been fewer assessments of the economic costs and benefits of their role in reducing flood damage to properties. This has limited their consideration by public agencies and private industries.\nUsing risk industry based flood models, we predict the increase in damages from Hurricane Sandy that would have occurred if wetlands had been lost. We estimate that coastal wetlands saved more than US$ 625 million in avoided flood damages from Hurricane Sandy across the northeastern USA. For census tracts with wetlands, there was on average a 10% reduction in property damages across the region. The damage reduction benefits varied by state and reached as high as 29% for Maryland. We also find that the benefits of wetland conservation accumulate upstream. Some townships with few wetlands within their boundaries nevertheless benefited from the cumulative surge reduction of wetlands downstream. Wetlands can also increase flood heights and damages to some properties by blocking the flow of water and causing it to pile up, which is similar to effects observed for artificial defenses such as seawalls or levees.\nTo examine the benefits of wetlands beyond an individual hurricane, we estimate the effects of salt marshes on annual flood losses to properties in Ocean County, New Jersey for 2000 storm events. Areas behind existing marshes are predicted to have an average of 20% less property losses than areas where marshes have been lost. These benefits of salt marsh conservation for damage reduction are much higher for properties at lower elevations.\nTogether, these studies illustrate the direct and indirect flood risk reduction benefits that coastal wetlands provide by reducing flood heights and also by decreasing exposure. We show that coastal wetlands can reduce property damage from storms and that these effects can be readily incorporated into the insurance industry’s risk models. These results help inform (i) risk reduction and conservation management priorities and (ii) the development of incentives for the conservation and restoration of natural defenses."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f6fc12de-5436-4084-be14-4854bdd837e3>","<urn:uuid:821cb41d-3d50-464a-b22b-f01c409f1535>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For safety purposes, should protective gloves be worn when operating both miter saws and table saws?","answer":"No, the safety requirements differ. For miter saws, safety accessories such as goggles are required, but gloves are not specifically mentioned. For table saws, it is explicitly advised to avoid using gloves as they can cause you to lose touch feel when feeding workpieces and potentially lose control. The only time gloves should be used with a table saw is during blade replacement to prevent scratches.","context":["Miter saws were created to be able to cut miter joints. It is time-consuming and difficult to do so by hand and thus, the miter saw was born out of necessity. It may be for small jobs on baseboards, a home renovation, or perhaps a pet project where woodworking is concerned, you can’t go wrong with a miter saw that can help you get the best accurate cuts at a faster, smoother rate.\nBefore that, you must know that there are there are three types of miter saws that have different functions:\n- Standard type – this type of miter saw creates 45-degree angle cuts to the left or to the right straight-up on the board.\n- Compound type – it can cut at a compound angle because the blade can be tilted.\n- Sliding type – it was created to have the saw that can slide along the arm to allow more range of the material to be cut.\nSafety measures when using a miter saw\nMiter saws are safe to use as long as you follow instructions and precautionary means. Even a small accident could cause you so much time, or worse.\n- Make sure that the cord is unplugged while the blade is being changed or when not in use.\n- Keep both hands on the surface and not anywhere under the table.\n- Your fingers should be away from the path of the blade.\n- Wear safety accessories such as a pair of goggles everytime you’re to use the miter saw\n- Before lifting wood and changing it, be sure that the miter saw had already come to a full stop.\nEfficient cutting with the miter saw\n- The blade will fall on the material depending on the latter’s thickness as well as the angle to be cut. Keep the following in mind: Make the necessary measurements, mark the board and extend that mark across the material. Check the path of the blade after making contact with the wood. Make the necessary adjustment on the position of the wood before proceeding with cutting.\n- Boards tend to be long and to be able to cut without expending too much of your energy minding your position, let most of the board’s length rest on the saw while cutting. Look for extra scraps and pile them up next to the saw to serve as the support if you’re cutting a board that’s too long. You may also use a saw stand with some support for your miter saw for longer materials.\n- Use the fence that’s at the back of the saw base then position and hold the material there. You may also use a clamp but be sure that the material is away from the blade at least 6 inches. Proceed cutting but be sure that one hand is on the handle of the saw. Your arms should both be in front and uncrossed with your feet planted firmly on the ground.\n- Turn on the miter saw’s power and wait for it to pick up speed. Carefully lowers the saw down to the wood. Wait for the board to get fully cut then take your finger off the miter saw trigger. Wait for the saw to come to a full stop before lifting it off.\n- The same types of cuts can be sped up by using paper tape on the length instead of making measurements one-by-one. You can simply remove the tape when the cutting is done.\n- If you want more accurate cuts, try using a stop block. Find a quarter-inch thick of wood and put cut pieces of carpet tape on its back. The saw should not be plugged into an electrical source and the blade is lowered. Measure the point from the teeth to the fence where you’re going to stick the wood block. Start cutting while the block is against the board you’re cutting. The cuts will turn out to be equal in length. Clean up the stop block.\nAdditional miter saw tips and tricks\n- Some materials will be sold that were left unpolished. You can just cut it off before taking measurements and the actual cutting of the wood so that you won’t have to worry about how it will look.\n- Cut the wood smoothly by making the wood go through it instead of the other way around.\n- The best cuts are made with blades that have more teeth. For cuts to be used on construction projects, use a blade with 50 teeth. If you’re going to cut moldings, make use of a blade with 90 teeth for smoother cuts.\n- Look for blades with a lower number of teeth for chemically treated wood to get smoother cuts. It will also do good for your miter saw motor as it will not be as strained.","There is a variety of how to rip longboards on table saw you can possibly make in different woodworking projects. These include strip rips, long rips, or squaring rips where long workpieces should be managed through the cutting station on the table saw.\nHowever, ripping longboards on table saw could be tricky and come with safety hazards. The proper procedure is required for accurate ripping results while preventing kickback during the operation. Let’s dig more information about ripping longboards on the table saw.\nTable saw rip cut Safely\nYou can basically avoid most injuries and incidents related to use a table saw during the operation. Check fundamental tips for making rip cuts on the table saw below\nSave your fingers with a push stick\nMost table saws come with a push stick that enables you to push the board or workpieces on their end edge when ripping them completely on the table saw. As for how to rip boards with a table saw safely, don’t use your fingers towards the blade to complete ripping the material but use this magical push stick. You can buy separate push sticks for spare or make DIY ones from scrap woods or boards in your workshop.\nInstall the blade guard that came with your saw\nTable saws mostly come with the blade guard that’s usually attached to the blade guard. It has an open-close or up-down mechanism that guards the blade against being exposed and would only open at the thickness of the board or workpiece as it’s pushed toward the blade. It’s very tempting to remove the blade guard to have more flexibility in ripping wood with table saw or cutting thicker materials but even professional woodworkers would discourage you from doing that.\nSupport long rips with an outfeed table\nWhen it comes to how to rip longboards on the table saw in your workshop, you better extend the support for the workpieces with an outfeed table. This application allows even longboards to keep supported along the way of cutting without a chance of dropping on one side and lifting on another side that can lead to chipping or even kickback.\nYou can rip thin strips safely too\nYou can make use of the adjustable plywood fence extension that you can calibrate based on the thickness you want to achieve. Guide the board along the extension to rip through the length of the material but don’t forget to use a push stick or push block to complete ripping at the end.\nHere’s a trick for straightening crooked boards\nYou can basically straighten the crooked boards by attaching the board or workpiece to a straight or pre-straightened board that would work as the fence guide or jig. As you’re pushing the crooked boards towards the blade against the fence, the straight jig would guide you through the ripping process until completed. The result is the crooked side of the workpiece would be as straight as the jig. You can repeat the procedure to straighten the other side.\nRequired Tools for this Project\nWhen it’s about how to rip longboards on table saw projects whether it’s for home improvements, wood crafts, or DIY woodworking, ensure that you have all the required tools. These include\n- Table saw\n- Blade guard and riving knife\n- Push stick, shoe, or block\n- Commercial or DIY outfeed table\n- Straight jig or calibrated fence\n- Fence extension\nHow to use a table saw\nSafety protocols are very important in table saw cutting wood and long boards or when operating it for other cuts. These are some table saw safety tips you better follow to avoid possible hazards when promptly using one.\n- Avoid using gloves: No professional woodworkers use safety gloves for reasons. You can either lose the touch feel when feeding the workpieces towards the blade or even lose control.\n- Complete your safety wears: Except for the gloves you better use all necessary safety wears including helmet, eye & hearing protector, non-slip shoe, etch.\n- Anti Kickback position: Be sure to avoid in-line position with the table saw blade to make you out of the line of the possible kickback throughout times.\n- Safe blade replacement: Disconnect the power cord of the table saw before changing the blade for precaution. You can use gloves this time to prevent the blade from scratching your hands.\n- Parallel fence: You can either keep the fence straightly parallel to the blade or slightly kicked out to prevent the most possible kickbacks. Ensure that your fence is 100% straight when loosened and locked.\n- Recalibrate All Mechanism: Different systems in a table saw are slightly or completely adjustable. Whether it’s the blade installation, fence system, trunnion, slots, blade lifts, or riving knife needs a proper calibration for longboards and ripping 2×6 on table saw before you operate the table saw.\nPlease follow the instructions on how to rip longboards on a table saw properly below for efficient and safe operation.\n1. Set the Blade Depth\nThe blade depth must slightly but not excessively be higher than the thickness of the workpiece you want to cut. If you want to cut dados, the depth must be exactly the same as the depth of the slots you want to make. Use the blade lift console to adjust the blade up and down to the correct depth.\n2. Marking the Workpiece for Cutting\nEven though the table saw has a ruler guide in conjunction with the fence, it’s still important to mark the workpiece you want to cut. This would help you to follow the correct measurement for how do you use a table saw while ensuring whether the fence or miter guide works perfectly.\n3. Set the Table Saw Fence\nRead the ruler in the rear of the table saw fence and find the width you want to set. You can use feather boards or fence extensions depending on your need. Lock the fence properly after setting the correct measurement for how to rip longboards on table saw in the workshop.\n4. Set Featherboard\nWhen ripping boards or wood planks, you better set the feather board that works as your hand extension to push down the workpiece towards the table and push against the fence.\n5. Position Outfeed Support\nAs for how to rip longboards on the table saw in your shop or job site, you must set up the correct position of the outfeed support. It should be the same or slightly below the table saw base for smooth out feeding of the workpiece.\n6. Rip-Cut the Workpiece\nOnce you’ve set the blade, fence, feather board, and the outfeed support properly, then it’s time to rip-cut the workpiece. When it comes to how to rip longboards on a table saw properly, you can start feeding the boards through the feather board that extends your handling.\n7. Finish the Cut Using a Push Stick\nWhen the workpiece feeding is coming to an end, grab your push stick or push shoe to finish the cut instead of using your bare hands. Push or feed the workpiece to the table saw blade until it’s completely cut.\n8. Power Down the Table Saw\nYou can repeat the procedure of cutting long boards on table saw for the next workpieces and when you’ve finished cutting, you can power down the table saw. Only turn your table saw back on only if you already have other boards ready to be cut.\nHow do you cut a board lengthwise with a table saw\nThe key to how to rip longboards on the table saw effectively is the configuration of the table saw that you’re previously set. Here’s how you can do it\n- Tilt and adjust the blade depth slightly above the thickness of the board\n- Prepare and set the outfeed support\n- Set and lock the fence on the cutting width you want to achieve\n- Apply fence extension when needed\n- Turn on your table saw and start feeding the boards\n- Use the push stick or push block to complete the cut\n- Turn off your table saw\nHow do you cut long wood on a table saw?\nHere’s how to rip longboards on a table saw efficiently:\n- Set the correct depth of the blade by extending it by 1/8 inch deeper than the thickness\n- Mark the cutting line on the longboard\n- Set the fence of the table saw\n- Set the outfeed table or support\n- Put on your safety wears for eye and hearing\n- Cut the wood safely\n- Complete the cut with push stick/shoe\n- Turn off the table saw\nHow do you rip longboards?\nYou can rip longboards by hand or by using power tools including a circular saw, jigsaw, or table saw. Among them, a table saw is the most efficient tool to use for how to rip longboards on the table saw as you can feed on the workpiece effectively and get completely square and straight cutting results.\nCan you rip 2×4 on a table saw?\nYes, you can rip 2×4 on the table saw with tight fencing and proper blade depth. It’s highly suggested to use feather board to tightly feed 2×4 woods onto the table saw blade. Always mark the cutting line on the workpiece even if you’re using fence and feather boards.\nWhat kind of saw makes curved cuts in plywood?\nJigsaw is the most common power saw used to cut curves in plywood or boards. Scroll saws and band saws with tighter blades. They can also do the job with less flexibility due to their limited throat. you can discover jigsaw vs bandsaw vs scroll saw for better cuts.\nWhat type of stock should never be ripped on the table saw?\nYou know rip longboards on a table saw but you should never cut round stock on it. The table saw isn’t designed to rip or support round logs as you need to use a band saw instead.\nLearning how to rip longboards on the table saw isn’t difficult but you must follow the proper steps to get the results you desire and avoid possible hazards when cutting with this power saw. You need to set up the blade, fence, outfeed, and any extension to accommodate the cutting width you want to achieve.\nYou must feed the longboard to the blade consistently. Then use the push stick or push shoe to complete cutting the material on the table saw. Safety gears to protect eyes and ears are a must but the use of gloves in this project isn’t advisable. In the end, you must turn off your table saw after cutting a workpiece.\nHi their! I am working with daily instruments since 2018. I complete my M.SC in Mechanical Engineering.

{"question":"前端开发和后端开发在网站开发中有什么主要区别？","answer":"Frontend and backend development serve distinct purposes in website development. Frontend refers to what users directly see and interact with, including the layout, colors, graphics, and text. It involves elements like navigation structures, page layout, and graphic design that create the visual user experience. Backend, on the other hand, operates behind the scenes and consists of everything that powers the website, including databases, servers, and code. Backend elements include e-commerce functionality, content management systems, shopping carts, online databases, and security features that make the website function effectively. While frontend and backend developers work together to build functional systems, they focus on different aspects of website development.","context":["Full stack development is a practice, not a product\nThe key to understanding full stack development is that it’s a practice, not a product. Technically, any website or application is considered to be full stack if it’s built with all three layers—front-end, back-end and database. However, generally speaking, it’s considered full stack when there are separate teams dedicated to each layer. This allows companies to dedicate developers and engineers specifically for each part of the project. In other words: It gives developers more control over their entire project from start to finish.\nFull stack developers do more than code\nIt’s commonly misconceived that a full stack developer only codes for a living. However, it’s actually a term describing someone who is good at front-end and back-end development. It’s an umbrella term used to describe a developer who knows everything there is to know about building a functional website or web application – from database integration to user interface development. This includes not only programming but also designing and site architecture/planning/maintenance.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Backend and Frontend?\nLet’s start with a quick definition. The frontend refers to what you see when you visit a website, such as its layout, colors, graphics and text. The backend is made up of everything that powers it behind-the-scenes—the code behind it all, databases, servers and more.\nFront-end and back-end developers work together to construct the systems that allow an application or website to function properly. However, The concerns they have differ.\nFull Stack Developer Is in High Demand\nThe advantage of being a specialist in one’s field and mastering a particular aspect of technology is obvious, but as technology rapidly expands and evolves, companies are looking for developers who can work on both the front and back end to build functional products with minimum input and support.\nDifferent types of full stack developers\nFront end, back end, and full-stack development are the most well-known development categories. There are some that are less well-known, such as:\nSystem security developers design security measures and tests for software to improve system security.\nLow-level developers write code that’s close to the hardware using languages like C and assembly.\nHigh-level developers write code that’s far from the hardware in languages like Perl, PHP, Ruby, and PHP.\nEmbedded developers work with hardware, such as electronic interfaces, internet of things (IoT) devices, serial data transmission, and hardware drivers.\nSoftware development engineers in test (SDETs) create the software that checks the quality of other software systems. Their tools ensure systems are working.\nBig data developers write programs designed to store and access enormous amounts of data. These systems include extract transform load systems, data warehouses, and regional databases.\nCRM web developers focus on systems that collect user data to improve satisfaction and sales.\nDevOps developers work with technologies used in the development of systems for building and using back-end systems.\nGraphics website developers write software used to shade, cull, render, light, shadow, and manage scenes. Their work is necessary for video and gaming projects.\nGame developers write code for video games. They often have skills in other areas with a focus on creating video games.\nData scientists write code for programs that analyze data sets for things like statistical analysis and predictive modeling.\nDesktop developers work on software that runs on operating systems.\nMiddle-tier developers write non-UI code for browsers. They also can do some front-end and back-end work.\nWeb developers specialize in building websites. They can be front-end, back-end, middle-tier, or full-stack","Web Development – Front End and Back End Elementshttps://guttulus.com/wp-content/themes/corpus/images/empty/thumbnail.jpg 150 150 tony tony https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aa9bbdf8f1e6bbf534778ecea7c0c925?s=96&d=mm&r=g\nWeb Development – Front End and Back End Elements\nWeb development involves the building, creation, and maintenance of websites. It includes the design, publishing, and programming of a website and also the management of the website’s database. The process can be divided into different stages and Guttulus, in this post, explains these important components.\nComponents of Web Development\nFront End Elements\nA website usually has a front end and a back end. The front end of a website is what people see when the website is loaded, and the back end is what is not seen. Front-end elements include:\n• Navigation structures\nNavigation structures refer to the order in which the various pages in a website are arranged. It also involves how the various components link together to perform different functions on the same webpage.\n• The page layout\nPage layout refers to how the various components of the webpage appear. These include the location of the menu – can be at the top, or on the sides – the images, tables, and texts on the page and how they are arranged. A good page layout is critical in ensuring that the users find it easy to get to various locations and links on the webpage. A poor layout, on the other hand, makes the webpage look crowded and quite difficult to navigate.\nA good website is one that creates a great user experience. Images are a great way to boost the appeal of a website, and they are an integral part of front-end web development. Images are not just limited to photos. They can include animations, lines and flourishes and navigation bars too. In some cases, you the images can be buried under the text.\nA website is normally aimed at providing a means for those seeking an audience and the audience to access each other. A website, therefore, should contain the relevant information intended for the audience. The information does not necessarily have to be in the form of text. It can also be in the form of videos and animations. Written texts, however, are still important in websites. The texts should be divided into small chunks that are clear and easy to read. Also, they have to be optimized for the site to rank high in the search engines.\nA good website should include a unifying graphic which is the company, institution or organization logo. The logo ties the website to the things that your organization, institution or company does.\n• Graphic design\nThis refers to the overall look and feel of the website. It is a combination of effective inclusion of the other elements of the front end of a website. The elements have to be creatively combined by a skilled, talented and educated graphics designer for the website to look appealing to the eyes of the users.\nBack End Elements\nThese are the elements that make the website function more effectively. The elements of the back end of a website include:\nIn today’s day and age, it has become increasingly popular for people to make their purchases online given the convenience that it offers. The E-Commerce element of a website is what makes these online transactions possible. It involves integrating payment methods in a website and the installation of security features to ensure that account information of the users is protected from online hackers and fraudsters.\n• Shopping Cart\nA shopping cart is normally found on sites that allow you to shop for products online. They are particularly suited for online stores that offer a variety of products. The shopping cart is mainly meant to ease the selection of the various items one wants to shop for.\n• Content Management System\nThis is a feature that allows the owner of a website to update information on the website without updating its HTML. The development involves the inclusion of a robust content management system that allows for the preparation of documents, editing, approval, and tracking or older publications.\n• Site search\nTo help easy navigation in the site, a good website should have a site search feature. This feature makes a website much easier to use.\n• Contact forms\nInterested users of a website might want to reach out to the owners of a brand or site to give their input in terms of review, inquiry or just to show appreciation. The inclusion of contact forms when developing a website makes it possible for the users to access contact information for the owners of the website.\n• Online databases\nA good website should have a database that one can search through to find the information that they need.\nSecurity involves ensuring that visitors to your site are safe and that the information in your site and its database is safe from hackers. Security can be enhanced by creating firewalls and password protected sections during web development.\nOther components of web development include web hosting and the domain name which is the address of your website. All these front and back-end elements have to be integrated into a website creatively and effectively by a knowledgeable person in web development to create a website that is effective and appealing to its visitors."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8333d2dd-59e0-4523-9d10-2e93fde8ca04>","<urn:uuid:48ad43b4-d54b-4b27-a7e8-90fff5b45cfd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey, I live in a cold area. What's the right way to stop a car on snow, and what should I keep in my car for winter emergencies?","answer":"For stopping on snow, you should drive slowly since vehicles take longer to stop on snow and ice than on dry pavement. If you have anti-lock brakes (mandatory in all cars since 2011), simply press the brake pedal and let the ABS system pump the brakes for you - you'll feel a pulse in the pedal and hear a thunk-thunk sound. Remember that all-wheel-drive doesn't help you stop better. For winter emergencies, keep essential items in your car including: a cellphone with charger, ice-scraper, snow brush, shovel, traction aids (sand/cat litter), jumper cables, flashlight with extra batteries, road flares, blankets, dry clothes, bottled water, and snacks. Also ensure you have basic emergency communication devices and that your exhaust pipe stays clear of snow to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.","context":["Cold Weather Health & Safety Tips\nIf You Must Drive\nWhenever possible, avoid driving in a winter storm. If you must go out, it is safer to take public transportation. However, if you must drive or get caught in a storm, here are some helpful tips:\n- Avoid traveling alone, but if you do so, let someone know your destination, route and when you expect to arrive.\n- Dress warmly. Wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothing in layers.\n- Listen to the radio or call the state highway patrol for the latest road conditions.\n- Use major streets or highways for travel whenever possible; these roadways will be cleared first.\n- Drive slowly. Posted speed limits are for ideal weather conditions. Vehicles take longer to stop on snow and ice than on dry pavement.\n- Four-wheel drive vehicles may make it easier to drive on snow-covered roads, but they do not stop more quickly than other vehicles.\n- If you skid, steer in the direction you want the car to go and straighten the wheel when the car moves in the desired direction.\n- Know your vehicle's braking system. Vehicles with antilock brakes require a different braking technique than vehicles without antilock brakes in icy or snowy conditions.\n- Try to keep your vehicle's gas tank as full as possible.\nIf You Get Stuck on the Road\n- Stay with your car. Do not try to walk to safety unless help is visible within 100 yards. You could become disoriented in blowing snow.\n- Display a trouble sign if you need help; tie a brightly colored cloth to the antenna and raise the hood to alert rescuers.\n- Start the car and use the heater for about 10 minutes every hour. Keep the exhaust pipe clear of snow to avoid the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n- Leave the overhead light on when the car is running so you can be seen.\n- Move your arms and legs to keep blood circulating and to stay warm.\n- Keep one window slightly open to let in fresh air. Use a window that is opposite the direction the wind is blowing.\nSafe Home Heating Tips\nImproper use of portable heating equipment can lead to fire or dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Take precautions to ensure you are heating your home safely.\n- Use only portable heating equipment that is approved for indoor use.\n- Keep combustible materials, including furniture, drapes, and carpeting at least three feet away from the heat source. NEVER drape clothes over a space heater to dry.\n- Always keep an eye on heating equipment. Never leave children alone in the room where a space heater is running. Turn it off when you are unable to closely monitor it.\n- Be careful not to overload electrical circuits.\n- Make sure you have a working smoke detector in every room. Check and change batteries often.\nWhat to Do If You Lose Heat\nEvery resident is entitled to heat and hot water. Tenants without adequate heat or hot water should first speak with the building owner, manager, or superintendent. If the problem is not corrected, tenants should call 973-266-5320. The Department of Property Maintenance will attempt to contact your building's owner to get heat or hot water service restored.\nIf you lose heat, take measures to trap existing warm air, and safely stay warm until heat returns:\n- Insulate your home as much as possible. Hang blankets over windows and doorways and stay in a well-insulated room while power is out.\n- Dress warmly. Wear hats, scarves, gloves, and layered clothing.\n- If you have a working fireplace, use it for heat and light, but be sure to keep the damper open for ventilation.\n- Open your faucets to a steady drip so pipes do not freeze.\n- Eat. Food provides your body with needed energy to produce its own heat and drinking helps your body avoid dehydration.\n- If the cold persists and your heat is not restored, call family, neighbors, or friends to see if you can stay with them.\n- If your service line, pipes or water meters freeze:\n- Open a faucet near the frozen point to release vapor from melting ice.\n- Direct a hair dryer or heat lamp at the frozen section, or put a small space heater nearby.\n- Never thaw a frozen pipe or meter with an open flame; this could lead to fire or cause a steam explosion.\n- If your meter is damaged or your pipes burst, call 973-266-5500.\nIf you lose power, call your power provider immediately to report the outage.\nHow To Help Others\n- Infants, seniors, and people with paralysis or neuropathy are at increased risk of hypothermia and frostbite. Check on friends, relatives, and neighbors who may need assistance to ensure they are adequately protected from the cold.\n- Recognize symptoms of cold weather illnesses such as frostbite and hypothermia.\n- Hypothermia symptoms include:\n- Shallow breathing\n- Slow, irregular heartbeat\n- Slurred speech\n- Unusual behavior\n- Frostbite symptoms include:\n- Gray, white or yellow skin discoloration\n- Waxy feeling skin\n- Hypothermia symptoms include:\n- If you suspect a person is suffering from frostbite or hypothermia, bring him or her someplace warm and seek medical help immediately or call 911.\n- If medical help is unavailable, re-warm the person, starting at the core of their body. Warming arms and legs first can increase circulation of cold blood to the heart, which can lead to heart failure. Use a blanket, or if necessary, your own body heat to warm the person.\n- Do not give a person suffering frostbite or hypothermia alcohol or caffeine, both of which can worsen the condition. Instead, give the patient a cup of warm broth.\nSnow Removal Safety Tips\n- Stretch before you go out. If you go out to shovel snow, do a few stretching exercises to warm up your body. This may prevent injury.\n- Cover your mouth. Protect your lungs from extremely cold air by covering your mouth when outdoors.\n- Avoid overexertion. Cold weather puts an added strain on the heart. Unfamiliar exercise, such as shoveling snow or pushing a car, can bring on a heart attack or make other medical conditions worse. Take frequent rest breaks, and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.\n- Keep dry. Change wet clothes frequently to prevent a loss of body heat. Wet clothing loses all of its insulating value and transmits heat rapidly.\n- Stay safe. Walk carefully on snowy or icy sidewalks. If using a snow-blower, NEVER use your hands to unclog the machine.\n- Maintain an awareness of utilities when shoveling snow. Do not cover fire hydrants with snow when clearing sidewalks and driveways. Do not shovel snow into manholes and catch basins.\n- Offer to help individuals who require special assistance, including seniors and people with disabilities.\nClearing Snow & Dangling Ice From Roofs\n- Snow and rain that collect on roofs become heavy and cause damage to buildings.\n- Remove leaves and debris from roof drains to prevent water from collecting.\n- In addition to cleaning out gutters, clear snow from roofs and drains.\n- Flat roofs require special attention. Snow and water should be removed with drainage systems or manually.\nResidents should take care to avoid areas roped off due to hazardous ice conditions, and be cautious of dangerous, hanging ice.\nTips for Staying Warm\nExposure to cold can cause life-threatening health conditions. Avoid serious conditions such as frostbite and hypothermia, by keeping warm.\n- Wear a hat, hood, or scarf, as most heat is lost through the head.\n- Wear layers, as they provide better insulation and warmth.\n- Keep fingertips, earlobes, and noses covered if you go outside.\n- Keep clothing dry; if a layer becomes wet, remove it.","Why Not Being Prepared for Winter Driving Could be Fatal\nIt can happen to anyone, your drive seems to be going smooth and boom! Your car starts skidding. It can be both frightening and dangerous experience but knowing how to react when dangerous situations arise, what to check before driving, what to keep in your car for emergencies and what to do if you become stranded in your car will help keep you safe and could even save your life.\nWith winter weather, slow and steady always wins the race, but knowing how to react when trouble strikes can help you avoid accidents and keep your tires on the road. Making sure you follow safe winter driving practices is the best way to proactively avoid winter accidents and other dangerous situations.\nThe most important thing to remember about winter driving is to take it slow. Quick maneuvers are the number one cause of scary skids and spin outs. Many people like to cling to their security blanket thought of their SUV being immune to winter weather. In practice this can be quite the opposite. The heavier your vehicle is and the higher the center of gravity is the more likely the vehicle is to react poorly to rapid driving maneuvers in winter weather. Just slowing down and keeping in mind that no vehicle is impervious to winter driving hazards will help you avoid an unexpected accident.\nIn winter weather many things can happen to hinder the visibility of road signs and other important signals that we use every day to make sure our drive is safe. Being over confident of your route and missing one of these while traveling in winter weather could be very dangerous since your car needs an increased distance to stop without sliding. Take it slow and be observant.\nEvery vehicle requires an increased distance to safely stop without sliding in winter weather. Momentum just works, trying to stop abruptly on a slippery surface will illustrate this very clearly in a dangerous way. Anti-locking brake systems have been mandatory in all cars since September of 2011 and these braking systems are your friend in winter weather. Before ABS was implemented in cars you had to manually pump the brakes like crazy to stop quickly and maintain steering control. Now with ABS built into all newer cars, if you have a car equipped with ABS you can just hit the brakes and your ABS takes care of the rest. You’ll notice a pulse like feeling from the pedal or possibly an almost grinding “thunk-thunk-thunk” type of sound. This is normal and lets you know that the system is rapidly pumping your brakes for you. You can still steer your vehicle with the system fully engaged, this helps you slow down and maintain control.\nNever assume all-wheel-drive will help you stop. Having all four wheels working for you will help keep you moving forward in slippery situations but stopping will require adequate braking. Many people like to assume that having AWD is the mechanical cure all for winter weather but making sure you still have an adequate stopping distance is very important to avoid unwanted skids or worse accidents.\nI know what you’re thinking, if the music is too loud than you’re too old right? With winter driving that’s all wrong. Being able to hear your tires while you’re driving in winter conditions can be a huge indication about the surface you’re driving on. If you can hear the crunch your tires on snow, it’s an indication that you’ve got traction but are on a potentially dangerous surface. When the tires go surprisingly silent this is an indication that you could be driving on sheer ice, a much more dangerous surface to drive on with very little traction. Simply hearing this change can help you safely adjust your driving to fit the surface you’re currently on.\nYou’ve taken all the proactive steps you can, you’re turning right at the next intersection and the back of your car starts to slide left instead. DON’T PANIC. Turning in the direction of the rear wheels (in this case to the left) will help you bring the car back in line with itself. This action is called oversteer and it’s what happens when the back of a car slides out of alignment with the rest of the car and the driver steers in the opposite direction to re-align the car. When doing this it’s important to remember that at this point your car has already lost traction and is in a slide. Make sure you are gentle with your steering wheel and have a firm grip with both hands, and ease off of the gas. Hitting the brakes or punching the gas will only make the slide worse.\nWhether you’re just an everyday motorist or if your company sends its employees out in company owned vehicles, checking and maintaining the following systems can help prevent dangerous situations while driving in winter weather.\nMaking sure your brakes are providing even and balanced braking is important as well as making sure the brake fluid is at the proper level to help combat the increased stopping distance required when driving in slippery weather.\nNeglecting your cars thirst in cold weather could result in a frozen line and could end up causing a major headache in cold weather. To avoid this make sure your windshield wiper fluids are topped off, your coolant is at an adequate fill level and your gas and oil levels aren’t too low.\nMake sure your ignition system is functioning properly and that your battery is fully charged with clean connections. Then make sure your alternator belt is in good shape and has the right tension.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is a serious threat, it’s very important to make sure your exhaust pipe is clear of snow at all times. A clogged exhaust pipe will send dangerous exhaust fumes into your car and can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.\nMake sure you have enough tread left on your tires. Bald tires don’t fare too well in slippery conditions. Switching to winter/snow tires in the cold months helps most people manage the longevity of their tires while maintaining better traction in winter conditions.\nMake sure all of your external lights and mirrors are functioning properly and are clear of obstruction from snow. Make sure your defrosters are working correctly and clear your windshield and wipers of any ice and snow. Make sure you clean all of the snow off of your car before hitting the road. In some areas it’s illegal to drive a car that hasn’t been cleared of snow. Not to mention it’s very dangerous for other drivers if a large piece of ice or chunks of snow go flying into traffic while you’re driving. DO NOT USE HOT WATER. Using hot water to clear your windshield of ice and snow is a bad idea unless you enjoy looking through cracked glass. Make sure you use a scraper and brush that are designed for automotive use, no one wants to scratch up their paint job or windows. It’s always a good idea to switch over to a low-temperature anti-freeze for your windshield wipers when dealing with winter driving. Whether you opt for the low-temperature anti-freeze or the regular blue stuff, make sure you’re topped off before hitting the slush, salt and sand covered roads.\nBeing prepared is your best defense for dealing with winter weather. If you find yourself stuck on the side of the road in heavy winter weather being properly prepared could save your life.\nHaving a means of communication is essential if you’re stuck and need help. Keeping a cellphone or two-way radio available in your car can help you make sure you’re able to call out for help in an emergency. Make sure you have the charger available for your cellphone or extra batteries for your radio.\nIf you find yourself stuck in winter weather, having the tools needed to clear the snow and help you clear that ditch are essential. Keep an ice-scraper and snow brush easily available to clear your windows and car of snow. If you know you’re traveling through exceptionally bad winter weather keeping a shovel and traction aids (bag of sand or cat litter) available is great to help you bail yourself out of a chilly situation. Being able to clear the snow from in front of and behind your tires and applying a traction aid to the areas in front of and behind your drive wheels will help you out when you find yourself stuck in deep snow. Keep in mind that the more you spin your tires when you’re stuck the deeper the hole you’re digging yourself into gets. Also, you create more resistance to movement in either direction when your front wheels are turned sharply in either direction. It’s best to try and keep your front tires as straight as possible. Keeping a tow chain in your car can help bail you out when all else fails, but you’ll need a friend (or nice passerby) with a truck to help tow you out. Keeping jumper cables or a battery powered jump pack in your car is a great idea for any season, you never know when your battery may die. In the winter this is more likely, when temperatures drop so does the performance of batteries.\nWhen you’re stuck on the side of the road, or worse in the road, being seen can be the difference of life or death. If you’re involved in a multiple car accident on a highway in heavy winter weather, stay in your car and make sure your lights are on. It’s very dangerous to exit your car in the middle of a multi-car accident. Other motorists may not be able to see you away from your vehicle and could accidentally hit you or your vehicle. Making sure that the headlights and tail lights are on will help make yourself more visible in this situation and the metal frame of your car can help protect you from oncoming motorists. Using a flashlight or any other type of illuminating object will help you stand out in a snow storm. A road flare or glow-stick are great to put out in the road near your car to indicate your there and stopped. Extra batteries are always a good idea if you’re deciding to keep a flash light in your car for emergencies.\nSometimes there’s no avoiding getting stuck. Planning ahead can help keep you comfortable and safe while you wait for help. Blankets and a change of clothes will be essential to help you stay warm and make sure you have a dry set of clothes. This is important when trying to combat hypothermia that could set in if you’re stuck for a long period of time. Keeping bottled water and snacks is important if you are traveling in a remote area through winter weather. Being stuck in hazardous weather far away from people can be fatal if you’re stuck for a long period of time without food and water. If you know you’re traveling far and could get stranded far from other people if you take any medications you’ll want to bring them along in case of an emergency.\nKnowing what to do when you’re stranded in your car in winter weather is essential to survival in these harsh conditions. Thankfully you’ve prepared a solid winter emergency kit after reading our article and have all the tools you need to stay safe while you call and wait for help.\nFirst things first, make sure you’re visible. Calling for help won’t do you any good if the person coming to bail you out can’t see you. It will also help protect you from passing motorists who may not be able to see you. Make sure there are no oncoming motorist and exit your car carefully. Using your flashlight inspect your exhaust pipe and make sure that it’s clear of snow. If you have a road flair this is a good time to use it to make sure you’re seen on the road.\nOnce you’ve made sure the exhaust pipe is clear and you’re illuminated, start the car for a short period of time and run the heater to help bring the temperature in the car up while you call for help with your cellphone or radio. Make sure to only run the car for short periods of time to avoid running out of fuel. While you wait it’s recommended to bundle up with a blanket or additional clothing to help reduce the chances of frostbite or hypothermia.\nWe can’t control the conditions on the road but we can mitigate the dangers involved with driving in winter conditions. Knowing how to react when dangerous situations arise, what to check before driving, what to keep in your car for emergencies and what to do if you become stranded in your car will help keep you safe and could even save your life. Please drive safe and always take every precaution you can when driving in winter weather."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9031cb30-7923-4be8-8f02-890a10672ff3>","<urn:uuid:fbca2ecb-4878-43ee-be95-e046b4ebb693>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to be an effective ruler according to Machiavellian principles? 💪","answer":"To be an effective ruler according to Machiavellian principles: 1) Focus on acquiring and maintaining power rather than being universally good 2) Be careful with liberality to avoid depleting finances and overtaxing people 3) Balance clemency and cruelty based on circumstances 4) Undertake great enterprises and set fine examples 5) Build a reputation as either a genuine friend or clear enemy 6) Surround yourself with capable and faithful advisors 7) Combine good laws with force to create a well-ordered political structure 8) Be prepared to set aside moral constraints when necessary for state security.","context":["Above all things, the concept of the ideal state is elaborated by a wide range of political philosophers. Every prominent author is disposed to construct a unique model of the perfect state grounded on his personal views and convictions. The thesis statement should be formulated as follows: The genuine model of Ideal State should be grasped as a fusion of two antitheses which incorporates both moral footholds of Plato’s Republic and personal strengths of the Machiavellian Governor. In order to substantiate the aforementioned thesis, a comparative analysis must be conducted.\nPlato, for instance, has managed to represent a profound as well as a complex conception of the ideal state depicted in the work “The Republic”. In this connection, it should be outlined that Plato emphasizes benefits of life in the society. He claims that “for justice is the order of the State, and the State is the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society” (Plato 12). Therefore, it is possible to argue that the purpose of the state, in Plato’s opinion, lies in the good life and justice. Furthermore, it should be asserted that justice has the direct nexus with knowledge according to Plato.\nApart from the above, Plato asserts that the ideal governor of the state must be a philosopher. In order to substantiate the aforesaid proposition Plato makes attempts to investigate the nature of human beings. His discourse is directed towards investigations of the prerequisites for being spoiled. According to Plato, many people are spoiled and only few of them manage to evade spoiling (Plato 365). In this connection, Plato’s reasoning helps to explicate the hypothesis that a true philosopher must be a lover of not only a part of wisdom, but of the whole. In addition, a genuine philosopher is obliged to adore knowledge and be a true lover of the “vision of truth” (Plato 337). Also, a philosopher must be capable to apprehend discrepancies between just and unjust things, good and evil, and of other phenomena. In the final analysis, the sheer distinction between philosophers and non-philosophers lies in the ability of the former ones to discern absolute beauty from the artificial products (Plato 339). Taking into account the aforementioned characteristics, it should be claimed that only philosophers are potent to preside over the state in accordance with justice which is deemed the highest subsistent form in the world. According to Plato, if the statesmen are not philosophers, the negligence of their unaccustomed mind may feasibly lead the state towards degradation and self-destruction. In view of the above, the conception of the higher state will be materialized only if the individual justice in every citizen corresponds with the ubiquitous justice in the state. As far as the individual justice is concerned, it should be claimed that Plato associates the aforementioned justice with the proper functioning of such components of the soul (mind) as rational, concupiscent and irascible elements.\nBesides, in accordance with Plato’s assertions, in the higher state “no man calls anything his own,” and there is neither “marrying nor giving in marriage, as well as “kings are philosophers” and “philosophers are kings” (Plato 8). According to Taylor, the first sign of the degradation of the ideal state into a “timocracy” is the acquisition of personal property by the two upper classes (Taylor 277).\nLikewise, it should be emphasized that the statesmen’ focus on the development of education is one of the preconditions to the enhancement of the state. Plato convinces that when the higher state is developed there will be no interchangeable cycles in the political history. Therefore, Plato’s understanding of the ideal state should be generalized in the following points. At first, education should be censored in order to prevent the promotion of immorality by means of drama and poetry. At second, education should accentuate primarily on morality and philosophy in order to nurture the good society. At third, private property and marriage in the two upper classes should be taken under the state control. At fourth, the prudence of the state is embodied in the class of governors or guardians. At fifth, the courage of the state is provided by the Auxiliaries. At sixth, the individual justice of every resident makes impact on the ubiquitous justice in the state. At seventh, the individual justice may be properly manifested by way of consensus and correlation between rational, concupiscent and irascible fundamentals of the soul.\nApart from the above, it should be admitted that Machiavelli highly praises political arguments of Plato. Moreover, Machiavelli’s political research is considered to be affected by works of Plato and other philosophers of Ancient Greece. In this connection, it should be mentioned that the principle political ideas of Machiavelli are set forth in his work “The Prince”. Nevertheless, it should be differentiated between Plato’s apprehension of the ideal state and the Machiavellian’s one. As far as Machiavelli is concerned, it should be stated that the major endeavors that regards his investigations are aimed at the issues of the political power and ruler’s character. Also, Niccolo Machiavelli’s ideas have made an undeniable influence on the contemporary government (Jacobus).\nTo start with, it should be ascertained that the concept of goodness is interpreted by Machiavelli in a specific way. Contrary to Plato, Machiavelli discerns citizens’ goodness from the governor’s one. According to the author of “The Prince” successes in ruling should not be juxtaposed with the goodness of the ruler. Furthermore, the philosopher strives to exemplify the failure of goodness claiming, that Alexander the Great being a man of such great goodness has both presided over the empire during fourteen years and conducted a fair justice in order to save every man from undeserved death. Notwithstanding, the aforesaid goodness, he has been despised, betrayed and killed by his own entourage (Machiavelli 104).\nIn view of the above, it is reasonable to presume that goodness does not guarantee power and, in Machiavelli’s opinion, the good person has no more authority by reason of being good. Hence, in contrast to the moralistic theory, Machiavelli suggests that only issues of acquisition and maintenance of power constitute the most essential task for the governor.\nLikewise, Machiavelli denies significance of liberality as an attribute of power. According to the author of “The Prince”, the governor is incapable to exercise honestly the virtue of liberality because the necessity to maintain his reputation of a liberal ruler will cause total expenditure of his finances and further augmentation of the taxing policy in order to recollect money (Machiavelli 85). Furthermore, Machiavelli expresses confidence that the wise ruler should not be afraid of the reputation of being mean because in time he will be considered capable both to defend himself against all attacks and to participate in enterprises “without burdening his people” (Machiavelli 86).\nIn addition to the aforementioned arguments, it should be purported that Machiavelli addresses the issues of cruelty and clemency as well. In his opinion, every governor ought to be deemed clement and not cruel (Machiavelli 88). Nonetheless, the ruler should be mindful in order to prevent the wrong application of clemency. Cesare Borgia’s behavior may serve as an example of the reciprocal relationships between cruelty and clemency. According to Machiavelli, Borgia being cruel has managed to both reconcile Romagna and return it to peace and loyalty. In this connection, Borgia has become more merciful than the Florentines “who have permitted Pistoia to be destroyed” in order to escape a reputation for cruelty (Machiavelli 88). Thus, the ruler is suggested to be clement as well as cruel in the certain circumstances.\nLikewise, the issue of renown in respect of the ruler is also discussed by the author of “The Prince”. According to Machiavelli, the governor ought to accentuate on the great enterprises and illustrate a fine example (Machiavelli 115). In addition, it should be claimed that the ruler’s reputation of a genuine friend or a downright enemy may enhance respect. In the final analysis, it should be stated that the ruler’s secretaries, in Machiavelli’s opinion, play a fairly important role in his political character. According to the philosopher, “the first opinion which one forms of a prince; and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him” (Machiavelli 120). In this connection, it should be assumed that capable and faithful entourage contributes to the ruler’s reputation of a wise governor.\nIn view of the above, it should be generalized that the principle characteristics of the Machiavelli’s ideal state are the following. At first, the strength of the state depends on the ruler’s character. At second, only proper application of power may assuredly assist the ruler in retaining safety and security in the state. At third, good laws in conjunction with the force comprise the manifold basis of a well-ordered political structure. At forth, the ruler must not be bound by the tenets of goodness and morality in order to apply cruelty if necessary. At fifth, the Machiavellian “lo stato” embodies particular features of a monarchy and a dominium which emphasizes the ruler’s ownership and control over the state.\nIn the final analysis, it should be supposed, that despite being affected by Plato, Machiavelli has elaborated his own original concept of ideal state which is quite contradictory to Plato’s one. According to Plato, an effective government may be exercised by the just rulers who highly appreciate moral virtues. Moreover, Plato provides no distinction between the private and public life. In Ancient Greece such phenomenon as the invasion of privacy never subsists. On the other hand, Machiavelli univocally defends immoral measures which may be undertaken by the governor in favor of his endeavors to do whatever is necessary to maintain the power in the country. In this connection, it should be ascertained that Plato dispraises such type of rulers who governs exclusively by might. Besides, discrepancies between Plato and Machiavelli’s characters of the ruler lie in the approaches to the concept of virtue. In this connection, it should be admitted that Plato juxtaposes the virtue with morality while Machiavelli emphasizes non-moral and utilitarian dimensions of virtue. In addition, it should be stated that Plato in his conception of the ideal state elucidates tenets of the utopian idealism while the Machiavellian ideal state manifests features of realism.\nAfter everything has been given due to considerations, it should be supposed that both concepts of the ideal state are imperfect regardless of being well-elaborated. As far as Plato’s republic is concerned, it should be emphasized that his state model is very over-idealized. Taking into consideration, that the contemporary society is very complex as well as dependent on the tenets of privacy, it is almost impossible to eliminate the verge between the private life and public affairs. Nevertheless, the factor of moral education in conjunction with a wise government may assist in overwhelming a wide range of social problems. On the hand, the Machiavellian concept of the ideal state offers more advantages than Plato’s one. The contemporary state may become very powerful and prosperous governed by the wise and caring ruler if properly based on arguments of Machiavelli. However, the misinterpretation of Machiavelli may result in creation of anti-democratic states similar to the Nazi Germany and the Fascism Italy.\nApart from the above, it should be proclaimed that the relevancy of the ideal state should be traced in the efforts to create a world government. According to Babic and Bojanic, the world governance is a fairly discussable issue correlative with the problems of peace and well-being in the world (Babic and Bojanic). In this connection, it should be claimed that the world governance should combine the best traits of the Plato’s ideal state and Machiavelli’s perfect ruling. It should be suggested that the world governors must embody characteristics of both moral and strong rulers. Reasonable fusion of the philosopher and the strategist may give birth to the ideal ruler. Therefore, it should be conceded that immorality and cruelty are not relevant traits.\nIt is possible to draw a conclusion that the ideal state must include both the moral ruling according to Plato and the reciprocity of law and force according to Machiavelli. The reasonable use of law and force makes the governor insuperable. Therefore, the thesis statement has been verified as true."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d4480912-1fd5-497d-83e4-5e52de73993e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When it comes to essential track day preparation vs regular brake maintenance, what are the key differences in brake fluid requirements?","answer":"For track days, brake fluid is considered one of the most essential preparations, with specific high-performance fluids like Motul RBF600 being recommended to dramatically prevent brake fading during intense track use. For regular maintenance, brake fluid should be replaced every few years during regular service, primarily to prevent issues with corrosion, moisture contamination, and maintaining proper hydraulic pressure, as time, heat, and impurities can lower the fluid's boiling point and reduce braking efficiency.","context":["Essential Track Day Preparation Guide\nKeen to get your car on some track days to see what it can really do? Well, here’s our guide to getting the most from your car and budget in preparation for getting the most out of your track time.\nFirst and foremost, we believe that the most essential thing you can do in the lead up to your track day is to get your car serviced properly and give it a thorough check over. Although your car might be standard or slightly modified, when you take your car on track it’s going to be operating pretty much flat out all day, with the car most likely being pushed to the brink of its capabilities, there’s a few jobs to do before it starts falling apart or melting!\nThe first things you should be checking and refreshing during the service is engine, gearbox and differential oil as well as brake fluid.\nAt the very least you should make sure that your tyres are in good condition. They should have plenty of life left in them and no cracks or tears. Don’t forget, if this is your daily and you’re not towing the car to the track, you’re going to need to drive home on the same tyres you arrived with. If you do happen to be running unbranded tyres, then it’s worth upgraded to a fast road tyre or a track orientated one like Nankang NS-2R’s. We can’t stress enough how important healthy tyres are, as these are the only part of the car that’s in contact with the surface, they shouldn’t be overlooked.\nInspect your cars bolts and clips and ensure that they’re all tight and nothing is untoward or loose. Crucial components that you should be checking are engine mounts, brake bolts, exhaust fixings and suspension fixings. No matter how tight you think your car is, it’s always worth checking as you don’t want your car falling to bits on the track!\nBefore you go bolting big turbo kits on to your vehicle, here’s a few choice upgrades that will make a big difference without breaking the bank.\nThis should definitely be the first modification when it comes to track days, as tyres are the only thing that are making contact between your car and the surface of the track. Now we’re not saying you should go out and buy slicks but a fast road/track orientated tyre like Yokohama AD08RS are sure to provide you with all the grip you should need without clearing your wallet out.\nThe things nightmares are made of are your wheels coming off whilst pushing your car hard around the track. You’ll need to make sure that the collars are seated against the bare metal of the wheel to stop this happening, especially if you’ve just had your wheels painted or powder coated. It’s good practice to check that they’re tight after each run and torque them up throughout the day. A set of Muteki wheel nuts are a great upgrade and will stand up to the extreme heat of track days without getting worked loose and chewed up after many times of torquing them up.\nRemoving unnecessary weight with things like rear seats, carpets, spare wheel is a sure-fire way to add some lightness to your vehicle and it’s not going to cost you a penny. By removing all the unnecessary items you’ll improve performance and put less stress on your suspension too.\nYou don’t need the latest 8 piston calipers and huge discs to have a good time on track. Take the Type R Trophy cars for example, they simply use upgraded brake pads from PBS and Motul RBF600 brake fluid which dramatically prevents brake fading and can be purchased for less than £200, depending on application. Allowing more fresh air to the brakes is also a big win too. Depending on your vehicle you could remove the fog lights and run ducting to the brakes to help keep them cool.\nInstalling a set of lowering springs or if your budget allows, a set of coilovers will make an incredibly big difference to how your car handles and responds. By lowering the car, you’ll reduce the centre of gravity and therefore decreasing body roll which’ll make for much better cornering. We’d recommend checking out the Eibach or Tein range if you’re after a set of springs and the Yellow Speed Racing coilover range, should you be able to spare the expense of a set of coilovers.\nThere’s a lot to be said for a decent bucket seat and harness combination for the track. Without these, you might find yourself being flung around the cockpit, clinging on to the steering wheel for dear life. With a harness firmly securing you to the seat, you can concentrate on shaving those last few tenths of your lap times.\nAs we’ve previously mentioned, when thrashing your car round at the track all day, things are going to get pretty hot which can cause problems. It’s worthwhile upgrading the cooling system and fans to improve reliability. For example, engine driven fans can suffer from problems at constant high engine speeds, so replacing it with a good, quality electric fan is a good solution. You’ll also find that heat builds up under the bonnet because there’s nowhere for it escape to, by simply installing a well-placed vent or simply opening the bonnet after each session can make a huge difference.\nIf you’re using your car solely on the track, it’s worth thinking about having a roll cage and some sort of fire suppression equipment. Make sure that you go for an FIA or MSA approved cage as cheap ‘show cages’ offer little to no crash protection and can do more harm than good. Even if it’s simply installing a neat Kap Industries bracket that holds a fire extinguisher underneath the passenger seat, that might be enough to save your car should the worst happen.\nYou’ll also need, at the very minimum, a helmet and to have your whole body covered. Although you can normally hire a helmet at the track, it’s worth investing in your own as you don’t know who’s had their head in the helmet before you put it on! The OMP Circuit EVO helmet is more than capable of the job and is reasonably inexpensive too.\nFinally, we recommend a set of gloves and boots should your budget allow. You’ll want as much feel on the pedals as possible, and a set of thin-soled racing boots will allow this. Gloves will increase grip on the steering wheel, especially on a hot summers day when the adrenaline is flowing and you’re dripping with sweat. You’ll be able to pick up a set of OMP Tecnica-S gloves for as little as £89 and a set of OMP Sport Boots will set you back just over £100.\nNo matter what you do or don’t decide to do to your car before you hit the track, the most important thing is to have fun and stay safe!","Complete Guide to Disc Brakes and Drum Brakes\nWhen it comes to driving safety, your brakes are critical. We’ve compiled a guide to help you understand your brakes. This includes disc and drum brakes, how they work, how they’re different and alike, why you may have both types on the same vehicle, what kind of wear to expect, and what parts will need maintenance.\nWhat you’ll find in this guide:\nWhat Is a Simple Brake System\nMaster Cylinder: Contains a piston assembly and brake fluid.\nBrake Fluid: Transfers the hydraulic pressure.\nDisc Brake Assembly: Includes caliper, pads, and rotor.\nBrake Lines and Hoses: Carries the brake fluid to the brake assemblies.\nDrum Brake Assembly: Includes shoes, wheel cylinder and drum.\nBraking System Basics\nDisc and drum brakes are based on a hydraulic pressure system. Braking starts with a mechanical force — your foot pressing the brake pedal. The end result is that your vehicle safely stops. Below is a quick explanation of the five points of the system.\nA piston compresses brake fluid inside the master cylinder located under your vehicle’s hood near your engine. This creates hydraulic pressure, generating a much bigger force than that of the small effort of pressing down on the pedal. See above image.\nThe pressure is transferred via the brake fluid through the brake lines and/or brake hoses (flexible tubes) that connect the lines with brake assemblies at each wheel.\nThere, wheel cylinders convert that hydraulic pressure back to mechanical force. Brake friction material is pushed against the brake disc or drum, slowing or stopping your vehicle.\nThe disc brake assembly is designed to safely stop your car when activated. More details about how this works below.\nThe drum brake assembly, equipped on some vehicles, is also designed to stop your vehicle when other points on the system are activated. More details below.\nBasics of Disc Brakes\nDisc brakes are found on most vehicles today. They are mounted on the front and/or rear axle. To stop a wheel (and your car), a disc brake uses a caliper fitted with brake pads to grab a spinning disc or rotor.\nWhat is a caliper?\nThe caliper is an assembly mounted to the vehicle with a bracket. It frames the rotor, looking and functions like a c-clamp. It contains the following components:\nBrake pads are a friction material bonded to a metal plate that helps stop your vehicle.\nOne or multiple pistons to push the brake pads against the rotor when you brake.\nA bleeder screw to allow for servicing the brakes and replacing the fluid.\nA rubber piston seal that prevents brake fluid leakage and retracts the piston when the brakes are released.\nA dust boot to keep contaminants out of the cylinder.\nAnti-rattle clips that add stability.\nWhat is a rotor?\nThe rotor is made of cast iron or a steel/cast iron composite. It’s attached to the wheel hub and turns with the wheel. This is the surface that the brake pads make contact with to slow your vehicle. Here’s how it works: when you step on the brakes, pressurized brake fluid pushes against the pistons inside the caliper, forcing the brake pads against the rotor. As the brake pads press against both sides of the disc, the friction stops the wheel’s rotation.\nRotors can either be solid or vented. Vented rotors have more surface area and can more easily dissipate heat.\nTwo Types of Disc Brakes: Floating & Fixed\nThere are two types of disc brakes. They are floating and fixed, named for the type of brake caliper used.\nA floating caliper (also called sliding) is the most common type. It has one or two pistons. When the brakes are applied, the inner brake pad is forced against the disc while, at the same time, the caliper body moves closer to the rotor. This action forces the outer brake pad against the rotor.\nThe fixed caliper design has one or more pistons mounted on each side of the rotor. The caliper itself doesn’t budge or move. It’s rigidly fastened to a brake caliper bracket or spindle. When the brakes are applied, only the caliper pistons move, pressing the brake pads against the disc.\nBasics of Drum Brakes\nDrum brakes are most often used on the rear axle of today’s vehicles. They are also very common on trailers. Manufacturers don’t use brake pads as the friction material in drum brakes. Instead, a drum brake system has a wheel cylinder with pistons that push brake shoes out against the inside of a spinning drum. This contact slows and stops the rotation of the brake drum and the wheel, bringing your vehicle to a stop.\nDrum vs. Disc Brakes\nMany of today’s vehicles have disc brakes on all four wheels. However, some models still have disc brakes on the front axle and drum brakes on the rear.\nWhy are discs put on the front? It’s due to weight factors. A typical, unloaded vehicle is about 10 percent heavier in front due to the engine. When you hit the brakes, the weight of the car transfers to the front. Therefore, more braking power is needed in the front, making disc brakes the perfect option for the job.\nDisc vs. Drum Brakes: Servicing\nServicing disc and drum brakes is important. When it comes to repairs, drum brakes have more hardware and can be more complex to service. But the materials typically cost less than disc brake pads, calipers, and rotors. Disc brakes generally consist of fewer components and are easier to service.\nBrake Maintenance: What Needs to Be Checked\nA lot of heat is created when you apply the brakes. When you press on the brake pedal, you’re converting the kinetic (moving) energy of the vehicle into thermal energy (heat), subjecting many parts to very high temperatures. This means a lot of wear and tear even in normal conditions. Some brake components will need to be replaced over the life of a vehicle, including:\nBrake Pad or Brake Shoe Friction Material: Disc brake pads slow the rotor through friction and wear with normal use. Eventually, they become too thin to function properly. The same applies to drum brakes. The friction material gets worn out and braking can become compromised. These components should be inspected regularly to avoid wearing them to the point that they cause damage to additional parts of your vehicle (rotor or drum).\nBrake Fluid: The brake system should be checked regularly for leaks and fluid should be replaced every few years (usually when the brakes are serviced). Any leak in the master cylinder, the brake fluid reservoir, the wheel cylinders, lines or hoses will reduce the hydraulic pressure that’s created when the brakes are activated. If the system can’t generate sufficient force needed to create braking power, you’ll notice your brake pedal needs to be pressed a lot further in order to slow or stop.\nHow often should I replace my brake fluid?: The brake fluid should be replaced every few years. This is usually done when brakes are serviced. While brake fluid is specifically formulated to prevent corrosion of the brake hydraulic components, time, heat, and moisture can lower the boiling point of the fluid. This results in less pressure in the hydraulic system forcing you to push down farther on the brake pedal to slow your vehicle. Other impurities, such as road grime, brake dust, rust, and more can get into the brake fluid, reducing braking efficiency and possibly damaging parts of the braking system.\nSeals: These rubber rings keep the hydraulic fluid from leaking and protect it from moisture and contaminants. They also cause the piston to return to its off position so the brake pads disengage properly when you release the brake pedal. If this doesn’t happen, you could experience brake drag, premature wear, and the vehicle may pull to one side when you brake.\nBrake Lines/Hoses: Brake lines and hoses are an essential part of the braking system. Rubber hoses can wear over time, while brake lines can be subject to corrosion or other damage. When this happens, it may compromise brake efficiency, loss of hydraulic pressure, pulling to one side, etc. Routine inspections, including hoses and lines, are critical to avoiding these issues.\nRotors: Rotors should be inspected regularly for even wear, physical damage, or cracking from excessive heat. These conditions can compromise braking power and efficiency. Brake rotors should be resurfaced or replaced when you have your brakes serviced (brake job or pads replaced). If you are experiencing any of the previously mentioned issues, your rotors may need to be repaired or replaced sooner.\nDust Boots: Brake components are constantly exposed to road debris and brake dust. The dust boot prevents grime from entering the caliper piston. If it fails and can’t do its job, piston damage can occur, causing brake drag, pulls and premature wear.\nMaster Cylinder: Regular fluid maintenance is important for prolonging cylinder life. Failing master cylinders can leak internally. In this case, you may get a low or soft pedal feel. You might not notice any visible fluid loss.\nNOTE: There are different approaches to brake service. See our Brake Servicing 101 and learn why it’s important to maintain more than just the brake pads or drum brake shoes.\nHow Often Do Brakes Need to Be Serviced?\nThere’s no set timeframe. The need to replace or service your brakes depends on your vehicle, driving style, climate and road conditions. To ensure proper braking when you need it, get your brakes checked regularly.\nStill have questions about your brakes? Review these frequently asked brake service questions.\nDisc and drum brakes are built differently, with somewhat different advantages. Both work as part of the hydraulic brake system. This system is constantly under high pressure, subject to heat, and can be compromised by road grime, air, brake dust and moisture. It’s important to get regular brake inspections to keep everything in proper working condition. Refer to your owner’s manual for a recommended schedule. Remember that odd brake sounds, smells or performance are indicators you need to get your vehicle to Les Schwab right away."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6ce2f084-4d5d-4f68-aded-ceeec182a07f>","<urn:uuid:88e9c02a-59ac-4cb0-a6f7-64420ed04c98>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I need help with rider positioning: what are the main differences in rider body position between shoulder-in and travers?","answer":"In shoulder-in, the rider maintains their hips facing straight down the long side while their torso and shoulders turn about 30 degrees into the arena, creating an 'unparallel' position between hips and shoulders. For travers, the rider's hips must point forward with head and shoulders also facing forward and level, while bringing the inside hip slightly forward and outside hip back. It's crucial in travers not to collapse to the inside or turn the shoulders to the outside. Both movements require careful body control, but shoulder-in specifically demands the unique position of keeping the lower body perpendicular to the track while the upper body turns in, whereas travers requires maintaining forward alignment while subtly adjusting the hip position.","context":["Shoulder-in is the first true lateral movement. In leg-yield, which lays the sturdy foundation for the lateral movements, the horse moves sideways as well as forward. But leg-yield itself isn’t technically a lateral movement. The distinction? In leg-yield, the horse stays straight from poll to tail. For a true lateral movement, his body bends evenly from poll to tail around your inside leg.\nThat even bending through the body is what you’re going to teach your horse with shoulder-in. In this pattern, his outside shoulder comes in off the track and aligns with his inside hind leg so he’s on what we call “three tracks.” If you watched him coming toward you, you’d see his outside hind, his outside fore directly in front of his inside hind, and his inside fore. (When you can see all four legs evenly spaced, by the way, he’s said to be traveling on “four tracks,” as he does in the “baby” shoulder-in called shoulder-fore, and in travers, renvers and half-pass.)\nIt’s Not Called “Dr. Shoulder-in” for Nothing\nI usually introduce shoulder-in when my horses are stepping up from Training to First Level. Whether you do dressage or your horse is a hunter, equitation horse, jumper or eventer, you can and should introduce it, too, because it’s a useful—some say the most useful—gymnastic pattern that …\n• Supples your horse and enhances his elasticity and freedom of movement all the way from shoulders to hindquarters.\n• Strengthens him and increases his engagement by getting him to lift his shoulders in front and to step farther under himself and carry more weight behind.\n• Straightens him and improves his obedience to your aids by getting him to move more from your inside driving leg to your outside half-halting rein.\n• Prepares him not only for the rest of the lateral exercises, but for such upper-level movements as canter pirouettes and such on-course efforts as tight or rollback turns, balanced corners and jumps that are close to a corner.\n• Saves your bacon! Shoulder-in is the most absolutely wonderful tool when your horse wants to spook. From the saddle, you cannot physically pull him past a scary object, but when you gain control over his shoulders, you can push him. Say he’s young or green, he’s at his first show and he absolutely doesn’t want to trot up centerline toward the scary-looking judge’s stand. Just put him in a shoulder-fore. The judge won’t care. In fact, she’ll probably say, “Hah! What a smart rider. A little shoulder-in is going to get her past this trouble spot without a fight.”\nShoulder-in is also a lifesaver if you’re on a young horse who wants to start bucking: If he’s in shoulder-in, he can’t buck. At that point, even if it’s not the world’s most correct shoulder-in, who cares? You’re keeping a dangerous situation from developing.\nHere are the tools you need to succeed:\n• Review asking your horse to go forward and back, turn on the forehand in leg-yield position, leg-yield itself, spiral-in and -out and counter-canter so you recall the feel of making a subtle but critical adjustment to your rider position.\n• Sitting trot, because you’ll have complete control over your horse’s up- and down-beat. If, however, sitting the trot gives you so much difficulty that it upsets your position or makes his job harder, by all means post.\n• A new rider position. In simpler exercises, such as forward and back, spiraling in and out, your hips and shoulders should always be perpendicular to the track. Now is one of the few times when you’re going to keep them parallel to the track by making them unparallel to each other. Let me explain: In shoulder-in, your horse’s haunches are going to travel straight down the long side, but his forehand is going to come in on about a 30-degree angle. Because your hips, thighs and the upper part of your calves control his hindquarters, that part of your body has to continue facing down the long side, perpendicular to the rail. But because your torso and shoulders influence and control his forehand, they have to turn slightly and face into the arena.\nTry it right now as you’re sitting there reading. I’m going to talk you through a shoulder-in left, so we’ll go that way: Put your elbows by your sides and your fists closed in front of you as if holding the reins. Keep your seat straight and square in your chair (think “laser beams are shooting straight ahead out of my hips”) while you very subtly turn your upper body about 30 degrees, not with a big twisting or tipping, but by staying perfectly level as you bring your left shoulder and upper arm back a bit and your right shoulder and upper arm a bit forward. What to do with your head? It must match your shoulders, but with your eyes still looking down the long side where you’re going. Got it? Great!\n• Leg-yield on the rail. When leg-yield on the rail feels dependable and comfortable in both directions, you’re ready to …\nRide a Shoulder-In\nTracking left, pick up an energetic sitting trot. When your horse is listening and light in your hand, which means he’s elevated in his shoulders and actively using his hind end, come around the short side of the arena. As soon as you’ve come through the second corner onto the long side, immediately ride a 10-meter circle. Sit deeper on your inside (left) seat bone, with your inside leg at the girth, your outside leg a hair behind it and your hips and shoulders perpendicular to the track. You never want this to feel as if you’re pulling him around with your inside (left) rein. Instead, it’s very much like a spiral-in. Every time his inside hind leg and outside fore start to leave the ground, bring his shoulder just a tiny bit in by pressing with your outside leg and giving a strong inward half-halt (as you squeeze your outside shoulder back and down, bring your outside rein against his neck to almost push against his shoulder). The feeling you’re after: Instead of reaching straight out in front, his outside fore comes up and around so he’s shaping the circular track.\nAs you come around on the last strides of the circle and start to feel his shoulders approaching the track on the long side, continue asking him to circle. In the next stride, when he’s almost straight on the track, continue to say “Circle.” But in the next stride, when you feel as if he’d make another circle if you kept going, ask him for a shoulder-in down the long side instead: At the very moment he’s bringing his outside shoulder up and in for another stride of circle, take a little bit of an indirect inside rein—not by pulling, but by turning the knuckles of your left hand toward your right hip. One of the first and biggest mistakes a horse will attempt to make in shoulder-in is to lean on his inside shoulder. That extra little bit of indirect left rein throws just a penny’s worth more weight onto his right shoulder—his outside shoulder—which will really make him engage, sit down and get more expressive with his inside hind.\nEncourage your horse’s shoulder to come off the track and stay off by turning your chest and shoulders toward the arena on about a 30-degree angle. And tell his haunches to continue straight down the long side by directing laser beams out of your hips and straight down the track. On each up-beat, when his inside hind and outside fore are in flight, strongly squeeze your inside leg at the girth, almost with the feeling that you’re pushing your inside hip toward his outside shoulder and down the track.\nAfter three to five strides—your horse won’t be able to hold the bend longer than that at first—ride another 10-meter circle. He already has his forehand off the rail, even if he’s lost a little bend, so just relax your inside leg, soften your inside indirect rein, smoothly bring your hips around so they’re once again parallel to your shoulders and perpendicular to the circular track and—boom! You’re circling.\nAs you return to the rail, repeat the aids for shoulder-in: Think, “We’re going to circle again”—but the moment your horse’s shoulders come away from the track and both your chest and his are facing into the arena, turn your hips so they’re facing down the long side, take an indirect inside rein, add a very strong inside leg and continue in shoulder-in to the end of the arena.\nNow, this is important: On a young horse or on one who’s just learning shoulder-in, I never get to the end of the long side and simply straighten him by bringing his shoulders back onto the track in front of his haunches. Instead, I ride one more 10-meter circle in the corner because it re-establishes any balance or bend he may have lost and reinforces the idea of bringing his shoulder up and in. (I begin or finish shoulder-in without circling only when he can stay balanced, expressive and almost perfect in shoulder-in all the way down the long side.)\nMake It Even MORE Gymnastic\nWhen you’re comfortably going the full length of the arena in shoulder-in, increase the difficulty by asking your horse for some forward and back in shoulder-in. The first few times you ask, be ready—with a clear indirect rein and strong leg on the inside and with a good half-halting rein on the outside—for him to say “OK” but then try to straighten his body.\nRide shoulder-in on a circle. Try a shoulder-in spiral-in and spiral-out. Or here’s a challenging exercise that my mentor, Erich Bubbel, taught me: Stay in shoulder-in left the entire time you ride from F to B, turn left at B, turn left at E and ride from E to K.\nWhat if …\n• You feel your horse trying to throw his haunches out, rather than bring his shoulders in? Hold his haunches with a stronger outside leg.\n• His shoulders stay on the track and only his head and neck come in? Make sure you’re not just pulling his head and neck around (as I’m doing in the “Wrong” photo above). Then take a step back and review the easier movement of leg-yield on the rail (see the photo on page 23) to remind him that his shoulders can come in while his haunches stay out.\n• Your horse loses his even bend from poll to tail and so develops too much angle? Check to make sure your inside hand is looking toward your outside hip. Then immediately circle 10 meters to restore the correct bend from poll to tail and to remind him about bringing his outside fore up and in.\n• Your horse gets slower and slower? This is such a common problem that I’ve never known a horse to become more forward while learning shoulder-in. (In fact, if you know one, I’d like to meet him!) That said, I am OK with your horse’s slowing down a little bit to figure out the movement, but not so much that he falls behind your leg and the movement becomes more difficult. If that happens, just circle and refresh him with some “forward,” even if you have to post the trot or ride a bigger 12- or even 15-meter circle. Remember he must always respond by going forward.\nA Colorado native who spent time riding hunters and jumpers as a teenager, Leslie Webb switched to dressage in 1978. During this time, she started working with U.S. Olympic Three-Day Eventing Coach Erich Bubbel and moved to California to train with him. “I was riding a lot of hotheaded and extremely athletic horses, and Erich and I had to come up with patterns that could communicate training precepts to them in a doable, non-confrontational way. Over the years, I came to realize that these patterns worked with all horses, not just hotheaded ones, so I refined and streamlined them until they developed into the training system I use today.”\nWhen Leslie began teaching, “I had to give my students clear, doable homework assignments with clear, concrete, step-by-step tools to guide them,” she says. So she went back to the meticulous notebooks she kept during her time with Erich. That was the foundation for a series of articles that first ran in the pages of Practical Horseman and was later turned into the book, Build a Better Athlete, now in its 10th year of publication.\nA 1995 Pan American Games team and individual silver medalist and multiple USEF, USDF and CDS award winner, Leslie continues to compete and train horses and students in Bakersfield, California.\nAdapted from Build a Better Athlete! by Leslie Webb with permission from The Equine Network.

As with my article on shoulder-in, I thought we should start with a quick glimpse of the history of this highly controversial movement before looking at the reasons for doing (or not doing) travers and then finishing with the ‘how-to-dos’.\nTravers was first written about by the Duke of Newcastle (1592 – 1676). Newcastle introduced haunches-in along the wall to work the horse’s haunches. In his book ‘William Cavendish, A General System of Horsemanship’ he said that “The inside hand combined with the outside leg works the croup because the inside rein pushes the inside hind leg outwards, at the same time that the outside leg pushes the outside leg inwards. By combining these aids, the horse must bring his hind legs underneath himself.” He went on to recommend that the horse should be worked in both directions in this manner before starting haunches-in on a volte (small circle) at a walk.\nSalomon de la Broue (1630-1610) and François Robichon de la Guérinière (1688-1751) both had doubts about the value of travers and recommended the use of renvers (haunches-out) instead. In fact, Guérinière stated that he thought a horse trained in haunches-in relied on the wall to prevent the outside front shoulder falling out rather than the rider’s aids. De la Broue was of the same opinion but thought that haunches-in was beneficial for horses that were heavy in the hand. These two masters had a profound effect on the French school, and neither Boucher, whom mentions the movement in passing or Fillis wrote much about haunches-in.\nGustav Steinbrecht (1808 – 1885) felt that travers should be taught once shoulder-in was established. He believed that travers was extremely beneficial in developing true collection as correct travers “requires greater flexion of the forehand than the shoulder-in” and that travers was unsurpassed for improving the trot.\nAlois Podhajsky (1898 – 1973) on the other hand, questioned the use of travers. He thought that travers encouraged the horses’ natural tendency towards crookedness and that any advantages obtained from the exercise were outweighed by the disadvantages. He advocated the use of renvers, as he felt this offered all the advantages of travers without the disadvantages.\nSo if the disadvantages of travers are to encourage crookedness and to overweight the outside shoulder, what are the advantages of travers? Firstly the movement teaches the horse to engage it’s outside hind leg through correct flexion of all 3 joints. Secondly it lightens the horse’s shoulders and finally by stretching the outside of the horse it increases suppleness. In fact like shoulder-in, quarters-in is the equivalent to a Pilates work out for the horse and helps develop the horse for collection.\nObviously if you are competing in dressage you will need to perform travers by the time you get to advanced medium level in BD or second level in the States. The FEI Rule Book states in article 412, that the “main aim of the exercise is to develop and increase the engagement of the hindquarters and thereby also the collection”, and this is fundamentally why I believe we should all teach our horse the movement, as it helps the horse develop the correct muscles to carry a rider.\nThe rules go on to describe the movement as follows: “The Horse should be slightly bent round the inside leg of the Athlete but with a greater degree of bend than in shoulder-in. A constant angle of approximately thirty five (35) degrees should be shown (from the front and from behind one sees four tracks). The forehand remains on the track and the quarters are moved inwards. The horse’s outside legs pass and cross in front of the inside legs. The horse is bent in the direction in which it is moving”.\nUnder FEI rules travers can be performed either in Collected trot or Collected canter, however, the walk should be used for introducing the movement and one should refrain from practising the movement in canter as much as possible as it can lead to a crooked strike-off.\nYet another important benefit of travers is that quarters-in prepares the horse for the half pass. Basically travers and half pass are almost the same movement; it is just that they are done on different lines and with a bit more angle required for half pass.\nSo having considered the pros and cons of the movement, how do we go about teaching travers to our horse? As with shoulders-in I like to teach travers to the horse and rider separately. With the horse I teach the movement either on-line (using a cavesson) or in-hand. There are a number of methods that cover teaching travers to the horse with simple ground work exercises. I will be producing an article on this shortly but details can be found on the Straightness Training website. If you are not a Straightness Training student and would like more information Manolo Mandez has some great ground work exercises that can be rented through Vimeo and Bent Branderup has some downloads for purchase in his on-line shop.\nAs far as the rider goes, I believe the best way to learn what do with our body is to ‘play act’ travers without the horse. At the Rider Biomechanics clinics I often use pool noodles with handles to help the students feel the movement. These work brilliantly as they are able to give the student an immediate visual reference as to whether they are getting the movement right or wrong. If you want to give this a try and haven’t got a pool noodle don’t worry, just try walking the movement anyway. Make sure your hips are pointing forward and that your head and shoulders are facing forward and are level. Ensure that your upper arms are close to your torso and bent at the elbows as though you are holding an imaginary tray of drinks. Now start to walk in a straight line (preferably by a wall). Then bring your inside hip forward fractionally and take your outside hip back, ensuring that you keep your upper body pointing straight ahead and your head over your sternum. Be very careful not to collapse to the inside as you turn your lower body, or as is more common turn your shoulders to the outside. Try walking a couple of steps in this position. Feel how your outside leg starts to step further under. That’s the equivalent of your horse starting to engage his outside hind leg more. We need to be able to do the movement easily, without tension and without turning our torso to the outside or collapsing to the inside before we think about trying to do it on horseback!\nOnce we can do the above exercise without thinking about it and our horse can happily perform travers down the entire long side of the arena on-line or in-hand without losing rhythm, then it is time for us to try to ride travers.\nYou should always begin asking for travers in walk. Ensure that you have a relaxed horse and that the walk is active and free-flowing. It is important to be conscious of this so that you do not lose the rhythm or tempo and the gait is not be impaired in any way as the travers begins.\n- Use the corner before the long side of the school to help you set up. As you start down the long side check that your horse’s head is pointing straight ahead. Look forward yourself, so you are looking between your horse’s ears.\n- Bring your inside leg and hip forward and move your outside leg (and hip) back slightly to ask the horse’s hindquarters to move inwards towards a 35 degree angle. At this stage it doesn’t matter if you get the correct angle, just the try.\n- Keep your inside leg on the girth to maintain impulsion and flexion to the inside.\n- Your inside rein will maintain a soft contact and flexion.\n- If necessary use a small touch of the dressage whip on the horse’s outside hip.\n- Look for one or two strides only and then continue straight and reward your horse. Do not ask for too much, too soon.\n- DO NOT …Look behind at the horse’s quarters – although this is a cheat’s way to initiate the movement and can be deliberately utilised to get the feel of quarters-in, it should not be necessary if both you and your horse have practised this movement separately. If you look over your shoulder at your horse’s quarters your horse will bring his head and shoulders to the outside, and you will need to correct with more inside rein.\n- DO NOT …Collapse your inside hip.\n- DO NOT …Allow your upper body to become crooked.\n- DO NOT …Swing your outside lower leg too far back.\n- DO NOT …Allow the impulsion to wane. This can and does happen when you are teaching the movement. It probably means you are asking for too much, too soon. Straighten up, reward your horse and next time ask for just one step.\n- DO NOT …Ask for too much angle. If this happens the chances are you have looked to the outside, turned your shoulders to the outside or taken your outside leg too far back. It is important that the horse continues to step under his point of mass with his outside hind and not behind it.\n- DO NOT …Allow the horse to look to the outside. This will move his whole body into a sideways movement.\nA COMMON MISTAKE is for the rider to lean away from the movement in travers. The horse (unless specifically trained to the contrary) follows the rider’s bodyweight and it will naturally go in the direction the rider’s body leans towards. If the rider’s weight and his rein aids are giving conflicting signals to the horse, the rider is setting up the horse to fail. Instead, ride the horse in travers and if you need to, weight your inside stirrup as the inside hind leg comes forward. That way, you and your horse will move forward in the movement TOGETHER. This creates more expression and better flow and movement.\nLook for a few quality strides only, then straighten your horse and ride away. By asking little and rewarding frequently you will soon be able to maintain travers along the whole long side of the arena, easily and in rhythm.\nOnce you can do this try:\n- Travers on a circle\n- Travers in trot\n- Ride shoulder-in along the long side to E or B, then do a 10m circle followed by travers for the rest of the long side.\nThe travers (haunches-in) is the first movement we teach a horse in which he bends in the direction of the line of travel. Learning travers is a prelude to teaching half pass, which requires quite a lot of lateral suppleness and cadence. These movements are the only two in dressage where the forehand is on the line of travel with the haunches displaced."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c5ed04f1-1eb4-42cc-8d1b-8c555b02fecc>","<urn:uuid:58b4f819-2cdb-4b9c-b61a-c9f4eb30f0b9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain the environmental impact of construction waste and its proper management benefits?","answer":"Construction waste materials are often inert and non-biodegradable, heavy, bulky, and overload landfills. When waste materials break down, they release pollutants and chemical stews that harm the environment. However, proper waste management through recycling helps protect the environment and offers benefits including cost reduction, increased productivity, improved health, waste minimization, environmental protection, better life quality, and better use of materials.","context":["Sustainability In Construction In The UAE\nAl Fahim, Ahmed Taha\nMetadataShow full item record\nThe realization of the construction projects is dependent on the successful realization of a large set of criteria. Among them, the key role is played by the following parameters: budget and schedule requirements to the project, quality characteristics, and security of potential stakeholders that will utilize the construction facility in the future. Due to the definition of the rising role of sustainability in operations of the business, the criteria of sustainability were also identified as an important requirement for the construction project in different countries, including the UAE. In this dissertation, this paper aims to provide a complex and detailed answer to the range of questions in the sphere of sustainable waste management for construction projects in the UAE. The significance of this theme was defined with the rising demand for realization of the construction projects in the country, and the associated increase of risk level for the organizations and stakeholders in the sphere of waste management. For the aims of the study, the following research questions were addressed: definition of key construction and demolition waste streams in the construction sector of the UAE; assessment of the potential impact of construction waste on the environment in the UAE; definition of the existing rules and legal regulations applied to the organization of sustainable waste management in the UAE; and definition of required and recommended changes to the existing practices in waste management for the UAE construction sector to make it more sustainable. To implement the stated research objectives, the procedure of the study was divided into four key stages - literature review, the quantitative method applied through the survey that was distributed to the sample size of 106 participants, the analysis of the results, and the generation of recommendations. In the context of the literature review, the following questions were addressed: definition of different types of construction and demolition waste in the UAE construction sector; the disposal of the waste streams; assessment of the potential impact of different types of construction waste on the environment; comparison of types of waste sources that are properly and improperly managed in the UAE; existing rules and regulations applied for waste management segment of the UAE construction sector; specific statistics describing the problem of waste management in the UAE; specific factors that lead to ineffective waste management and recommendations that could be applied to guarantee an improved quality of waste management in the UAE construction sector. The results of the literature review had to contribute to a full understanding of the current situation in the sphere of waste management in the UAE and abroad. Results of the literature review defined the actual level of the issue’s significance, key sources of problems, and potential solutions that could be applied for the aims of recommendations development. A quantitative study of primary data collection from 106 participants had to contribute to the definition of the actual situation from the point of view of employees and management operating in the UAE construction sector. The following groups of stakeholders engaged in the UAE construction sector were applied for the study: developer, contractor, consultant, government, and private sector. According to the results, a major part of the participants was aware of sustainability issues in their sphere of work. The effectiveness of sustainability practices applied in their work was assessed as high by the majority of participants. Among the factors of waste management, respondents considered the factors of cost, productivity, waste reduction, and adequate skills as most important. Participants agreed that both private business and government should pay much more attention to the sphere of waste management in the construction sector. Among the benefits of effective construction waste management, participants of the study-oriented on the factors of cost reduction, increased productivity, improved health, waste minimization, environmental protection, better life quality, and better use of materials. Based on the study findings, specific recommendations were developed for the UAE construction sector in general. Following findings are important to mention: the need for companies to work toward recycling of construction waste materials; the need for the government to develop a set of clear and transparent rules for the regulation of waste management procedures; requirement for a business to increase the level of awareness and education of employees on the issues of sustainable waste management; and prioritization of reuse of the construction waste materials. Taken together, these measures should contribute to the transformation of waste management practices in the UAE for higher productivity and effectiveness.","Krause provides construction waste management and construction waste recycling systems to solve a wide range of solid waste and other recycling problems.

{"question":"Can you compare the compression set characteristics of colored silicone rubber versus HNBR elastomers?","answer":"For silicone rubber, compression set testing has shown that adding pigments (in the range of 0% to 4%) does not significantly affect the material's physical properties, including its compression set characteristics. The study demonstrated that color variation can be considered to have low severity during process validations and risk assessment. HNBR elastomers, particularly when peroxide cured, have the best compression set and heat resistance among their category. HNBRs are specifically noted for combining good compression set properties with resistance to various media like hot water, steam up to 150°C, and industrial lubricants. They are positioned as filling the performance gap between NBRs and FKMs in applications requiring both heat and aggressive media resistance.","context":["Silicone rubber is a very versatile material, especially when considering its uses in the medical industry. Silicone is used to create a variety of items – precision O-ring seals, splash and dust covers, implantable wiper seals, and more. Silicone holds up well to many forms of sterilization, including steam, ETO, and Gamma.\nWhile many silicone parts are unpigmented (naturally clear silicone), most customers choose to have the material pigmented. This allows for easier identification and inspection of parts during assembly. Colored silicone is also used to create a particular “look” on the overall finished product, which is possible because silicone is available in a wide variety of standard and custom-matched colors.\nThe common practice of coloring silicone has led to a frequent question: does adding pigment to the silicone affect its physical properties? It is a valid concern. Recently, a small study was conducted to proactively alleviate some of that concern.\nTypically, most silicone is pigmented with colorant in the range of 1% to 3%. For our comparison, we evaluated the same batch of liquid silicone over the range of 0% to 4% color at 1% intervals. All tests slabs were cured for 20 minutes at 350°F and then post-cured for four hours at 400°F. All testing was performed on 70 durometer Shore A liquid silicone rubber with the addition of a standard cobalt blue pigment.\nThe first property we checked is the same one most people review when beginning to look at physical properties: durometer. For this test, a handheld gauge based on the ASTM D2240 Shore A scale for three stacked tensile test specimens was used and repeated three times for each of the five test mixes.\nFigure 1: Shore A hardness vs. color percentage\nTensile and Elongation\nSince durometer is a non-destructive test, we could then use those specimens to run three tensile tests to the ASTM D412 standard. In our setup, we used an MTS QTest 10 to pull the specimens in tension at a speed of 20 inches per minutes.\nFigure 2: Tensile Strength (psi) vs. Color percentage and Elongation vs. Color Percentage\nThe next property tested was tear resistance. Silicone applications are generally somewhat sensitive to tearing. Any degradation should be more apparent here. The same MTS QTest 10 machine was used to run the ASTM D624 Tear resistance test, as well as Die B, which has a small slit that cuts into the test specimen to create a stress concentration at the point of most geometric stress.\nFigure 3: Tear resistance (ppi) vs. Color percentage\nThe last test is one that is considered crucial to any sealing application: compression set. Compression set is important because it is an accelerated aging test that helps quantify the material’s ability to resist permanent deformation.\nWe used the plied disk method of ASTM D395 to conduct a compression set test. This requires three stacks, cut from the slabs, of three disks. The heights of the stacks are then measured so that they can be compressed 25% in a fixture. In this instance, they were put in an oven for 22 hours at 175°C. The stacks were then removed from the fixture and allowed to sit for 30 minutes before a final measurement was taken.\nComparing the initial heights before testing to the compressed heights after testing determines the final percent loss in height (permanent deformation) over that compression period, or the ‘set’ that the material took.\nFigure 4: Compression Set (%) vs. Color percentage\nIt is apparent from the graphs there are no significant changes to the materials physical properties over the typical pigmentation range of silicone rubber. As long as the silicone is within the normal range of colorant addition, then there should not be any significant physical property variation outside the normal variation of silicone rubber. Therefore, during process validations and risk assessment, color variation can be considered to have low severity.\nUltimately, it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure correct material choice.

We have years of experience designing and developing rubber parts whose functions vary from mundane hose washers to seemingly magical medical devices.","Elastomer Material Types A-Z\nACM elastomers offer excellent heat resistance; they can typically be used at temperatures of 150°C (up to 175°C for limited periods). They provide high resistance to oxygen, ozone and industrial oils. Resistance to water is generally poor, and compression set and low temperature flexibility depend on base polymer and compounding choice. ACM elastomers are used primarily used where combined resistance to heat and oils is required.\nAEM rubber materials offer an unusual combination of physical properties; high heat resistance (up to 175°C), excellent ozone and weather resistance, moderate resistance to mineral oils, low temperature flexibility to –30°C, good resistance to hot water and high tensile strength. AEM applications are similar to ACM elastomers, but with an advantage where low temperature flexibility is concerned. They are typically moulded into O-rings seals, boots and ignition wire jackets.\nAU / EU\nThese elastomers generally show outstanding tensile strength, tear and abrasion resistance, and give excellent protection against oxygen and ozone (except in hot climates, due to greater risk of microbiological attack in AU types, and ultraviolet light in the case of EU types. EU elastomers have a better low temperature flexibility (-35°C typically) and both have excellent resistance to high-energy radiation (106 Rads).\nPolyurethane rubbers are used where high abrasion resistance and oil / solvent resistance are required together, e.g. hydraulic seals and gaskets, diaphragms, hoses and roller-skate and skateboard wheels. In all applications, consideration should be given to hydrolysis and limited heat resistance.\nCR seal materials typically display good resistance to ozone, heat aging and chemicals. Good resistance to refrigerants, aliphatic hydrocarbons, mineral oils and greases. Typical trade name: Neoprene™ (DuPont)\nChlorobutadiene rubbers contain chlorine in the polymer to reduce the reactivity to many oxidising agents, as well as to oil and flame. CR elastomers also have good resistance to ozone cracking, heat ageing and chemical attack. Some of the important applications of CR elastomers include Vee-belts, coated fabrics, cable jackets, tyre-sidewalls, seals and gaskets in contact with refrigerants, mild chemicals and atmospheric ozone.\nCSM grades contain 24-43% chlorine content to provide excellent ozone and weather resistance, discoloration by sun and ultraviolet light, high resistance to many oxidising and corrosive chemicals, good resistance to dry heat to 150°C, low flammability and gas permeability, and also good resistance to hot water (when cured with lead oxide).\nThe low temperature properties are generally limited, depending on the chlorine content of the CSM grade used, and the compression set is not very good. CSM elastomers are generally useful in electrical applications, weather resistant membranes, hoses and acid resistant tank linings.\nECO elastomers are generally resistant to high temperatures, oils, ozone and flame, with gas resistance comparable to NBRs. The temperature range for continuous use is –40 to +120°C, but are generally unsuitable for rubber to metal bonding (they are corrosive to metals). ECO elastomers are suitable for use in seals, gaskets, diaphragms, cable jackets, belting etc, for a wide range of media. However, they are unsuitable for use with ketones and esters, alcohols, phosphate ester hydraulic fluids, sour gas, water and steam.\nEPDM elastomers have a fair tensile strength and excellent resistance to weathering, ozone and chemical attack. They also exhibit excellent electrical insulation properties. Peroxide cured elastomers exhibit excellent heat ageing, and resistance to compression set from –40 to +150°C, more so if sulphur cured. They are resistant to a wide range of media, including hot water and steam to 200°C (in the absence of air), but are not considered compatible with mineral and synthetic lubricants, and hydrocarbon fuels. They are typically used in the production of window and door seals, wire and cable insulations, waterproofing sheets and hoses, and seals, O-rings and gaskets.\nThis is the most chemically resistant elastomer available and is effectively a rubber form of PTFE. It displays other properties which prove most valuable in applications where purity, high temperatures and retention of sealing force are paramount.\nFKM seal materials demonstrate outstanding resistance to heat, weather, ozone, oxygen and oxidisers, with very low gas permeability. PPE’s FKM seal materials include copolymer, terpolymer and tetrapolymer grades and bisphenol and peroxide cure systems.\nFKM elastomers are highly fluorinated polymers containing few compounding ingredients. They are stable at very high temperatures (they can withstand 200°C / 400°F indefinitely, in service). By comparison, conventional elastomers would become brittle in 24 hours at this temperature, in air. FKM vulcanisates, in general, have outstanding resistance to oxygen, ozone, weather, flame and oxidative chemicals, and excellent resistance to swelling in a wide variety of media. However, they are not compatible with polar solvents (e.g. M.E.K.), some organic acids (e.g. Formic acid), certain methanol and ester based hydraulic fluids (e.g. Skydrol), ammonia and some amines. They are suitable in high-energy radiation environments up to about 106 Rads. Special grades of FKM may be required for use in hot water and steam applications.\nFKM elastomers provide high compression set resistance if compounded with bisphenol cure systems. Generally they are serviceable down to –30°C, but specialist grades (such as Endura® V91A) can provide effective sealing down to –45°C. Electrical insulation properties are not particularly outstanding, but would be adequate for sheathing where elevated temperatures, ozone, chemical and flame resistance are required (e.g. shaft seals, O-rings and gaskets, diaphragms and cable sheathing).\nCopolymer, Terpolymer or Tetrapolymer\nFluoroelastomer or fluorocarbon (FKM/FPM) materials are available in three general types depending on their fluorine content and the number of monomers contained with the polymer:\n|65 - 65.5%||Contains two monomers (simple molecules from which polymers are built).|\nGeneral purpose, most common, most widely used for sealing.\nBest compression set and very good fluid resistance.\nOften referred to as 'A' and 'E' type grades.\nThese are normally the least cost types of compound.\n(B or F)\n|67%||Contains three monomers.|\nBetter fluid and oil/solvent resistance than copolymers but at the expense of poorer compression set resistance.\nOften referred to as 'B' or 'F' type grades.\n'F' grades offer superior fluid resistance over 'B' grades.\n|67 - 69%||Contains four monomers.|\nImproved fluid resistance over other types, including acids and solvents. Compression set better than terpolymers. These are sometimes known as 'G' grades.\nIn addition, certain tetrapolymers have good low-temperature flexibility.\nTetrapolymers are the most costly of the three type listed here.\nTetrapolymer materials can also be referred to as GF, GLT and GFLT grades which correspond to Viton® FKM materials.\nGF - Good high temperature performance and chemical resistance but reduced mechanical properties and low temperature performance.\nGLT - Improved low temperature performance but reduced chemical resistance.\nGFLT - Good all-round low/high temperature performance and chemical resistance.\nViton® is a registered trademark of The Chemours Company.\nFVMQ elastomers are modified silicone rubbers, with superior fluid resistance, but limited to about 175°C (347°F).\nThe hydrogenation process of NBR elastomers provides excellent heat and ozone resistance. Peroxide cured HNBRs have the best compression set and heat resistance, and high-nitrile (ACN) HNBR elastomers have better resistance to mineral oils. HNBRs combine best resistance and low temperature flexibility, although they are more expensive than NBRs. HNBRs are useful where resistance is required to ozone and weather, ageing in hot air and industrial lubricants, hot water and steam to 150°C, amine based corrosion inhibitors and sour gas (H2S), and high-energy radiation.\nHNBRs fill the gap between NBRs and FKMs in many areas of application where resistance to heat and aggressive media are required simultaneously, and may therefore provide a lower cost alternative to FKM elastomers.\nResistant to the same fluid types as EPDM, the distinctive properties of IIR rubber materials are very low gas and moisture permeability, excellent insulating properties, good ozone and weathering resistance, and resistance to many organic and inorganic media.\nIIR elastomer materials can be polymerised with various halogens (e.g. Chlorine / Bromine) to improve resistance to certain chemical media, but at the expense of electrical insulation and moisture resistance. They can be used from –40 to +120°C typically, and are mostly used in the production of tyre inner tubes, seals and gaskets, vacuum seals, membranes and pharmaceutical goods.\nNBR (BUNA N)\nNBR elastomers are available in five basic grades; based on acrylonitrile content, giving proportional physical and chemical properties. NBRs typically have (depending on increased ACN content), decreasing low temperature flexibility, increasing compression set, gas permeability, improved heat ageing and ozone resistance, improved tensile and abrasion strength, hardness and density. NBRs are used where good resistance is required, to aromatic hydrocarbons at –40 to +120°C (e.g. gaskets and seals, hoses and cable jacketing), typically in the oil and gas industry.\nHigh Nitrile: >45% ACN content\nMedium Nitrile: 30-45% ACN content\nLow Nitrile: <30% ACN content\nThe higher the ACN content, the higher the resistance to aromatic hydrocarbons.\nThe lower the ACN content, the better the low temperature flexibility.\nThe best overall balance for most applications is medium ACN content.\nNatural rubber (tapped from the cultivated rubber tree) exhibits high tensile strength, abrasion resistance, resilience, tear strength and low hysteresis.\nThe chemically similar polyisoprene has lower strength properties than the natural form but better low-temperature properties. Both rubbers are susceptible to degradation by weathering characteristics, and both show poor resistance to mineral and petroleum-based oils and fuels. Typical long-term operating range is from -50°C to 70°C, with the main applications being tyres, vibration mounts, springs and bearings.\nProduced as a substitute for NR (Natural Rubber); in general, SBRs can be used in similar applications as NR / IR elastomers, except in severe dynamic applications (e.g. requiring low heat build-up on flexing). SBRs can be used in tread compounds on car tyres, but not truck tyres. SBRs have inferior weathering and chemical resistance to most other elastomers.\nTFE/P (also known as FEPM)\nThe base polymer is solely produced by the Asahi Glass company, and sold under the name ‘Aflas’. TFE/P vulcanisates exhibit similar thermal stability to FKM elastomers, but better electrical resistance and a different chemical resistance profile (e.g. sour gas, acids and alkalis, ozone and weather, steam and water, all hydraulic and brake fluids, alcohols and high energy radiation). However, they are not compatible to aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. M.E.K. and acetone), organic acetates and organic refrigerants.\nFKM elastomers exhibit better compression set. The low temperature flexibility is relatively poor (except in certain fluids that would plasticise the rubber to some extent). It is always recommended to carry out functional tests under working conditions. TFE/P elastomers are finding wide application; mainly in oil-field operations and chemical processing as O-rings, seals and gaskets, cable insulating, jacketing and hose liners.\nThe distinctive properties of silicone rubbers are outstanding resistance to ozone and corona, outdoor weather and sunlight. Special compounds will withstand up to 300°C; however, in the absence of air, silicones can revert to a paste, even at lower temperatures. The usual high temperature limit, quoted for continuous service, is 200°C. Silicones have an excellent reputation for their low temperature flexibility (some compounds to –90°C) and electrical insulation, which are maintained fairly constant at the full range of service temperatures. Electrically conductive compounds are also available.\nSilicones have a low level of combustible components; even when exposed to flame, the elastomer is reduced to a non-conducting silica ash. Silicones also exhibit excellent compression set and high physiological inertness (tasteless, odourless and completely non-toxic).\nSilicones are also resistant to bacteria, fungi, high energy radiation (to 106 Rads) and excellent release properties (except to glass). The main limitations are low tensile properties and poor resistance to acids, alkalis and steam above 120°C. Silicone elastomeric parts are used for electrical insulation, gaskets and O-rings (static or low dynamic applications only), food and pharmaceutical goods.\nFurther information quick links:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:02238051-c8b4-4d4b-8027-7d6835670605>","<urn:uuid:16988308-427f-489a-9568-697759659150>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the analog and digital elements compare between Sculpture's production process and the TouchMix-16 mixer's features?","answer":"Both systems blend analog and digital elements, but in different ways. Sculpture's process involves analog elements like tape loops, tape recorders, and hardware samplers combined with digital production in Ableton Live. The TouchMix-16 mixer similarly combines analog inputs (like XLR microphone connections and TRS line inputs) with digital processing, including 32-bit floating point processing, digital effects like reverb and delay, and digital control through its touchscreen interface.","context":["In our series Input/Output, we pull up a stool in the studios of producers from the Ableton Community, inviting them to shed light on the inspirations, techniques and technologies that feed into their production process, and the latest music to come out of it.\nSculpture is the London-based duo of animator/visual artist Reuben Sutherland and musician/producer Dan Hayhurst. Embracing digital and analog media, tactile and virtual approaches in equal measure, Sculpture’s immersively psychedelic audio-visual output over the past six years has lost none of the joyful ‘let’s-just-see-what-happens’ spirit with which the project began. Check out the video below to get a sense of Sculpture’s truly unique modus operandi, then read our interview with Dan Hayhurst on the occasion of the release of Membrane Pop, via Oneohtrix Point Never's Brooklyn-based Software label.\nScultpure play a live show at Frankfurt’s saasfee* pavillion\nYou call Sculpture an “opto-musical agglomerate”, please explain.\nWe could refer to it as an AV project but I feel the world needs more romance. It's a multi-sensory investigation into perceptual/emotional stimulation – the visible and the audible are of equal importance and each informs the other. 'Agglomerate' makes me think of an entity – something with a life that's more than the sum of it's parts. It could be manufactured, like a polymer or robot, it could be organic. Also, maybe it's a temporary state/arrangement, like it might disperse again or reconfigure.\nHow did the two of you happen to come together?\nWe were neighbours in a big warehouse in London – the kind that is just barely converted into habitable space; paper thin walls, freezing in winter, a greenhouse in summer. Reuben was working with this animation technique using discs like a phenakistoscope and a video camera, and I was contributing to the warped local conditions with this kind of odd music that I like to make... it might have been influencing his brain patterns early on in some way, leaking through the wall. Mind you, he was pretty far into the wormhole already. We knew each other for maybe a year before we started to work together. There was obvious common ground and we thought we'd test the potential of a collaboration by staging a performance. We didn't work together in advance, we just performed simultaneously without knowing exactly what the other would do. So the material itself is sort of leading the way in terms of connections being formed, juxtapositions and frames of association and reference – the interaction of different sensory elements.\nOne of Sculpture’s zoetropic picture disc vinyls as designed by Reuben\nWhat are the commonalities of your approaches to the media you each work in?\nThere's a conversation between digital and physical; algorithms/processes manifesting themselves in the physical world in some way. We use techniques of spontaneous rearrangement, in Reuben's case he literally has a 'library' of hundreds of animations on printed cards – more than he can reasonably keep under control, and it's growing all the time like a nervous system. They're being generated in Photoshop and After Effects and transferred to this tactile medium. I'm combining physical cut-ups with analogue tape and hardware instrumentation (samplers / CDJ deck) with digital techniques for disintegrating and reconfiguring audio, for which I'm using Live pretty much entirely.\nThe 'conversation between digital and physical' that you mention – how does that become part of the production process? For instance, in the making of the new album?\nI tend to work on elements of things that can be recombined in different permutations, rather than discrete 'tracks'. So, building up a library of rhythms, sounds, harmonic elements, tones, percussion etc. Things from completely different times like 'found material' recorded in 1955 but also stuff I make myself. There are things from five years ago, last week, this afternoon – stuff I've completely forgotten ever making. This 'library' is then also expanded out across various reels of tape, tape loops and samplers in the physical world. It's pretty chaotic to be honest! These sources tend to get recorded into Live at some point, and then also I'm recording Live's output back to various tape recorders (often making tape loops) and samplers like a Korg ES1 or Teenage Engineering OP1.\nI'll do stuff like record an old bit of tape with some random recording from the the ‘60s on it into Live, convert that to MIDI data and use that to fire off samples in Drum Racks. These could be 'hits', but are just as likely to be longer recording like a few meters of tape. Each chain of devices would typically be Pitch > Arpeggiator > Random > Scale > Simpler. And I'll use macros to control stuff like chance of pitch randomisation, sample start point, arp rate, sample length etc. I use an APC 40 as a control surface. I'll use clip automation on the macros too. You can very quickly atomise and rearrange all kinds of material this way.\nWhat I end up with is a collection of re-combinable elements spread across different media; Live Clips/Sessions/Arrangements, tape loops, reels of tape, cassettes, CDRs, hardware samplers. Through continually trying out different permutations both in the studio and live, routines eventually coalesce into 'finished tracks'. At that point I'm recording things back into Live and using it to edit and arrange.\nSometimes it’s layering things semi-randomly. So, for instance with the new LP, the thing that 'finished' it off was dropping a recording of a gig into the final arrangement at random and several things along the timeline just clicking with each other in just the right way. I'm really into the idea of unplanned simultaneity creating new connections/associations…\nA video for Sculpture’s ‘Plastic Infinite’ release, featuring the animated picture disc on which it\nWhat's your setup for playing live? Is there much direct interaction between you and Reuben? Or is it more a case of going down parallel roads to the same destination?\nWe both have a setup with enough flexibility to be able to respond to what the other is doing in the same way that two musicians would. Similarly with the way some of the music has already become 'fixed' in a repeatable routine, whereas some of it is still in an exploratory stage (and some of it is improv). Reuben has his unruly library of animation cards which he plays on a record player with a video camera suspended above it. It's visual turntablism.\nHe has some animations up his sleeve that he knows he wants to use when he hears certain sounds – but much of the time it's more about unplanned simultaneity. Your brain finds connections and associations in the perceptual information its receiving. And, we're generating a lot of information very quickly.... it's a high energy event. That said, we've been working together for 6 years so we know what kind of thing is going to work... it's not like it's completely random.\nI don't use a computer live. I always transfer computer generated material to other media. The reason is that I find a computer/screen occupies too much attention in this context. So I have a collection of devices that act like a modular instrument. I can play it pretty well but not perfectly, so there are plenty of surprises and unplanned diversions. Reel to reel tape recorder (for tape loops), CDJ deck, a couple of hardware samplers (Korg ES1/ Teenage Engineering OP1), walkman, and effects (ring mod, echo, distortion).\nPlaying live, it all gets a bit out of control – we're both sort of chasing this thing that's just balanced between organisation and chaos. The way that I throw material into Live and use it to try and generate new forms in an unplanned way, that's reflected in the way I use found tape. You're looking for things that trigger emotional/aesthetic responses and sort of lead you to places you wouldn't find otherwise. From a purely 'music production' point of view, you end up with a mixture of things with different tonal qualities that combine together in a really pleasing way. It's also scrambling temporal signifiers – sounds/aesthetics that you associate with different eras. We live in a time when these kind of distinctions are being broken down by the internet and by the enormous amount of information crowding into our sensoria. We're all constantly editing, processing and organising information – our perception of reality is made up of this stuff, and it's quite enjoyable to play with.\nSculpture’s Membrane Pop is out on Software Recording Co\nSee and hear more of Sculpture.","16-channel digital mixer\nOur take on the QSC TouchMix-16 by Crutchfield's Buck Pomerantz\nYou'll get your music sounding right quickly and easily with QSC's TouchMix-16 16-channel digital mixer. This compact and intuitive audio workstation features a bright touchscreen control surface that displays all the knobs, sliders, and meters you'll need to dial in perfect sound for your band, club, or house of worship. Every input channel has access to a 4-band parametric equalizer, high- and low-cut filters, a noise gate, and a compressor all brought instantly onscreen with the touch of a finger. You can view most functions and effects in Advanced Mode for total parameter control, or in Simple Mode for easier operation with fewer control options.\n20 inputs, 10 outputs\nThe TouchMix-16 features sixteen XLR microphone inputs, four of which can also be used as 1/4\" line inputs, and two stereo pair TRS 1/4\" line inputs for a grand total of twenty inputs. In addition to the main left and right outputs, you'll find six XLR balanced auxiliary outs and two stereo pair TRS 1/4\" outputs that can be used for different monitor mixes or for recording.\nEffects included — no need for outboard gear\nYou can use up to four effects at the same time, choosing from six available types of effects including reverb, delay, and chorusing. You can even sweeten up a vocal track with a pitch-correction processor that you can assign to any input channel. The two main and first six auxiliary outputs each have access to a 28-band 1/3 octave graphic equalizer, a dynamic limiter, 4 notch filters (that'll help eliminate feedback), and variable low- and high-cut filters, so you'll have complete control over the sound as it goes out to the speakers. The other Aux outputs each feature a 4-band parametric equalizer as well as the limiter and high- and low-cut filters.\nPresets and wizards\nQSC hired experienced concert sound engineers to create over 100 presets specifically custom-tailored for different instruments and venue types. In addition, you can save all the mixer's settings to a “scene” for recalling that perfect mix for your next appearance at the venue. Gain and FX Wizards help you set up your mixes for the best and most consistent sound quality. The Anti-Feedback Wizard, Room-Tuning Wizard, and real-time analyzer (RTA) all help you set the equalization correctly. You can copy and paste settings from one control to another for faster setups.\nThe TouchMix-16 comes with a padded carrying case\nYou can form up to eight DCA (digitally-controlled attenuator) Groups, so you can control a handful of channels with one fader. You can also create up to eight Mute Groups, so you can turn off groups of microphones when they're not needed.\nWireless iPad® control\nYou plug the included Wi-Fi adapter into one of the TouchMix-16's USB ports to create your own wireless network. Download QSC's iOS TouchMix App to your iPad and you can control your TouchMix-16 wirelessly from virtually any position in the room. You can use the second USB port for digital recording and playback.\nYou can record up to 22 tracks simultaneously from the TouchMix-16 to an external hard drive. (See the Digital Connections Highlights below for requirements.) You can also play your recordings back and mix them to 2-track stereo, and record that on your hard drive as well. The TouchMix-16 gives you a choice of sampling rates for your recordings — 44.1 KHz, recommended for CD-quality recordings, and 48 KHz, for video projects.\n16-channel digital mixer (20 input channels):\n- 12 mono mic inputs (XLR)\n- 4 mono mic/line inputs (combo XLR/TRS)\n- 2 stereo line inputs (1/4\" TRS)\n- phantom power assignable to each mic channel\n- 10 analog mix outputs — Left/Right main (XLR), Aux 1-6 (XLR), Aux 7/8 and 9/10 stereo pairs (1/4\" TRS)\n- 8 DCA Groups possible for controlling group levels\n- 8 Mute Groups possible for muting groups of channels\n- 24-bit AD/DA converters\n- 32-bit floating point processing\n- input channels:\n- +/-15 dB digital gain control\n- 4-band parametric equalizer with high/low shelving\n- dynamic compressor\n- noise gate\n- variable high- and low-pass filters\n- main outputs and aux outputs 1-6:\n- 6-band parametric equalizer\n- 28-band 1/3-octave graphic equalizer\n- dynamic limiter\n- 4 full-frequency notch filters\n- variable high- and low-pass filters\n- aux outputs 7/8 and 9/10:\n- 4-band parametric equalizer\n- dynamic limiter\n- variable high- and low-pass filters\n- 4 effects processors — can each be loaded with:\n- Lush Reverb\n- Dense Reverb\n- Mono Delay\n- Stereo Delay\n- Pitch Shift\n- Pitch Corrector processor can be assigned to any input\n- Firmware upgrade available from QSC.com\n- MP3 playback from USB drive\n- USB Wi-Fi adapter included\n- remote control via iPad, iPad mini, or iPad Air and QSC TouchMix App (requires iOS 6 or higher)\n- 22-track recording and playback via optional external hard drive requires USB 3.0 connection, FAT32 format, and 7800 RPM minimum\n- sampling rates: 44.1 or 48 KHz\n- touchscreen control surface plus fine-tuning master wheel\n- Advanced Mode shows all parameter controls of an effect, Simple Mode displays less options\n- stores up to 130 mixer scenes, 130 channel presets, and 130 FX presets\n- wizards help set gains and effects routing\n- Anti-Feedback Wizard, Room-Tuning Wizard, and real-time analyzer (RTA)\n- headphone and monitor outputs and talkback channel\n- Info button accesses onboard user's manual\n- padded carrying case included\n- weight: 5.9 lbs.\n- dimensions: 14-1/4\" W x 3-9/16\" H x 11-3/4\" D\n- warranty: 1 year\n- Our 60-day money-back guarantee\nWhat's in the Box:\n- 16-Channel digital mixer\n- AC power supply (w/ attached 4' DC cord)\n- 6.5' AC power cord\n- USB WiFi adapter (pre-installed)\n- Carrying case\n- Quick Start Guide\n- Warning Information Sheet\n- Limited Warranty\nFeatures and Specs\n|Line inputs||4 x XLR/TRS, 2 stereo TR|\n|Monitor outputs||6 x XLR, 4 stereo TRS|\n|Effects||Compression, Reverb, Del|\nTouchMix Series Compact Digital Mixer: QSC TouchMix compact digital mixers are designed for musicians, production professionals and live performance venues that need the power and capability of a large \"concert\" mixing console in a compact, affordable and easy to use form.

{"question":"What is the historical significance of the Kandyan kingdom's location at 485 meters elevation in relation to its resistance against foreign powers?","answer":"The elevation and mountainous location of Kandy proved strategically crucial, as the kingdom was able to maintain its independence from foreign invaders (Portuguese, Dutch and English) due to the torturous access routes through mountains. This geographical advantage helped Kandy survive multiple invasions and remain the last independent Sinhalese kingdom until it finally submitted to British rule in 1815.","context":["Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.Join Britannica's Publishing Partner Program and our community of experts to gain a global audience for your work!\n- Introduction & Quick Facts\n- Government and society\n- Cultural life\n- Early settlement and the spread of Buddhism\n- Early growth and political centralization, c. 200 bce–1255 ce\n- Drift to the southwest (1255–1505)\n- Social and economic changes\n- The Portuguese in Sri Lanka (1505–1658)\n- British Ceylon (1796–1900)\n- Constitutionalism and nationalism (c. 1900–48)\nKandy and its struggle with European powers\nRajasinha occupied Kandy, a Sinhalese kingdom in the Central Highlands, about 1580, and its ruler took refuge with the Portuguese. In 1591 the Portuguese launched an expedition to Kandy to enthrone Dom Philip, an heir of the dispossessed ruler. They were accompanied by an ambitious and distinguished Sinhalese military nobleman, Konnappu Bandara. Dom Philip was installed as king but died under suspicious circumstances, and Konnappu Bandara enthroned himself, proclaiming independence from the Portuguese and taking the regnal name of Vimala Dharma Surya. The demise of Sitawake after Rajasinha’s death left Kandy the only independent Sinhalese kingdom.\nThe Portuguese launched another expedition to Kandy, in 1594, under Gen. Pedro Lopes de Sousa, planning to enthrone Dona Catherina, a baptized Sinhalese noblewoman. Popular hostility soon built up toward the seemingly ever-present Portuguese troops. Vimala Dharma Surya took advantage of the agitated atmosphere and, making use of guerrilla warfare tactics, routed the Portuguese army in 1594. He captured Dona Catherina, made her his queen, and legitimized and consolidated his rule. He expanded into the old Sitawake kingdom and emerged as the leader of resistance to the Portuguese. The Portuguese made a few subsequent attempts to subjugate Kandy, but none were successful.\nVimala Dharma Surya realized that without sea power he could not drive the Portuguese out of Sri Lanka. He saw the arrival of the Dutch as an excellent opportunity to gain naval support against his adversaries. The first Dutch envoy, Joris van Spilbergen, met the king in July 1602 and made lavish promises of military assistance. A few months later another Dutch official, Sebald de Weert, arrived with a concrete offer of help and, in view of favourable terms offered by the king, decided to launch a joint attack on the Portuguese. However, a misunderstanding between the king and de Weert caused an altercation between the Kandyans and the Dutch, and de Weert and his men were killed.\nKing Senarath (Senarat) succeeded to the Kandyan throne in 1604 and continued to solicit Dutch support. In 1612 a Dutch envoy, Marcelis Boschouwer, concluded a treaty with Senarath. The king granted the Dutch extensive commercial concessions and a harbour for settlement on the east coast in return for a promise of armed assistance against Portuguese attack. The Dutch ultimately were unable to offer adequate assistance, and so Senarath turned to the Danes. By the time a Danish expedition arrived in May 1620, however, Senarath had concluded a peace agreement with the Portuguese. The truce was short-lived, and in 1630 the Kandyans, taking the offensive, invaded Portuguese territory and laid siege to Colombo and Galle. Again the absence of sea power proved a handicap, and another peace was concluded in 1634.\nIn 1635 Senarath was succeeded by his son Rajasinha II. The Dutch were now firmly established in Batavia (now Jakarta) in Java and were developing their trade in southern Asia. The king sent emissaries to meet the admiral of the Dutch fleet, Adam Westerwolt, who was then blockading Goa, India. The fleet came to Sri Lanka and captured Batticaloa. Westerwolt and Rajasinha II concluded a treaty on May 23, 1638, giving the Dutch a monopoly on most of Sri Lanka’s cinnamon and a repayment in merchandise for expenses incurred in assisting the king. In May 1639 the Dutch fleet captured Trincomalee, and in February 1640 the Dutch and the Kandyans combined to take Negombo. But differences arose over the occupation of captured forts. The Dutch refused to give Trincomalee and Batticaloa to the king until their expenses were paid in full, and Rajasinha II realized that what the Dutch really wanted was to replace the Portuguese as the rulers of the coast.\nRajasinha II nevertheless continued to work with the Dutch to expel the Portuguese. In March 1640 Galle was taken, but the progress of the allies soon was temporarily halted by a truce declared in Europe between the Dutch Republic and Spain, which at that time ruled Portugal and its overseas possessions. In 1645 the boundaries between Portuguese and Dutch territory in Sri Lanka were demarcated. Jan Thijssen was appointed the first Dutch governor.\nThe Dutch peace with the Portuguese and occupation of captured territory incensed the Kandyan king and strained relations between him and the Dutch. In May 1645 war broke out between them. Though Rajasinha II could not conquer the occupied lands, he made them worthless to the Dutch by destroying crops and depopulating villages. The Dutch then realized the advantage of coming to terms with the king. In 1649 a revised treaty was signed. The Dutch agreed to hand over some of the lands but again delayed it because of the immense debt the king was held to owe them.\nThe Dutch truce with the Portuguese expired in 1652, leaving the Dutch free to resume the war. Kandyans launched attacks on Portuguese positions in the interior provinces of Seven Korales, Four Korales, and Sabaragamuwa and pushed the Portuguese back to their coastal strongholds, despite fierce resistance. Rajasinha II was anxious to attack Colombo, but he was put off by the Dutch. He tried to secure guarantees from them for the return of that city after its conquest, and the Dutch made lavish promises. In August 1655 the Dutch were strengthened by the arrival of a large fleet under Gen. Gerard Hulft, and they laid siege to Colombo by sea and by land. In May 1656 the Portuguese surrendered the city to the Dutch, who shut the Kandyans out of its gates. Requests for the cession of Colombo met with evasive replies. Highly incensed, Rajasinha II destroyed the lands around Colombo, removed its inhabitants, and withdrew to his mountain kingdom.\nAfter a brief respite the Dutch resumed the expulsion of the Portuguese from Sri Lanka. Adm. Ryckloff van Goens arrived with a fleet to continue the attack on Portuguese strongholds in northern Sri Lanka. The Dutch took Mannar in February 1658 and Jaffna in June. They had replaced the Portuguese as masters of coastal Sri Lanka.\n- Official Tourism Site of Sri Lanka\n- World Health Organisation - Sri Lanka\n- The Catholic Encyclopedia - Ceylon\n- Central Intelligence Agency - The World Factbook - Sri Lanka\n- National Gallery of Art, Washington - Biography of George Bellows\n- Official Site of the Embassy of the State of Kuwait in Colombo, Sri Lanka","City of Kandy lies in center of Sri Lanka at a elevation of about 485 metres above sea level and about 116 Kms from Colombo. Generally considered the capital of the hill country, Kandy was the last capital of last generation of Sri Lanka Kings which finally fell under British rule in 1815. The Name Kandy was given by the English as a derivation of “Kanda Uda Rata”. The current Sri Lankan name is “Maha Nuwara” and the historical name of this city is Senkadagalapura.\nAccording to folklore the name Senkadagala originated from a Brahmin called Senkadagala who lived in the area or from a queen (called Senkada) of King Wickramabahu or from a coloured stone called Senkada gala.\nSenkadagalapura was established as a city by the King Wickramabahu III (of Gampola Era) during his reign from 1357-1374 AD. Senasammata Wickremabahu ascended the throne in the 15th century (1473-1511) making it the new capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. Until the 19th century, Kandy was the capital city and thus the home of the Royal Palace and the “Dalada Maligawa” (Temple of the Tooth relic).\nDespite fall of coastal regions to the foreign invaders ( Portuguese, Dutch and English) the Kingdom of Kandy managed to hold its independence surviving many invasions due to the torturous access routes through mountains. Kandy finally submitted to the British in 1815 when its chieftains voluntarily submitted to British rule by signing a pact with Britain at the “Magul Maduwa” which stands to this day near the Dalada Maligawa by the Kandy lakeside.\nThe last king of Sri Lanka, King Sri Wickrama Rajasinhe was imprisoned by the British and sent to a prison in India and lived as a prisoner until his death. With his capture, probably the longest Royal Dynasty in the world which survived since 6th century BC (over 2350 years) came to an end .\nEven after the invasion, Kandy has managed to preserve its function as the religious capital of Sri Lanka and a place of pilgrimage for practitioners of the most purest form of Buddhism.\nKandy is also popular because of the annual festival known as the ” Esala Maha Perahera” in which the Tooth relic of Buddha is taken in a grand procession through the streets of the city. The tooth relic is taken on a royal tusker. The procession includes traditional dancers and drummers, flag bearers of the provinces of the old Kandyan kingdom, the Nilames (temple custodians) wearing their traditional dresses, torch bearers and also the grandly attired elephants. This ceremony which is annually held in the month of July, attracts large crowds fro all parts of the country and many foreign tourists.\nTraveling Directions to Kandy\nKandy lies in middle of the country built in a small wooded valley deep in the hills around an artificial lake created by the king Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe.

{"question":"How is electricity transitioning from a centralized to a decentralized model, and what role do Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS) play in this transformation?","answer":"The electricity system is transitioning from a traditional centralized model with huge remote generators to a more decentralized configuration with smaller generation units closer to users. This transformation includes the rise of reliable smaller-scale generation like gas turbines, wind power, and photovoltaics, along with innovative network facilities and microgrids that can operate independently or in federation. DERMS are software-based platforms that help manage these distributed energy resources (DER) by balancing power supply and demand and delivering grid-based services. DERMS provide core functions including DER discovery, monitoring of power loads, production estimation, scheduling, and dispatch of power. They are essential for integrating various DER assets and enabling their aggregation and management in large groups, which helps maintain grid stability and allows new services like wholesale power marketing.","context":["The world is undergoing a dramatic electricity transition, and the global struggle for power over this transformed electric system is set to profoundly shape our future, argues Walt Patterson, Associate Fellow in the Energy, Environment and Resource Department of Chatham House in London. According to Patterson, politics, not economics, will determine the outcome of this struggle. Article courtesy Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy.\nWhose power ?\nElectricity means power. That, at least, has long been a common English usage – think of power stations, power lines, power companies, power systems. People use the word ‘power’ as a direct synonym for electricity but it is far more than electricity. Power is one of the most important concepts in human society.\nOn a personal level, power is the ability to do what you want to do. On a social level, power is the ability to make others do what you want them to do. How did electricity become power? How does electric power interact with other aspects of power? As the world’s electricity undergoes a dramatic, hectic transition, what might the transition imply for power in global society?\nDisputes about electricity policy, planning, investment and the associated costs – and who pays them – have always been couched in economic terms: which option is cheapest, offers the best value for money and so on. But such disputes are first and foremost political – a struggle for power between different participants in electricity systems. Even the putative economic evaluation depends on who is evaluating and how.\nOne striking difference, arising from the altered technical configurations of innovative electricity, is that Samuel Insull’s ‘natural monopoly’ argument that a locality could economically justify only one set of wires, no longer applies\nThroughout the first century of public electricity provision, until the 1990s, in the many confrontations that occurred around the world, the power almost invariably lay with centralized agents – governments or franchised monopoly companies or often both – rather than with individual citizens and electricity users. The siting of a transmission line, dam or power station, the choice of generating technology, the control of emissions, the disposal of waste and safety concerns were all decided by these centralized agents regardless of public opposition. So was the cost users paid for electricity from the public system. Captive customers of monopoly power had no choice.\nThe situation was akin to the status of telecommunications. Throughout the world, telephone systems, whether state-owned or private, were franchised monopolies that laid down stringent restrictions on their customers. Later governments began to break up these franchised monopolies and to liberalize telecommunications.\nThe Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy is a new endeavour founded at Chatham House last year. The Hoffmann Centre’s mission is “to accelerate the uptake of smart policies, technologies and business models that will reshape the world’s demand for resources and transform the global economy.”\nThen along came the internet, wireless mobiles, tablets and smartphones, which within two decades caused a spectacular transformation. Customers who had been effectively powerless under the traditional regime found that they could now choose providers and types of connectivity, communicate by text, voice or video over any distance, access information and entertainment at will, and collaborate with others anywhere – powers previously in the realm of science-fiction.\nA similarly rapid, comprehensive and disruptive transformation is now happening to electricity. Driving it is a combination of technological innovation and institutional upheaval. The technological innovation is affecting not only generation but also networks and end-use equipment and the software linking them – a striking reorganization of system configurations, the facilities involved and where and how they function.\nThe corollary is an equally striking shake-up of regulatory and business relations. The overall effect is a gradual but unambiguous diminution of the power of the traditional centralized players, the rise of new centralized players and a gradual but accelerating increase in the power of those previously at the edges of the centralized system.\nBreaking the mould\nThe traditional centralized model assumed huge remote generators feeding long high-voltage transmission lines carrying large currents in one direction via local distribution networks to passive loads on the premises of users.\nThe rise of reliable smaller-scale generation broke the mould: gas turbines in combined cycles; gas engines offering cogeneration or even trigeneration, electricity, heat and cooling; then wind power; then photovoltaics, among others. The rise of wind and solar power – both fire-free forms of generation – reduces system dependence on fuel, with its variable and unpredictable future costs and its inevitable environmental impact.\nInnovative generation has been accompanied by innovative network facilities and corresponding software – including Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC). These network technologies still fit into the traditional decision-making power structure, with investment and management by large centralized players. But they also foster more flexible and versatile system configuration and operation, loosening system boundaries and making existing assets more amenable to reorganization.\nThe inevitable corollary of decentralized electricity must be a fundamental rethink of the very idea of regulation and with all that that implies for political and economic power\nAs this technical evolution continues, in more and more places the traditional system is gradually turning into a more decentralized configuration, with smaller units of generation, many of these closer to users with users themselves becoming generators. A yet more disruptive technical innovation is also coming into play – affordable battery storage at scales from household to substation.\nThe abundant technical options now available offer the opportunity to set up complete and coherent, integrated and optimized local systems, including generation, networks and high-performance loads, all communicating with one another in so-called ‘microgrids’. Such a microgrid may be connected to a traditional system.\nIt may, however, be free-standing and able to operate independently, either in emergency ‘island’ mode or as a normal complete system. As more microgrids emerge, they may in turn be interconnected for load-levelling and backup – effectively a ‘federation’ of microgrids with operating, management and financial arrangements far removed from the traditional centralized power structure.\nMicrogrids in rural settings, controlled by and serving local people, are already emerging in Southeast Asia, and they present major opportunities for other parts of the world beyond the reach of traditional networks. Can these regions, including more than a billion people still without electric light, establish decentralized village microgrids to leapfrog traditional centralized electricity and its institutional power structure? The potential is enormous, and obvious, but the centralized players are still mostly stubbornly opposed to such loss of political power, despite their inability to deliver.\nGradual decentralization of the technical model of electricity systems brings with it a parallel decentralization of decision-making power, disrupting the institutional arrangements of traditional electricity.\nNew players, such as universities, airports, hospitals, shopping malls, office blocks, communities, villages – and even single individuals – acquire the power to invest in and to connect and control electricity facilities. Not just user technology but generators, networks, software and entire systems. They also acquire the power to select and to change business partners as well as the types of business activities and relationships, and, not least, to refuse an offer.\nThese new decentralized powers gravely threaten the business model of the traditional centralized players. They also offer an appetizing menu of potential opportunities for new business activities and relationships for the traditional players and the new arrivals. In the Netherlands, for example, the green energy company Vandebron links many small-scale solar, wind and biomass generators with users of electricity. The generators decide what they want to charge and the users decide whose electricity they want to buy. This peer-to-peer relationship is still novel for electricity but could become much more common.\nPower will determine where, how and how much money is invested. Power will determine how revenue flows and to whom\nDecentralized and differentiated technical configurations will also entail profound changes in the prevailing institutional framework for electricity, which may not be welcomed by those who as yet still exercise most of the relevant economic and political power.\nOne striking difference, arising from the altered technical configurations of innovative electricity, is that Samuel Insull’s ‘natural monopoly’ argument that a locality could economically justify only one set of wires, no longer applies. The ‘natural monopoly’ argument gave rise to the ‘regulated monopoly franchise’ concept. The inevitable corollary of decentralized electricity must be a fundamental rethink of the very idea of regulation and with all that that implies for political and economic power.\nThe traditional unilateral electricity transaction essentially offered users a ‘Hobson’s choice’: take it or leave it. The new entrepreneurial context will be a dramatic break with that unequal tradition. Users will have the power to negotiate and interrogate prospective providers and to also select the best option.\nThat in turn may entail different business relationships based, not on short-term commodity transactions, but on longer-term contracts between providers and clients, and not on selling kilowatt-hours but on providing the services people want. Instead of the lopsided power wielded by the suppliers of traditional electricity, in these new relationships, the balance of power ought to be more or less equal, with contract terms offering mutual benefits to both parties.\nAlthough the electric transformation is taking place mainly for sound business reasons, its emphasis on higher-performance gas-fired generation, especially cogeneration and trigeneration, plus entirely fire-free wind and solar generation, may gradually but unambiguously reduce the hitherto vast and dominant economic and political power of traditional fuel suppliers.\nGas-fired and fire-free electricity undercuts the power of the coal industry; electric vehicles undercut the power of the oil industry; better buildings in whole-system upgrades undercut the power of the natural gas industry. What is emerging is a contest of electricity versus fire. Some power is gradually being decentralized, but large-scale wind and solar fire-free generation is also becoming ever more significant.\nThe struggle under way is thus intensely political. Politics, not economics, will determine the course of electricity’s evolution. Power will determine where, how and how much money is invested. Power will determine how revenue flows and to whom. Some new players, large and small, will be winners. Some traditional players, previously large and unchallenged, may be losers. But they will not go quietly.\nWalt Patterson is Associate Fellow, Energy, Environment and Resources at The Hoffmann Center for Sustainable Resource Economy, base at Chatham House in London.

With smaller outputs than traditional generating resources like centralized power plants, DER systems are often sized to meet the requirements of a particular site. They may be connected to the local electric power grid or distribution system or isolated from it for dedicated use.\nDER systems like rooftop solar panels, battery energy storage systems, distribution-connected commercial wind farms, and solar plants account for an increasing amount of the power fed into the electrical grid, helping to reduce society’s dependence on fossil fuels and reduce emissions. However, their growing numbers, variable and unpredictable output, and remote, independent operation are making it more difficult to operate the grid safely, efficiently, and reliably.\nIf distributed energy sources could be more efficiently aggregated, managed, and dispatched in large groups rather than individually, the critical balance between energy supply and demand could be better managed. Also, new grid services could be offered, such as the ability to market excess power profitably on a wholesale basis.\nWhat are Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems?\nDistributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) provide these capabilities. A DERMS is a software-based platform used to manage various distributed energy resource (DER) assets to balance power supply and demand and to deliver grid-based services. Until now, however, there hasn’t been a general understanding of appropriate guiding principles, core functions, and the required functional specifications for DERMS systems, but the need is urgent.\nGuiding the Integration of Distributed and Renewable Energy\nIn late 2020 the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 2222, enabling DER aggregators to compete in all regional organized wholesale electric markets for the first time, encouraging widespread adoption of more electricity generation from DERs.\nNot only does IEEE 2030.11™-2021, Guide for Distributed Energy Resources Management Systems (DERMS) Functional Specification address these needs, but the consensus-based standards development process at IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) and the diverse membership of the IEEE 2030.11 Working Group was instrumental in helping to shape the policy and regulatory framework FERC Order 2222 relies upon. The work was initiated with administrative, logistical, and other support from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Electricity (OE), which has referred to IEEE SA as a key source for the standards and guidelines needed to drive integration of distributed, renewable energy sources.\nAs the latest standard in a body of DER management standards development work including the IEEE 1547™ series and IEEE 2030.7™, IEEE 2030.11 is regarded by DOE-OE as a significant contribution that will help to drive the increased use of distributed, renewable energy resources, and their associated environmental benefits for decades.\nBasic Principles and Core Functions for Distributed Energy Resources Aggregation\nIEEE 2030.11 provides overall guidance for the application and deployment of DERMS and DERMS control systems. It proposes a set of core functions, including DER discovery/visualization; monitoring of real and reactive power loads and voltage at specific nodes; and related functional requirements. It also provides guidance on DER production estimation and scheduling; dispatch of real and reactive power; and provision of DER ancillary services such as voltage and frequency control/support.\nThis guide also gives direction on how to integrate two existing and increasingly popular ways to aggregate distributed energy resources into DERMS; namely, virtual power plants (VPPs) and microgrids. VPPs and microgrids are often thought to be different names for the same thing, but they are entirely different entities.\nVPPs have no fixed boundaries and are formed for the sole purpose of aggregating DER to enable bulk power sales. They can be problematic for the grid because the VPP operators don’t take transmission reliability constraints into account, and they also don’t always necessarily understand the process of power dispatch, which is fundamental to grid management.\nBy contrast, microgrids have fixed boundaries and their output feeds a utility’s local distribution system. Unlike VPPs, they can “island,” or disconnect from the grid if necessary, to ensure that they can deliver critical loads within their boundaries when needed.\nIn addition, a growing number of small to mid-sized DER facilities are being connected to the transmission and sub-transmission systems. This requires their coordinated management by the transmission system operators to enable their safe and reliable integration in the grid. IEEE 2030.11 also addresses the management of those DER facilities.\nBenefits to Multiple Stakeholders\nIEEE 2030.11 is intended to set forth guiding principles, provide a common language and define core functionalities for a DERMS to a wide range of stakeholders, including vendors, utilities, energy service providers, developers, standards organizations, and governing bodies.\nFor utilities, the guide shows how to develop a more sophisticated DER integration capability than currently exists, offering a more detailed view of the grid structure and enabling utilities to develop the specific solutions needed to operate their systems safely and reliably in the presence of high penetration of DER.\nFor aggregators, IEEE 2030.11 describes everything needed to interact with the power grid safely and reliably in order to conduct business, while strongly emphasizing the need and responsibility for strong cybersecurity processes and practices.\nFor businesses, campuses, and individuals, IEEE 2030.11 enables them to more easily maximize the value of their rooftop or other generation resources, by selling their excess power to an aggregator, rather than simply giving it away to the local utility.\nThe growing number of large-scale solar and wind power installations pose meaningful challenges for grid operation. A case in point was the sudden, unexpected loss of about 1,200 MW of solar power generation capability in California in 2016 – enough power for more than 10,000 homes – as a result of the Blue Cut wildfire.\nAs the penetration grows and technology of inverter-based resources evolves, specifications and standards are needed to address performance requirements. The IEEE P2800™ Wind and Solar Plant Interconnection Performance Working Group was established to build a consensus on the requirements for inverter-based resources interconnected with transmission and sub-transmission systems.\nAnother key task is to look at ways to incorporate DERMS into the coming electrification of transportation. To that end, the IEEE P2030.13 Working Group has a goal to provide a guide for the development of a functional specification for fast-charging station management and control systems for electric transportation, including energy management and grid-interaction functions.\n– Geza Joos, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Chair\n– Anthony Johnson, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Vice Chair\n– Robert Cummings, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Vice Chair\n– James Reilly, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Secretary\n– Jon Grooters, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Participant"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3ecacc60-74cd-4966-ac9c-82200bc499bf>","<urn:uuid:97e4d8d4-725d-4016-8792-b8ff8b25e16e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Need help measuring our CS team's success in different languages - what metrics should I track? 💡","answer":"To measure CS success across languages, you should track three key customer-centric metrics: Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores to gauge overall happiness, Net Promoter Scores (NPS) to measure likelihood of brand recommendation, and Customer Effort Scores (CES) to evaluate service interaction ease. These KPIs should be measured in the context of language to understand how native-language translations impact customer happiness. CSAT can be measured after every interaction, while NPS frequency should depend on your business type. CES and CSAT can be measured together to understand language impacts on satisfaction.","context":["Often, when customer service (CS) teams embark on a multilingual translation effort, they want to know how to measure success. One of the clearest indicators of a CS organization’s success as a whole are customer-centric metrics such as:\n- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores\n- Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and\n- Customer Effort Scores (CES).\nWhen these KPIs are measured in the context of language, CS leaders can see a clearer picture of how native-language translations impact customer happiness and willingness to recommend the brand to others. The subjectivity of translations makes them difficult to measure in terms of translation quality alone. (However, there are many efforts underway to improve the quality measurement process, including our own COMET framework for automated machine translation.)\nEven so, quality metrics must be viewed in context of the customer’s actual experience. What’s the best way to find out? Turns out, it’s as easy as asking.\nCSAT as a tool to collect language insights\nCSAT scores are the gold standard of customer-centric metrics. These scores can be incredibly useful in the context of language. Specifically, CSAT can be a powerful data collecting tool that comes with actionable insights that shape your CS strategy. Here are a few examples of how to examine CSAT:\n- Average CSAT per language: When CSAT is parsed by language, you can start to see trends on a broader level. For example, certain language teams may be handling larger backlogs. As a result, CSAT scores could suffer due to longer wait times. In many cases, multilingual machine translation can help a single expert agent cover a variety of languages, improving these scores per language.\n- Average CSAT scores per agent: Measuring average CSAT scores per agent can help identify improvements over time and hone in on team members who may need additional training or performance improvement recommendations. Since hiring expert agents is such a challenge, evaluating CSAT before and after implementing a new tool can show how an agent’s performance improves by automating previously manual tasks. However, make sure that you benchmark a score before the new tool is in place. Benchmarking can help identify how to replicate processes across agents, or identify outliers and understand behaviors. For example, you may find that after you implement a translation tool, Japanese CSAT scores are still low. From there, you could implement a training program to ensure that English-speaking agents understand how to respond to Japanese language queries so the machine translation tool works more effectively.\n- CSAT per location: CSAT per location can show you which BPO providers are performing the strongest in terms of language. For example, say you have one team in Mexico and one in Portugal. Even though both speak English as their primary language and use the same machine translation tools, the Portuguese BPO may have better CSAT scores. You can view both BPO centers in terms of their cost vs. CSAT scores and determine how much of a tradeoff you’re willing to make.\nNPS to measure team performance with language\nThe NPS has been used in the business world for over a decade to understand how likely a customer is to recommend your product or service to a friend or peer. NPS can be used to identify customers who may spend more with your organization (or Promoters), or those who have a negative impression of your brand and can potentially be turned around (or Detractors). For CS, NPS can be a powerful indicator of team performance.\nA little known fact is that 40 percent of customers will not buy from a brand in another language. Another 74 percent say they’re more likely to buy from a brand a second time if they’re offered post-sales support in their native language. Something as simple as offering native language support could be a major boon to your NPS and turn those Detractors into Promoters.\nHowever, NPS isn’t a catch-all for every brand to use, and frequency really matters. For example, a behind-the-scenes B2B software company may deal with the same customers again and again. For that reason, measuring NPS too regularly may not make sense. However, a direct-to-consumer company should measure NPS after the customer has time to adjust to the product. Some companies make the mistake of measuring NPS directly after purchase, which may not give the customer enough time to weigh in accurately.\nCES: a powerful metric combined with CSAT\nAccording to Gartner, effort is the strongest driver of customer loyalty. Nearly all (96 percent) customers with a high-effort service interaction become more disloyal compared to 9 percent who have a low-effort experience. High-effort experiences could include interactions such as channel switching, repetition of information, generic service, or transfers.\nMeasuring CES is as easy as asking customers to respond to a prompt ranking how easy it was for the company to handle their request. Getting service seamlessly in their native language through a low-friction website helpdesk, email or chat interaction can help reduce effort. Even better, low effort can increase other customer-centric metrics such as NPS. According to the same Gartner study cited above, NPS is 65 points higher for top-performing, low-effort companies than for high-effort companies.\nCES and CSAT can be measured together to understand the impacts of language on customer satisfaction. For example, measuring CES at the beginning can show how native-language requests reduced customer effort. CSAT, on the other hand, can be measured on a monthly basis, depending on the type of product or service you offer. Both B2B and consumer companies should measure CSAT after every customer interaction (and then filter by agent, language and location to gain additional insights). B2B companies can take it a step further by measuring end-user satisfaction in addition to these two KPIs.\nMastering both customer-centric and operational KPIs\nWhen measuring the success of a CS team’s language operations, it’s important to weigh these customer-centric KPIs alongside operational metrics focusing on language flexibility, performance improvements and cost-savings. In part two of our blog series, we’ll focus more on internal operational metrics that drive team performance and success, such as first call resolution and average handle time.\nAbout the Authors\nSophia Malina is a Customer Success Manager and Diana Afonso is Head of Customer Happiness"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:17a076d4-0546-4954-ab64-d73ad649c174>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Does the U-matic video format support higher video resolution than the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III's 4K recording capability?","answer":"No. The U-matic video format is an analog format from the 1970s-1980s, while the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III can record in 4K digital resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) at up to 29.97/25 fps, which offers significantly higher quality than analog video formats.","context":["Video Guidance: Identifying Video Formats\nHow Do I Identify Video Formats?\nVideo formats come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have been available commercially since 1956. You may come across video in the form of heavy 2-inch tapes that are stored in specialized containers or you may find video saved on small flash cards the size of a postage stamp. Sometimes your video will have identifying markings from the manufacturer or the content creator. If you do not have these helpful markings, you can follow some of the guidelines below to determine what type of video you may have.\nOpen Reel Video\nOne easy way to determine what type of magnetic videotape you might have is to note whether its stored on an open reel or inside a cassette. This will help you to significantly narrow down the type of tape you may have encountered. There are only four different widths of open reel videotape: 2-inch, 1-inch, ½ -inch, and ¼ -inch.\n- 2-inch tapes usually date from the 1960s-1970s while 1-inch was prevalent during the 1980s-1990s; both formats were typically used in a broadcast or studio recording setting.\n- ½ -inch tapes were a little less common and were used by smaller organizations or even consumers primarily during the 1970s-1980s.\n- ¼ -inch video tapes are uncommon, though a few formats existed between the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nMeasure the width of the tape to determine which of these four sizes you have. Always exercise care when handling magnetic tape- ideally some leader or blank tape will be present and you will not need to touch the part of the tape containing content.\nRemember that just because you have determined the physical format of the tape, you still dont know what has been recorded on the tape. As noted in identifying audio formats, 1-inch and 2-inch tape were also used in professional audio recording so it is possible to have audio only on these larger open reel tape formats.\nIf you have cassette-based videotape then there are many more possibilities.\n- The earliest type of video cassette was an analog format called ¾ -inch or U-matic. These cassettes came in two sizes- regular and small or S cassettes. U-matic tapes were a common broadcast or edit mastering format in the 1970s-1980s; they were also used in the educational and industrial markets.\n- The early consumer cassette tapes dated from the late 1970s-1990s and included VHS and Betamax. These two formats were famously locked in a format war which VHS eventually won.\n- During the 1980s, the professional Betacam formats were introduced as well, these included Betacam and BetacamSP.\n- Later in the 1990s Betacam SX and Digital Betacam (both digital formats) became prevalent. The Betacam SP and Digital Betacam formats have been (and in some cases still are) used as mastering formats in both broadcast and preservation settings.\n- Lesser-known professional formats like D-1 and D2 were used for mastering as well; these were also high-quality digital tape formats, but they did not become as popular.\n- Video8, Hi-8 and Digital8 were the first small video cassette formats. These were popular in both professional and consumer markets and could easily be used in camcorders.\n- More modern cassette formats include DVCPro, DVCam and miniDV. These formats are also small and portable. HDCam is a larger, more robust modern cassette format that is sometimes used for mastering or making intermediate copies of film content.\nVideo can also be stored on optical discs. These include well-known formats like DVD and Blu-Ray discs as well as the older and less common LaserDisc format. LaserDiscs are much larger than DVDs, typically measuring 12 inches across; DVDs are typically 4.65 inches across. Smaller versions of both formats exist, but are less common.\nEven if you have identified the physical features of a video tape, you may still need to determine which type of video standard is recorded on the tape in order to ensure that it plays back properly.\nIf you have analog composite video recordings, they are recorded in one of three major video encoding systems that exist in the world.\nThese systems were developed as a means of combining in one signal all the information necessary to broadcast, display, and record video. Although each has a large number of sub variations, the three systems are:\n- NTSC (National Television System Committee)\n- PAL (Phase Alternate Line)\n- SECAM (Séquentiel couleur à mémoire)\nCountries and regions throughout the world have at various points in time, and sometimes for geopolitical reasons, adopted one of these analog standards. NTSC is the standard that was adopted within North and Central America and all countries in the Caribbean except Guadeloupe and Martinique.\nThe various systems are not compatible, so it is important to be aware of this if you are trying to playback or transfer your recordings. If you have analog recordings from another country or region of the world you will need to ensure that the playback machine is either the same system as the recording you have or capable of playing back multiple systems. Depending on the output options of your player, you may also need to have the output standard converted. Commercial standards converters are available for purchase, and some service providers provide those services.\nThis is a map showing where the various video encoding systems are used.\n- Videotape Identification and Assessment Guide From the Texas Commission on the Arts\n- Care and Handling of CDs and DVDs By Fred R.

{"question":"Which vessel has a higher maximum guest capacity: Bhagwan Dryden or Oktavia?","answer":"Bhagwan Dryden has a higher maximum guest capacity with accommodation for 44 people, while Oktavia can accommodate up to 22 guests per trip.","context":["Incat Crowther’s new Catamaran Dive Support Vessel (DSV), Bhagwan Dryden, is making waves in the DSV sector and has already received high praise throughout its initial operational feedback for its dynamic positioning operations in shallow, rough seas since its launch and delivery earlier this year as reported by Incat Crowther.\nThe 187 ft (57 m) Bhagwan Dryden is the first catamaran dive support vessel with such a high level of integrated dive systems. The vessel has been designed from the keel up to perform six key roles; Dive Support, Geophysical Survey, Geotechnical Survey, Cargo Transport, Hyperbaric Rescue and Safety Standby.\nThe vessel can work in shallow waters, offering operational efficiencies at these depths and is fitted with an ROV, two built in decompression chambers and two Pommec launch and recovery systems, with the diving systems boasting a depth rating of 164 ft (50 m).\nWith such a varied array of operational roles, unique solutions were required not only in the allocation of spaces, but also with the specification of a flexible, high-redundancy propulsion system.\nThe result is an advanced propulsion and powering package that integrates a pair of Thrustmaster TH300MLRT 300 hp (220 kW) azimuthing retractable combi bow thrusters, azimuthing stern drives, and generators. Bhagwan Dryden is fitted with four generator sets (two Cummins QSK38-M’s and two QSK19-M’s), overseen by an advanced power management system that makes optimal use of the four generators and a battery bank to ensure each power source is used in the most effective way. The battery bank stores enough power to propel the ship for short periods, whilst the generators can be powered up in stages to minimize fuel burn. The system offers both excellent low-speed efficiency (7 knots requires just 25% power) and maneuverability and a laden speed of 11 knots.\nThe azimuthing stern drives combine with Thrustmaster’s TH300MLRT azimuthing retractable combi bow thrusters and a Kongsberg dynamic positioning control system to give the vessel DPS-2 maneuverability. The innovative system lends itself to shallow draft dive operations, Thrustmaster’s forward azimuthing thrusters are able to maintain operation as tunnel thrusters when retracted. Further positioning capability is provided by a Sonardyne Ranger 2 USBL acoustic positioning system, which allows the vessel to maintain station relative to undersea reference points.\nThrustmaster’s robust lineup of retractable bow thrusters with power ratings from 200 hp to 5000 hp (150 kW to 3,730 kW) inherit all the benefits of a typical bow thruster application such as docking, slow speed maneuvering, emergency steering and station keeping at zero or slow forward speed with the added ability of extending down past the bottom of the vessel to assist in controlled, azimuth propulsion. Retractable tunnel thrusters are easily installed transversely in the bow or the stern of a vessel and include a section of the vessel’s hull when in the retracted position. Retracting the tunnel thruster is as simple as clicking a single button that will cause the tunnel thruster to automatically correct its positioning before retracting back into the vessel.\nThe Bhagwan Dryden was developed in conjunction with Bhagwan Marine and built by Keppel Singmarine, Bhagwan Dryden.\nIn addition, Bhagwan Dryden is fitted with a 100-tonne, four-point mooring system featuring four deck winches and diagonally-oriented fairleads on all four corners of the vessel.\nThe aft main deck’s 160m2 of cargo space, rated at 10t/m2, is supplemented by a multitude of purpose-fitted deck equipment, including launch and recovery systems, stern roller, shark jaw, tow pins, A-Frame, waterfall winches and container securing lugs.\nAccommodation cabins for a complement of 44 are situated in the hull and the mid deck. The hull also houses laundry facilities and a gymnasium. The mid-deck features an aft-facing survey room, which is linked to the wheelhouse by wireways, allowing operational flexibility.\nThe wheelhouse features complete all-round visibility, including aft-facing DP control stations.\nThe main deck of the vessel houses service spaces including an ROV control room and three workshops; as well as crew spaces such as a change room, cinema, dining mess and lounges and a commercial standard galley adjacent to dry and cold food storage spaces.","Oktavia is a budget friendly professional dive liveaboard, it offers a regular 5D5N trip in the Similan Islands. It can accommodate up to 22 guests.\nOktavia is a beautiful wooden boat which is 30 meter long, 6.5 meter wide and weighing in at 150 tons, cruise at 8 up to 10 knots. It was built in 2003 then modified and refurbished again in 2007.\nOktavia was originally built to hold 33 guests, but in order to provide guests the maximum comfort and space, this boat limited the guest capacity to just 22 people per trip. This means even when the boat is fully booked, there will still be a lot of space for everyone. And due to its big size, the cruising will be very comfortable, even when the sea gets a bit rough.\nOktavia provide adventure cruising with a complete experience with diving, snorkeling, beach runs, island excursions, jungle walks, treasure hunts for the kids, marine life presentations, beach football and more. It’s really suitable for everyone wants to experience an amazing liveaboard trip in the Similan Islands.\nOn the upper deck, which is also called the ‘party deck’, is equipped with media-PC, LCD TV, DVD/CD player, book exchange library and some board games, bar. During the meals time, it also can be used as a dining area which provide guests 3 main meals a day in buffet style and always include a vegetarian dish, snacks are normally served twice a day. For guests with special dietary requirements, just simply mention it at the time of booking, we will do the best we can to inform the chef in advance.\nThe large sundeck offers plenty of space for guests relax at the sun beds, the yoga mats, the comfortable armchairs and even a large sofa area. And part of the sundeck are shaded, so even those who have sensitive skin can come here and enjoy the freash air and beautiful sea view. In good weather guests have been known to sleep under the stars up here and as long as you’re not disturbing anyone you can too.\nThere is an equipment room which keeps all the Scubapro rental dive equipment on the boat, so there will be no problems with wrong sizes rental equipments, you can always change it during the cruise.\nOktavia has 11 cabins in total, with different cabin types, it only accept a maximum of 22 guests.\nAll cabins have air-conditioning and equipped with fan, reading light, shelf unit, electrical outlets (running 220 volt), windows, sheets and towels.\n2 Master Suites:\nLocated on the upper deck and stretching across the entire width of the boat, with 27 square meters in size.

{"question":"Why would someone choose to convert a Class 1 laser system to Class 4 instead of buying a dedicated Class 4 system?","answer":"Converting a Class 1 system to Class 4 offers more flexibility than buying a dedicated Class 4 system. It allows users to process oversized materials only when needed, while operating in safer Class 1 mode at other times. This approach is more cost-effective and space-efficient than buying a larger Class 1 system, and it avoids the constant safety protocols and liability risks associated with operating an always-open Class 4 system.","context":["Class 4 Conversion Module\nLaser safety standards are well established and relatively harmonized internationally. These harmonized standards establish four broad classifications of laser safety for products. The classifications range from Class 1 in which the laser energy is fully contained within the laser system and the operator is not exposed to any laser energy, to Class 4 in which the laser system does not have containment provisions and the operator can potentially be exposed to high levels of laser energy. To process materials in a Class 1 laser system, the material must fit completely within the laser system enclosure.\nThe patented Class 4 Conversion Module is an option that allows the user to quickly and easily convert a laser system between fully enclosed Class 1 operation and open Class 4 operation, allowing the user to place oversized objects in the laser system for laser material processing or pass continuous objects such as rolls of material or conveyor systems through the laser system.\nThis module provides the following benefits to the user:\n- Increased Material Handling Flexibility and Productivity\nProvides a convenient and safe way to process a variety of material sizes and form factors that normally could not be processed in a closed Class 1 system.\n- Improved Safety and Reduced Liability\nComplies with all laser safety standards required for class 4 laser operation when operating in open Class 4 mode.\nHow the Class 4 Conversion Module Works\nULTRA platforms are equipped with interlocked access doors on either side of the laser system. The optional Class 4 Conversion Module allows use of these platforms with the side doors open by bypassing the safety interlocks on the side doors. With this module installed, the protective system housing is left open, creating the potential for exposure to errant laser energy. Use of this optional device changes the safety classification of the laser system from Class 1, which is considered safe for use under all conditions, to Class 4, which is considered potentially hazardous. Due to these potential hazards, laser safety standards require additional safeguards to be built into laser systems operating in Class 4 mode that are normally not present on Class 1 laser systems. The Class 4 Conversion Module provides these additional safeguards so the laser system meets Class 4 and safety audit requirements.\nIncreased Material Handling Capability\nAwareness of laser materials processing is growing at a rapid pace and as awareness grows, the need to process materials in different form factors and in more productive ways grows as well.\nPrior to the introduction of the Class 4 Conversion Module, which is exclusive to ULS laser systems, there were two methods for handling larger material. One approach was to purchase a Class 1 laser system large enough to completely contain the largest material a user expected to process. This drives up cost and makes for an inefficient use of space and resources, especially if oversize parts are not processed very frequently. The other approach was to purchase an open bed, certified Class 4 laser system. The drawback of operating an always open Class 4 laser system is the added risk and liability of operating continuously in Class 4 mode. Also, there is the burden of the additional safety protocols the user must practice along with the cost and maintenance of safety equipment. In some locations, routine inspections by safety inspectors may even be required to operate Class 4 laser systems.\nAn ideal solution for occasional processing of larger materials is a smaller Class 1 laser system that can be legitimately operated in Class 4 mode when needed. Less scrupulous manufacturers will look the other way when customers bypass safety interlocks on Class 1 laser systems or even hint to customers that this is an acceptable practice to process oversized materials. However, a Class 1 system with safety features bypassed is not equipped with the required safety features to operate in Class 4 mode and would never pass safety audits. ULS has solved this problem with its unique, patented Class 4 conversion module which adds all of the required safety features necessary to operate an open laser system in Class 4 mode. This module can be added and removed from the laser system in minutes thereby allowing the user to operate in true Class 4 mode only when necessary - providing complete flexibility.\nAn additional benefit of the Class 4 Conversion Module is the ability to convert a laser system to operate permanently in true Class 4 mode. This feature, in conjunction with the ULS Automation Interface option, allows a laser system to be safely integrated into a high productivity manufacturing environment. Laser based production processes can be developed on a Class 1 laser system in small batches and the same laser system can be easily converted to higher productivity with the addition of material handling equipment such as shuttles or roll feeds without a large investment in new and different laser systems.\nImproved Safety and Reduce Liability\nThere are many mandatory safety measures required under internationally recognized laser safety standards. These safety measures must be complied with when operating a Class 4 laser system. Certain safety measures are the responsibility of the manufacturer and are integrated into the optional Class 4 Conversion Module, including the following:\n- Remote Interlock Connection\nA means of remotely connecting to the interlock circuit of the laser system allowing connection of remote switches to the laser system for deactivating the laser. This feature must be used to connect an interlock switch to the doors of the designated room in which the laser system will be operated so that the laser is automatically deactivated when the doors are open.\n- Key Control\nA removable key that prevents unauthorized operation of the laser system when in Class 4 mode.\n- Laser Energy Emission Warning Device\nA visible warning light that indicates when the laser is capable of emitting laser energy.\nA mechanical device to block emission of laser energy. This device takes the form of a shutter which is manually operated.\n- Class 4 Warning Label\nA Class 4 warning label to indicate the laser system is classified as Class 4.\nIn addition to the requirements placed on the manufacture of Class 4 laser systems discussed above, there are certain operational safety measures that are the responsibility of owners of the laser systems operating in Class 4 mode. As part of the sales process for purchasing a Class 4 conversion module from ULS, information is provided to the user describing their responsibilities and ULS experts are available to answer any questions. These safety measures are mandatory for operation of Class 4 laser devices under Federal and State law in the United States as well as under the laws of most other countries. Many of these safety measures are outlined in ANSI Standard Z136.1 “American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers” or in equivalent standards available in most other countries, such as the European Standard EN 60825-1. Other safety measures may be required by state and/or local authorities, for example, the Regulation BGV B2 on laser beams of the German Employer’s Liability Insurance Association. It is the responsibility of the Owner to understand and adhere to these laws. A brief synopsis of the most common safety requirements addressed to Owners of a Class 4 laser is outlined below:\n- In any facility in which a Class 4 laser system is to be operated, an individual must be designated as a Laser Safety Officer (“LSO”) who will assume the authority and responsibility to monitor and enforce the control of laser hazards. The individual designated as the LSO should be trained in laser safety and aware of all safety measures set by law. There are many avenues available to acquire this training. Recognized sources of this training are the Laser Institute of America (www.laserinstitute.org), the Employer’s Insurance Liability Associations in the European countries or, laser safety associations within Owner’s country or territory.\n- The Owner of the Class 4 laser system will be responsible for creation of a controlled area in which a Class 4 laser system will be operated. A controlled area is an area designed to fully contain the laser energy potentially escaping from a Class 4 laser system and with measures in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the area including lighted warning signs outside the designated and controlled area and interlocks on entryways.\n- The LSO will be responsible for designating and training all personnel authorized to operate, maintain or service a Class 4 laser system. It will also be the responsibility of the LSO to take measures to inform and restrict all unauthorized personnel from access to a Class 4 laser system.\n- The Owner of the Class 4 laser system will be responsible for identifying and providing to all authorized personnel any protective equipment such as specially designed eyewear, protective equipment and clothing needed when operating, maintaining or servicing a Class 4 laser system. Further, the Owner will ensure that no juveniles operate the laser.\n- Mirrors, lenses and other reflecting or refracting materials should not be used around or processed in a Class 4 laser system. Adequate measures must be taken to control these materials around Class 4 laser systems.\n- The LSO will be responsible for auditing all safety measures on a regular basis. This includes regular retraining of authorized personnel, serialization and regular inspection (and replacement when necessary) of all special eyewear and clothing and regular inspection of all safety measures surrounding the controlled area in which a Class 4 laser system is operated. The LSO may be required to maintain records as necessary to prove compliance.\n- The LSO will be responsible for regular medical surveillance of all authorized personnel operating a Class 4 laser system. This can include but is not restricted to mandatory annual eye exams, for example.\n- Class 4 lasers must not be used at tradeshows or exhibitions.\nThe above list is not to be considered exhaustive. Other mandatory safety measures may be applicable which will vary from state to state and country to country. It is the responsibility of the owners of a Class 4 laser system and the owners of the facility in which it will be operated to identify and comply with all regulations pertinent to their locale. In some states, for example, anyone wishing to operate a Class 4 laser device must register with the state energy regulatory agency, pay annual fees and submit to annual inspections. There may be penalties involved for non-compliance. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has also adopted rules for safe use of lasers in the workplace. The LSO must comply with all Rules and Regulations set by law.\nA user must carefully weigh the risks and additional regulatory safety burdens of safely operating a laser system in Class 4 mode. However, if the need arises to operate in Class 4 mode in order to process oversized material or more efficiently move material through a laser system, a user can be confident in ULS solutions. By taking advantage of the Class 4 conversion module, a user’s laser system will have all of the safety features required to operate safely in class 4 mode and pass safety audits. User and owners will also receive all of the information and help they need to understand and follow proper safety practices and minimize business liability.\n- Remote Interlock Connection"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:45d32906-e936-4fcf-8f05-69c15ed3c5b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Both the LEGO Corner Garage and The Flintstones sets feature vehicles - how do they compare in length?","answer":"The Corner Garage's tow truck measures 5 inches (14cm) long, while The Flintstones car measures 4 inches (11cm) long.","context":["It’s December, and aside from LEGO Advent Calendars, that also means one thing – the Modular announcement! Well, after a year’s worth of speculation and guess work, and absolutely no spoilers or leaks (hooray!), here it is – 10264 Corner Garage. Yep, we’re sticking with the pattern of two straights, and a corner building.\nWeighing in at 2,569 pieces, which makes it the third biggest modular by piece count, after 10255 Assembly Square and 10224 Town Hall, this beautiful set includes six minifigures, and will be available from January 1st, 2019. There’s no VIP early access.\nYou’ll need to fork out US$199.99 / DE 179.99€ / UK £159.99 / AU 299.99, which is a bit more than expected, but still manageable. Included in the set is a 1950s style gas station with fuel pump and workshop, an animal clinic on the first floor, and a nice little apartment on the top floor.\nLet’s first take a look at the minifigures and supporting builds, followed by an in depth look at each level.\nIn order of the image above, there’s the vet, a girl with her bunny, a man with his dog, the gas station owner, mechanic, and a woman with a scooter.\nThe mechanic and gas station owner are wearing the same uniform, and have some very nice face printing. The mechanic’s face is the same print as the mountain biker from 60202 Outdoor Adventures, and the gas station owner’s face is the same as the fisherman from 21310 Old Fishing Store. The man with the dog is also wearing the Old Fishing Store owner’s jumper! It’s a beautiful print, so great to have another one.\nI can’t remember where the girl is from, but the torso of the woman is a new, as well as the face with the aviators and lipstick. What is also new, but the torso of choice for me is the vet’s. It looks excellent, with the stethoscope.\nThe tow-truck also looks fantastic, with a small hand-of-god control used to lift a car – it’s a small play feature, but one that will be brilliant to play with. I also really like the brick built tyre fitter – it’s spot on! Ok, lets go floor by floor.\nThe garage – Jo’s Garage – has a drive through section with a 1950’s style Octan fuel pump. It looks really cool, especially the other external features of the build. The hanging wheels and tools on the side are a nice addition, as well as the garage door. I also love the little tree on the side, using the new three leaf plant elements. The tagline for the business – By Accident We Meet – is very clever.\nWhat’s interesting about this floor is that it has two doors on the right hand side, but they appear like they’re not separated by a wall. It seems like such a simple thing to fix, but it’s not there.\nInside the garage is a small counter with cash register, tool rack, the tyre fitter and that vehicle lift that also works.\nThe first floor houses Dr Jones’ Animal Care (No Snakes!). The outside brings in a rare colour in a big way – dark orange – and includes a wide variety of never before seen parts, or ones very hard to come by! There’s also some new 2x6x2 sand blue bay windows, seen on the right hand side.\nInside the vet’s office is a waiting area outside with some couches and a coffee table, and the vet surgery, with a variety of different vet-like apparatus.\nThere’s an examination table, heat lamp (apparently for warming frogs), vet’s desk with a very large lamp, and some other things obscured by the wall. Either way, it looks good!\nUpstairs we have the apartment.\nThe outside is similar to the floor below, but with some flowers adorning the edge – the details using shaped tiles also looks beautiful.\nInside there’s room for a couch and TV, small kitchen and a bed.\nThe TV looks like a 1950’s style one, and the couch is beautifully done. It’s also great to see a minifigure spoon appear in a set like this.\nThe kitchen looks excellent. I’m really impressed with how this has turned out. There also appears to be a toilet cistern behind the door.\nThe roof looks very nicely finished along the edge, and has a sunbed for lazing the day away. I also love the new flowers – I’ve not got any of these yet, so having these included is going to be very exciting.\nThat’s it! It looks spectacular, and a very unique addition to the ever-growing modular street. While I’m personally a little disappointed to be moving away from the Streamline Moderne architectural style of this year’s Downtown Diner, it’s sure to please a lot of fans to be more suited to the rest of the lineup.\nYou can read the full press release below, as well as check out a few more images that weren’t included in the bulk of the post.\nAges 16+. 2,569 pieces\nUS $199.99 – CA $269.99 – DE 179.99€ – UK £159.99 – FR 189.99€ – DK 1,499DKK – AU 299.99\n*Euro pricing varies by country.

The series takes place in a romanticized Stone Age setting, and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are their best friends). It was originally broadcast from September 30, 1960, until April 1, 1966, in a prime time slot, the first such instance for an animated series.\nThe continuing popularity of The Flintstones rested heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting. The Flintstones was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated franchise for three decades, until The Simpsons debuted in late 1989. In 2013, TV Guide ranked The Flintstones the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after The Simpsons).\nThe show is set in a comical, satirical version of the Stone Age which, although it uses primitive technology, resembles mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the sitcoms of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock (pop. 2500). In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen, saber-toothed cats, and woolly mammoths.\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of anachronisms. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in prehistory. This society takes inspiration from the suburban sprawl developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals. They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them. Finally, the stone houses of this society are cookie-cutter homes positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.\n|This is a description taken from LEGO.com.

{"question":"What were the key technical specifications and performance capabilities of the Bell Rocket Belt during its test flights?","answer":"The Bell Rocket Belt weighed 125 pounds and demonstrated modest performance capabilities during testing. In its first untethered flight at Niagara Falls Airport, it reached a height of 1.2 meters (4 feet) and flew for 13 seconds, achieving a maximum speed of 10 kph (6.2 mph) and covering a distance of 33 meters (108 ft). At its peak development, the jetpack could reach heights of up to 10 meters (33 ft) with a maximum flight duration of 21 seconds. It used hydrogen peroxide as fuel, which was chosen because it required no combustion and was considered safer than the initially used compressed nitrogen.","context":["In A Nutshell\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, researchers at Bell Aerosystems developed the first jetpack, named the Bell Rocket Belt. It was capable of flying to a height of 10 meters (33 ft), with a flight duration of 21 seconds. It was almost purchased by the US Army, but the project was scrapped because of the disappointing statistics.\nThe Whole Bushel\nIn 1953, Wendell F. Moore, a researcher at Bell Aerosystems, began working on a prototype of a rocket pack. Experiments on his invention began a few years later, using compressed nitrogen forced out of two steel tubes as thrust. In the beginning, they weren’t so much flying as hopping with style, but by 1958 they were able to fly at a height of 5 meters (16 ft) for up to three minutes. This attracted the attention of the US Army, which was looking for a Small Rocket Lift Device, or SRLD, capable of lifting soldiers over obstacles. In 1959, they contracted Bell Aerosystems to develop such a device for them, utilizing the research already completed by Moore. In total, the US Army paid Bell Aerosystems $150,000 for the project.\nThe details of the prototype were changed when the US Army contract was signed. For starters, the fuel was changed to hydrogen peroxide because it required no combustion and was deemed to be safer. The first flight tests were all personally performed by Moore and were accompanied by a tether attached to the ground, serving as a restraint in case the rocket pack malfunctioned. In a test flight on February 17, 1961, the 125-pound prototype failed, shooting off to the right and breaking the tether. It finally fell from a height of 2.5 meters (8.2 ft), shattering one of Moore’s kneecaps, causing such injury that he was never able to fly again. His understudy, engineer Harold Graham, performed all of the subsequent flights. On April 20, 1961, just outside of Niagara Falls Airport, the first tether-free flight was performed, reaching a height of 1.2 meters (4 feet) and lasting a total of 13 seconds. The maximum speed Graham attained was 10 kph (6.2 mph) with a flight distance of 33 meters (108 ft). Another 28 test flights were conducted so the flying technique could be mastered before the rocket pack was shown publicly.\nAt the Fort Eustis military base on June 8, 1961, the rocket pack was shown publicly for the first time, in front of several hundred US Army officers. Many more public demonstrations were conducted, with a personal exhibition for President John F. Kennedy taking place on October 11, 1961, where Graham flew over a stream and landed next to him. All of the test flights were well received, but the US Army declined to pay for any more research because the flight distances and times were considered inadequate for what they needed. The rocket pack was modified and almost used by NASA for their Apollo 11 mission to the moon, serving as a backup in case the lunar module failed. But it was scrapped in favor of a lunar rover because space was limited. After that, research at Bell Aerosystems was discontinued."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7677a584-c5b6-439e-8314-5c98ddcfbb02>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which standard provides more flexibility in implementation: IEC 61557-12 for power metering or ISO 14001 for environmental management?","answer":"ISO 14001 provides more flexibility in implementation as it is a voluntary framework that organizations can adapt to their specific needs, regardless of size, location, sector, or industry. In contrast, IEC 61557-12 is more prescriptive, establishing specific requirements for electrical measurements, accuracy limits, and operating parameters that power metering devices must meet, with detailed specifications for characteristics like guaranteed accuracy and defined measuring ranges.","context":["Digital Power Metering and monitoring Devices (PMDs) are fast replacing analog equipment, providing more accurate measurements and enabling remote data access. But specifying these devices could become problematic without common reference information describing such factors as, say, appropriate operating temperatures and the exact power parameters the device is capable of tracking. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has addressed this concern with a standard that establishes common set of reference requirements for electrical measurement.\nUnderstanding what this standard covers and how to read related manufacturer information can make it easier for engineers and other electrical professionals to compare and select the right PMD for any given application. Its full name is a mouthful: IEC 61557-12: “Electrical safety in low voltage distribution systems up to 1000V a.c. and 1500V d.c. – Equipment for testing, measuring, or monitoring of protective measures – Part 12: Power metering and monitoring devices (PMD).” However, its impact is equally broad – enough to fill two separate posts. In this post, I’ll provide an overview of IEC 61557-12’s scope and requirements. Next, I’ll provide information on related PMD-testing requirements described by the standard.\nIEC 61557-12 was developed to help specifiers select the right device for any electricity cost-management application. It also helps promote state-of-the-art electrical management on the demand side of the electrical network. To that end, this standard covers energy measurements, as well as measurement of many other critical electrical characteristics. In this way, IEC 61557-12 differs from standards for electricity metering equipment, which focus only on energy measurements.\nIn its section on PMD functions, IEC 61557-12 lists all possible electrical characteristics the devices might measure, along with related requirements – such as rated ranges of operation or allowable measurement techniques. The listed characteristics include:\n- Active energy (with performance classes equivalent to the classes defined in IEC 62053-21 and IEC 62053-22)\n- Reactive energy (with performance classes equivalent to the classes defined in IEC 62053-23)\n- Apparent energy\n- Active, reactive and apparent power\n- Root-mean squared (RMS) phase and neutral current\n- RMS voltage\n- Power factor\n- Voltage dip and swell\n- Voltage interruption\n- Voltage unbalance\n- Harmonic voltage and distortion\n- Harmonic current and distortion\n- Maximum, minimum, peak, average and demand values\nAs a big bonus for specifiers, IEC-61557-12 establishes three performance classes for registered devices. The classes define how well a PMD operates across four specific parameters for every type of electrical measurement it is marketed to provide, as shown in Figure 1.\n- Guaranteed accuracy refers to the limits of uncertainty in the results a PMD provides, over a specified measuring range and under reference conditions. I’ll be covering the topic of uncertainty limits in my next post.\n- Defined measuring range specifies the minimum and maximum values of quantities between which limits of measurement uncertainty are defined. For current, measuring range is specified by manufacturers through:\n- nominal current (In) and maximum current (Imax) for sensor operated PMDs (called PMD/Sx)\n- base current (Ib) and maximum current (Imax) for directly connected PMDs (called PMD/DD)\n- Influence quantities refers to environmental conditions, such as temperature and other climatic impacts and electromagnetic perturbations that might be encountered in switchboards or electrical cabinets. The standard specifies maximum permitted variations of accuracy due to those influence quantities.\n- Zero-blind (Gapless) measurement – in other words, continuous (rather than intermittent) monitoring – is required for several capability parameters under the standard, particularly for energy measurements.\nNot just for standalone devices\nImportantly, IEC 61557-12 applies to PMDs embedded within other equipment as well as standalone devices, which is critical today, when PMD measurement capabilities are increasingly present in protection relays, feeder remote terminal units and a number of circuit breaker offerings. So, when selecting these products, specifiers can refer to the standard to define the required performance class for the embedded measurement function.\nTesting criteria in the next post\nIn my next post on IEC 61557-12 I’ll be looking at the testing criteria that help define a PMD’s uncertainty limits – essentially, the limits of its accuracy. As you’ll read, these criteria look at devices’ performance both in isolation and as part of an overall system.\nIf you are looking for more details, you can check out the following documents:\n|Power meters selection guide||White paper||Power Meter Selection Guide for Large Buildings|\n|IEC 61557-12||White paper||Guide to using IEC 61557-12 standard to simplify the setup of an energy measurement plan.|\n|Measurement applications||White paper||Guide to energy measurement applications and standards|\nAlso, for more information about standards and access to additional tools, resources and product information you can register for our dedicated Consulting Engineer portal site.\nThe post Understanding the IEC 61557-12 Standard That Makes Meter Comparisons Easier-Part 1 appeared first on Schneider Electric Blog.","What Is ISO 14001:2015 – Environmental Management Systems?\nISO 14001 on ASQTV™\nISO 14001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system (EMS). It provides a framework that an organization can follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements.\nPart of the ISO 14000 family of standards on environmental management, ISO 14001 is a voluntary standard that organizations can certify to. Integrating it with other management systems standards, most commonly ISO 9001, can further assist in accomplishing organizational goals.\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines an environmental management system as “part of the management system used to manage environmental aspects, fulfill compliance obligations, and address risks and opportunities.” The framework in the ISO 14001 standard can be used within a plan-do-check-act (PDCA) approach to continuous improvement.\n- Who should use the 14001:2015 revision?\n- What are the benefits of ISO 14001?\n- ISO 14001 certification\n- ISO 14000 family of standards\n- ISO 14001 resources\nISO 14001:2015 should be used by any organization that wishes to set up, improve, or maintain an environmental management system to conform with its established environmental policy and requirements. The requirements of the standard can be incorporated into any environmental management system, the extent to which is determined by several factors including the organization’s industry, environmental policy, products and service offerings, and location.\nISO 14001:2015 is relevant to all organizations, regardless of size, location, sector, or industry.\nWhat topics does ISO 14001:2015 cover?\nAt the highest level, ISO 14001:2015 covers the following topics with regard to environmental management systems:\n- Context of the organization\n- Performance evaluation\nISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS) Framework\n14001:2004 vs. 14001:2015\nThe 2015 revision of ISO 14001 introduces a number of changes from previous versions. A detailed explanation of the changes can be found in this ISO 14001 presentation by the ASQ Energy and Environmental Division.\nAs part of the effort to structure all ISO standards in the same way, the ISO 14001:2015 revisions include incorporating a required high-level structure, using mandatory definitions, and incorporating common standards requirements and clauses.\n10 major areas of impact of the 2015 revision:\n- Expansion in EMS coverage and scope\n- Required interactions with external parties\n- New requirements for leadership engagement\n- Expanded legal compliance requirements\n- Need for risk-based planning and controls\n- New documentation requirements\n- Expanded operational control requirements\n- Changes in competence and awareness requirements\n- Impacts on the internal audit program\n- Increased certification costs\nIntegrating ISO 9001 and ISO 14001\nResponsibilities for the combined standards might include:\n- Drafting a policy statement and quantifiable objectives\n- Setting up organizational charts and job descriptions\n- Providing adequate resources\n- Managing documentation for both standards in a single document control system\n- Appointing a management representative as well as coordinators for the quality and environmental managements systems\nWhen adding ISO 14001 components to those of ISO 9001, planning must be expanded to deal with environmental impacts, and the inspection and test systems modified to cover environmental conformance. The organization must meet the environmental expectations of customers and the government, and it must incorporate environmental management elements into internal audit programs and training sessions.\nISO 14001 can be integrated with standards besides ISO 9001 in order to provide synergy with other systems, such as OHSAS 18001 and ISO 13485.\nUsing ISO 14001:2015 has many benefits for organizations with environmental management systems. Organizations and companies find that using the standard helps them:\n- Improve resource efficiency\n- Reduce waste\n- Drive down costs\n- Provide assurance that environmental impact is being measured\n- Gain competitive advantage in supply chain design\n- Increase new business opportunities\n- Meet legal obligations\n- Increase stakeholder and customer trust\n- Improve overall environmental impact\n- Manage environmental obligations with consistency\nOrganizations that have already achieved ISO 14001 certification are encouraged to transition to the 2015 version. Organizations will have a three-year transition period to update their environmental management systems to the new standard.\nTo get started with ISO 14001:2015:\n- Review existing quality management system requirements (ISO 9001:2015)\n- Purchase ISO 14001:2015\n- Get ISO 14001 training\n- Certify to ISO 14001\nISO 14001 is the most popular standard of the ISO 14000 family, which also includes standards such as the following:\n- ISO 14004:2016 - Environmental Management Systems - General Guidelines On Implementation\n- ISO 14006:2011 - Environmental Management Systems - Guidelines For Incorporating Ecodesign\n- ISO 14015:2001 - Environmental Management - Environmental Assessment Of Sites And Organizations (EASO)\n- ISO 14020:2000 - Environmental Labels And Declarations - General Principles\n- ISO 14031:2013 - Environmental Management - Environmental Performance Evaluation - Guidelines\n- ISO 14040:2006 - Environmental Management - Life Cycle Assessment - Principles And Framework\n- ISO 14050:2009 - Environmental Management - Vocabulary\n- ISO 14063:2006 - Environmental Management - Environmental Communication - Guidelines And Examples\n- ISO 14064-1:2018 - Greenhouse Gases Part 1\n- ISO 19011:2018 - Guidelines For Auditing Management Systems\nArticles and Case Studies\nISO 14001 Standard: Literature Review And Theory-Based Research Agenda (Quality Management Journal) Environmental sustainability has gained momentum in the business world and academia.

{"question":"How does federated search support content organization, and what impact does it have on television content discovery?","answer":"Federated search supports content organization through two approaches: query-time merging, which combines results from multiple search engines, and index-time merging, which creates a centralized index. In television content discovery, this technology has become pivotal as the connected TV landscape evolves. It helps prevent market fragmentation by providing viewers with a central portal to discover content from both linear broadcast sources and internet television, eliminating the need for time-consuming searches across multiple locations. The system uses search and recommendation engines to create a unified content discovery experience.","context":["Federated Search: The Options\n- There are two distinct definitions of \"federated search\" within the search engine industry. They imply very different approaches, both conceptually and technically.\n- It is important to understand which of these approaches is best suited to your needs.\nThis article defines and explains the two alternative federated search models.\n\"Federated Search\" is generally accepted to mean:\nDeploying a search over distributed and possibly heterogeneous data sets, and receiving in return a unified search results list.\nThere are two distinct approaches to federated search, which can be labelled as index-time merging and query-time merging. The pros and cons of these are outlined below.\nIn most circumstances, this is the faster and easier solution to implement.\n- A query federator intercepts the query, and passes it to multiple search engines\n- The federator then waits to hear replies from the search engines, and when received, merges or concatenates the results into a results list.\nThis model relies on data repositories to provide a search function.\nPROS: The primary advantage of this approach is ease of implementation, because no additional indexing of content is necessary. The query federation system simply taps into existing systems an extracts results, which are then merged.\nIn some cases, query-based federation is the only viable option. For example:\n- Federating to large-scale Web content via a major search engine such as Google\n- Federating to a private data set, held behind a pay-wall and therefore not available to be indexed locally\n- Performance issues can occur if the federator waits for the slowest remote search engine to respond\n- The merging of search results into a sensible hit list is difficult if based on relevancy, as each search engine called will score relevancy in a different way. Often, is it better not to attempt merge on relevancy but instead; either present separate results lists (behind tabs for example) or use a more deterministic data item to merge on, such as date, location or price, or present results from different sources in blocks. For example, this is how SharePoint 2013 Search Federation works\n- Search engines provide varying levels of query sophistication. Federation at query time usually implies a \"dumbing down\" to suit the least capable search engine, however, this need not always be the case. For example, sophisticated query parsers can be used to ensure that search clues are optimized for each search engine involved\n- Document level security is a potential cause of performance issues, but this depends on the complexity of the security environment\nThis approach requires content to be acquired into a central index, and it is typical of traditional enterprise search systems.\n- Most search engines default to ranking by relevancy, which is what most users expect. Through acquiring all data into a central index, sophisticated query enhancement and relevancy algorithms can be applied, providing the user with excellent search results.\n- The effort needed to acquire the content from the various repositories can be substantial. This is done via read-only processes. The content of remote repositories is not moved or changed, but the indexing process must read each item, and re-read it every time a change occurs. In some cases, for example where private content behind paywall is involved, this is not possible\nHYBRID FEDERATED SEARCH\nSometimes, the optimum solution is a hybrid approach. Where practical, content is indexed centrally. Repositories for which that is not cost effective (or simply not possible) are federated to at query time. If this approach is used, careful thought is needed about results presentation, to make sure that users understand how the system is set up, and how to navigate and interpret results efficiently.\nWHICH APPROACH WORKS BEST?\nThe approach that works best all depends on your data environment and your user needs.\nStart by looking at the data environment, user requirements and business drivers, then informed decisions can be taken. In our engagements, this process usually begins with a Search Assessment.\nTo discuss federated search in more detail, please feel free to contact us.","Content Discovery Platform\n|Methods and challenges|\nA Content Discovery Platform is an implemented software recommendation platform which uses recommender system tools. It utilizes user meta-data in order to discover and recommend appropriate content, whilst reducing ongoing maintenance and development costs. A Content Discovery Platform delivers personalized content to websites, mobile devices and set-top boxes. A large range of content discovery platforms currently exist for various forms of content ranging from news articles and academic journal articles  to television. As operators compete to be the gateway to home entertainment, personalized television is a key service differentiator. Academic content discovery has recently become another area of interest, with several companies, such as Sparrho, being established to help academic researchers keep up to date with relevant academic content and serendipitously discover new content.\nIn to provide and recommend content, a search algorithm is used within a Content Discovery Platform to provide keyword related search results. User personalization and recommendation are tools that are used in the determination of appropriate content. Recommendations are either based on a single article or show, a particular academic field or genre of TV, or a full user profile. Bespoke analysis can also be undertaken to understand specific requirements relating to user behaviour and activity.\nA variety of algorithms can be used:\n- Collaborative filtering of different users’ behaviour, preferences, and ratings\n- Automatic content analysis and extraction of common patterns\n- Social recommendations based on personal choices from other people\nAcademic Content Discovery\nAn emerging market for content discovery platforms is academic content  Approximately 6000 academic journal articles are published daily, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to balance time management with staying up to date with relevant research. Though traditional tools academic search tools such as Google Scholar or PubMed provide a readily accessible database of journal articles, content recommendation is these cases performed in a 'linear' fashion, with users setting 'alarms' for new publications based on keywords, journals or particular authors.\nGoogle Scholar provides an 'Updates' tool which can suggest articles by using a statistical model which takes a researcher's authored papers and citations as input. Whilst these recommendations have been noted to be extremely good, this poses a problem with early career researchers which may be lacking a sufficient body of work to produce accurate recommendations.\nEmerging companies such as Sparrho or PubChase aim to take content discovery a step further by using machine-learning techniques to compare users amongst each other. Sparrho uses traditional content recommendation using keyword-based feeds, but also encourages users to train the platform by flagging suggestions as relevant or irrelevant. It also goes beyond traditional academic content in diverse material such as conference posters and patents in its database.\nTelevision: An Evolving landscape\nAs the connected television landscape continues to evolve, search & recommendation are seen as having even more pivotal role in the discovery of content.

{"question":"Did naval captains in the Seven Years' War have more authority over their ships than governor Hamilton had over Newfoundland?","answer":"No, both naval captains and Governor Hamilton had limited authority. The documents show that Seven Years' War captains were under the Admiralty's 'iron control' and had to focus on specific duties regarding their ships. Similarly, Hamilton found his powers were hampered - he couldn't enforce building regulations in St. John's, had difficulty implementing reforms even with expanded legal authority from parliament in 1820, and his proclamations were declared invalid by Chief Justice Forbes.","context":["HAMILTON, Sir CHARLES, naval officer and governor of Newfoundland; b. 25 May 1767, elder son of Sir John Hamilton and Cassandra Agnes Chamberlayne; m. 19 April 1803 Henrietta Martha Drummond, and they had one son; d. 14 Sept. 1849 in Iping, England.\nCharles Hamilton was bred to the navy. His maternal grandfather had been an admiral and his father was a captain who earned a baronetcy for his work in the defence of Quebec in 1775–76. Charles went to sea in the summer of 1776 as a captain’s servant on his father’s ship, the Hector. From 1777 to 1779 he attended the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth and then rejoined the Hector as a midshipman. Between 1780 and 1810 he served in the East and West Indies, the North Sea, the Mediterranean, and off the coast of Africa, rising to become a rear-admiral and commander-in-chief on the Thames on 31 July 1810. He was promoted vice-admiral of the blue on 4 June 1814. On 25 April 1818 he became naval commander-in-chief of Newfoundland and Labrador and on 9 May was appointed governor. He arrived on 19 July, relieving acting administrator Captain John Bowker.\nThe policy of appointing admirals as governors has been criticized by historians of Newfoundland, who have echoed contemporary complaints that these men were, as a petition from the inhabitants of St John’s stated, “educated from their youth in a system of their own” and thus were unfit for “the exercise of that discrimination and patience so essential in the administration” of colonies. In Hamilton’s case the criticism was only partly valid. He was not without civil experience, having served as an mp for various constituencies in the south of England and in Ireland for about 13 years between 1790 and 1812, although he was on active service for most of that time. He could also claim to be “not altogether ignorant of the history of early colonization, having passed a great portion of my life in the Plantations.”\nUnfortunately for Hamilton, Newfoundland’s institutions had not kept pace with the times, and his instructions were virtually identical to those given to the 18th-century governors. Hamilton was deeply conservative and he did value Newfoundland as “a good Nursery for seamen,” but he also acknowledged that it could not remain simply “a station for the seasonal fishery.” One sign that the Colonial Office had also arrived at this conclusion was that Hamilton was expected to establish a year-round residence and he was the first governor to be accompanied by his wife.\nHorrified by the lack of public buildings and the narrow streets and crowded wooden houses of St John’s, Hamilton built a court-house, began work on a jail, and sought to impose a building code on the town, particularly after it was again devastated by fires in 1818 and 1819. He also supported the construction of churches by the Church of England, although he refused to expand the public education system and in 1823 protested when the Colonial Office gave a grant to the Newfoundland School Society, composed mainly of dissenters and low-church Anglicans. But most of Hamilton’s efforts at civic improvement came to little, either for lack of funds or because he could not enforce his regulations. Even after he received more extensive legal authority from parliament in 1820, he found it difficult to effect reforms: “No endeavours of mine or powers I possessed could induce the inhabitants to adopt more cleanly habits.” None the less the Hamiltons actively participated in the social life of the capital. Lady Hamilton, “the kind and constant friend of the Widow and the Orphan, was a talented artist who left for posterity a portrait of the Beothuk Demasduwit*.\nIronically Hamilton inadvertently accelerated the destruction of the Beothuks. In his eagerness to “extend to that miserable people the blessings of Civilization,” he authorized John Peyton’s ill-considered expedition in 1818. Although its main purpose was to establish friendly contacts, the mission resulted in the death of two Indians and the capture of Desmasduwit. Hamilton ordered an investigation but turned it into what was later termed a “cover-up.” He was also responsible for the equally unsuccessful expedition of Commander David Buchan in 1819–20. He did provide assistance to Shawnadithit* when she gave herself up to William Cull* in 1823.\nHamilton was unable to diversify Newfoundland’s economy. Having been instructed to promote agriculture, he soon reported that the soil was “so much worse than I had envisioned” that it was only suitable for “Grass & Potatoes.” Although he favoured small grants for fishermen, he did little to encourage such grants, and he dismissed proposals for roads into the interior as unnecessary because the island was inevitably dependent on the fisheries. The collapse of the cod market after the Napoleonic Wars led Hamilton to place greater emphasis on the rapidly expanding seal fishery and to encourage the whale and Labrador salmon fisheries. Because of the depressed economy, large numbers of destitute people had flooded into St John’s. Hamilton’s solution was to match funds raised by private subscription for the relief of the poor, while deporting as many of them as possible to the British North American colonies or the mother country. In 1822 he provided approximately £370 for relief rations in St John’s but gave more than £468 towards removing paupers from the island. Hamilton was primarily concerned with increasing government revenues, but his powers were hampered by the depression and by the legal decisions of Chief Justice Francis Forbes, including his declaring invalid the governors’ proclamations, which traditionally had been assumed to have the force of law.\nForbes’s decisions, combined with the growing outcry against the practice of appointing naval officers as surrogate judges, led the Colonial Office to revamp the legal system. Hamilton returned to London on 18 Oct. 1822 to assist in the process. However, the juridicial provisions of the 1823 Newfoundland bill owed more to Forbes and the legal adviser at the Colonial Office, James Stephen, than it did to Hamilton. With great reluctance Hamilton went back to the island in July 1823 to assess public opinion and to complete his accounts. He left again in November, returning to his family home at Iping. Although he continued to draw half pay until 5 July 1824 and was occasionally consulted by the Colonial Office, he never again held an appointment. On 22 July 1830 he became an admiral and on 19 Jan. 1833 was made a kcb. He had succeeded to the baronetcy on his father’s death in 1784.\nWhen defending his administration, the latter part of which had been marked by political discord, Hamilton claimed in 1824 that “if the system required alteration it was no fault of mine.” Yet he cannot be absolved of all responsibility. His opposition to the proposed incorporation of St John’s was short-sighted and he stubbornly defended the surrogate system – partly because it justified a larger naval establishment – and delayed its inevitable abolition. Indeed, he probably accelerated the demand for reform by overreacting to the least sign of opposition. His prolonged dispute with William Dawe, the only trained lawyer on the island, was particularly damaging. Hamilton dismissed him from his position as notary in 1818 and later fined him for contempt when Dawe legitimately challenged the authority of a court of oyer and terminer established and presided over by Hamilton. Dawe’s heated attacks on the governor led the English reformer Joseph Hume to demand an examination of Hamilton’s accounts in 1823. Although Stephen’s investigation uncovered that Hamilton, with a salary and a vice-admiral’s pay and allowances, had been selling surplus coal purchased for Government House, it largely exonerated him of wrongdoing.\nHamilton never understood the strength of the pressure for change because he had little respect for those pushing for reform, a group he referred to as “adventurers without principle (or property . . .)” and “a few troublesome persons.” Thus it is hardly surprising that the last of the admiral-governors, even though a resident, did little to redeem the reputation of that office.\nPRO, CO 194/61–72; CO 195/7.

A few of them, who later became famous, we knew personally at least a little, but until now most of them have never been more than names. The genius of this book is to bring them to life as individuals; to show their hopes and fears, their faults and virtues, and to fill in the details of their working lives. Far from the grand narrative of battles and campaigns, this book illuminates the everyday world and everyday thoughts of a generation of 18th-century naval officers.' N.A.M. RODGER, All Souls College, Oxford This book provides a detailed insight into the operations of the British Navy during the Seven Years' War by examining the experiences of the cohort of men promoted to the rank of captain in 1757. Byrne McLeod outlines their early careers, discusses how they were selected for promotion and examines the opportunities for making reputations and fortunes through action first against the French and then also the Spanish. She also demonstrates the iron control wielded by the Admiralty over its captains and shows that, although connections and interest assisted greatly with promotion, allegations of 'corruption' were misplaced. The navy in this period was highly effective: an extremely complex and efficient bureaucracy where merit was most definitely rewarded. Based on extensive original research, this book explores the everyday minutiae of the captains' duties and responsibilities. The captains were well aware that every detail of their commands contributed to their effectiveness as fighting machines. From never-ending convoy protection to large-scale, world-wide amphibious operations, these men served in what has rightly been called the first global war. Maritime and eighteenth-century historians will find this book particularly rewarding. A.B. McLeod obtained her doctorate in naval history from the University of Exeter following careers as a teacher and in the City.\nWhat people are saying - Write a review\nWe haven't found any reviews in the usual places.\nThe Route to Post Captain\nA Captains Duties Regarding His Ships Fabric and Equipment and Her Influence on His Career\nManning the Navy during the War\nOpportunities for Individuals\nThe Admiralty and Its Captains\n3rd rate 6th rate Admiral Admiralty Anson appointed April Archibald Kennedy asked August Baillie Baugh capture career century Clevland coast cohort Commissioner Commodore complement convoy court martial crew cruise December deck Despite dockyard Edmund Affleck Faulknor February flag fleet Fortescue French privateers frigates guns half pay Havana Hood Hotham January John Elliot John Lindsay July June Kempenfelt Keppel Knackston letters lieutenant logs London Lord Lordships March Mariner’s Mirror master and commander Medows merchant Michael Clements N.A.M.

{"question":"As an aviation historian, I'd like to know: Was the Seafire more capable than the Hurricane in World War II, and how did their combat performance compare?","answer":"The Seafire and Hurricane had different strengths in combat. The Seafire was a high-performance carrier-based fighter developed from the Spitfire, capable of reaching speeds up to 452 mph at 20,500 ft (in its F.Mk 47 variant) and carrying powerful armament including four 20mm Hispano cannon. However, it had limitations including a relatively short range and fragile undercarriage. The Hurricane, while somewhat slower than both the Spitfire and Bf 109E, proved highly effective against Luftwaffe bombers and was considered easier to fly. In fact, Hurricanes were responsible for shooting down more than half of the nearly 1,200 German aircraft destroyed during the Battle of Britain, demonstrating their significant combat effectiveness despite being less glamorous than the Spitfire family.","context":["Please note: The Supermarine Seafire was a naval development of the most famous of all British aircraft, the Spitfire. The Seafire is covered in a many books and reference sources as a Spitfire development.\nLike the Spitfire, it deserves more space and detail than can be afforded on this web page so we urge further reference to the many books that describe its design and development. Jeffrey Quill’s autobiography Spitfire: A Test Pilot’s Story provides an excellent starting point. The Spitfire, itself, is presented separately.\nThe Supermarine Seafire was an urgent development of the Spitfire to generate a high performance carrier-based fighter aircraft. Somewhat compromised in service by an undercarriage that was not designed from the outset to handle the the rigours of carrier landings, the Seafire nevertheless gave valuable service throughout its operational life.\nThe Seafire Mk IB was a conversion of the land-based Spitfire VB with the conversions being carried out by Air Service Training (AST) and by Supermarine with the main modifications being the introduction of a retractable arrester hook and local fuselage strengthening.\nThe Seafire was produced in 8 marks with total production of 14 prototypes, 538 Spitfire conversions and 2,094 new-build aircraft giving a total of 2,646 aircraft (see the table below summarising production quantities from the various manufacturers involved).\nThe most important marks were (in numerical order):\n- The Mk I, and Mk II (total 542 aircraft converted from Spitfire VB and VC);\n- The Mk III with folding wings (Supermarine prototype and 1,263 new-build aircraft from Westland Aircraft and Cunliffe Owen)\n- The Griffon-powered Mk XV (6 prototypes and 434 production aircraft from Westland and Cunliffe Owen)\n- The Mk XVII with a cut down rear fuselage (prototype and 233 production aircraft, mainly from Westland).\nThe other production marks were the Griffon-powered F.45, F.46 and F.47.\nThe Seafire F Mk 47 was the final and most highly developed aircraft of the Spitfire / Seafire family and Test Pilot Jeffrey Quill is quoted as say that 'the overload weight of a Seafire F.47 was equivalent to a Spifire I carrying 32 airline passengers'.\nDespite the operational limitations of a relatively short range and a somewhat fragile undercarriage, the Seafire saw operational service through to the end of the Second World War, operating with the Pacific Fleet off Japan right up to VJ Day.\nVariants and numbers built\n|Seafire Mark||Quantity by Manufacturer|\n|Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd (Aircraft Section) (Supermarine Works)||AST Ltd||Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft Ltd||Westland Aircraft Ltd||Total|\n|IB: conversions from Spitfire VB||Prototypes AB205, AD371, BL676 and 36 at South Marston||136||169|\n|IIC: conversions from Spitfire VC||Prototype AD371 and 262 conversions||110||373|\n|III: new build with folding wings||Prototype MA970||350||913||1,264|\n|XV: Griffon powered||6 prototypes||184||250||440|\n|XVII: cut down rear fuselage||Prototype NS493||20||213||234|\n|F.45: naval version of Spitfire F.21||Prototype TM379, and 50 production||51|\n|F.46: Contra-props||24 production||24|\n|F.47: modified wing fold||Prototype TM383 and 90 production||91|\n|Total||14 prototypes, 456 production = 470||136||554||1,486||2,646|\n|Mk IIC||F.Mk 47|\n|Powerplant||One 1,470 hp Rolls-Royce Merlin 45||One 2,350 hp Rolls-Royce Griffon 88|\n|Span||36 ft 10 in||36 ft 11 in|\n|Maximum Weight||6,665 lb||10,200 lb (12,500 overload)|\n|Capacity and armament||Pilot only; two 20mm Hispano cannon and 4 machine guns, or 4 20 mm cannon.

The slightly larger Hurricane was regarded as an easier aircraft to fly and was effective against Luftwaffe bombers.\nAdditionally, How much do Hurricane Hunter pilots make? It depends on the individual’s rank and years of experience, and whether or not he or she is a full-time Hurricane Hunter (an Air Reserve Technician, or ART) or a regular reservist. ART salaries are anywhere from $30,000 to $70,000 per year, whereas a reservist will make between $8,000 and $15,000 in a typical year. 5.\n- 1 What planes are used to fly into hurricanes?\n- 2 What are the names of the hurricane hunter planes?\n- 3 Did the Hurricane shoot down more planes than the Spitfire?\n- 4 Did the Spitfire or Hurricane won the Battle of Britain?\n- 5 Was the Spitfire the best plane in WW2?\n- 6 What do you need to be a hurricane hunter?\n- 7 Why do hurricane hunters use prop planes?\n- 8 How do hurricane hunter planes fly into hurricanes?\n- 9 How do they fly into hurricanes?\n- 10 Why does NOAA use prop planes?\n- 11 How many planes does NOAA have?\n- 12 Who shot down the most planes in ww2?\n- 13 Who shot down the most planes in the Battle of Britain?\n- 14 How many planes did the Spitfire shoot down in ww2?\n- 15 Did the Hawker Hurricane win the Battle of Britain?\n- 16 Who won the Battle of Britain?\n- 17 How did the Battle of Britain end?\n- 18 What was considered the best WW2 fighter plane?\n- 19 What was the best plane in World war 2?\n- 20 What was the most successful plane in World war 2?\nWhat planes are used to fly into hurricanes?\nG-IV Jet: Above and Around the Storm\nNOAA’s Gulfstream IV-SP (G-IV) which can fly high, fast and far with a range of 4,000 nautical miles and a cruising altitude of 45,000 ft., paints a detailed picture of weather systems in the upper atmosphere surrounding developing hurricanes.\nWhat are the names of the hurricane hunter planes?\nNOAA uses two Lockheed WP-3D Orion turboprops to fly through hurricanes and a Gulfstream IV-SP which flies around the upper fringes of storms to get a read on steering currents.\nDid the Hurricane shoot down more planes than the Spitfire?\nThe Hurricanes made an outsized contribution to the battle itself. More than half of the nearly 1,200 German aircraft shot down were by Hurricanes, but its impact has tended to fade into the background compared to the more graceful Spitfire. “The Spitfire had mystique about it,” Beaver says.\nDid the Spitfire or Hurricane won the Battle of Britain?\nThose who have previously studied the Battle of Britain have most often come the conclusion that, although the Spitfire was an integral part to the Royal Air Force’s defense of Britain, it was ultimately the workhorse Hawker Hurricane that won the battle.\nWas the Spitfire the best plane in WW2?\nThe Spitfire is most likely the most famous aircraft from the World War II era. It was the king of low-altitudes, it will be known forever as the plane that turned the tide in the Battle of Britain. … In the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire gained fame by having the highest victory-to-loss ratio among British aircraft.\nWhat do you need to be a hurricane hunter?\nAerial Hurricane Hunter Career\nRequires Commercial Pilot certificate. Includes charter pilots with similar certification, and air ambulance and air tour pilots.\nWhy do hurricane hunters use prop planes?\nAnswer: The turboprops are more tolerant of hail than the jets. Airplanes that penetrate thunderstorms have an increased chance of encountering hail. Additionally, the two types of airplanes used, the P-3 and the C-130, are especially rugged.\nHow do hurricane hunter planes fly into hurricanes?\nHurricane hunters fly through intense lightning during Tropical Storm Nestor in October 2019. … Of course, there are other times when the aircraft is surrounded by lightning and it might drop a thousand feet in the blink of an eye because that’s just what the mass of air surrounding it felt like doing.\nHow do they fly into hurricanes?\nThe NOAA uses specialized aircraft and instruments to fly into hurricanes and study storms’ movements for better tracking. … The data collected by the flight crew and weather crew on the plane is the only way to precisely locate the eye of the storm. It’s called fixing the eye.\nWhy does NOAA use prop planes?\nToday, hurricane hunters fly specially equipped planes that NOAA describes as “high-flying meteorological stations.” The data the planes and crew gather “help forecasters make accurate predictions during a hurricane and help hurricane researchers achieve a better understanding of storm processes, improving their …\nHow many planes does NOAA have?\nNOAA’s fleet of 10 manned aircraft is operated, managed and maintained by NOAA’s Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), part of NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations.\nWho shot down the most planes in ww2?\nWhile serving in Germany’s Luftwaffe in World War II, Erich Hartmann flew more than 1,400 missions in the Messerschmitt Bf 109, enabling him to score an astonishing 352 kills.\nWho shot down the most planes in the Battle of Britain?\nIn just 42 days 303 Squadron shot down 126 German planes, becoming the most successful Fighter Command unit in the Battle of Britain. Nine of the Squadron’s pilots qualified as ‘aces’ for shooting down 5 or more enemy planes, including Sergeant Josef Frantisek, a Czech flying with the Poles who scored 17 downed planes.\nHow many planes did the Spitfire shoot down in ww2?\nThe Spitfire entered service with No. 19 Squadron at Duxford in August 1938. Production was slow at first, but by September 1940 it was in service with 18 RAF squadrons. Spitfires shot down a total of 529 enemy aircraft, for a loss of 230 of their own.\nDid the Hawker Hurricane win the Battle of Britain?\nFor the RAF aircraft which actually won the Battle of Britain was an older, larger, slower but still deadly fighter, the Hawker Hurricane. … Despite tributes such as this, the Hurricane never received the credit it deserved.\nWho won the Battle of Britain?\nIn the event, the battle was won by the Royal Air Force (RAF) Fighter Command, whose victory not only blocked the possibility of invasion but also created the conditions for Great Britain’s survival, for the extension of the war, and for the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany.\nHow did the Battle of Britain end?\nBy the end of October 1940, Hitler called off his planned invasion of Britain and the Battle of Britain ended. Both sides suffered enormous loss of life and aircraft. Still, Britain weakened the Luftwaffe and prevented Germany from achieving air superiority. It was the first major defeat of the war for Hitler.\nWhat was considered the best WW2 fighter plane?\nThe Focke-Wulf FW-190 was widely believed to be the best fighter aircraft of World War II. As the war went on the FW-190 was manufactured in no fewer than 40 different models. The appearance of the new aircraft over France in 1941 was a rude surprise to the Allied air forces.\nWhat was the best plane in World war 2?\nThese Were The 10 Best Planes Of WW2\n- 1 De Havilland Mosquito – Ultimate Multi-Role Aircraft.\n- 2 North American P51 Mustang – Best Allied Fighter. …\n- 3 Avro Lancaster – Best Heavy Bomber. …\n- 4 Supermarine Spitfire – Best British Fighter. …\n- 5 Boeing B29 Superfortress – Best Long-Range Bomber. …\n- 6 Focke-Wulf FW-190 – Best Fighter. …\nWhat was the most successful plane in World war 2?\nThe P-51 is widely regarded as the finest all-around piston-engined fighter of World War II to have been produced in significant numbers.

{"question":"What are the key strategies for successful professional networking at events, and what cybersecurity measures should be taken to protect against related social media threats? 📱","answer":"For successful networking at events, professionals should set clear goals, dress appropriately, bring business cards, keep conversations concise, and follow up on connections promptly. It's important to focus on quality rather than quantity of connections and avoid common mistakes like distributing resumes or using a shotgun approach. Regarding cybersecurity measures, professionals should take several precautions: avoid accepting friend requests from unknown people even if they share mutual connections, use ad blockers on corporate devices, never share passwords, be cautious of urgent messages or posts, and avoid using social media on public Wi-Fi hotspots. Organizations should implement email security measures, browser isolation technology, and regular password changes to protect against social engineering and phishing attacks that could result from networking activities.","context":["Professional networking might sound intimidating to recent college graduates or people who have never tried it before. In reality, networking simply means making connections and forming relationships with other professionals in your field. Many graduates view professional networking as the gateway to obtaining job offers. While networking and knowing the right people often provides access to career opportunities, there is more to be gained from successful networking than just finding a job. Through networking, professionals share a wealth of knowledge, resources, and connections.\nNetworking simply means making connections and forming relationships with other professionals in your field.\nProfessionals network online through popular sites such as LinkedIn, and in person at conferences, events, and meetings. More than just taking down names and phone numbers, or adding distant colleagues on a website, professional networking should retain a personalized element. Forming positive, personal associations with other public health professionals creates an environment that encourages collaboration, mutual assistance, and respect. In a field focused on improving the health of society as a whole, it is beneficial for individuals to maintain professional and personal relationships with their peers.\nDifferent Types of Professional Networks in Public Health\nSome researchers argue that three types of professional networks exist: operational, personal, and strategic. Each adheres to its own unique purpose, function, and makeup. Operational networks, which typically consist of internal contacts within an organization, exist to enhance a group's functionality and efficiency. Personal networks, which consist of contacts from external locations, exist for professional and personal development as well as to provide access to useful contacts. Strategic networks comprised of internal and external connections look to facing future challenges, determining priorities, and building industry support.\nEach strategy poses its own advantages and disadvantages, including internal blind spots and bias, questions of accessibility, and exclusiveness. Public health professionals benefit from forming networking associations of all three types, but strategic networks prove the most important in the field as a whole, encouraging professionals to collaborate for larger, common goals concerning the promotion of human health.\nNetworking Events in Public Health\nAlthough networking often occurs online, the importance of public health networking events cannot be understated. In-person networking provides an immediate connection and, depending on the context, may prove more memorable for both parties. Networking opportunities occur in convention centers, workplaces, and even in public. Make time to attend relevant lectures and seminars, visit job fairs, and attend social events.\nAdding a personal touch to your professional connections will help you stand out and be remembered.\nNetworking in person might seem like a contrived or hollow process, but this doesn't have to be the case. A stereotypical networking method, such as handing out business cards or contact information, goes along well with a chat about your current work experience, future goals, or personal motivations. Adding a personal touch to your professional connections will help you stand out and be remembered.\nElevator Pitches in Public Health\nOne useful tool for professional networkers to keep in their back pocket is the classic elevator pitch: a concise, brief summary of who you are, what you offer, and what you’re seeking. It should last no more than approximately 30 seconds, which is the length of an average elevator ride. Apart from avoiding a clunky sales pitch format, few hard and fast rules exist for elevator pitches. You should craft yours according to your own needs. Aspiring public health professionals might consider sharing their motivations for choosing to pursue work in this particular field. For additional ideas, use online guides and suggestions.\nSocial Networking Sites for Public Health Professionals\nLinkedIn is the most popular and widely known professional social networking site. However, public health professionals have additional online networking options, such as BranchOut and Gadball. Online social networking provides several advantages over traditional methods, namely increasing the size of your potential networking pool. You can access people from global locations without leaving your desk, although online communication often lacks the personal touch of face-to-face networking. LinkedIn and other business networking sites frequently require paid membership to access certain features, which limits your networking ability if you choose to remain on a free plan.\nIt takes time and experience to develop networking abilities. Even long-time professionals must continue to hone their methods as they learn what to say and how to act in their efforts to make meaningful connections with others.\nListen and Ask Questions\nDont Go it Alone\nNetworking Event \"Do's\" for Public Health Professionals\n- Set Goals: Before you attend a networking event, consider what you want to accomplish and set goals accordingly. Maybe you want to hold five in-depth conversations that end with an exchange of contact information. Maybe you want to meet a specific person in attendance. Wherever you go, go with a goal in mind.\n- Dress Appropriately: You don't have to dress the same way for every event you attend. Consider the event’s context. A social mixer might not require the same attire as a business conference. When in doubt, business casual is usually appropriate.\n- Bring Business Cards: While networking events stand apart from job fairs or vendor exhibitions, you should still bring business cards with relevant information and contact details. At the end of a conversation with someone, offer them your card and ask if they would like to stay in touch.\n- Be Concise: At heavily attended networking events, everyone arrives with the hope of making as many significant professional connections as possible. Keeping this in mind, try to avoid unintentionally holding others hostage with a long-winded discussion. Keep your conversations and anecdotes concise, and allow conversation partners to move on if they wish.\n- Follow Up on Connections: You’ve spent the evening conversing, shaking hands, and getting to know others in your field. Now you can head home and let the networking magic kick in, right? Not quite. Following up on conversations with a timely email, LinkedIn connection request, or phone call in the week following the event is vital to meaningful networking.\nNetworking Event \"Don'ts\" for Public Health Professionals\n- Distribute Paper Copies of Your Resume: Although the population at networking events might look similar to what you would see at a job fair, the two come with entirely different social rules. Keep your resume at home when you attend networking events. Focus on meeting people and forging real connections rather than appearing overly eager to land a job.\n- Use a Shotgun Approach: When attending a networking event, focus on the quality, not quantity, of connections. One surefire way to alienate other professionals in the room is by making a sales pitch to everyone within earshot or passing out business cards like candy.\n- Interrupt or Talk Over Others: Successful networkers listen and speak. Interruptions are rude in any context. Remember that networking means making real connections, not getting the last word. Give others your attention, and they will return the favor.\n- Be Intimidated: No matter what professional hats we wear in the workplace or how much name recognition we possess, at the end of the day, we’re all human. Don’t be afraid to approach others at a networking event. Even notable public health professionals benefit from conversations with others.\n- Neglect to Follow Up on Connections: Following up on connections after a networking event ensures your best chance of developing and maintaining the professional relationship. Take the initiative, and don’t assume others will reach out first. Waiting too long, or forgetting entirely, to follow up on a connection makes it difficult to reconnect in the future.","Social Media Threat Definition\nSocial media offers an outlet for people to connect, share life experiences, pictures and video. But too much sharing—or a lack of attention to impostors—can lead to a compromise of business and personal accounts.\nAttackers often use social media accounts during the reconnaissance phase of a social engineering or phishing attack. Social media can give attackers a platform to impersonate trusted people and brands or the information they need carry out additional attacks, including social engineering and phishing.\nHow Social Media Threats Happen\nBusinesses can’t control what people do in their private lives. But unfortunately, attackers can take advantage of employees who post too much information on social media.\nThe methods used by an attacker depend on the social media platform targeted. Facebook allows users to keep their images and comments private, so an attacker will often friend a targeted user’s friends or directly send a friend request to a targeted user to access their posts. If an attacker can connect to several of the targeted user’s friends, then it’s more likely that the targeted user will accept the friend request based on the number of connected friends.\nLinkedIn is another common social media target. LinkedIn is known for business networking, and users’ networks are typically filled with colleagues and other employees within the same organisation. If an attacker targets a business, LinkedIn is an excellent social media site to collect business emails for a phishing attack. A large enterprise could have several networked employees who list their employer and their titles. An attacker can use this public information to find several employees who have access to financial information, private customer data or high-privilege network access.\nCollecting information to steal data isn’t the only reason to use social media for reconnaissance. The information posted on social media could be used to obtain passwords or impersonate business users. Many online accounts allow users to reset passwords if they enter a security question. With enough information from social media posts, an attacker could guess the answer to these security questions based on the private information posted by a targeted user.\nBrand impersonation is another social media threat. With enough gathered information, an attacker can impersonate a business brand to trick users into sending money, divulging private information or provide an attacker with account credentials. Attackers also use this threat to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. These attacks can lead to more massive data breaches and business infrastructure compromise.\nExamples of Social Media Threats and What They Look Like\nBecause many social media platforms publicly display user posts, attackers can silently collect data without a user’s knowledge. Some attackers will take further steps into gaining access to user information by contacting targeted users or their friends.\nThe way a social media threat is carried out by an attacker depends on their goals.\nIf an attacker is looking for a high-stakes reward, the best way to quickly earn monetary rewards for their efforts is to target businesses. An attacker might first review LinkedIn for a list of possible targets. Targets can be a mix of high-level corporate employees and low-privilege users who could be tricked into sending additional corporate data or fall for a phishing attack that gives the attacker access to account credentials.\nWith a list of targets, an attacker could then review social media accounts for personal information. Personal information can help the attacker gain the target’s trust in a social engineering attack. It can also be used to guess answers to security questions for an account takeover or used to get closer to a user with higher privileges. The names of pets, favourite sports teams and education history are all potential password clues or answers to questions used to verify the user’s identity to reset a password.\nAfter the attacker collects all the data needed, the next step is to launch the attack. An attacker can use any of the following methods:\n- Social engineering. An attacker might call employees to trick them into sending private data, proving credentials or wiring the attacker money. In a complex attack, the attacker can pretend to be a high-level executive to trick the targeted user into transferring money to the attacker’s account.\n- Phishing. An attacker may use collected social media information to spoof the sender of an email message and trick users into clicking links or sending the attacker private data. A high-level employee’s spoofed email address could send a message instructing the recipient to send money, click a malicious link or reply with sensitive data.\n- Brand impersonation. Using brand employee names, the attacker can trick customers into thinking requests are from the legitimate brand. This type of brand fraud could be used to trick users into divulging personal information or account credentials.\n- Site compromise and data theft. With enough information from social media, an attacker could write malware explicitly targeting the business or perform an attack that would provide internal network access where the attacker can then exfiltrate data.\n- Spread malware. Like brand impersonation, an attacker could create domains and websites that claim to be the legitimate business and trick users into downloading malware or providing credentials.\n- Data breach. If an attacker gains access to account credentials, it could lead to a significant data breach targeting an organisation.\nBecause there are several social media platforms on the internet, an attacker can perform social engineering and phishing using a variety of threat methods. There is no “one size fits all” social media threat for an attacker. But basic reconnaissance and research using social media are the same. Any public information on private and business social media accounts could be used in further attacks.\nWays to Prevent Social Media Threats\nMost social media security threats stem from employees disclosing too much private and business information publicly. These accounts are personal, so businesses can’t stop users from having a social media presence. But they can educate users on the best ways to protect data and their credentials.\nEducation is key to stopping social media security threats. Individuals can educate themselves. But businesses must conduct training programs for every employee so that they can detect and prevent social engineering and phishing. The first step is educating users on the dangers of disclosing too much information online to the public. Even social media accounts set to private could be used in an attack should the attacker gain access to private feeds. Users should never post private corporate information on their social media accounts or information that could be used in an account takeover.\nSome organisations hand out mobile devices and allow users to install social media apps. These companies should provide an acceptable usage policy that determines what users can post using company devices. It’s also critical to protect these devices from malware to avoid company social media accounts from being hacked. Remote wiping software should be installed should an employee physically lose their device or it gets stolen.\nSome other educational points for employees include:\n- Use ad blockers on corporate devices. If ad blockers are not feasible, instruct employees to avoid clicking ads, especially on popups that instruct users to download software to view content.\n- Employees should not share passwords—even if it’s within the same department.\n- Attackers use fear and urgency in their engagements, and employees should recognise this tactic as suspicious. Any messages or social media posts that urge employees to act quickly should be ignored.\n- Don’t accept friend requests from unknown people even if the user has several friends in common.\n- Avoid using social media sites on public Wi-Fi hotspots. Public Wi-Fi is a common location for attackers to snoop on data using man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.\n- User account passwords should change regularly. But users should also be encouraged to change their own private social media account passwords.\nIT staff should have social media cybersecurity defences in place to help users avoid being victims of an attack. Email servers can use artificial intelligence applications to catch suspicious emails with malicious attachments and links.\nSuspicious messages can be quarantined and reviewed by administrators to determine if the organisation is the target of an attack. Browser isolation is also an option for organisations that let users browse the internet. This technology allows users to freely browse the internet, but confines personal web activity to a protected container that prevents downloads, uploads and form fills to keep threats out of the environment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e196372-d753-4b58-8bd7-58fe8fa637c1>","<urn:uuid:a9a72fed-011a-491c-8fdd-818b9d95a65f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the anti-discrimination protections differ between Colorado's sick leave law and New York's Women's Equality Act regarding family status?","answer":"New York's Women's Equality Act explicitly prohibits workplace discrimination based on familial status, making it illegal to deny jobs, promotions, or terminate employees because they have a family. In Colorado, while the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act allows employees to take sick leave to care for family members, it doesn't specifically address discrimination based on family status in hiring or promotion decisions. The Colorado law defines family members broadly to include immediate family, those in loco parentis relationships, and those requiring health or safety-related care.","context":["If your company’s employees are working overtime to help you achieve a profitable bottom line, you’re in a…\nColorado Governor Signs Paid Leave Bill\nColorado Governor Jared Polis recently signed the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB 20-205) into law, which requires employers of 16 or more employees to provide paid sick leave to all employees effective January 1, 2021.\nCurrently, there is no paid sick leave provided in Colorado.\nPaid Sick & Safe Time (PSST) Leave\nThe Paid Sick and Safe Time leave will first be applicable to employers with 16 or more employees beginning on January 1, 2021, and then apply to all employers from January 1, 2022.\nEmployees will begin to accrue sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a yearly maximum of 48 hours effective January 1, 2021. Employees can immediately begin using their accrued sick leave as it is accrued.\nReasons for Leave\nThe employee has a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; needs a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment related to such illness, injury, or condition; or needs to obtain preventive medical care.\nThe employee needs to care for a family member who has a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; needs a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment related to such illness, injury, or condition; or needs to obtain preventive medical care. The employee or family member has been the victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment and needs to be absent from work for purposes related to such crime.\nA public official has ordered the closure of the school or place of care of the employee’s child or of the employee’s place of business due to a public health emergency, necessitating the employee’s absence from work.\nDefinition of family members includes an employee’s immediate family member (a person related by blood, marriage, civil union, or adoption), a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis, a person who stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a minor, and a person for whom the employee is responsible for providing or arranging health- or safety-related care.\nEmployers who already have a pre-existing sick leave policy are not required to provide any additional sick leave if the employer’s plan meets or exceeds the requirements under the new law.\nEmployers may “front load” sick leave, which would provide employees with the total amount of required sick leave at the beginning of the year rather than waiting for the employee to accrue the hours.\nCarry – Over\nAn employee’s unused sick leave must be carried over to the next year; however, an employer may limit the use of sick leave to 48 hours per calendar year.\nSick Leave Pay\nLeave must be paid at the same rate of pay the employee is paid for regular working hours, or at the state minimum wage, whichever is greater. Employees transferred to a separate division of the same employer or to a successor employer must be allowed to transfer their accrued sick leave to their new place of employment.\nEmployers are required to notify each employee in writing of their right to paid sick leave and to display a poster in the workplace that will be developed by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.\nPublic Health Emergency Leave (PHEL)\nCurrently, Colorado employees are subject to the COVID-19 Sick Leave (CO-EPSL) which provides paid sick leave under the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act in the FFCRA, Pub.L.116-127. This is effective up to December 31, 2020. There is no other public emergency leave in Colorado.\nThe COVID-19 Sick leave contained in the FFCRA requires covered employers to provide up to 80 hours of FFCRA paid sick leave to covered employees.\nAs per the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act, in the event of a public health emergency, employers must supplement an employee’s PSST to ensure the employee may take the following amounts of leave:\n- For employees who normally work 40 hours or more per week: At least 80 hours.\n- For employees who normally work fewer than 40 hours in a week: At least the greater of either the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work in a 14-day period or the amount of time the employee actually works during an average 14-day period.\nEmployers may count an employee’s unused PSST toward the PHEL the law requires. The Act defines a “public health emergency” to be:\n- an act of bio-terrorism, pandemic influenza, or an epidemic caused by a novel and highly fatal infectious act, for which: 1) a disaster emergency is declared by the governor; or 2) an emergency is declared by a federal, state, or local public health agency;\n- a highly infectious illness or agent with epidemic or pandemic potential for which a disaster emergency is declared by the governor.\nReasons for Leave\n- To self-isolate and care for oneself (or a family member who is self-isolating) because the employee (or family member) is diagnosed with, or experience symptoms of, the communicable illness that is the cause for the public health emergency;\n- To seek or obtain (or care for a family member who needs) medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms associated with a communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency.\n- To seek (for oneself or a family member) preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency.\n- If the individual’s presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the individual’s exposure to the communicable illness or because the employee is exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness (regardless of diagnosis), as determined by local officials with such authority or the employee’s or covered relation’s employer;\n- To care for a child or other family member when the child’s care provider is unavailable due to a Public Health Emergency, or if the child’s or family member’s school or place of care has been closed by a local, state, or federal public official or at the discretion of the school or place of care due to a Public Health Emergency, including if a school or place of care is physically closed but providing instruction remotely; or\n- If an employee is unable to work because the employee has a health condition that may increase susceptibility to or risk of communicable illness that is the cause of the Public Health Emergency.\nAn employee may use PHEL until 4 weeks after the official termination or suspension of the public health emergency. Employees need not supply documentation to take leave.\nEmployers may count an employee’s unused PSST toward the PHEL the law requires.\nThe Healthy Families and Workplaces Act does not provide a specific date by when the PHEL leave requirement begins. Considering that the CO-EPSL provisions will apply until December 31, 2020, and the PHEL provisions reference being in addition to paid sick and safe time, it is possible that the PHEL will be effective January 1, 2021.","Gird your loins, chauvinist bosses and creepy male co-workers: the New York Women’s Equality Act took effect Jan. 19, and it has a whole bunch of new protections for women in the workplace. It amends the New York State Human Rights Laws with new language that makes it much harder for employers to wiggle out of pay disparity and sexual harassment lawsuits, and also increases the rights of pregnant employees.\nBelow are five key changes that will improve women’s rights in the workplace. We’ve explained what the old laws were, and how the new Act changes each of them. We’ve also cited the legal jargon directly, in case you ever have to bring up the specifics of the Act with your boss. (Here’s hoping you never have to.)\n1. Women can’t be paid less because of race or gender.\nThe New York Women’s Equality Act closes a major loophole that was perpetuating pay disparity among women, especially women of color. Under the old law, employers could argue that “any other factor than sex” was the reason they were paying women less — which, for instance, could allow an employer to claim that a male employee generates more revenue than a female employee. The new law abolishes that arbitrary standard.\nNow, an employer defending a pay disparity lawsuit must offer proof of a “bona fide factor” other than sex, which is both “job-related” and “consistent with business necessity.” The law specifically references “education, training, [and] experience” as factors that may warrant different rates of pay. The new law also “trebles” (multiplies by 300 percent) the unpaid wages as a way to punish employers who willfully violate the law. So, for example, if you sue because men in your same position have made $50,000 per year more than you for the past three years, you could be awarded $450,000.\n2. Employers can’t muzzle co-workers’ discussions about salary.\nIn order to discourage lawsuits, employers often prohibit their employees from discussing salaries with their co-workers. Without knowing the salaries of their co-workers, women are unable to gauge whether they’re being paid less than their male counterparts. Worse, employers can sometimes reprimand or terminate employment when women ask about co-worker salaries. The New York Women’s Equality Act states that “no employer shall prohibit an employee from inquiring about, discussing or disclosing the wages of such employee or another employee.”\n3. Small businesses can’t run from harassment lawsuits just because they’re small.\nUnder the old rule in New York, if a company employed less than four employees in New York, a woman couldn’t sue her boss for sexually harassing her at work. Which is ridiculous, since 60 percent of businesses in New York have less than four employees.\nThe new rule makes it so that a sexual harassment lawsuit can be brought against an employer of any size: “…in the case of an action for discrimination based on sex […] with respect to sexual harassment only, the term “employer” shall include all employers within the state.”\n4. Women can’t get fired for having kids.\nThe New York Women’s Equality Act prohibits “workplace discrimination on the basis of familial status.” This means that a woman can no longer be denied a job, fired from the one she has or turned down for a promotion because she has a family. (It’s sad, but the running stereotypes about women as being family-burdened affect employer decisions in hiring, firing and promoting them. This type of discrimination hurts those who need protection the most — some 70 percent of children living with single mothers are poor or low-income.)\n5. Bosses have to accommodate pregnant employees.\nPregnancy discrimination is on the rise, posing a real problem to the economic security of many families, especially for low-wage workers whose employers are less forgiving. The new law makes it illegal to deny reasonable accommodations to pregnant employees, such as increased bathroom breaks and more comfortable chairs.\nWhile the New York Women’s Equality Act is a great step forward, the benefits won’t be realized until New Yorkers are made fully aware of the rights they possess and feel encouraged by their community to stand up when they’ve been wronged.\nZachary J.

{"question":"I'm planning to install new flooring in my outdoor patio and bathroom. Could you compare EPDM rubber flooring and cork flooring for these areas in terms of moisture resistance and installation requirements?","answer":"For outdoor patios, EPDM rubber flooring is the better choice as it offers superior weathering resistance and can withstand UV rays, ozone, and moisture. It needs to be installed using polyurethane-based glue adhesive or double-sided tape for a secure application against environmental conditions. For bathrooms, while cork flooring can be used, it comes with significant restrictions - only cork tiles should be installed (not floating floors), and the perimeter must be carefully caulked before installing molding to prevent water damage. Additionally, cork is susceptible to expansion and shrinkage due to humidity changes, making it less ideal for high-moisture environments. EPDM rubber, being naturally moisture-resistant with a high coefficient of friction, won't absorb water and prevents the growth of mold and mildew, making it more suitable for both outdoor and wet indoor environments.","context":["EPDM synthetic rubber is the ideal material for creating outdoor flooring and industrial rubber parts due to its greater degree of weathering resistance compared to other elastomeric materials. Although, it is most commonly used in the production of industrial rubber parts, EPDM synthetic rubber is also used in other outdoor settings as well. As a case in point, this ozone resistant rubber is a popular material used in rubber flooring for residential, industrial, and commercial outdoor settings as it is able to provide long-lasting protection against weathering. In addition, EPDM membrane material is a common product used in roofing applications as it tends to have a longer life in abrasive environments. Furthermore, EPDM rubber parts, membrane, and flooring are all easy to install with the use of weatherproof adhesives.\nWhat is EPDM Flooring?\nEPDM flooring is a tire derived product, or TDP, that is made up of ground up tire crumbs that have been bonded together with an adhesive to create a solid sheet. Other times, speckles of 100% EPDM are added into the blend of rubber crumbs to enhance the material’s environmental resistance properties with some recycled rubber products having a 17% overall EPDM synthetic rubber content. According to CalRecycle, “Tire-derived products (TDP) can satisfy established technical testing standards for building construction, traffic control, paving and many other applications, while offering many unique performance benefits” (calrecycle.ca.gov). Recycled rubber is commonly used as outdoor flooring due to its EPDM synthetic rubber content, high tensile strength, and ability to resist degradation caused by damaging environmental factors. EPDM synthetic rubber is generally used for the production of industrial rubber parts, such as seals and gaskets; however, it is the superior ozone resistant rubber material with a high tensile strength allowing it to provide resilient and long-lasting flooring in outdoor settings. Commercial EPDM is best known for its superior environmental resistance properties as its “main properties are excellent heat, ozone, and weather resistance” (polyhedronlab.com). These properties of EPDM synthetic rubber allow it to provide long-lasting weatherproof properties that are ideal for outdoor settings. In addition, EPDM synthetic rubber is often regarded as a “crack-less rubber” due to its resistance to ozone-cracking and high tensile strength, which is the term used to describe the “maximum load that a material can support without fracture when being stretched, divided by the original cross-sectional area of the material” (Britannica.com). EPDM synthetic rubber is an extremely resilient material that is difficult to tear or break, even when it is put under extreme stress or pressure. This along with its superior resistance to UV rays, ozone, and oxygen, commercial EPDM will make for a long-lasting material used in the production of outdoor rubber flooring options.\nDoes EPDM have to be Glued Down?\nIt is sometimes required to glue down EPDM, such as in roofing and outdoor flooring applications; however, not all EPDM rubber parts, or flooring options have to be glued down. Because EPDM membrane is a thermoset membrane, they are “bonded together at the seams to form one continuous membrane” (Wikipedia.org). Then, the EPDM membrane is generally glued down to the roof using a latex or water-based adhesive (homesteady.com). EPDM roofing applications must be glued down due to the amount of weathering and abuse it will experience. Additionally, outdoor flooring containing EPDM, much like roofing applications, must be glued down due to the possibility of wet weather. On the other hand, industrial EPDM rubber parts, such as industrial seals and gaskets, do not need to be glued down. Industrial seals “are used to prevent leakage, hold pressure, and deflect contamination at…static and dynamic interfaces. Examples of static interfaces include the entry point of bolts and screws, and the interface between an engine block and cylinder head…Dynamic interfaces are typically linear, such as the seal between pistons and cylinders” (fastenerengineering.com). Instead of being glued down for installation, EPDM seals and gaskets are generally held in place by the pressure of the two joining surfaces. As a case in point, “Gasket depend on compression and their ability to conform to imperfections in the two surfaces to create a seal. Bolted connections are often used to provide this compression” (fastenerengineering.com). When used outdoors and in wet weather conditions, it is important to glue down EPDM derived outdoor flooring and roofing membranes to prevent the products from shifting or moving while in use.\nWhat is EPDM Coating?\nAn EPDM coating is an extra layer of protection that is often, but not always, used on roofing applications that need extra protection against damaging environmental factors. For a damaged EPDM membrane “an additional coating removes the white spots across the surface of the sheet EPDM roof. The liquid material seeps into the cracks. In turn, this makes the rubber material whole and reduces tension damage.” An elastomeric coating is used to seal damaged rubber membranes to ensure reliable insulation and prevent leaks. For instance, “Supplement coating products are used to reinforce damaged or leak-prone problem areas” (Wikipedia.org). This ozone resistant rubber coating is also highly resistant to UV rays and oxygen allowing it to provide optimal protection in roofing applications. A roof coating is generally the, “topmost layer of protection for membrane, receiving the impact of sunlight (both infrared and ultraviolet (UV)), rain, hair, and physical damage” (Wikipedia.org). EPDM synthetic rubber is the ideal material for outdoor coating because it is the best outdoor rubber material being able to resist degradation caused by UV rays, ozone, moisture, and oxygen. Elastomeric coatings made of EPDM synthetic rubber cannot withstand heavy foot traffic, meaning they cannot be used to coat areas like walkways or patios.\nCan EPDM be Installed Over Felt?\nEPDM can be installed over felt, but it has to be done so with a polyurethane adhesive or with a metal strip that clamps the two materials together. Both EPDM synthetic rubber and felt are commonly used roofing materials due to their excellent resistance to UV rays, ozone, and oxidation; however, the addition of an EPDM membrane will prove to enhance protection against leakages and damage. EPDM membrane can easily be installed over felt with the use of a polyurethane adhesive. A polyurethane-based adhesive is the ideal adhesive for roofing applications due to its “high resistance to weathering and environmental influences; high resistance to aging and high structural strength; and high impact and shear strength “which are all important factors to have in a resilient and long-lasting roofing product (resin-expert.com). Other times, EPDM synthetic rubber can be installed over felt using a “termination bar”. A termination bar is a metal bar, often made of extruded aluminum that is used for “sealing membrane wall flashings to various approved substrates” (gentite.com). A termination bar is used when adhesives are not bonding the materials together. For instance, “Roofing felt is bitumen based and it can be difficult to get any sort of good bond to bitumen with anything other than a like for like bitumen product… [A termination bar] is basically a long strip of metal with a series of holes pre-drilled that clamps the EPDM membrane onto the roofing felt with a dedicated water cut-off mastic sandwiched in-between” (fixmyroof.co.uk). Generally, EPDM can be installed over felt, but when it comes to choosing between the two materials, EPDM synthetic rubber will offer better insulation and resistance against damaging environmental factors.\nCan EPDM be Installed on Plywood?\nEPDM can be installed on plywood; in fact, plywood is one of the best materials for EPDM installation. EPDM synthetic rubber must be glued down to the existing surface to ensure a sturdy application in the face of outdoor environments. Plywood in an ideal material for adhesives to hold onto, especially for EPDM bonding. For example, “If you are fitting a one-piece EPDM roof then you will need to glue it down, unless it’s ballasted or mechanically fixed…The trouble with this is that the glues used in rubber roofs do not like the presence of contaminants such as bitumen or asphalt. For good adhesion your roof decking will need to be clean Plywood or OSB [Oriented Strand Board] sterling board…” (fixmyroof.co.uk). The plywood should not have any splinters because it may puncture the EPDM membrane. Therefore, EPDM synthetic rubber can be installed on plywood that is free of dust or debris.\nWhat Flooring Can be Used Outside?\nFlooring made of tire derived products, such as recycled rubber and reclaimed rubber, can be used outside due to their high content of EPDM synthetic rubber and superior resistance against damaging environmental factors. Rubber naturally has a high resistance to moisture thanks to its high coefficient of friction. In addition, because recycled and reclaimed rubber variations are made of post-consumer tire crumb, they will not be harmed by the harsh effects of UV rays, ozone cracking, or oxidation. These ozone resistant rubber materials will not absorb moisture, allowing it to be used and left outdoors for extended periods of time. Furthermore, its resistance to moisture helps prevent the growth of harmful organic byproducts, such as mold and mildew, to promote a healthy environment.\nTire Derived Products\nTire derived products, or TDP, are ideal outdoor flooring materials because they are made of resilient and weather resistant post-consumer materials. Outdoor rubber flooring products are often made of crumb rubber which derive from post-consumer tires that have been ground into fine crumble. Often times, “Crumb rubber is used in rubberized asphalt concrete, paving applications, and a variety of other tire-derived products including synthetic turf infill and molded rubber products” (calrecycle.ca.gov). The EPDM synthetic rubber content in the composition of vehicle tires helps give them enhanced resilience towards damaging environmental hazards as well as physical impacts and abrasions. Tires are often built with a mixture of natural rubber and a synthetic rubber, most often SBR or EPDM synthetic rubber; however, a tire consisting of EPDM and natural rubber will be highly advantageous. For instance, “A tyre sidewall built using a blend of NR with ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) would be protected against attack by ozone and, having no need for antiozonant, would maintain its initial ‘new’ appearance and would thus be advantageous” (link.springer.com). Other times, tires made of synthetic SBR are also available; however, without the use of this ozone resistant rubber, tire manufacturers will have to coat the finished product in an antiozonant to protect the rubber from cracking when exposed to the ozone. Therefore, tire derived products, including recycled and reclaimed flooring products, are ideal for outdoor use.\nHow Do You Install Outdoor Rubber Flooring?\nOutdoor rubber flooring should be installed using some sort of adhesive to ensure a sturdy and firm application in the face of abrasive environmental conditions. The best way to permanently install outdoor flooring is by using a polyurethane-based glue adhesive. A polyurethane-based glue is the ideal adhesive for outdoor usage because it is a highly weatherproof adhesive that will remain securely adhered to whatever surface even in the presence of moisture. For temporary outdoor installations, you may use double sided tape. This method of installing outdoor ozone resistant rubber flooring makes it easily removable which can be beneficial for easy replacements in case of any damage. The permanence of your intended application will determine which adhesive, or installation method, is best suited for your project.\nThis ozone resistant rubber is a popular choice of material chosen for the production of outdoor residential, commercial, and industrial applications due to its high degree of resistance against harsh UV rays, ozone, and oxygen. EPDM synthetic rubber is ideally and most commonly used to make EPDM rubber parts for industrial usage; however, it is not limited to those applications and is also popular choice in material for roofing and outdoor flooring applications. In addition, with its easy installation process, commercial EPDM can be securely fastened onto materials, such as felt and plywood. When it comes to outdoor applications, whether it be roofing, industrial rubber parts, or flooring, EPDM synthetic rubber is the best option for a reliable and long-lasting protection.","Yes, it is very comfortable to stand on cork flooring and is easy to maintain. Place area rugs or mats in front of the kitchen appliances and sink to protect your cork floor from a lot of traffic, water spillages, dropping food, grease, and everything else that can cause premature wear of your kitchen floor. Do not drag furniture across the floor. Use felt pads on chair and furniture legs. Avoid moisture on the floor.\nFor maintenance, we recommend regular sweeping and damp moping as dirt and grit can act as sandpaper and damage your finish.\nOnce a year or more frequently if there is a lot of traffic and the floor starts to show some signs of wear, you will want to refurbish you cork floor according to the maintenance guidelines supplied. This will reinforce the protective layer and will restore the original appearance.\nWarm and soft, cork floors make a very comfortable flooring surface for a bathroom. However, we recommend you take certain precautions because of the high risk of spillage. Floating floor is not recommended for bathrooms, only tiles should be used. After installation, it is important to caulk the perimeter of the room, prior to installing molding or baseboard. This will prevent spills from damaging the sub-floor or walls. An additional protection layer should be applied to completely seal the joints, please use only our recommended products for Care and Maintenance.\nIn basements there is a high probability of occasional moisture migration from the slab. Moisture can cause glue-down tile to delaminate and cup. Therefore, tile is not recommended for this type of application. For basements, we recommend installing our Floating Floor over a moisture barrier 6 mil film of polyethylene to be used as. A floating floor is not attached to the sub-floor and will rest on top of the moisture barrier.\nJust like other wood products, cork is subject to the phenomenon of expansion and shrinking in response to climactic changes. Extreme environmental conditions, meaning exposure to extreme heat, moisture or dryness (more than 65%, less than 35% R.H) can cause cork to shrink and make joints more visible. When humidity levels are higher, cork flooring can expand. As a general rule, cork flooring is more stable than wood flooring. When wood expands, it does so only across the grain, so the expansion is concentrated in one dimension. However with cork, any expansion or shrinkage is dispersed in all directions. With proper acclimation, installation, and maintenance, expansion and shrinkage of your cork floor will be less noticeable.\nThe shape of the subfloor is usually the deciding factor. If the subfloor is in poor condition with many cracks, old vinyl tiles or sheet vinyl, grimy or dirty the use of floating floors would be recommended.\nThe use of a floating floor over poor subfloors avoids the need to prepare costly subfloors as long as the floor is reasonably level. Also, if there is any risk of moisture migration from a concrete slab than a floating floor properly installed with a moisture barrier is also recommended.\nThe glue down cork floors can be used over any subfloors (wood or concrete) which are dry, clean and free of dirt, grease, wax or anything that would hinder a good bond and where cracks have been filled.\nA floating floor is one that is not attached to the substrate. Each plank is secured to those adjoining so that the floor system functions as a single unit instead of as a series of individual pieces. This means that visible signs of expansion and shrinking, normal to any wood product, are severely reduced. Installation of a floating floor is easier, faster and cheaper.\nCork floors have been used since early in the last century. Europeans are particularly familiar with cork flooring. More recently cork floors have become very popular in North America and Australia and are now sold virtually around the world. Amorim Revestimentos is recognized as leader in quality, innovation and unique solutions for interior design. Superior quality products that provide innovative solutions for decoration and unparalleled performance compose our offer. By combining know-how, traditional production methods and the latest technology, Amorim Revestimentos produces solutions of different decor, stylish, durable and comfortable using a material with characteristics that science can not overcome: the cork.\nCork floors are as durable as most other floors. In addition, they are a natural product, environmentally friendly, and produced from a renewable resource (bark of cork oak tree when peeled does not damage the tree). In addition cork flooring is antistatic, sound absorbing, insulating (both heat and cold), and a relief for those with allergies. No other flooring material combines these benefits. When maintained properly, cork flooring can last for generations.\nCork flooring is produced in a density high enough to withstand heavy traffic and weight. One of the characteristics of cork is that it has a \"memory\" and therefore recovers well from compression, very much like a wine cork stopper being pulled out of a bottle expands. A durable surface finish further protects the cork and allows for easy maintenance. Nevertheless, just like other flooring materials, we recommend the use of protective pads under furniture legs.\nCork floorings are high quality, natural materials and should be recognized as such. Some shade variation due to raw material nature is an inherent and attractive characteristic of all natural products, whether cork, wood, or bamboo. Exposure to sunlight can also result in shade change.\nYes, exposure to UV light as well as sunlight will cause color variations to cork; typically a yellowing. This is normal and not a manufacturing defect. Area rugs and large furniture will block light exposure and cause uneven coloration. To minimize, furnishings and floor coverings should be moved periodically. Covering large exposed windows will help as well.\nYou are the best judge of your pet’s behavior. You know what the habits, activities, and potentially destructive actions of your pet better than anyone else. Cork floors are coated with a finish that could be scratched by the claws of cats and dogs running on the floor. However, because cork is resilient and will move away from pressure the surface will be less subject to abrasion than a similarly treated hardwood floor. Keeping your pet’s nails trimmed will help keep your floors looking beautiful.\nWear Resistance Technology – A multilayer UV cured finish that due to its composition of ceramic beads confers to the cork flooring a high resistance to the abrasion, scratches and stains, without changing the natural texture of the flooring.\nHigh Performance Surface – This finish is based on the strength of nano-bead technology. HPS® works by embedding a fine shield of nano-beads atop the surface layer to protect and preserve floors from scratches, scuff marks, dents, abrasions, stains, and UV damage. This fine layer of nano-beads has a lower gloss level for a natural look and provides excellent traction to prevent slipping.\nYes! Bacteria, dust and dirt do not embed themselves in cork flooring as they do in other flooring options. Simple regular maintenance, such as dust mopping, sweeping or vacuuming keeps cork floors sanitary.\nWicanders has products suitable for commercial areas with heavy traffic like corridor, department stores, lobbies, schools and open plan offices. No Wicanders products are recommend for multi-purpose halls and counter halls.\nDIN 51130 is used for testing shoe-trafficked areas over a surface lubricant, where a person walks back and forth on a platform (in a laboratory) covered with tiles. The angle of inclination if the test area is steadily increased until the person begins to slip. The angle at which the person slips is recorded and averaged out over a number of tests. The higher the rating, the more a tile may be considered anti-slip. DIN 51130 then relates these R ratings to particular fields of use. Generally, R9 is the accepted minimum for use of a tile in public areas.\nAll Wicanders® range products are tested following EN ISO 9239-1.\nThe fire resistance is classified (EN 13501-1) based in energy (flame) and smoke contributions.

Both facilities are closed on Mondays, December 25th, and January 1st.","context":["Etruscan necropolis of Cerveteri, known locally as Necropoli della Banditaccia, is the main burials’ area of the ancient Etruscan city of Caere and one of the most impressive and magnificent necropolis of all Etruria and Mediterranean basin.\nIt belonged to the ancient city of Caere (Cerveteri) a wealthy Etruscan city up on a tuff hill situated about 40 km from the city of Rome and not too far from the Tyrrhenian coast. The importance of Cerveteri in the history of Etruscan civilization is testified by its magnificence and a large number of findings from the burial outfits and excavations both in the areas of sanctuary and residential district.\nNecropolis of Cerveteri covers an area of about two kilometers. It’s a vast burial site (around 20.000 chamber-tombs in this one necropolis according to experts) with unique features which had been worth the inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 2004.\nStretched on a tuff plane next to the urban area, Necropolis of Cerveteri returned a large number of buildings of various kinds dating from the VII to the I century BC. In fact, we have different sectors within the graves corresponding to the quarters by which the necropolis must have been structured.\nThe open-access area includes the Old and New Enclosure where can be admired the circular mounds with hemispherical caps made of soil, the graves known as “a dado” (like dice) prepared in ordered sequences on straight roads and large hypogeums belonged to aristocratic families in the zone called \"Del Comune\" dating from IV to III century.\nAnother sector is locally known as “Autostrada” corresponding to the paved road that runs to Cerveteri. To its left there's the impressive Grave of the Five Chairs (third quarter of the VII century BC) so called because of the number of seats carved in tuff inside one of its rooms, which today is included in a wider monumental complex due to current excavations. To the right, in front of the Enclosure's entrance, there's another burial area with chamber-tombs and mounds of Eastern period (so called area of the \"Great mounds\").\nThe importance of the Necropolis of Cerveteri comes also by providing details about ancient Etruscans living and housing. In fact, graves are built imitating the houses where they spent their lives, with many rooms and shaped doors and windows, columns and pillars, furnishings, potteries made by precious metal and goods from the Near East and from Greece.\nYou really have to take this tour of the \"city of the dead\" and we also recommend you to visit the Cerite National Museum where a large number of Etruscan relics are collected including the famous \"Sarcophagus of the Spouses\".\nOpen from 8.30 am until sunset.\nClosing Monday, 25 December and 1 January.\nNational Museum of Cerite: from 8.30 am to 7.30 pm.

{"question":"What are the contaminant removal capabilities of reverse osmosis systems versus Purifloh's FRG technology?","answer":"Reverse osmosis systems remove 95-99% of total dissolved solids and are effective at removing dissolved organic and inorganic compounds, while also improving taste, odor, and color. However, they waste 2-3 gallons of water for every gallon purified. In comparison, FRG technology can eliminate a broader range of contaminants including chemicals, hydrocarbons, viruses, bacteria, and toxins. The FRG system's OH radical has highly-reactive oxidation capability and is particularly effective at purifying water. Additionally, FRG technology offers a chemical-free solution with benign waste output and can be engineered to produce specific combinations of radicals for different applications.","context":["Purification specialist Purifloh (ASX: PO3) has completed a landmark $9.6 million equity raising with a key cornerstone investor in the United States to initiate commercial development opportunities for its Free Radical Generator (FRG) technology.\nThe raising was achieved through the placement of 4 million Purifloh shares with Michigan-based Upjohn Laboratories, at a price of $2.40 per share representing a 380% premium on the company’s last trading price of $0.50/share.\nIt provides Purifloh with funding to accelerate commercialisation of the patent-pending FRG technology in the application of indoor air purification, water sanitation and surface sterilisation.\nUpjohn is a family investment company owned by Michigan investor and businessman Bill Parfet, who will join the board of Purifloh on completion of the transaction.\nUpjohn will also acquire 1,271,601 shares through an off-market transfer from Purifloh’s second largest shareholder, resulting in a total interest of 5,271,601 shares or 16.8% of the company.\nPurifloh’s technology generates a range of ‘free radicals’ which are able to eliminate a wide range of contaminants such as chemicals, hydrocarbons, viruses, bacteria and toxins typically found in contaminated air and water.\nFRG’s output can be engineered to produce ranges and combinations of radicals to cater to the requirements of a given application.\nThe most powerful of these – the OH radical – has a highly-reactive oxidation capability and is believed to be effective in purifying water and disinfecting surfaces and environments.\nCompared to traditional systems, the technology is believed to be more effective against bacteria including gram-negative, gram-positive and antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens, and also offers a safe and chemical-free solution with benign waste output.\n“The challenge for widespread adoption has been reliable and cost-effective production of the radicals themselves,” Purifloh said.\n“The radicals have a short half-life and as a result they cannot be stored nor transported… to deploy and maximise the power of these radicals requires a robust, reliable and cost effective in-situ production system.”\nThe company said FRG-based systems have the flexibility to generate a “powerful range of radicals” which can be channelled as agents of purification and sterilisation.\nDiscussions have commenced with potential commercial partners.\n“We are actively engaged with companies in the US who are showing strong interest in the capability and performance of this system,” Purifloh said.\n“The value proposition and competitive advantage for FRG-based products in new and existing markets continues to strengthen.”\nGlobally, indoor air quality is of increasing concern due to the negative health impacts from chemical, physical and biological contamination within occupied spaces.\nFRG core technology has been developed to clean the air in occupied internal environments and has been shown to have a high rate of purification, targeting biological and chemical decontamination, and particulate removal (<0.3 microns).\nIt is able to decontaminate harmful airborne substances and is safe for use in all environments.\nHealthcare-associated infections are also a major global health care problem and the numerous disinfection solutions on the market have limited success regarding effectiveness, kill rates, toxicity and cost.\nFRG technology is used in a chemical-free device developed by Purifloh which is able to rapidly and fully-sanitise internal rooms and facilities particularly those within hospitals and medical facilities.\nPurifloh is working with Somnio in the development of water treatment products which are able to treat a range of sources, from recreational water and industrial waste to drinking water systems.\nThe company’s initial focus is a system for cleaning residential and commercial recreational pool water where

industrial waste water and clean, safe drinking water.\nAt mid-afternoon, Purifloh shares were trading 296% higher at $1.980.","Tips for Taps Blog\nWhether your water comes from a private well, a municipal water utility, or the fountain of youth, there’s an ongoing risk that something harmful gets into it.\nWater treatment can help reduce and even remove different pollutants from your water, but with so many different technologies on the market, choosing the right filter can be overwhelming.\nIn this article, we’ll explore important questions like:\nWhat kind of filters are there?\nHow do they work?\nWhich filter is best for me?\nChoosing a Filter\nMany factors go into choosing the right water filter, such as what pollutants you wish to remove, the conditions of the surrounding environment, price range, and lifespan of the filter. While there are a handful of different ways to filter water at home, we will take an in-depth look at the five most popular water purification methods:\nActivated Carbon Filters.\nReverse Osmosis Filters.\nUV Water Filters.\nActivated Carbon Filters\nActivated carbon filters (e.g. Brita, PUR and other low-cost counter-top pitcher filters) are very common due to their low cost and ability to remove common water pollutants. Before we dive into what they can and can’t do, let’s take a look at how they work.\nHow Do Activated Carbon Filters Work?\nActivated carbon filters are made out of tiny pieces of treated carbon in granular or block form. The particles are extremely porous with just one gram of activated carbon having a surface area of ~500-3000m2 ! The enormous surface area of the carbon granules makes these filters very effective at removing contaminants out of water via adsorption. Activated carbon filters are capable of removing contaminants anywhere from 0.5 microns to 50 microns in size. Put into perspective, a human hair is approximately 75 microns in diameter.\nAs water flows through active carbon filters, impurities in the water stick to the carbon and cleaner water results. It is important to note, though, that much of the effectiveness of carbon filters depends on both the flow and temperature of the water. For the best filtration results, activated carbon filters should be used with low pressure and cold water.\nWhat Do Activated Carbon Filters Remove?\nActivated carbon filters are most successful at removing the following contaminants:\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs)\nActivated carbon filters are also effective at improving the taste and odor of water. For example, chlorine, which is utilized by many municipal water treatment facilities in the disinfection process, is often present in drinking water in small amounts and causes water to taste and smell like bleach. Activated carbon filters remove chlorine in water, enhancing both the taste and odor. In addition, they remove VOCs like hydrogen sulfide gas, which causes the rotten egg smell, thus removing the smell.\nUpkeep of Activated Carbon Filters\nAs water passes through an activated carbon filter, pollutants collect on the carbon. Once the carbon is completely covered with pollutant, it is no longer able to effectively remove impurities from the water. When this happens, the filter must be changed. A few factors affect how long a filter can effectively function, such as how many contaminants are in the water and the volume of water you are filtering.\nEach filter comes with a manufacturer’s recommendation, which tells how often you should change your filter. Most activated carbon filter brands suggest that you replace your filter for every 40 gallons of water that passes through, which is approximately every two months.\nReverse Osmosis Filters\nHow Do Reverse Osmosis Filters Work?\nWhile the term “reverse osmosis” (RO) leaves many confused, the process is relatively straightforward. Simply put, RO systems use a high pressure pump to push water through a series of semi-permeable membranes that allow water molecules to pass through while trapping water-soluble toxins.\nMany municipal water systems use RO processes to clean the water that eventually flows from your faucet. However, if your tap water will still has some sediment, minerals, and microbes from the distribution system, you may consider investing in a home RO system.\nWhat Do Reverse Osmosis Filters Remove?\nMost RO systems remove 95-99% of total dissolved solids. They eliminate a wide variety of common chemical contaminants and are most effective are removing and improving the following:\nTaste, odor, and color\nDissolved organic and inorganic compounds\nDespite effectiveness in removing the above contaminants, RO filtration can be a slow and wasteful process in comparison to other treatment processes. For every gallon of purified water produced, domestic RO systems often waste two to three gallons of water.\nUpkeep of Reverse Osmosis Filters\nAvailable in a variety of sizes and degrees of complexity, RO systems are sold both as countertop units, which cost around $200, and whole-home systems, which can cost upwards of $12,000.\nThough the price tag can be a tough pill to swallow, RO systems consume small amounts of energy and are easy to maintain, as each system lasts for about last for about a year.\nUV Water Filters\nHow Does UV Filtration Work?\nUltraviolet (UV) light has been utilized for decades as a reliable process for microbial disinfection. In the most classical form of UV filtration, water is pumped into a chamber that contains a UV lamp surrounded by a quartz sleeve. The lamp is designed to emit a specific frequency at which, around 254 nm. At this frequency, UV light reliably destroys the DNA of microorganisms. This eliminates the microorganism’s ability to reproduce, rendering it harmless.\nSome advantages of UV filtration are that it is chemical free, cost-effective, and fast. In addition, there are no harmful bi-products of UV filtration, and no water is wasted in the purification process.\nWhat Do UV Filters Remove?\nIf operated properly, UV Water Filters can effectively destroy 99.99% of microorganisms in water.\nMicroorganisms (such as Coliform bacteria, E. Coli, Legionella, Salmonella, infectious Hepatitis, Cryptosporidium, etc.)\nIt is important to note that UV filters only remove microorganisms from water. If you want to remove other contaminants, consider combining UV filtration with another purification method or using a different filtration method altogether.\nUpkeep of UV Filters\nUV filters are fairly simple to maintain- only the UV lamp and its surrounding sleeve, or “filter,” must be replaced annually.\nHowever, in order for UV filtration to work, the water must be clear prior to entering the filter. If water has a high turbidity, UV light cannot reach and kill harmful microorganisms because it is blocked by other particulates. Thus, it is important to have clear water for UV filtration, which can be achieved through proper installation and the utilization of other filtration methods, such as mixed-media, to remove particulates.\nMulti-media filters consist of two or more layers of media and are used to reduce the SDI (Silt Density Index) and TSS (Total Suspended Solids) of water. Often, they are used prior to other filtration methods, such as activated carbon and RO filtration, to reduce clogging and increase effectiveness.\nHow Do Multi-Media Filters Work?\nMost multi-media filters have three layers of media. The coarsest, most dense material lies at the bottom, while the finer, lighter material sits on top. Typically, the layers are anthracite, sand, and garnet, with anthracite at the top and garnet on the bottom.\nAs water filters through, larger contaminants are trapped in the first layer with smaller contaminants catching in the lower layers. This allows for faster flow rates and longer periods of run time between backwash cycles.\nWhat Do Multi-Media Filters Remove?\nParticulates as small as 20 microns\nParticulates as small as 10 microns (using a coagulant addition)\nWhile many multi-media filters only remove particulates, some utilize media to improve certain water parameters, such as catalytic carbon to reduce chloramine levels.\nUpkeep of Multi-Media Filters\nMulti-media filters are unlike other filters in that they have the ability to “clean themselves” in a process called backwashing. During backwashing, water flows in the opposite direction, expelling trapped particles and discarding them through the filter drain.\nBackwashing should be performed when:\nThe filter’s pressure gauge reads greater than 10 psi\nThe turbidity of the filtered water increases by 10%\nWater flow is noticeably slower\nWhile chlorine is unsafe to drink in large amounts, in smaller doses, it’s effective in disinfecting water. Chlorination is the process of adding chlorine to drinking water in order to kill harmful bacteria.\nHow Does Chlorine Disinfection Work?\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant due to its ability to disrupt the activity of harmful microorganisms in water. First, chlorine combines with enzymes in the cell membrane, which damages the membrane and allows chlorine to enter the cell. Once in the cell, chlorine rearranges the DNA and disrupts cell respiration, leading to the death of the microorganism. It is important to note that chlorination is most effective at a low pH and higher temperatures.\nThree types of chlorine are used for chlorination:\nSodium Hypochlorite: Better known as household bleach, this compound contains about 5.25% chlorine and is the easiest of the three to manage for residential use.\nCalcium Hypochlorite: This compound is most commonly used in residential treatment and is sold in chlorine granules or pellets.\nChlorine Gas: Chlorine gas is sold as a compressed liquid and is the cheapest of the three.\nHowever, because it is hazardous until introduced to water, it is mostly used in municipal facilities.\nChlorination in a residential setting can be conducted using a chlorine pump (most common), suction device, aspirator, solid feed unit, or a batch disinfection system. Each has pros and cons and which system is right for you depends on many factors, such as the source of the water, price, access to electricity, and whether or not you want fixed or varying dosages.\nWhat Is The “Right Amount” of Chlorine To Add?\nThe amount of chlorine that you add during chlorination depends on which of the three types of chlorine you are using, how much water you wish to purify, and contact time (the period of time between when the chlorine is added and when the water is used). For example, if you are using bleach as your disinfectant, ¼ teaspoon must be added to every one gallon of water.\nThe amount of free chlorine, or chlorine residual, present in the water indicates whether or not the water is safe to drink. Chlorine residual levels should be between 0.2 PPM and 4 PPM, with optimal concentration between 0.3 PPM and 0.5 PPM.\nChlorine residuals within optimal range indicate that:\nEnough chlorine was added to the water to kill harmful microorganisms\nRecontamination during storage didn’t occur\nToo much chlorine wasn’t added\nWhat Does Chlorine Filtration Remove?\nUpkeep of Chlorine Disinfection\nDifferent chlorination mechanisms require varying maintenance routines; however, all systems require chlorine supplies to be refilled periodically.\nWater Filters Recap\nWater filters, air filters, and even Instagram filters tend to make things better, depending on which one you choose. Many factors go into choosing the right filter for you and your water, but with the right filter, you have the ability to greatly enhance your health and the health of those you love. So, go get yourself a filter….

{"question":"How do fuel management practices affect business aviation operations, and what role do renewable fuels play in reducing emissions?","answer":"Fuel management affects business aviation operations primarily through cost control, as fuel represents the largest share of variable operating costs. Operators can control costs through fuel programs, price tracking, efficient routing, tankering, and reduced cruise speeds, potentially saving significant amounts per gallon. Regarding renewable fuels, they are considered among the most viable options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport, especially in aviation. Advanced biofuels are expected to play a significant role, with scenarios projecting a need for a more than 10-fold increase in their uptake between 2017-2050. However, these advanced biofuels currently cost more than twice the price of conventional fossil fuels, presenting a challenge for widespread adoption.","context":["It forms a big part of your annual operating budget, but how can operators better control their fuel purchase practices? Dave Higdon offers tips…\nFew are better placed to understand the relationship between cold hard cash and high-speed flight than those who pay the bills for your Flight Department. In these days of increasing costs, skilled managers add value to their flight operations by controlling all three major cost items: Flight crew staffing, maintenance and upkeep, and fuel costs.\nSetting an operating budget demands a working knowledge of all three items and how those factors interact. For example, budgeting for ‘X’ hours flying per year sets the bar for maintenance (based on hourly costs) and a concomitant estimate of fuel costs.\nThat’s simple enough, providing the person developing the budget recognizes that changing any one of those three factors automatically brings a related change to the other numbers.\nIn reality, plenty of people put tremendous effort into controlling their fuel spending. Though consumers lack any way to influence pump prices, they enjoy total control over when, how much and where they choose to fill their tanks.\nSince fuel costs account for the largest share of variable operation costs, managing fuel use and fuel purchases greatly influence the department’s budget.\nWithin this article, we’ll consider the steps needed to keep your operation on – or under – your fuel-budget estimate. Following are some of the best tips and practices…\nTip #1: Join a Fuel Program\nThe Business Aviation community includes numerous vendors and program operators offering fuel cost control tools for those who enroll with them and use their systems. By contracting with vendors, these tools guarantee a lower price than the posted pump price in exchange for a minimum commitment.\nDo check that a particular program (e.g., a card arrangement) is accepted among the FBOs and airports your operation typically frequents. You may find some adjustments are needed, dependent on the airports you use.\nBy taking these precautions, you will avoid penalizing your operation by paying for a fuel club membership that's not usable at the majority of the airports you visit.\nMost of these programs offer guidance to help you use their cards. Once you have one, use the tool even if it doesn't always get you the lowest price.\nTip #2: Use Fuel Price Trackers\nVarious tools and programs exist solely to track and report fuel prices at airports around the country and across the globe. The better of these trackers update daily, while the best update even more frequently.\nBy entering a route or point of origin and destination, these programs typically will produce a list of airports along the route as well as their fuel prices at the time of the last check. A quick internet check or phone call can then confirm whether the posted prices remain in effect.\nAs an added bonus, making an advanced reservation can get you an additional discount at some airports.\nTip #3: Consider the Most Efficient Route\nFlight planning for fuel costs may not be an everyday occurrence, but on occasion a slight change in the route flown can yield big savings without appreciably adding to the trip length (thereby offsetting any fuel savings).\nChecking route fuel prices – through programs like those noted above – may reveal potential savings by landing at a different airport for the meeting, without refueling, then, by refueling somewhere else.\nAs an example, a trip last fall required us to make a technical stop that yielded a saving of $1.40 per gallon. On a 280-gallon uplift of jet fuel, that $1.40 of per-gallon savings translated to spending $392 less! Imagine savings like that multiple times a year. The habit could almost become a profit center of its own.\nTip #4: How About Fuel Tankering?\nWhere weight-and-balance considerations allow, some benefit may come from uplifting more fuel than a trip requires. Yes, it will slow your climb and could limit what's carried in the cabin, but the chances are that it won't.\nMany pilots like to fly with the fuel level suggested by flight planning; that is, fuel needed plus reserves for weather and a diversion. Carrying the least called-for saves fuel, helps climb performance and gives cruise speed a bit of an edge.\nBut if home field fuel costs are the lowest – and the aircraft is capable – tankering extra fuel can reduce total fuel expenses for a trip.\nThat is especially the case when the fuel capacity allows for a round-trip flight without refueling. Even when an airplane can't tanker round-trip fuel, the destination fuel price may be less – which is an incentive to fully top off before returning to home base.\nTip #5: Slow Down, You Fly Too Fast…\nAll aircraft offer a published maximum cruise speed. Why do we fly if we don't want to go as fast as possible? The answer involves another book speed: Maximum-range cruise speed.\nThrottling back isn't solely for ‘tailwind days’. Flying at maximum-range speed (even though you're flying a much shorter trip) will provide a measurable decline in fuel costs, with only a small increase in the en route time.\nThe vast majority of our trips are between 350-500nm. Sacrificing 40 knots on a 500nm trip may add 15-20 minutes to the trip – with a savings of 15-20% in fuel not used.\nPutting these fuel-saving steps into effect this January brings the potential of a full year of fuel savings compared to posted prices – because fuel costs show little sign of declining as we saw earlier in the decade.\nDemand increases and supply adjustments have largely ended any semblance of a glut in petroleum supplies. The business turbine fleet continues to grow, and flight hours are up in many parts of the world.\nEven as OEMs continue to advance the fuel efficiency of their engines and aircraft, the changes fall short of offsetting the higher prices expected in the next decade. Start practicing fuel-saving habits today and help your bottom line tomorrow.","Renewable fuels – Advancing European Market Uptake\nDiscovering the world, working with people across the globe, commuting to work every day or consuming exotic fruits imported to Europe – nearly every European is used to at least one of these habits producing a significant amount of carbon emissions. On the road to decarbonizing transport and reaching climate targets, the market uptake of renewable fuels is essential.\nThe European transport sector is the only major sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are continuously increasing. According to the European Environment Agency, in 2016 the transport sector contributed 27 percent of total EU greenhouse gas emissions and they were 26.1 percent higher compared to 1990. While road transport has contributed the most to the transport sector’s GHG emissions, the largest increase in final energy consumption has occurred in the aviation sector between 1990 and 2016, and this sector is expected to continue growing rapidly. International shipping activity is also expected to increase as it is driven by increasing globalization and trade.\nIn response to increasing emissions, the EU has set several targets to mitigate and limit GHG emissions from transport. An overall target of a 60 percent reduction in GHG emission within the transport sector by 2050 was set in 2011 (compared to 1990) – still too low to reach the 2015 Paris Agreement aspiring to limit global warming to less than 1.5°C. In 2015, the study “Emission reduction targets for international aviation and shipping” conducted for the European Parliament suggests that by 2050 global aviation emissions should be at least 41 percent lower than in 2005, and the global emissions of the shipping sector to be at least 63 percent lower.\nRenewable fuels are among the most viable options to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. While electrification becomes more significant, (mainly in road and rail transport), advanced biofuels are expected to maintain a significant role for the shipping and aviation sectors – especially in the short- and mid-term. A number of scenarios conducted for the European Commission and by the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicate the need for large quantities of renewable fuel demanded by 2050. With the aim of contributing to the Paris Agreement goals, the PRIMES scenarios foresee a major increase in current biofuel use. If demand in 2050 is to be met completely by advanced biofuels, this implies a more than 10-fold increase of their uptake in the time frame between 2017-2050. For the successful and sufficient market uptake of biofuels, feedstock has to be produced sustainably in sufficient quantities.\nEnsuring sustainable feedstock\nThere has been a great deal of skepticism followed by strong debates about the overall sustainability of biofuels especially their impact on land use patterns and food prices, and their carbon emissions across the production value chain. In response, a new generation of renewable transport fuels is emerging produced from non-food biomass called advanced biofuels.\nEurope has significant potential to produce advanced biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstock (such as waste and residues from agriculture and forestry). There are many initiatives that provide evidence to that. The EU H2020 projects FORBIO and SEEMLA demonstrated that biomass can be produced for bioenergy in a sustainable way on underused land, a process which is in line with the objectives of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED II), showing a high potential in promoting the production of advanced biofuels. The latest findings of the ADVANCEFUEL project show that many biomass sources are potential candidates that require sustainability efforts before they are readily available to produce advanced biofuels at a commercial scale (e.g. infrastructure, farmers experience, regulatory compliance and support, suitable for conversion).\nThe European transport sector is the only major sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are continuously increasing.\nWater scarcity, low fertility and marginality are major challenges concerning biomass productivity and profitability on underused land. The web geographic information system (GIS) developed by the BIOPLAT EU project helps identify suitable marginal, underutilized and contaminated (MUC) lands around Europe, assessing environmental, social and economical sustainability indicators of bioenergy value chains. Another option to tackle limited available fresh water and marginal land is to use seaweed as novel biomass for alternative transport fuels. The MacroFuels project developed several routes for the con- version of seaweed to biofuels which, once upscaled, will be economically viable. MacroFuels further achieved urgent technological breakthroughs towards large-scale seaweed cultivation such as deployment and cultivation at sea, automated harvesting or efficient storage and pre-treatment methods.\nAlthough RED II is an important step forward in recognizing the need to cover all bioenergy uses and supporting renewable fuels in the transport sector, lack of internationally recognized and harmonized criteria between different bioenergy sectors remains a major barrier to the commercialization of advanced biofuels that will increasingly be produced in multi-output biorefineries and supplied to international markets such as shipping and aviation. Harmonization of national and voluntary sustainability certification schemes at EU level is key for the market uptake of advanced biofuels. The ADVANCEFUEL project provides a set of sustainability criteria and indicators along the whole supply chain and recommendations to enhance the sustainability performance of biofuels.\nEnd use of advanced biofuels\nIn addition to incremental sustainability governance and availability of biomass for the production of advanced biofuels, a secure and stable policy framework and significant cost reductions are essential for a successful market uptake. According to the progress review by the European Commission conducted by Navigant, the EU is on track for reaching renewable energy and biofuel targets 2020. However, the IEA World Energy Outlook, flags that the biofuel production in EU member states is not on track to meet the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) demand in 2030 as most biofuel consumption is at low percentage blend levels with fossil fuels. It forecasts annual production growth of 0.5 percent in Europe, falling short of the 8 percent of growth to meet the SDS. Higher biofuel blend rates or greater use of drop-in biofuels are essential to increase the consumption of biofuels. To tackle the high costs of advanced biofuel investment and production, the IEA recommends to introduce supportive policies to facilitate the technology learning and production scale-up necessary to reduce costs.\nEuropean renewable fuels market analysis by the ADVANCEFUEL project indicates that Europe started off well with the advanced fuels sub-obligation of 3.5 percent (including double counting) introduced in RED II. However, this may not be yet sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement targets. For road and rail transport, the EU introduced a mandatory renewable energy target. In contrary to road and rail, the aviation and shipping sectors are regulated at an international level. As of 2021, a global market-based measure, Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), will be operational addressing CO2 emissions in the aviation sector allowing airlines to buy emission reduction offsets from other sectors to compensate emissions or use eligible fuels with lower carbon use.\nProduction costs of advanced biofuels are more than twice the price of conventional fossil fuels.\nIn spring 2018, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a strategy to reduce total GHG emissions from shipping by 50 percent in 2050, and to reduce the average carbon intensity by 40 percent in 2030 and 70 percent in 2050, compared to 2008 by focusing efforts on enhancing the energy efficiency performance of shipping, encouraging the development of national action plans to develop policies addressing GHG emissions from international shipping, and provide technical cooperation and capacity-building activities.\nScaling up advanced biofuels\nProduction costs of advanced biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks are typically more than twice the price of conventional fossil fuels and the current low fossil fuel prices have been a considerable obstacle to their development and deployment as shown by latest ADVANCEFUEL results. The shipping sector can use a large range of advanced biofuels. The future ability of advanced biofuels to compete in the market will depend on cost reductions such as technological learning, economies of scale, efficiency improvements, more affordable and more sustainable feedstocks as well as the evolution of fossil fuel prices. Making them competitive can be difficult, especially in the aviation sector due to their high production costs and energy intensity. In shipping, biofuels can be a viable option due to lower production costs and the large demand from the industry.\nTo reach climate goals and decarbonize road, maritime and air transport, upscaling biofuels is crucial and an indispensable way forward in the energy transition. In addition to using all possible renewable fuel options, maximizing energy efficiency and energy saving is necessary. There are still some roadblocks to remove in the strategy to ensure a smooth market uptake of renewable fuels. Concerted stakeholder action is essential to put transport biofuels on track with the Paris Agreement. Policy is therefore an important tool to steer future market uptake towards value chains that source sustainable feedstock and employ resource efficient conversion pathways generating rural and global economic development and a more decarbonized mobility around the world."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:820d32d5-a456-447b-a4e9-3cd0705f23a6>","<urn:uuid:09a8fc6a-0002-4743-ade4-8f119f121d9c>"],"error":null}

There was no democracy in Medieval times. What was the main form of government in late medieval Europe? ABSOLUTE MONARCHY. What was that? After the end of the Roman Republic, democracy disappeared for 18 centuries. There was no democracy in Medieval times. What was the main form of government in late medieval Europe? ABSOLUTE MONARCHY. What was that?\nTHE AGE OF ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES or ABSOLUTISM (1500 – 1800) Kings/monarchs in most European countries (France, England, Spain, Russia, Austria, Prussia) established complete/absolute rule over all people and over the aristocracy (nobility).\nYou live in France in s. What changes have occurred since 1100s? -Nomadic invasions have stopped and you feel secure. -Trade & money have become important part of your life. -Many knights & lords have gone and never returned from the Crusades (but do you really care?) -Nobles often fight between each other or rebel against the king. -Many serfs have moved to towns & now work in guilds. -You’re proud that the French royal army won the Hundred Years war against England. -The pope isn’t the highest authority any more. -The French people are split between Catholic & Protestant & there are frequent civil wars between the two. -France has become a global power & even has colonies in the New World but other countries in Europe compete with France. Would you prefer to have a strong king or keep the old system of a weak king & many feudal lords?\nLOUIS XIV Also known as the Sun King, Louis XIV is the symbol of an absolute monarch. He ruled France for 72 years. \"L'État, c'est moi\" (\"I am the state\")\nAbsolutism was justified by the Divine Right of Kings theory: What is it? Royal power comes directly from God (not from the will of people). The king is God’s representative on earth and accountable only to God. Any attempt to get rid of a monarch goes against the will of God.\nAbsolutism was justified by the Divine Right of Kings theory, formulated by the French bishop Bossuet: “ The royal authority is sacred. God established kings as his ministers and reigns through them over his people. For such a reason the royal throne is not the throne of man, but the throne of God himself... The person of kings is sacred and any attack on them is a sacrilege... One should obey the prince on grounds of religion and of conscience. Royal authority is absolute. The prince owes an explanation to no one for what he orders.”\nCENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATION Louis XIV appointed commoners as ministers and regional Governors (intendants). He ruled with the help of a royal council of advisers – NOT nobles but commoners personally chosen by him. NEVER called a meeting of the Estates General (council of nobles, middle class and clergy)\nCONTROL OVER THE NOBILITY Louis XIV required nobles to spend a majority of the year under his close watch in his palace at Versailles instead of their manors. He spoiled them with extravagant parties and luxury. This brilliant plan achieved 2 goals: The nobles were happy and dependent on Louis XIV (and didn’t fight against him). The king’s own administrative agents controlled the country instead of the nobles.\nECONOMIC POLICY Set up his own system of tax-collecting to increase the money in the royal treasury. Raised tariffs (taxes) on imported goods. Built strong marine to export goods. Government control of the economy.\nSTRONG ROYAL ARMY OF 400,000 Louis XIV created the strongest and best trained army in Europe (paid professional army).\nHOWEVER: Huge spending on army, wars, Versailles & luxury for himself and his noble “guests” The debt of the royal treasury increased 5 times during his reign.\nEmpress Maria Theresa (1717 – 1780) Habsburg dynasty Austria & Hungary\nSCHÖNBRUNN PALACE IN VIENNA\nHer father Charles VI had no surviving sons, so he changed the Habsburg dynasty law to give his daughter the right to succeed to the Austrian throne and inherit his lands upon his death. She didn’t have real education and was only taught the proper etiquette and court manners that the ladies of her time learned. Maria Theresa became one of the greatest monarchs of the 18 th century.\nIntelligent, affable, cheerful, pleasant, fond of music, and at the same time very moral and deeply religious.\nHER CHARACTER Her warm personality and strength of will won her the loyalty of her subjects and troops. She appealed to them directly in moments of crisis, sometimes carrying her baby in her arms. She had 16 children, with 6 daughters (all of whom were named \"Marie _______\") and 5 sons surviving to adulthood. In the 1760s, smallpox claimed a few victims in the royal family. Even Maria Theresa got infected and she did receive the last rites in 1767, but she recovered. Afterwards, she became an outspoken advocate of vaccination and had all her children vaccinated.\nDuring her reign, Vienna increased its reputation as a center of the arts & music.\nPeter the Great 1672 – 1725 Absolute monarch (tzar) of Russia\nPeter Visits Europe Shortly after he took the throne, Peter took a long trip to Western Europe (disguised as an ordinary worker) to learn more about European customs and industrial techniques. Inspired by his trip, he resolved to make Russia strong enough to compete with European monarchies.\nWESTERNIZATION – using Western Europe as a model for change to make Russia stronger. He commanded all of his courtiers and officials to cut off their long BEARDS and wear European CLOTHING. Boyars (nobles) who sought to retain their beards were required to pay a heavy annual tax. The rich had to pay much higher beard taxes than the poor. All government servants had to shave their beards and wear Western-style clothes. The shaving of beards came to symbolize Peter’s reign. He ordered many nobles to settle in the new capital of St. Petersburg. Modernized the army - hired European officers to train his soldiers in European tactics with European weapons.\nSt. Petersburg became the new Russian capital (oriented towards Europe). The most famous statue of Peter I in St Petersburg. In fact, the whole city may be considered as a vast monument to him.\nSt.Petersburg – Royal Palace\nPeter the Great had his own son killed because of suspicion of plotting against him.\nSuleiman the Magnificent ( ) Sultan of the Ottoman Empire\nSuleiman’s Topkapi Palace in Istanbul\nSuleiman the Magnificent was the most powerful monarch of his time: His wealth surpassed that of any European monarch The Ottoman Empire became one of the most powerful empires in history, reached all the way to the border of Austria Istanbul became one of the most magnificent capitals Art and literature flourished Strengthened the legal system of the Ottoman Empire\nThere was NO democracy in medieval times What was the main form of government in late medieval Europe? Absolute monarchy Why did citizens accept this for so many centuries? Because they didn’t question the divine right of kings to rule.\nIn England, however, things began to change very early… LIMITED MONARCHY in England\nTHE MAGNA CARTA (The Great Charter) THE MAGNA CARTA (The Great Charter) KING JOHN was forced to sign it in 1215 (in England)\nWHAT WAS THE MAGNA CARTA? The first legal document which limited the power of the king. Who limited the power of the king? A group of citizens (a council of nobles, church leaders & wealthy middle class people). This council later became known as the Parliament in England. The Magna Carta was a LAW that the king was forced to accept – a law that applied to ALL including the king himself. (The king is not above the laws.) Everyone has the right to be tried by a jury of his peers (equals). English kings could not impose taxes without the approval of the nobles. (the Parliament’s “power of the purse” & “no taxation without representation”)\nTrouble began in the 17 th century: King Charles I tried to rule as an absolute monarch. Charles I denied Parliament’s power to limit his “divine right.” He dissolved Parliament, began imposing high taxes and imprisoning his opponents. What was the response of the English Parliament? They went to war with their king – the English Civil War broke out in 1642.\nThe English Civil War ( ) Was between the army of Charles I and the army of the English Parliament, headed by Oliver Cromwell. Why were they fighting? Limiting the monarchy. Who won and who lost? Parliament won.\nCharles I was beheaded. England was declared a Republic. Oliver Cromwell became a military dictator. After Cromwell’s death, Parliament invited Charles II to restore the limited monarchy.\nKing James II – tried once again to rule as an absolute monarch in the 1680s. Once again the English Parliament was ready to go to war to prevent that. The English nobles secretly offered the English crown to Mary (James’s daughter) and her husband William of Orange. When their army arrived in London, James II gave up his throne. William and Mary took the crown from James II in a bloodless way - this is known as the Glorious Revolution.\nAfter the Glorious Revolution, before the nobles/barons gave the English crown to William & Mary, they asked them to sign the ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS (1689). What do you think it did? It limited the power of the monarch even more (ex. can’t decide on taxes) It gave more freedoms and rights to the common people – right of trial by jury, freedom to petition the king, freedom to elect representatives in parliament, etc.\nTHE ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS 1689 Kings cannot impose taxes without Parliament’s consent. King can’t mobilize the army without Parliament’s consent. People have the right to a trial by jury Kings may not suspend laws or interfere with free Parliament elections. No cruel & unusual punishment\nCONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY THE ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS turned England into a CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY, where laws (constitution) passed by the Parliament limited the power of the kings.

The six rivers for which the forest is named carved out deep valleys from a prominent coastal range over thousands of years. The streams support several species of fish and a mixed bag of wildlife. Visitors come from miles around to enjoy the hiking trails that were created by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) during the 1930s and have been maintained ever since by the United States Forest Service (USFS). People from as far away as San Francisco and Reno stay in nearby communities like Crescent City, CA, while venturing into the forest to get close to nature.\nActivities in Six Rivers National Forest\nSix Rivers National Forest receives massive amounts of precipitation, either through rainfall or fog, which is the principal reason redwoods thrive in the area. These gigantic trees create their own ecosystem by sending roots into compost collected at various heights where massive limbs collect debris. Douglas Fir and Red Cedar crowd the higher elevations of the forest where redwoods do not thrive. The undergrowth is tremendous and is often difficult to pass through.\nThe deep valleys of Six Rivers National Forest are cut off from the sky by a massive canopy of redwoods, firs, and cedars. However, the hilltops and high peaks of the forest provide a startlingly clear view of the night sky.\nAngling is the big draw that brings people to Six Rivers National Forest. As the name portends, six rivers cut through the forest, but that is just the tip of the massive amounts of water available here. Hundreds of streams packed full of trout run down the hills into the rivers. There are a significant number of lakes in the forest, some of which are unvisited, where angling will get you your limit in a short time.\nWhen you visit Six Rivers National Forest, you find a diverse wildlife habitat that houses animals much as it has for thousands of years. Since the forest was established early, long before humans sought to develop such areas for profit, the animal population has been protected. Indeed, 12 threatened and endangered species find shelter in this forest.\nGeocaching is allowed in Six Rivers National Forest in sections that are not designated as Wilderness Areas. Be aware of where you are planting your cache, and have fun in the areas provided.

{"question":"How does the aesthetic function of coffered ceilings contrast with flying buttresses in architectural design?","answer":"Coffered ceilings serve primarily as decorative elements that can add either rustic charm or ornate elegance to a room, being constructed today from lightweight materials like veneer or particleboard for affordable installation. In contrast, flying buttresses served both practical and aesthetic functions in cathedral architecture - they were originally developed to support vaults and roofs, but later were retained purely for aesthetic purposes to create supernatural impressions through their arched designs and spaces filled with light. While coffered ceilings affect room appearance by reducing reflected light and potentially making spaces appear smaller, flying buttresses were specifically designed to enable larger, more imposing internal spaces associated with spiritual experiences.","context":["A coffered ceiling has beams arranged in an appealing geometric pattern that give the ceiling a recessed appearance. Today most coffers are hollow and crafted from veneer, particleboard or plastic. These lightweight materials allow coffered ceilings to be installed with little preparation and at an affordable cost.\nChoosing the Right Coffer\nBefore you can decide which type of coffered beams to buy, you should lay out your design on graph paper. This will allow you to visualize the finished ceiling before you begin the project. Keep in mind that adding textured finishes to the ceiling may enhance the use of coffered beams. Pre-fabricated coffered beams come in many widths and heights. Coffered beams will reduce the amount of light reflected back into a room and can make a room appear smaller. Using a thinner beam will reduce this affect and still produce the desired results.\nCoffered Ceiling Kits\nMany companies manufacture these ceiling kits to your room and personal specifications. These kits vary in price and complexity. Ornate moldings and drop down ornamentation can produce a ceiling reminiscent of the ancient Greek or the Gothic period in European architecture. Simple coffered beams produce a ceiling with a rustic hand-hewn beam appearance and are less expensive than the ornately carved coffer beams and trim.\nPreparing the Ceiling\nBefore you begin attaching the supports for the coffered beams, the ceiling should be painted if needed. It is easier to paint and or texture a ceiling before installing the beams. Be sure to allow the ceiling to dry completely before installing the coffered beams. Textured ceilings can add a depth to coffered beams. Drywall mud is applied to the ceiling and then using sponges, bristled brushes, trowels or hands a texture is created. A thin coating provides for a light texture while a thicker coating will provide the material for deep textures. Once completely dry, the textured ceiling can be painted. Drywall mud is available in muted colors allowing for the creation of textured ceilings that do not require painting.\nThese ceilings require support. The easiest way to install hollow coffer beams is to place a wood support strip on the ceiling. The hollow beam is then nailed to this support on both sides providing adequate support. It is recommended that you place the center beams up first. This allows for any adjustments due to un-level ceilings to be made during installing. Adjustments made on the outer edges of the ceiling will not be visible. Center beams that are not aligned will be visible.\nAfter the coffered beams are installed, trim boards will be added to help cover any imperfections and add a finishing touch. Wide trim will produce a deeper recessed look than thin trim will. Trim boards should be finished to match or accent the coffered beams prior to installation. Using glue and finishing nails ensures that the coffered ceiling will last for many years.\nCoffered beams are a way to enhance any rooms décor. Adding a rustic touch or an ornate sense of elegance can both be achieved by installing a coffered ceiling.","– Bruce Long\nMost of us – especially the Catholics and High Anglicans among us – are aware that Medieval Cathedrals were often constructed with flying buttresses. These external arch like props or supports had two functions. One function was practical, and yet had an ultimately aesthetic purpose. The other function was religio-aesthetic. The aesthetic of Cathedrals was and is very much motivated by spiritual considerations. The idea of space inside a place dedicated to the worship of deities visualised as very large was important to the overseers and worshipers alike. As a result, much was invested in maximising the high internal space of cathedrals. They were in a sense, after all, supposed to house the spirit of a god that was thought to be very big in different ways (or to be sporting a large presence) or at least to stand as some kind of metaphorical reference thereto for the comfort of the community (flock). To this end the structural strength of the support of the roof and walls was moved partially to the outside of many Cathedrals (Notre Dame and Strasborg are notable examples).\nOriginally flying buttresses were developed to support the vault of cathedrals and their roofs. Later Cathedral construction was able to eliminate the external buttress due to improvements in construction technology, but it was retained in some cases for the second function: the aesthetic function. The design of a flying buttress is such that the massive (usually stone) pillar stands apart from the wall it is supporting, while the arch affixed to the pillar meets the supported wall of the vault and/or roof at the top. The series of arches gives a space underneath. This space is associated – by those in the business of knowing spiritual and supernatural things – with impressions of the supernatural.\nSpaces filled with light are prominent in the interior of cathedrals, and are featured in many famous Gothic and classical Christian artworks. Light through the clouds, rays of light through space and the air, horizons and sunsets full of light: all of the kinds of image tropes that most of us readily associate with spiritual impressions – even those of us not of a supernaturalist leaning, perhaps. Waters and light in air and through space are themes touched upon extensively in religious writ from The Bhagavad Gita, to Buddhism and Taoism, to the Pentateuch with its body of a god hovering over the waters and the creation of light. In many of these traditions, however, these supernatural and miraculous concepts stem from and merge with the natural.\nThe aesthetic effect on the inside of a cathedral is well documented. The imposing impression of size and space has been discussed and described many times by architecture and art critics. What I am interested in here, however, is the philosophy of aesthetics – or just aesthetics – and how it relates to planned social spaces.\nPhilosophy courses about aesthetics often start with something Greek (the Greeks were certainly interested in beauty), then move on to – say – Tolstoy. Tolstoy is a central figure because of his formative place in European aesthetic theory. He had a very straightforward and very religioius definition of the beautiful. Art is only beautiful and of high quality if it elicits feelings. But these feelings are best if they glorify and morally elevate the god mentioned in the Bible (which character’s name is God in English, of course). By the time of Tolstoy, however, natural theology – based upon the theological premise that nature was a prime testimony of the power of the Christian god – had been well established for some time.\nGenerally (in the West) students of the philosophy of aesthe\ntics are moved from the ecclesiastical-supernaturalist and other religious conceptions of beauty to more contemporary relativist and postmodern theories via thinkers like the romantic Jean Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Hume famously asserted that one cannot get an ought from an is – meaning that one cannot assert what should be the case simply based on the habits of people in society. His conception of what was moral was thus associated not with an objective external standard of some kind (called objective moral realism) as Tolstoy’s god-centered morality was. Hume instead asserted that sentiment was the basis of moral value. If a social group had certain sentiments about the moral value of something, then this was all there was as a basis of morals – and another group or individual may have different sentiments. Hume’s approach to aesthetic value – the beautiful – was similar. He asserted that aesthetic value is only subjective: the root of the idea that beauty is in the idea of the beholder. However, when it came to expert assessment of what kinds of art and design are to be called beautiful: that required an expert with years of training. Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder, but judging art required a well cultivated and trained eye.\nKant revised Hume on just about everything (although many philosophers are not convinced at his success in the endeavour, including Bertrand Russell). Kant’s approach to almost everything involved his concept of normativity. According to Kant, the moral thing to do is that which one would normally will to do ideally in any given circumstance. His aesthetics was also normative in flavour, but more importantly, he tried to reintroduce an objectivity into the evaluation of the aesthetic. Except, however, for Rousseau and Hume, the concept of the link between the beautiful and the natural gets somewhat lost by the time of Kant.\nKant in a sense regarded beauty as having a natural basis, since he thought that human cognition was determined in its nature teleologically, along with nature itself. That is to say, almost everything in Kant’s doctrine was subsumed to teleology – purposed nature – and of course for Kant the purpose is from an all powerful god. Kant performs something of a philosophical sleight of hand in that he rarely discusses the connection between God and teleology, but his assumed source of purpose as a theist, and something of a theologian, could be nothing else. He was commissioned by the academy and the elite to counter the significantly anti-religious scepticism of Hume.\nHowever, to the credit of the power of Hume’s thought and philosophical argumentation, and based upon the backdrop of a powerful recent empiricist turn in philosophy and natural philosophy, Kant did not feel free to call on the god of the bible in his philosophy openly (although said Biblical character did get a mention sometimes) because Hume had set the tone such that this could never be a philosophically respectable response. It would be theology – not philosophy to use a god as the explanation for everything, and the Empiricists – of which Hume was arguably the chief exemplar – had established their doctrine of demonstrable empirical evidence soundly by the time Kant arrived on the scene (although one of them – Locke – was certainly theist). Thus Kant emphasised teleological nature as central in almost everything. However – according to Kant it was the teleology – the purpose – itself that provided the basis for the aesthetic, moral, and objective value of things.\nNature as beautiful in and of itself is a theme that is central to Eastern mysticism and religious philosophy: especially Taoism and Buddhism. It was, however, arguably only recovered in West in the 20th century by Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul Sartre in the sense that most of them – as existentialist philosophers – had naturalist leanings with respect to the environment in which humans lived existence was experienced:\nHowever, whilst Camus’ ‘absurd’ names the essentially tragic state of humanity, it is counterbalanced by his awe towards the indifferent majesty of Nature. For Camus, one of the ways of liberating oneself from the illusion of meaning and unity is to open up to the beauty of Nature and partake in it, abandoning oneself in privileged moments of hedonistic communion with wild environments, such as the rugged Algerian landscape or the Mediterranean, or in eroticism (1938a; see the moments of happiness in The Outsider, for example, 1942a, 23–24, 116–117). (SEP: Existentialist Aesthetics)\nIn contemporary planning theory and philosophy, nature takes a central place across the board. It is elemental in positivism from the scientific standpoint of systems approaches where the systems in question are often natural systems that must be integrated and managed into lived environments. Similarly for the constructivist outlook: nature is the basis of the idea of the value of the greenspace. In China’s functionalist sustainability-harmony model nature has center stage – not just in terms of resource optimisation and conservation efforts (like staggeringly ambitious zero emission targets) but also in the sense that ancient Chinese appreciation for the centrality of the relationship between people and nature is re-deployed anew with the concept of harmony (within the community and between human society and natural environment).\nThe topic of the pragmatic and alleged psychological value of belief in higher powers is one extensively debated in the philosophy of religion and the philosophy of science (usually in the context of what are called evolutionary debunking arguments). I am not going to try to engage with that extensive material here, except to comment that, in the context of the philosophy of planning, there is strong evidence from the field of social psychology and the field of psychology that the more Utopian or ‘Eden like’ – the more like the Elysian Fields or Shangri La or Heaven on Earth a place is – the psychologically healthier its inhabitants are. Actually, I suggest that, human beings being the evolved psychological agents that we are, it is probably nature that informs our impression of what is beautiful. This would fit with the studies done on the psychological benefits of greenspace.\nFrom the time of the Greeks through to Tolstoy and then Hume, Kant, and then the existentialists, the concepts of both the supernatural and natural as elements of the aesthetic persisted (existentialist Kierkegaard was of course a theist). Scientific naturalism is critical and central to sustainable and psychologically healthy urban plans, and so nature has taken the lead as the key to aesthetic value in urban planning. City buildings are now often planned and architected with gardens on their roofs and walls, and the garden-park features prominently in city greenspaces. So architecture plays a part in greenspace now, but as we saw earlier, architecture has been known to have a psychological impact for some time. Cathedral builders used it to great effect – and affect. The design and arrangement of large vaults of space was their primary tool, and spaciousness is an aesthetic associated with luxury and comfort for good reason. The opposite of spaciousness is labelled as ‘cosy’ by real estate marketers, but there is arguably not really any positive aesthetic value associated with it – just claustrophobia.\nIf constructed spaces designed to communicate impressions of the supernaturally large were once the mainstay of aesthetics in architecture and the planning of social and public spaces that went with it, they were always perhaps a spiritual-romantic facsimile of the grandeur of nature and its spaces: the cosmos, the horizon, the sky, the oceans, celestial bodies, and the clouds. Now planners of architecturally defined urban and city spaces defer directly to nature – but still push it into the maximally comfortable and curated format possible in many cases. So the impression of not just nature and the open natural space alone is seemingly not all that constructivists are now interested in. There is still a strong reference to the managing of nature into a Utopian garden. Lions, tigers, and poisonous thickets might be exciting and awe-inspiring, but they are also the kind of thing nature offers that motivated us to build cities in the first place. Edifice and curated nature still both have an important aesthetic place, and they are increasingly merged.\nBibliography and References\n- Deranty, J.-P. (2015). Existentialist Aesthetics. In E. N.

{"question":"As an immunology student, I'm curious about how T cell tolerance works in the thymus and what happens when this process fails with age?","answer":"T cell tolerance operates through two key mechanisms in the thymus: central tolerance eliminates self-reactive T cells, while peripheral tolerance generates regulatory T cells that suppress self-reactive T cells that escape thymic destruction. These processes depend on interactions between developing T cells and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). However, the thymus undergoes age-related degeneration starting around puberty, which progressively reduces the production of new T cells. This leads to an oligoclonal T cell repertoire rather than a broad spectrum of immunity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections, decreased vaccine responses, and paradoxically, increased autoimmunity.","context":["Konstantina Alexandropoulos, PhD\n- ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR | Medicine, Clinical Immunology\n- ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR | Medicine, Liver Diseases\nResearch Topics:Autoimmunity, Cell Adhesion, Cell Motility, Chemokines, Chemotaxis, Epithelial Cells, Immunological Tolerance, Immunology, Inflammation, Integrins, Lipid Signaling, Migration, Protein Kinases, Signal Transduction, T Cells, Tolerance, Trafficking, Transplantation\nKonstantina Alexandropoulos, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the Department of Medicine/Division of Clinical Immunology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Head of the T-cell-mediated Autoimmunity and Inflammation Laboratory. Research in the laboratory focuses on understanding the mechanisms that regulate T cell tolerance and how disturbances in this process result in organ-specific autoimmunity. The laboratory has uncovered mechanisms that regulate T cell tolerance through elimination of autoreactive T cells in the thymus, as well as tolerogenic mechanisms that supress self-reactive T cells in peripheral organs. Ongoing collaborative projects are exploring how the gut microbiota regulates T cell self-reactivity and inflammation in the liver and colon. Studies in preclinical mouse models and human specimens are in progress to identify immune cell profiles that promote development of liver and colon autoimmune diseases, elucidate the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and develop strategies to combat organ-specific autoimmune inflammation.\nMulti-Disciplinary Training AreaImmunology [IMM]\nPhD, City University of New York (CUNY)\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nKonstantina Alexandropoulos, PhD, is the Director of the T-cell Mediated Autoimmunity and Inflammation Laboratory. The laboratory focuses on elucidating several aspects of T cell physiology including T cell development, activation and trafficking under physiologic and disease conditions.\nOne major focus of our research is directed towards understanding the processes that cause aberrant T cell function and T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases exemplified by conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. Under normal conditions, developing T cells in the thymus are educated not to attack the body's own tissues in a process known as T cell tolerance. T cell tolerance is exerted through two different mechanisms: a) elimination of mature, self-reactive T cells in the thymus (central tolerance); b) intrathymic generation of regulatory T cells which in peripheral tissues suppress the activity of self-reactive T cells that escape destruction in the thymus (peripheral tolerance). Establishment of both central and peripheral tolerance occurs in the thymus and is highly dependent on reciprocal interactions between developing T cells and the thymic epithelium, specifically medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Disruption of these interactions leads to aberrant elimination of autoreactive T cell clones, defective peripheral tolerance and autoimmunity, manifested as T cell-containing inflammatory infiltrates in and autoantibody production against peripheral tissues. We are currently using different mouse models with mutations that disrupt the development of mTECs to understand how disruption of thymic cross-talk between the medullary epithelium and T cells affects T cell development and autoimmunity.\nAnother area of research in the laboratory concentrates on elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell activation and migration during the initiation and establishment of an immune response respectively. In these studies we are using knockout mice lacking expression of novel signaling proteins we previously characterized to study how these proteins regulate T cell activation, migration, and T cell-mediated immune responses under normal or inflammatory conditions. Our studies using mouse models coupled with molecular and biochemical approaches serve as a platform towards elucidating basic aspects of T cell physiology and are aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets to control the behavior of T cells in inflammation and autoimmunity.","Under normal conditions, most T lymphocytes are made in the thymus. Unfortunately, the size of the thymus degenerates progressively with age, with a noticeable onset at around the time of puberty. Because the output of new T cells from the thymus is directly proportional to its mass, age-related thymic atrophy results in a lifelong, progressive decline in the production of new, naive T cells. In the peripheral lymphoid system, this decreased thymic output is compensated by homeostatic expansion of existing T cells. While this avoids frank T cell lymphopenia, the end result is that, over time, the T cell pool increasingly represents an oligoclonal repertoire, rather than the broad, unbiased spectrum of immunity conferred by newly generated, naive thymic T cells. Thus, aging is associated with an accumulation of T cell immunodeficiencies (or immunoinsufficiencies) that, in turn, result in increased susceptibility to infectious disease, decreased response to vaccines, decreased anti-tumor surveillance, increased autoimmunity, and other related disorders. Decreased capacity to make new T cells is also a substantial limitation in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is an established therapy for diseases like leukemia, and an emerging therapy for autoimmune disorders like lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. Correcting and/or preventing age-related thymic degeneration (atrophy) is thus of substantial importance for enhancing quality of life, and for decreasing health care costs in adults and the elderly. Notably, the thymus can be induced to completely regrow, although the most efficient means for this (surgical castration) is somewhat impractical. Nonetheless, this plasticity underscores the potential for devising other more practical means for inducing thymic regrowth.\nThe aims of this project are to use recently devised, robust physical methods (laser microdissection, microarray) and computational modeling to generate accurate global lists of thymic stromal genes in their native state in situ, both in the unmodified atrophied thymus, and during various phases of regrowth (initiation, log phase, termination) induced by castration. Stromal gene expression signatures will then be analyzed to reveal changes that occur in atrophy, and during the regrowth response. Informatic and biological validations will be used to identify key regulators in these processes, which will be followed-up by conventional biological approaches (transgenics, knockouts). In addition to an in- depth understanding of thymic stromal biology and the regrowth process, this project is expected to ultimately reveal potential new targets for therapeutic approaches for thymic regeneration.\nDecreases in T cell immunity are a direct consequence of age-related thymic degeneration, and are linked to a host of undesirable conditions, including increased risk of infection, increased severity of infection, decreased response to vaccinations, decreased tumor surveillance, increased autoimmunity, and so on. Regenerating the thymus is therefore of significant interest to human health. This application proposes a novel approach to understanding the biology of regrowth of the atrophied thymus. In addition to an in-depth understanding of the regrowth process, this project is expected to ultimately reveal potential new targets for thymic regeneration therapy.\n|Griffith, Ann V; Venables, Thomas; Shi, Jianjun et al.

{"question":"How did the city of Constance handle both religious reform and papal conflicts during the medieval and reformation periods, and what were the eventual consequences for the city?","answer":"Constance played a significant role in both papal and reformation history. During the Great Schism, it hosted the Council of Constance in 1414, a major Church gathering that resolved the crisis of having three competing popes by electing Pope Martin V. Later, during the Reformation period, Constance became a reformed city under the leadership of Ambrosius Blarer, who implemented strict moral laws in 1526 that prohibited activities like dancing, drinking, and adultery. The city's reformers were idealistic and even developed a unique system where citizens took turns as moral guardians. However, the city's Protestant ambitions ultimately led to its downfall. In 1548, after refusing to negotiate with Emperor Charles V unless they could maintain their Protestant faith, Constance lost a battle at its gates. As a result, they were forced to abandon Protestantism and lost their status as an Imperial Free City, becoming subject to Catholic Habsburg Austria.","context":["The title of this episode of CS is The Not-So Great After All Schism.\nAt the end of our last episode, a Frenchman, the Archbishop of Bordeaux was elected by the College of Cardinals in 1305 as Pope Clement. But Clement never set foot in Rome, because the locus of political power had shifted to France & her King, Philip. This marks the beginning of what’s called the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy, a 72–year long period when France dominated the papacy. After Clement, the next 6 Popes, all French, chose to make their headquarters in Avignon rather than Rome. Though it began as a small town when Clement first located there, over the next 70 years it grew to a population of some 80,000, nearly all of them associated in some way with the Church bureaucracy.\nThis transfer of the papacy from Rome to France had a profound impact on the way all Europe came to see both the Pope and the leadership of the Church. Rome was the Eternal City. The Church of Rome, with the Pope as its bishop, went all the way back to Peter. That’s why people regarded it as special; why it called the shots for everyone else. If the Pope no longer sat in Rome, if he could now reside in some other church, what did that say about his authority? Was he indeed Peter’s successor? Was he truly The Vicar of Christ? And what did it mean when the Pope seemed to be little more than the political mouthpiece for the King of France?\nWhile the French enjoyed having the Pope close to home, the rest of Europe didn’t find it much to their liking. The duchies and other regions of what would alter be called Germany in particular resented it, since they were in constant tension with France.\nMost of the hostility toward the Avignon papacy revolved around the abuse of money. Since the Papal States in Italy were no longer contributing, the papacy nearly went bankrupt. To replace the lost income the Avignon popes employed a whole slew of both old & new schemes. There were fees for this privilege and taxes for that. Whenever a new bishop was appointed, his first year’s income went instead to the Pope. Then veteran bishops were transferred between churches, so the Pope could start the process all over again. Sometimes NO bishop would be appointed to a post, so the entire income for months on end went to Avignon.\nThe most lucrative practice was the granting of indulgences. These were passed out for just about any reason; any venture the Church figured was in its interest. Anything from a minor public works project to engaging in war, could earn someone an indulgence. And what the indulgences earned those they were granted, grew as the months and years passed. The common people, who couldn’t afford to purchase such spiritual extravagances, & trusted in a more sincere form of devotion to God, saw all of this as a gross departure from the path of righteousness. Bitter feelings against Avignon grew, especially when the Pope demanded an increase in revenue under the threat of excommunication. Hell was for un-repentant sinners, not people who couldn’t afford to pay ever more in taxes & fees.\nBy 1360 the outcry over the French domination of the Church made it clear the Avignon papacy could not continue. No one foresaw the incredible events the return to Rome would bring.\nIn 1377 the elderly Pope Gregory XI re-entered Rome. But the joy that attended the re-establishment of the papacy there was short-lived. Gregory died within a year. The College of Cardinals, still filled by Frenchmen, yielded to the clamor of a Roman mob and chose an Italian. On Easter Sunday, April 18, Urban VI was crowned as the new Vicar of Christ. As the next months unfolded, it became clear Urban was a harsh dictator. The Cardinals had second thoughts about his election. In August they announced that in their earlier decision, a mob had forced the selection of an apostate and the proceedings were invalid. End of Round One.\nIn September, the so-called apostate Pope Urban VI fired off Round Two in the conflict by creating a new College of Cardinals. The first College, dominated by those French cardinals, chose a new Pope from their number, Clement VII. Clement took a tour of Italy to present himself as the real Pope, then headed back to Avignon.\nThis brings us to what is known as “The Great Schism.” It lasted for 39 years. Each papal court had its own College of Cardinals, insuring the succession of its choice. Each Pope claimed to be the true Vicar of Christ, with the power to excommunicate those who refused to acknowledge him. The other guy, of course, was “antichrist.”\nOf course, the French went with Clement; Italy and most of the rest of Europe, with Urban. But since England went with Urban, Scotland went with – can you guess? Yep – Clement. Within each kingdom, there were minorities of support for the “other guy.”. Riots broke out. Property was burned and a new crusade was called for.\nIn 1395 professors at the University of Paris proposed a general council, representing the Universal Church, to meet and heal the schism. Problems immediately arose. Canon Law said only the Pope could call a general council; and only the Pope could ratify any decision it made. Which Pope had those rights? In effect Canon Law prohibited the reunion of Christendom!\nBy 1409 a majority of the cardinals from both sides agreed something had to be done. They met for a general council at Pisa in Italy. They deposed both Popes & elected a new man, Alexander V. Wouldn’t you just know it; neither of the 2 deposed prelates accepted the action. Now the Church had not 2, but 3 POPES!\nOne of them called for a crusade against another and sold indulgences to pay for it. This ridiculousness finally stirred the people of Europe to action. In 1414 the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund assembled the most impressive Church gathering of the era at the German city of Constance. Even the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church sent reps.\nFor the first time, voting took place on a purely national basis. Each nation had 1 vote. The national structure of the council was highly significant. It shows that the Church was reluctantly coming to realize the new national alignment of power turning Europe into the modern world.\nIt took 3 years, but eventually the council got one of the Popes to step aside, deposed the other 2 and chose a new Pope, Martin V. One of the deposed popes tried to retain his title, but for all practical purposes, the council in Constance brought an end to the Great Schism.\nJust when it seemed things would get back to normal, the new Pope made a move which seemed to slit his own throat. The instant he was seated, he repudiated all acts of the council, except the one by which he ruled. Yet it was the council’s acts that had built the authority by which they could name him Pope. It was as if he said his election was based on a fiction.\nLooking back, Pope Martin’s actions seem foolish, but he had good reason to deny the work of the council. It raised a very important question: Who’s greater, a council that seats a Pope, or the Pope who’s authority convenes councils?\nThis blatant foray into political machinations dug a trough for the papacy it would be a while getting out of.\nAs we end this shorter episode on the Not So Great After All Schism, it seems this is a good place to pause and make an editorial comment.\nOver the years I’ve done this podcast, I’ve had only a few Roman Catholics who’ve gone after me for not being fair with the Church & Papacy. A lot more Catholics have remarked on how fair they’ve found the podcast. So let me say this à The Church, whether we’re talking about the Eastern Orthodox, the Church in the East, the Roman Catholic Church, of the dozens of Protestant groups have a mixed record when it comes to faithfulness to God. There are high points and low. Golden Ages, Glided Ages, & periods of grody mud. There’s no point in white washing those times in Church History when the so-called people of God didn’t act like it. This era of the Great Schism is at best an embarrassment. No amount of spin can make it anything else. Pope Alexander VI, real name was Roderigo Borgia. He ruled from 1492–1503 & was grossly immoral; obsessed with providing wealth and power for his children. The entire 15th C is an abysmal period for the Popes as they were far more interested in politics & the arts than in the things of God. As Shelly puts it, “The pope often could not make up his mind whether he was the successor of Peter or of Caesar. Political corruption and immorality in the Vatican reached unbelievable heights under the Borgias.”\nAnd while things were horribly out of whack in the upper reaches of the Church Hierarchy, there weren’t hundreds, maybe even thousands of godly bishops, priests, and deacons who served their parishes well, with a heart to glorify God. It’s just that the Papacy was certainly no example to follow.\nSo, Martin V tried to up-end the Council of Constance but what happened there was not to be forgotten by the representatives. Estrangement from the Vatican was growing. Men began to think in terms of “national churches,” and a church governed by representative bodies instead of a tyrannical dictator. The philosophical ground for the Reformation was being groomed.","Ambrosius Blarer was born 1492 into a leading family of Konstanz. He studied theology in Tübingen where he met Philip Melanchthon with whom he kept a lifelong friendship. After getting his master‘s degree, he entered the Benedictine monastery Alpirsbach Abbey.\nThrough his correspondence with Philip Melanchthon and his brother Thomas Blarer, a student in Wittenberg between 1520 and 1523, Ambrosius Blarer was well informed about Luther's teachings and began spreading them himself among his brothers. This led to a conflict between him and his superiors and in 1522 Blarer fled the convent. He found refuge in his hometown; Constance was already well on the way to becoming reformed so he did not have to fear the consequences of breaking his vows. Nevertheless, he kept wearing his habit.\nReformation of Konstanz\nIn February 1525, Blarer started preaching in Konstanz and he soon became a leading figure of the local Reformation. With his cousin and co-reformer Johannes Zwick and their brothers, Konrad Zwick and Thomas Blarer respectively, who were members of the city council (Thomas later became mayor), Blarer had a spiritually as well as influentially effective team to continue the reformation.\nThe Konstanz Reformers were very idealistic, hoping to cleanse the city of all sin and evil. In 1526, a moral law was passed which prohibited dancing, drinking, swearing, adultery, etc. Enforcing the law proved difficult at first, until a new strategy was introduced in 1531; from then on all citizens had to take turns in functioning as moral guardians, reporting every violation of the law to the council. This eliminated the danger of the people‘s anger at the rules to be directed at any one person, as well as the danger of systematically overlooking friends and family.\nAnother speciality of the Constance Reformation was their love for music. Ambrosius wrote many educational and religious songs which were sung as part of the liturgy. Several of his songs can still be found in the Swiss Evangelical Hymn-Book.\nCorrespondence and influence\nLike Martin Bucer of Strasbourg, Blarer‘s theology was greatly influenced by both Zwingli and Luther. He tried to find a position which was acceptable to both parties, which mainly led to his exclusion from both groups. In 1530, Constance signed the Tetrapolitan Confession, the „Zwinglian“ counterpart of the Augsburg Confession, which was neither accepted by the Lutherans nor the Zwinglians. The Tetrapolitan Confession was also signed by Strasbourg (Bucer was its author) and by Memmingen and Ulm, two cities for which Blarer was the main reformer.\nAmbrosius Blarer kept up a wide network of correspondence to many reformers. The best known among them included: Philip Melanchthon, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger, Andreas Karlstadt and Johannes Oecolampadius.\nThe ambitions of the Constance Reformers were shattered in 1548. Unlike the other members of the Schmalkaldic League, Constance had refused to negotiate with Emperor Charles V unless they could obtain the right to keep the Protestant faith. This ended in the battle at the city gates on August 6, 1548, which Constance won, but to prevent further losses, the council finally had to agree to the Emperor‘s conditions. Because they had refused negotiations for so long, they were not only forced to abandon their Protestant faith, but also lost their title of Imperial Free City and became subject to Catholic Habsburg Austria.\nBlarer had already fled before the battle. He lived the rest of his life in exile, in Biel and Winterthur. In the Swiss Confederation he kept on preaching the gospel and advising numerous reformers who turned to him for help. He died in Winterthur December 6, 1564.\n- Martin Burkhardt, Wolfgang Dobras, Wolfgang Zimmermann, \"Konstanz in der frühen Neuzeit\", Konstanz: Stadler Verlags Gesellschaft mbH, 1991 ISBN 3-7977-0259-0\n- ed.

{"question":"What are the key technical features of MSDP in multicast networks, and what security benefits does SDN provide for network management?","answer":"MSDP (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol) enables inter-domain multicast deployments by establishing mesh connections between RPs (Rendezvous Points) that share the same IP address in an anycast configuration, allowing sources and receivers to connect to different RPs while maintaining communication. For security, SDN provides centralized control and holistic visibility of network behavior, enabling efficient enforcement of security policies, reduction of policy conflicts, and runtime manipulation of forwarding rules. SDN also allows for efficient security monitoring and updates by appending security modules at the controller platform instead of hardware changes.","context":["Usually MSDP (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol) is used for inter-domain (different BGP Autonomous Systems) multicast deployments. We can use this even within an IGP environment to provide resiliency for multicast deployment combine with Anycast.\nIn anycast, same IP address (as RP) is advertised by multiple network devices into the network.Therefore when receivers join to particular multicast group, they will connected to close by RP based on the IGP metric advertised. Since all RPs advertizing same IP address sources can join to a different RP where as receivers join another RP (as all advertise same IP). MSDP comes into play in this situation to establish MSDP mesh between each RP. In this way even sources & receivers join into different RP, RPs talk to each other via MSDP they can establish Shortest Path Tree (SPT) between multicast source & receivers.\nSo here is my test set up. I have changed the link bandwidth in order to create different IGP metric to RPs from source & receivers. Also I have configured the same IP address on Loopback 99 interface in both CME & WAN router which will act as RP. PIM sparse mode configured on given interfaces & EIGRP configured for IGP routing.\nFirst we will configure loopback interface in both routers (CME & WAN) & assign same IP address. You need to advertise this into your IGP domain.\nCME# interface FastEthernet0/0 description 100Mbps LINK to CAT2 bandwidth 100000 interface FastEthernet2/1 description 10Mbps LINK to CAT4 bandwidth 10000 ! interface Loopback99 ip address 10.10.99.1 255.255.255.255 ip pim sparse-mode router eigrp 1 network 10.10.99.1 0.0.0.0 WAN# interface FastEthernet0/0 description 100 Mbps LINK TO CAT4 bandwidth 100000 interface FastEthernet0/1 description 10 Mbps LINK to CAT2 bandwidth 10000 ! interface Loopback99 ip address 10.10.99.1 255.255.255.255 ip pim sparse-mode router eigrp 1 network 10.10.99.1 0.0.0.0 CAT2# interface FastEthernet1/0/4 description 100Mbps LINK to CME bandwidth 100000 interface FastEthernet1/0/22 description 10Mbps LINK to WAN bandwidth 10000 CAT4# interface FastEthernet1/0/23 description 10 Mbps to CME bandwidth 10000 interface FastEthernet1/0/22 description 100 Mbps to WAN bandwidth 100000\nNow if you look at IGP metric from Source & Receiver to RP address (10.10.99.1) you would see multicast source connected switch (CAT2) goes to CME where as from receiver connected layer 3 switch (CAT4) prefer WAN router. You can simply verify this by telnet to 10.10.99.1 IP from these two switches.\nCAT2#telnet 10.10.99.1 Trying 10.10.99.1 ... Open CME> CAT4#telnet 10.10.99.1 Trying 10.10.99.1 ... Open User Access Verification Password: WAN>\nNow you have to configure RP address for your network devices. for the simplicity I will use static RP configuration (you can use any other methods like Auto-RP, BSR as well). Therefore “ip pim rp-address 10.10.99.1” needs to be configured on CAT2, CME, WAN, CAT4. Now if you source multicast traffic for a particular multicast group (184.108.40.206) from the source you should see (S,G) entry on CME as CAT2 preferred that over WAN for RP address. You won’t see any entry on WAN router.\nCAT2#ping Protocol [ip]: Target IP address: 220.127.116.11 Repeat count : 5 Datagram size : Timeout in seconds : Extended commands [n]: y Interface [All]: Vlan200 Time to live : Source address: Type of service : Set DF bit in IP header?

Still RP address will be same for them & no need to learn another RP address. This is how you can achieve faster fail over with Anycast MSDP multicast deployment.\n1.

Its ultimate goal is to greatly improve the livability Quality of Service (QoS) of its citizens and to optimize the utilization of its assets and natural resources sustainably. One of the key technical attributes in smart cities is to deploy a large number of sensors to collect data to enable real-time and intelligent\n... ecisions for various city functions and citizen needs. Many of the data have strict security requirements as they are either private to citizens or sensitive to critical infrastructures. As a result, how to securely and efficiently deliver and process the dramatically increasing volume of data becomes one of the grand challenges in materializing the smart city vision. In recent years, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a leading communication infrastructure candidate for smart cities. While many efforts have existed to research, prototype, and even deploy SDN on a small scale for some smart city applications, there is still a lack of cohesive understanding about SDN's impact on the secure communication need of smart cities. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the core functionality of SDN from the perspective of secure communication infrastructure at different scales. A specific focus is put on the security threats and challenges in accordance with SDN plane-based architectures for various smart city-enabled applications. We further systematically categorize the state-of-art solutions and proposals to apply SDN to support typical smart city applications, such as transportation, health, and energy applications. Lastly, we cast a holistic view of future research trends. INDEX TERMS Communication system, OpenFlow, security, smart city, software defined networks. 12084 VOLUME 9, 2021 M. Rahouti et al.: Secure SDN Communication Systems for Smart Cities These manual security configurations (i.e., firewalls, IPSec, intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS)) on a distributed set of network entities are vulnerable to inter-domain policy conflict and configuration and implementation errors, which may lead to earnest security ivulnerabilities and breaches  . Contrariwise, SDN improves security in a networkingenabled environment due to its centralized control of the network system and holistic visibility of the network behavior and run-time manipulation of inserting/pushing forwarding rules  . Therefore, the SDN non-distributed management of network allows for a more efficient enforcement of security policies and reduction of their conflicts. Additionally, security implementations such as security monitoring applications could efficiently inquire flow samples from data-paths via an SDN controller  . Once security analysis is finished, the monitoring application may guide the data path components to take action by either denying incoming traffic, redirecting the traffic to security-based middle boxes, or even restricting the traffic within a particular network authority. Moreover, SDN grants an efficient update of security applications and policy implementations. It allows for appending security modules at the controller platform instead of changing the hardware or even updating its firmware  . As the SDN controller detaches and centralizes the control plane of a network, it allows for the enforcement and automation of security policies due to the programmability features of the SDN controller. Therefore, SDN can deal with network threats and malicious traffic at runtime by leveraging applications of network security. To better represent an SDN architecture, Figure 2 depicts the main planes/layers of SDN and their functionalities. The three planes are shaped as follows: FIGURE 2.

{"question":"Could you explain the key differences between CVRF and SOC for Cybersecurity frameworks in terms of their scope and intended users, and how each framework contributes to organizational security?","answer":"CVRF and SOC for Cybersecurity serve different but complementary purposes in cybersecurity. CVRF is an XML-based framework specifically focused on standardizing vulnerability reporting across organizations, enabling faster exchange and processing of vulnerability-related information. It's available free to the public and can be used by independent bug discoverers, vendors, security coordinators, and end users worldwide. In contrast, SOC for Cybersecurity is a broader risk management reporting framework designed by AICPA that evaluates an organization's entire cybersecurity risk management program. While CVRF focuses on vulnerability documentation, SOC for Cybersecurity provides comprehensive guidelines for documenting cybersecurity risk management programs and includes control criteria based on standards like NIST and ISO 27001/27002. Another key difference is that SOC for Cybersecurity can be used by any organization, unlike other SOC reporting options which are limited to service organizations.","context":["CVRF is an XML-based framework that enables stakeholders across different organizations to share critical vulnerability-related information in an open and common machine-readable format. This format replaces the myriad of current nonstandard reporting formats, thus speeding up information exchange and processing.

Methods such as embedding security metric and vulnerability data inside response reports are all vendor-specific, non-standard and time consuming to decipher manually.\nThrough its CVRF Project, ICASI undertook to remedy this lack of standardization, using the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) as a starting point. The project team – including contributors from ICASI Founding Members Cisco Systems, Intel Corporation, International Business Machines, Juniper Networks, Microsoft Corporation and Nokia, along with representatives from Oracle and Red Hat – also surveyed enterprise users about similarities and differences in current vulnerability reporting, asking them what future reporting methods should address. The team then expanded existing security documentation formats and integrated a best-of-breed solution into a common, open XML-based framework CVRF that brings consolidation and consistency to the security vulnerability documentation space, and is expected to grow organically among stakeholders.\nThe XML-based framework of CVRF predefines a large number of fields, with extensibility and robustness in mind. These fields are consistent in naming and data type, so that any organization that adopts and understands CVRF can easily produce documents or read the ones that another CVRF-equipped organization has produced. Independent discoverers of bugs, large vendors, security coordinators and end users of security response efforts worldwide can all write CVRF documents to share critical vulnerability-related information. Widespread use of CVRF will accelerate information dissemination and exchange and incident resolution as a result.\nICASI's intention is that CVRF be a living framework that will be enhanced and revised as necessary. ICASI plans to continue supporting CVRF to ensure that it will remain both stable and free for use by all. Implementers are encouraged to submit their suggestions for improvements to [email protected]\nThe Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI) provides a unique forum of trust through which global companies can collaborate to actively address complex, multi-product security threats to better protect the critical IT infrastructures that support the world’s enterprises, governments and citizens.

In case you haven’t heard about this framework, we are here to bring you up to speed.\nWhat Is SOC for Cybersecurity Examination and Do You Need it for Your Business?\nWith anticipated security threats like crime-as-a-service (CaaS) and the inherent security risks to the IoT and the supply chain, it seems like every business—in every industry and at every size—is going to have to tighten up cybersecurity.\nSOC for Cybersecurity may be the solution everyone has been scrambling to find to combat the potential risks on the horizon.\nAny business that works with service organizations, which specialize in services that include cloud storage and software-as-a-service (SaaS), must ensure that each service organization maintains a safe and secure cyber environment.\nWith the increasing need for organizations to demonstrate proper management of cybersecurity threats with effective processes and controls in place to detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from breaches and other security events, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) designed a cybersecurity risk management reporting framework.\nThe resulting framework is a key component of the new System and Organization Controls (SOC) for Cybersecurity engagement.\nSide note to curious IT professionals: You might find yourself wondering, “Didn’t SOC once stand for “Service Organization Controls?” If that is the case, you are correct. SOC for Cybersecurity is the cyber controls set and described by each organization’s enterprise-wide cyber risk management program.\nGiven the known and anticipated risks of doing business via the Internet, we believe it is important that you adopt the SOC for Cybersecurity framework for your business. It is a great way to monitor and manage your internal controls, as well as keeping your management and board members, investors, analysts, clients and prospective clients, business partners and industry regulators abreast of the health of your system on a regular basis.\nWhy Did the AICPA Design SOC for Cybersecurity?\nThe AICPA took a look at the cyber environment and realized that it could do something to help all businesses manage the risks. The body designed SOC for Cybersecurity to work as a reporting mechanism for any organization, rather than solely for service organizations that provide services to client organizations, also known as user entities. All other SOC reporting options designed by the AICPA—SOC 1, 2 and 3 examinations—are only intended for service organizations. With this new reporting option, everyone can work with a consistent reporting mechanism for assurance regarding its cybersecurity controls.\nWhat Do You Need to Know About the SOC for Cybersecurity Examination?\nThe SOC for Cybersecurity goes hand-in-hand with the framework. It offers guidelines on the best ways for you to document your own cybersecurity risk management program. It also provides a number of controls and objectives that you may use to stay on track for the best possible cybersecurity.\nAdditionally, the examination presents standards for public accounting firms. These standards allow the firms to report on the cybersecurity programs while also giving clear guidance to CPAs to provide cybersecurity assurance to clients.\nWhat Are the Primary Components of SOC for Cybersecurity Examination?\nThe AICPA designed SOC for Cybersecurity using two basic and important criteria:\n- Descriptive Criteria. Descriptive criteria provide a narrative description of the company’s current risk management program and approach. This key step gives a baseline measurement of the effectiveness of the current controls within the program.\n- Control Criteria. Control criteria are the ideal baseline against each company is able to compare their own baseline measurement within their descriptive criteria to determine where they stand, such as how near to or far from the mark they are.\nUser entities can choose from a few different pre-existing control criteria, also known as a family of standards, including:\n- Trusted Services for Security, Availability and Confidentiality\n- NIST Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Framework\n- ISO 27001/27002\nThe SOC for Cybersecurity examination report will ultimately include:\n- Management’s description of their organization’s cybersecurity risk program\n- Management’s assertion about their cybersecurity risk program\n- Practitioner’s report\nSide note: Keep in mind that there is a difference between SOC for Cybersecurity and risk assessments. The main difference between the two is that a risk assessment measures an organization’s exposure against a specific collection of threats through an evaluation. SOC for Cybersecurity offers an independent opinion regarding an entity’s complete risk management program methodology and practices, which also includes its own risk assessment process.\nA Few Key Benefits of the SOC for Cybersecurity Examination and Reporting\nThere are several benefits associated with adopting the most appealing SOC for Cybersecurity framework for your business and submitting to SOC for Cybersecurity examination and reporting.\n- You provide verified proof that your organization is dedicated to operating within the most secure possible cyber environment.\n- You can stay a step ahead of the competition by taking this extra step that provides assurance to your customers, business associates and any other interested or invested parties.\n- Catch potential issues before they become full-blown data breaches.\nThe Importance of Your Auditor’s Role in SOC for Cybersecurity\nScheduling a SOC for Cybersecurity audit is an important part of implementing your framework, making sure it is running properly and obtaining verified proof that you are doing everything possible to run a safe computing environment in the context of the cyber realm.\nOur team at I.S. Partners, LLC. has championed this new step made by the AICPA to help our clients stay ahead of the curve when it comes to online operations. However, it is understandable that you may feel overwhelmed at the prospect of undergoing one more adoption and implementation of more controls. We can help you sort through it all to make the process easier."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:05f8d85c-990d-457c-a37f-60eebde0909a>","<urn:uuid:42e942fe-83b5-4f7f-9271-d141bcfc04b8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What safety rules and restrictions typically apply to science fair displays?","answer":"Science fair displays typically prohibit several items for safety reasons, including living organisms, plant materials, chemicals, hazardous substances, sharp items, tanks with gases, flames, and batteries. Instead, photographs should be used to document these aspects. Display boards must strictly adhere to specified size dimensions - even slight exceedances may result in trimming by organizers. For electrical components like computers, specific permission may be required. It's recommended to check with fair organizers about permitted items and display requirements beforehand.","context":["Science Fair Display Boards – Communicate Your Experiment and Results\nYou want everyone to know how hard you’ve worked on your project and what a good job you did. So, it’s important to communicate your experiment and results in a way that will immediately attract their attention.\nThe display is the first thing the judges see so you don’t want it to be disorganized and messy, or be cluttered with just text. Remember, you only have one chance to make a first impression!\nThe overall purpose of your display, or poster presentation, is to describe the science project work to the judges and to tell the story of your project.\nIn general, you should plan for your display to include the following:\n- State the purpose of participating in the Science Fair. What problem are you trying to solve, or what question are you trying to answer\n- State your hypothesis, or if it’s an engineering project state the goal\n- List the materials you used\n- Explain the procedures you followed – your Experimental Plan or if it’s an engineering project your Design Analysis\n- Provide you results, as brief summaries\n- Include graphs, charts, diagrams, drawings and/or photographs. Don’t forget to label everything!\n- Conclusions (were you right or wrong); use simple statements, preferably with bullets\n- List references. If you have a lot, then list at least your major references\n- List applications for your research and a few words about any plans you have to do further research on the topic\n- One of the best things you can do is to include pictures of yourself in action working on your project or working with scientists. Make sure you include captions under each picture to explain what’s going on in the photo.\nFollow the Rules\nWe can’t emphasize this enough. Be sure to read and understand all the display and safety rules!\nEvery project receives the same space allocation. The most important thing about your display is to make sure you follow any rules you’ve been given about the dimensions or material of the display. You should not extend your boards by even an inch. With some science fairs, there have been documented cases where the fair organizers have trimmed the sides or top of the display with a knife/saw to make it the size specified in the instructions, even when it cut off important information. So, before you get to the fair, set up the project at home and double check all the dimensions.\nSome projects may need electricity; be sure to check the rules to see if you can bring a display that may need electricity such as a computer. But, just because a computer or something powered by electricity was used to model a process or compile your results does not mean it will be allowed at the fair. Don’t hesitate contacting the science fair organizers if you have any questions. You don’t want to be surprised when you get to the fair and are told you need to dismantle part of your display.\nStudents like to display items they used doing their experiments. For safety reasons, many items cannot be displayed at a science fair including living organisms, plant materials, chemicals, hazardous substances, sharp items, tanks with gases, flames and batteries. You will need to find a way to use photographs to show what you did. Check with the science fair organizers in advance to be certain what you can and cannot display as part of your project. Schools and science fair organizers have the right to remove items that may be dangerous to the public.\nDisplay Board Material\nDisplay board can usually be made of any material, but should be sturdy enough to stand alone on a table. Many students either use a three-panel blank science fair display board you can buy at office stores, or foam core (a type of Styrofoam) which can be purchased in any art supply store and hinged together with strong tape or Velcro. Making your display from wood makes it heavy and difficult to transport. Large displays don’t necessarily mean it’s a good project, so don’t feel like your display has to be the largest one in the room.\nBasic Board Format\nIn most cases, your board will be broken into three segments. People typically read from left to right, so you should set up your board to tell the story of your project from left to right.\n- Left Panel\n- Center Panel\n- Graphs, tables, charts, diagrams\n- Drawings and/or photos. Make sure you put only your best looking drawings or photos that tell a story.\n- Make sure everything is labeled correctly and is self-explanatory\n- Right Panel\n- Conclusion/discussion of your results and observations\n- Suggest future experiments and ways the research might be used by others\n- References; if there are many then select a variety of several of them to show how much background work you did\n- On the Table in Front of the Board\n- Your journal or notebook\n- Your report\n- If you used special equipment or a model and it fits the size requirements, the set-up can be placed in front of your display or in a place to enhance the exhibit – not overwhelm it.\nMake Your Display Stand Out\nYour project will be surrounded by many others, so it’s important that it look good, stand out, be eye-catching and most important — tell the story of your project, completely. Here are some Science Fair Displays and advice about Display Boards:\n- Pick a color scheme and stick to it: Don’t use too many colors, 2-3 at the most or it will become distracting. It’s safest to use black or equally dark lettering. It’s not an art project, but it should still use artistic techniques, mat papers.\n- Your project title should be large enough for a judge to read from about four feet away (14 point is a recommended minimum). If you’re using a standard size tri-fold board from the office supply or art store, your project title should be about two inches high. Make sure the title and text are easy to read. Avoid writing in all capital letters, or using a font with a shadow; these can sometimes be difficult to read easily.\n- If you mount the titles of each section and graphics/photos onto a different color paper, it will create a border to make them more eye-catching.\n- Make sure your display board is neat and looks organized, and be sure to check your spelling and make sure you line papers up straight using rulers. Some judges may question how careful you were with doing your experiment if your display board is unorganized or if there are sloppy spelling mistakes.\n- There are some science fairs that have preliminary judging where projects are reviewed without the students present. When this happens, the display is very important.\n- Can the display get your point across without you being there to provide an explanation? Ask a friend or relative if they can figure out what you did with the project.\n- Here’s another reminder to read the science fair rules and regulations carefully about what you can and can not bring as part of your display (especially make sure you do not bring any chemicals or hazardous materials). Contact the fair organizers if you have any questions at all about this; they’re there to help you.\n- Most fairs do not allow you to show your name, the school name and/or pictures that identify you by name on the board. However, you can include this information in your notebook and on your report."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:03a42b0d-6a4e-4390-88f7-954bcf7649ea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do frogs manage to jump such incredible distances?","answer":"Frogs achieve their impressive jumping abilities through tendons. Research has shown that muscle power alone cannot explain the speed and distance of frog jumps. Instead, it's the tendons that allow frogs to propel their bodies against gravity's pull to achieve these remarkable distances.","context":["How can we replace the beautiful Panamanian golden frog.

Alternatively, delegate this task to a staff member who handles outgoing communications.\n“Your PIO or a writer can craft a great Identity Statement for your city. The trick is to get out of the government-writer frame of mind. Sit at a coffee shop, hang out with your community, get to know what makes your city unique, and write about that.”—SF DEM\nPublic awareness and outreach\nOnce you’ve built your site, you’ll need to promote it and share it with residents. See the Create Awareness page for starter ideas.\n“City72 is far more than a website - it’s about building a culture of preparedness. In San Francisco, our entire preparedness program—and how we connect with our residents—has changed to reflect SF72. Outreach is a constant need and the target audience—“I Shoulds”—needs to be prompted more than once to take the next small step.”—SF DEM\nYou’ll need to purchase a domain name, hosting services, and ongoing technical support. If you plan on using City72 during emergencies, we recommend purchasing robust hosting, rather than relying on free hosting services.\n“Choose a domain name that’s catchy and short to keep preparedness simple.

{"question":"¿Cuál es la diferencia principal entre el uso directo e indirecto del agua en los centros de datos? 🤔 Me gustaría entender mejor cómo consumen agua estas instalaciones!","answer":"Data centers use more water indirectly through electricity consumption than directly through cooling. The indirect water usage occurs because most power generation methods (except wind and solar) involve heating water to create steam for driving turbines, and this process requires additional water for cooling. In cooling towers, about 2% of water volume is lost to evaporation. The direct water usage in data centers primarily comes from cooling systems, particularly in those using adiabatic economizers where water is sprayed onto heat exchanger surfaces or into the air stream for cooling purposes.","context":["It might come as a surprise, but data centers use more water indirectly, thought electricity, than directly through cooling. This is due to the way most electricity is produced. With the exception of alternative power generation methods, like wind and solar, most power generation is achieved through heating water and turning it into steam that drives turbines. The steam that drives the turbine needs to be cooled by another source of cold water. If a body of water is nearby, like a lake or a river, then water is drawn from there. If not, a cooling tower is usually used. Cooling towers are common to natural gas, coal and nuclear power generation. Water that passes through the cooling tower usually loses about 2% of its volume to evaporation. It doesn’t seem like much, but on a scale of hundreds of thousands of gallons it begins to add up. Power generation facilities can compensate for this evaporation loss through rainwater harvesting, which is a feasible solution given the size of the facility. This dramatically reduces strain on the regular water supply.\nWhile the examples of power plants and data centers are relatively niche, there are a variety of industrial applications of rainwater that shouldn’t be overlooked. For example, facilities that serve or employ large fleets of vehicles need also to have a facility for washing them. Vehicle washing equipment is perfectly capable of using rainwater. The more vehicles a company has, the more economically feasible and ecologically beneficial it is to install a rainwater harvesting system.\nMany manufacturing facilities have on-site laundering. Manufacturing plants, especially those that have processes involving direct contact with raw materials, need to wash work clothes on a daily basis. This basic task constitutes enormous water consumption, and is the perfect candidate for using rainwater in its processes. Industrial facilities themselves may also need to be cleaned on a daily basis to maintain health and safety standards. Obviously, the average factory doesn’t need to adhere to hospital levels of spotlessness. Thus, rainwater is perfect for the job. Implementing rainwater in just a few of these aspects of manufacturing can help conserve thousands of gallons of water each year.\nAdditionally, quite a few manufacturing processes involve dust. Building material production, textiles, grain processing – these are some examples where dust can be not only an issue of cleanliness but a genuine danger to health. Dusty processes usually have dust suppression measures that involve spraying water at the source of dust, so that it is immediately washed away without getting the chance to become airborne. Something as simple as a stone saw requires a large tank of water to spray the blade so the stone dust particles are suppressed. On a scale of a factory, this translates to enormous quantities of water, and there is no reason why rainwater cannot be used in this scenario for both economic and water conservation reasons. Rainwater harvesting is a highly effective water conservation method, and if you are a manufacturer, survey your plant to see where rainwater can be used. You’re sure to find it.\nWaterrightsconference © 2020","There has been talk about Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), in data center circles for years. Together with Delta T, it’s become an industry buzzword when talking about data center efficiency and environmental conditions. Another aspect that has become increasingly important as data centers rely on economizer cooling modes is Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE). This issue has been overlooked in the discussion. The Green Grid created both of these data center sustainability indicators.\nWhen deciding between cooling designs, the availability and cost of water should be considered, especially when considering economizer systems.\nWhat is Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)?\nWhile the definition of PUE is the total power utilized by the data center divided by the power consumed by the data center’s IT equipment. The WUE is a comparable measure that splits total yearly water usage by IT power on a certain location.\nPhoto Credit: blog.se.com\nA data center’s water use is a complicated topic. Not only is water utilized on-site, but the utility’s electric power generation also consumes a large amount of water. As a result, boosting data center water use might reduce total water consumption by lowering the amount of energy required. Consider a multi-megawatt data center that consumes tens of thousands of gallons of water each day. For both environmental and local legal concerns, data centers using evaporative cooling should strive to reduce their water use.\nWater Source and Pressure for Adiabatic Economizers\nPhoto Credit: processcooling.net\nAdiabatic economizers spray water onto heat exchanger surfaces or straight into the air stream. The water serves to cool the air as it enters the data center.However, part of the water evaporates and is wasted in the process. For these systems to work, you’ll need a consistent and reliable source of water. You will lose the economizer benefit if your water supply is turned off for whatever reason. If there is a considerable possibility of water shortages, you may need to build larger economizer systems than you would normally, or add separate backup cooling systems, both of which might significantly raise upfront capital expenditures.\nWater pressure is another factor to consider. WUE rises as a result of high-pressure systems producing a fine mist that is prone to a lot of evaporation and water loss. Low-pressure systems function more like a shower, allowing a higher volume of water to be collected and recirculated. If a system does not have a recirculation capability, the water loss is 100%.\nBalancing Water Use And Energy Efficiency\nWe often associate energy efficiency with sustainability – in addition to lower operating costs — but owing to the financial and environmental consequences of water use, this link becomes less obvious with cooling systems that utilize water.\nThis is most evident when an adiabatic system is introduced to an air-cooled chilled water system. The inclusion of an adiabatic system increases the partial power use effectiveness (pPUE) of the air-cooled system by roughly 0.01, equating to 208,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, using a 3 megawatt (MW) data center in Ashburn, Virginia as our testing model. As a result, it raises the water use effectiveness (WUE) from 0 to.165, saving 4.3 million gallons of water per year. Evaporating water has a net effect on the system that improves energy efficiency while also increasing water use.\nBecause most sources of electricity utilize water in the power generating process, it has been argued that lowering data center energy usage aids water conservation. This is a true point, however, in most cases, the water saved upstream by power production processes does not entirely offset the water consumed downstream by data center cooling systems.\nAccording to a 2017 research by the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Labs the average water consumption for electricity in the United States is 0.576 gallons/kWh.Using this average, the adiabatic system is anticipated to save 119,808 gallons of water in power production, resulting in net water consumption of roughly 4.18 million gallons.\nWhile it’s understandable to place a higher priority on the adiabatic system’s capacity to reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the environmental costs of water use, water usage should not be overlooked when considering sustainability.\nCost and Water Quality\nTo determine which system is the best match, you must consider the cost and availability of water. Keep in mind that the cooling system with the lowest power consumption and highest water usage may have the greatest total cost of ownership. Lowering WUE is a worthwhile aim itself, but it is not the only factor to consider.\nWater quality is also a factor to consider. High-pressure adiabatic systems are particularly susceptible to water quality issues. This is because they push water to flow through small orifices to generate fog. Because the orifices of low-pressure evaporative systems are much bigger and less prone to clogging, they are more forgiving. This lowers maintenance expenses and lowers the chance of system failure.\nThe Benefits of Water Cooling Systems Include:\nAn increase in server density is possible.\nThere is a significant reduction in the amount of energy required for cooling.\nThere is less time for manufacturing and a higher return on investment.\nThere’s no requirement for a unique building design.\nInfrastructure that is more reliable,\nThere’s no need to re-characterize air flows before making any movements, additions, or modifications.\nPhoto Credit: www.upsite.com\nMany data center operators have been concerned about possible leakage when using water cooling, but this technology has advanced to the point where this should no longer be an issue. The use of water to cool hotspots enables the future operation of high-density data centers. Water cooling is, in most cases, considered a best-practices approach. When “free cooling” is used during periods of colder weather, water-cooled technologies become even more efficient.\nCooling towers, in actuality, don’t keep things cold. They reject heat by moving heat from the water supply to the atmosphere via evaporation and sensible heat transfer, lowering the water temperature. Because businesses utilize cooling water for a variety of purposes, cooling towers come in a variety of shapes and sizes.\nAir Handling Unit Monitoring with Wireless Tunnel Sensors\nAKCP HVAC MONITORING SENSORS\nIn chilled water cooling systems having sufficient water in the cooling tower is essential. With wireless tank depth pressure sensors, you can easily monitor and be alerted if the water level drops below the required levels.\nFlow meters can be installed to check for water loss, ensuring inflow and outflow are equal.\nDifferential Air Pressure Sensor installed on the Air Handling Unit Filter. When pressure drop across the filter is high filters are dirty and require maintenance. Sensors are wireless with 10-year battery life.\nNaivas, Kenya's largest supermarket and online grocery delivery service, selected AKCP Wireless LoRa™ based monitoring system for quality control temperature and humidity monitoring of their cold storage environment.\nInstalled at the Naivas Beef Butchery, cold storage and dispatch areas the L-DCIM provided centralized monitoring, graphing and alerting.

{"question":"Hi! I am studying wetland restoration in US. Can you compare the restoration goals between San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Baylands?","answer":"Both regions focus on large-scale wetland restoration, but with different specific goals. San Francisco Bay's restoration, exemplified by the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project, aims to recover about 15,000 acres of marshes, tidal flats, and lagoons. The San Pablo Baylands project has a broader vision of creating an unbroken band of restored marshes from the Petaluma River to Vallejo, with specific work including the restoration of 290 acres at Cullinan East through dredged sediment placement and enhancement of 740 acres of seasonal wetland at Haire Ranch.","context":["[This is a guest post from Charles “Si” Simenstad, Research Professor; Wetland Ecosystem Team, School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, in response to the question posed in a prior post, “What specific actions would you propose, if several billion dollars were available to improve the environment of Jamaica Bay and its surrounding neighborhoods?”]\nI’ve enjoyed reading the SeaAndSkyNY blog, and was particularly attracted to your earlier post about how Jamaica Bay is not exactly New York City’s “crown jewel” and the plethora of problems not only affecting the estuary’s ecosystems (e.g., low-oxygen dead zones and disappearing marshes and islands) but the future livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people living in neighborhoods surrounding the bay. However, I might from some experience caution you to not discount either the resilience of the Bay’s ecosystems or the capacity of the stakeholder community to respond with initiatives that would enable adaptation to future degradation.\nMy experience with restoration initiatives in Puget Sound, San Francisco Bay and other coastal regions, which has included extensively urbanized systems, suggests that all but the most extensively degraded estuaries have the capacity for resilience. Even when residents think that their shorelines have become permanently anchored and contaminated by development and industry, as you say, “anything is possible!” San Francisco Bay is a case in point, where the somewhat modest Baylands Ecosystem Habitat Goals project in 1999 synoptically identified and mapped areas for improvement and recovery of the Bay’s shoreline ecosystems, much to the disparagement by many stakeholders; but, likely due simply to identifying the potential capacity of marshes, tidal flats, lagoons and other wetlands to recover, we now find restoration actions like the ~15,000 acres of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project on a trajectory to recovery. While not without its conundrum of complications, inherent in shifting baselines and being situated in the “most invaded estuary in the world”, the promise of emerging wetlands is enlivening a broad spectrum of stakeholders.\nNot that we necessarily can or even have the political will to reverse 100-200 yr of coastal change. The historic template is a noble goal, but many of the fundamental ecosystem processes—such as fresh water and sediment delivery—as well as new phenomenon—such as introduction and colonization by non-indigenous species—have changed the way estuaries function. As a result, the estuary’s response to restoration may alter the structure and composition of component ecosystems in a way that may not be part of the historic template. Thus, a fundamental criterion is for both restoration practitioners and stakeholders to acknowledge system constraints and understand and work with extant ecosystem processes. In the case of Jamaica Bay, where like many urban estuaries the shoreline has been extensively hardened, and nearly all of the fringing wetlands have been removed historically, the only feasible goal is to establish sites that are self-regulating and integrated within their mosaic of the developed landscape. But, if there is any opportunity to reconstitute natural processes that we know can recover more sustainable estuarine landscapes, features and biota, we have the opportunity to advance beyond the less-than-satisfactory mitigation represented by parks and esplanades even if we often have to settle for rehabilitation rather than rigorous restoration. Initiatives in urban estuaries offer the opportunity for expansion of public understanding, appreciation and even direct involvement in restoration that is actually often harder to mobilize in less disturbed landscapes.\nWhile the functions, goods and services that humans value from natural ecosystems may not be easily, rapidly or totally recovered from multiple-stressed environments such as urban estuaries, understanding how we have constrained natural ecosystem processes can move us beyond just the “random acts of kindness” that tend to characterize urban shorelines (some of these ideas are expanded upon in http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092585740500193X). We need to be more strategic and less opportunistic; more comprehensive and less project-specific; and more imaginative and less circumspect. In Puget Sound, where I am involved in the stimulating, albeit challenging, planning of comprehensive restoration and protection of the Sound’s ~4,000 km of nearshore ecosystems (see PSNERP; http://www.pugetsoundnearshore.org/) we have found considerable scientific and social traction by shifting the paradigm from opportunistic, “structure-based” (e.g., focus on ‘designing’ habitats) restoration approaches to repairing impaired and degraded nearshore processes that account for a broad spectrum of ecosystem functions, goods and services. This “process-based” concept also implies greater sustainability and adaptation to future stressors such as sea level rise and other climate change impacts at the coastal margin (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092585740500193X). In fact, the innovative restoration planner would view climate change just as much an opportunity as a constraint.\nBut, as you well know, tackling restoration at these comprehensive scales and approaching it through the improvement of ecosystem processes requires more science that we have typically accumulated for these systems. And, the multiple stressors inherent in urban estuaries require more disciplines, skills and tools than suburban and rural landscapes. Interdisciplinary science and engineering teams must be assembled to confront the complex issues of rehabilitating highly developed landscapes. Given the persisting uncertainty in urban estuary restoration, two science and technology approaches are almost essential: models – from conceptual to hydrodynamic, sedimentological, and ecological – to formulate predictions of ecosystem responses to restoration actions, and an adaptive management structure to reduce that uncertainty through more experimental learning. Based on our PSNERP experience, I suggest you will find that initiating scientific and technical white papers and other guidance documents, developing conceptual models that bring stakeholders to the table, instituting rigorous external peer review, and other “lessons learned” mechanisms that provide timely dissemination of results to the broader restoration community will instill both trust and confidence in the feasibility and value of taking on restoration at Bay-wide scale.\nI applaud the incentive that through SeaAndSkyNY you have introduced to the concept and reality of restoring Jamaica Bay.

The project has long been a top priority of many local and regional habitat restoration plans. The Refuge is within the larger landscape known as the San Pablo Baylands, which includes more than 40,000 acres of current and historic tidal wetlands, non-tidal perennial and seasonal wetlands, riparian corridors, and uplands. The project advances the landscape-scale restoration vision of the Baylands Ecosystem Habitat Goals Science Update 2015 (2015 Science Update) – to create an unbroken band of restored marshes from the Petaluma River to Vallejo.\nReclamation and conversion have led to the loss of approximately 82% of historic wetlands in the San Pablo Baylands, which despite this loss remain among the most important waterfowl and shorebird staging and wintering habitat complexes in the Pacific Flyway. The area supports over 30 species of waterfowl, and approximately 50% of the Pacific Flyway diving duck population; peak waterfowl populations approach 280,000 ducks. The area also supports nearly 600,000 shorebirds during peak migration periods. Reclaimed lands have subsided three to seven feet relative to marsh elevation depending on land use history. Nevertheless, forthcoming studies indicate that the project is in a prime location for restoration, based on the area’s high resilience to sea level rise due to its high sediment supply, both now and into the future (Healthy Watersheds, Resilient Baylands Report, San Francisco Estuary Institute, in preparation).\nMajor restoration along the Napa River corridor began with the restoration of over 8,700 acres of former salt production ponds and the salt production facility known as the Napa Plant Site, in what is now the Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, owned and managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. This was followed by the restoration of 1,249 acres at the western portion of Cullinan Ranch (Cullinan West) on the Refuge. The project will expand this effort by restoring 290 acres of wetlands near the lower Napa River at the eastern portion of Cullinan Ranch (Cullinan East) through placement of dredged sediment to accelerate restoration and improve resilience for sea level rise. It will also include work in the Sonoma Creek Baylands, where it will repair a levee, enabling enhancement of approximately 740 acres of seasonal wetland at Haire Ranch, the northeastern portion of Skaggs Island, another Refuge property. Finally, it will remove invasive plant species throughout the Refuge and provide conservation education"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f02602c3-e3d2-429d-9d10-e67632b24311>","<urn:uuid:f014b6a6-b729-4ea8-ac52-3b51c2f325fc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to learn about ancient warfare tech. Did Archimedes really create effective weapons, and how long did crossbows stay relevant in actual combat?","answer":"Archimedes created several highly effective weapons, including a steam cannon that MIT students later proved could fire projectiles with more kinetic energy than an M2 machine gun bullet, and the Claw device that could lift and sink enemy ships. He also developed powerful catapults capable of hurling 700-pound rocks. As for crossbows' combat relevance, they remained in use for an exceptionally long time, particularly in China. While they were gradually replaced by gunpowder weapons in Europe, Chinese forces continued using crossbows until the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), though their technological inferiority to modern gunpowder weapons contributed to China's defeat in that conflict.","context":["Most weapons that were used by classical or ancient civilisations will be familiar to us. For example, the Romans’ principal arms included their versions of daggers, short swords, spears and bows.\nThese weapons would have been used by the bulk of ancient armies, but there were other, lesser-known weapons designed to give an unexpected advantage on the battlefield.\nThese arms highlight the creativity, ingenuity and sometimes-horrific imaginations of the designers of ancient war machines.\nArchimedes was a master of weaponry\nNo list of inventive ancient weapons would be complete without a couple of examples from the amazing mind of Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC).\nThough famous for academic pursuits and a range of non-military inventions, Archimedes came up with a few weapons that must have been terrifying and seemed otherworldly to anyone who faced them in battle.\nBesides these less conventional weapons, Archimedes is credited with inventing impressive projectile devices and powerful catapults that were capable of hurling rocks of up to 700 pounds (317 kilos).\n1. Archimedes’ heat ray\nThough this weapon’s existence is debatable, ancient writings describe how an invention of Archimedes was used to destroy ships with fire.\nMany believe that during the Siege of Syracuse, during which Archimedes died, large mirrors of polished metal were used to focus the Sun’s rays onto enemy ships, thereby setting them alight.\nModern recreations of the weapon have demonstrated mixed results regarding its effectiveness.\n2. The Claw of Archimedes\nThis crane-like device utilised a large grappling hook that was suspended from a long arm.\nThe claw would drop down from a city or fortification’s defensive wall and down upon an enemy ship, hook it and hoist it up before dropping the ship back down again, knocking it off balance and perhaps capsizing or sinking it.\n3. Steam cannon\nAccording to both Plutarch and Leonardo da Vinci, Archimedes invented a steam-powered device that could rapidly fire projectiles. Using drawings from da Vinci, MIT students successfully built a functional steam cannon.\nThe shells left the cannon with a velocity of 670 mph (1,080 km/h) and measured a higher kinetic energy reading than a bullet fired from an M2 machine gun.\n4. Repeating crossbow (Chu-ko-nu)\nArchaeological evidence of the existence of repeating crossbows in China has been discovered dating back as far as the 4th century BC.\nThe design for the Chu-ko-nu was improved upon by a famous military advisor named Zhuge Liang (181 – 234 AD), who even made a version that could fire up to three bolts at once. Other ‘rapid-fire’ versions could fire 10 bolts in quick succession.\nThough less accurate than single-shot crossbows and with less range than longbows, the repeating crossbow had an amazing rate of fire for an ancient weapon. It saw use until as late as the Sino-Japanese war of 1894 – 1895.\n5. Greek fire\nThough technically a weapon of the early Middle Ages, Greek fire was first used in the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire around 672 AD, purportedly invented by Syrian engineer Callinicus.\nAn incendiary weapon, this ‘liquid fire’ was propelled onto enemy ships through siphons, bursting into flames on contact. Extremely difficult to extinguish, it even burned on water.\nGreek fire was so effective in combat that it represented a turning point in Byzantium’s struggle against Muslim invaders. So closely guarded was the recipe for Greek fire, that it has been lost in history. We can only speculate as to its exact ingredients.","Not a Shot in the Dark: How Crossbows Changed War in Ancient China\nThe crossbow is a missile weapon that had a major impact on the way battles were fought in the ancient world. Prior to the widespread use of crossbows, it was the bow and arrow that was the projectile weapon of choice. To use this weapon efficiently, however, it was necessary for archers to have a considerable amount of training as well as physical strength.\nBy contrast, it takes a relatively lesser amount of skill and physical strength to operate a crossbow. Moreover, it could be made cheaply. Thus, conscripted soldiers (who may not have had training with the bow and arrow) could be armed with crossbows to shower projectiles on the enemy.\nTracing the Origins of Crossbows\nThe crossbow may have been first invented in ancient China. Some historians believe the Chinese had even already invented the first crude crossbows as early as 2,000 BC. This is based on certain bone, stone and shell artifacts that have been interpreted as crossbow triggers. More conclusive evidence of ancient Chinese crossbows, however, comes from around the 6th century BC, if not earlier.\nPortrait of the Imperial Bodyguard Zhanyinbao, carrying his archery equipment and wearing a sheathed dao. ( Public Domain )\nWhilst the crossbow was probably first invented in East Asia, it is difficult to determine its exact civilization of origin. Apart from ancient China, the crossbow could have been first used in Central Asia. It has also been suggested that crossbow technology spread into ancient China when Central Asian marksmen were hired as mercenaries by the Chinese. Nevertheless, most of the evidence (literary and archaeological) for the earliest crossbows is from China itself.\nEarly Mentions of the Crossbow\nTwo examples of early Chinese literature mentioning the crossbow include Sun Tzu’s The Art of War , and Mohist scripts from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC. In the latter source, there is a reference to the use of a giant crossbow during the late Spring and Autumn period (from the 6th to the 5th centuries BC).\n- Excellently preserved, complete crossbow from 2,200 years ago found at Terracotta Warrior site\n- Secrets of Chinese Terracotta Army Weapons Revealed\n- New Dig at First Emperor Mausoleum Expected to Yield up to 1400 More Terracotta Warriors\nA miniature guard wielding a handheld crossbow from the top balcony of a model watchtower, made of glazed earthenware during the Eastern Han era (25–220 AD) of China, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ( CC BY-SA 3.0 )\nAs for the archaeological evidence, bronze triggers that were once part of crossbows were discovered in a grave in Qufu, Shandong Province. These artifacts date to around 600 BC, when this area was part of the State of Lu during the Spring and Autumn period.\nAdditionally, bronze crossbow bolts were found in a mid-5th century BC grave in Hubei province, which was at that time part of the State of Chu. In 2015, the first complete crossbow from the Qin Dynasty was excavated by archaeologists from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang. This crossbow, which measures about 1.5 m (4.9 Feet) in length, had a firing range of almost 800 m (2624 Feet).\nA kneeling crossbowman from the Terracotta Army assembled for the tomb complex of Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC) ( CC BY-SA 2.5 )\nA Crossbow Solution\nIn Europe, crossbow-like siege machines were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The former were even recorded to have used a smaller type of crossbow known as the gastraphates (meaning ‘belly shooter’). Nevertheless, it was later during the Middle Ages that smaller, handheld crossbows became popular on the battlefield.\nDespite its numerous advantages, the crossbow had some serious flaws. One of them was the fact that it was a very slow weapon. A crossbow’s average rate of fire was two bolts a minute. By contrast, a skilled longbow man could fire between 10 to 12 arrows in a minute.\nIt is likely that the ancient Chinese crossbows had this same problem as their medieval European counterparts. As a result of their innovation, the Chinese came up with an ingenious solution – the Zhuge nu , or repeating crossbow.\nA non-recurve repeating crossbow. Ones used for war would be recurved ( CC BY 1.0 )\nAlthough its invention is traditionally attributed to a tactician of the Three Kingdoms period called Zhuge Liang, archaeological evidence has shown that the use of this weapon predated the famous tactician about 500 years.\nNevertheless, it is entirely possible that Zhuge Liang made significant improvements to the design of the repeating crossbow. As its name suggests, the repeating crossbow was capable to firing a number of bolts before needing to be reloaded. Later repeating crossbows, for instance, were able to fire as many as 10 bolts in 15 seconds before reloading was required.\nIn Europe, crossbows were gradually replaced by gunpowder weapons. In China, on the other hand, the use of the crossbow seems to have survived up till the late Qing Dynasty. It has been said that the last major world conflict to feature crossbows was the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 – 1895).\n- Terracotta Army weapons were immensely powerful\n- The Tale of Teucer – Legendary Archer of the Trojan War and Founder of Ancient Salamis\n- 2,100-Year-Old Royal Tomb Discovered in China\nJapanese troops during the Sino-Japanese war.

It was also the leading cause for the decline in future crossbow use.\nFeatured image: Part of a Naval Battle Scroll from the Imjin War. Photo source: ( CC BY 1.0 )\nDrury, F., 2015.

{"question":"What is the optimal oven rack position for baking cookies, and how does baking powder affect their texture?","answer":"Cookies should be baked on the middle rack of the oven, as this position offers the most even heat and air circulation for consistent baking. When baking on one rack at a time, the middle rack is ideal. As for baking powder's effect on texture, it significantly impacts the final result - using baking powder will produce cookies that are light and fluffy with a fine texture, while omitting it will result in cookies that are more tough and dense.","context":["Where should I bake my cookies? The simple answer to this question is, meet in the middle. Cookies should (almost) always be baked on the middle rack of the oven. The middle rack offers the most even heat and air circulation which helps cookies bake consistently.\nWhere should the rack be in the oven when baking?\nWhen in doubt, stick with the middle ground. For most baking and cooking situations, the middle rack will cook and bake food more evenly. But keep in mind, this rule applies only when you’re baking on one rack at a time.\nWhat is the best oven setting for baking cookies?\nDefinitely heat from the bottom but bake on the center rack. Place a thermometer inside the oven to check that the temperature is accurate–home ovens can be off by 50 degrees or more, making a huge difference for cookies. 350 degrees Fahrenheit is a good temp for chocolate chip cookies.\nWhich tray to use in oven for cookies?\nChoose a flat baking tray when baking cookies. A tray or sheet with no sides is best as it allows the heat to evenly bake the cookies. It also allows for easy removal of the baked cookies with a spatula. TIP: Use a flat baking tray or cookie sheet with no sides.\nDoes an oven bake from the top or bottom?\nAlways bake with both top and bottom heat, which allows the temperature to be evenly distributed to all the sides around the pan.\nDo you bake chicken on the top or bottom rack?\nPreheat the Oven and Set Up A Rack\nPlace a wire rack in a shallow roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. Cooking the chicken on a wire rack allows air to circulate under the chicken, and the skin on the bottom will become a bit crispier than if you cooked it directly on the pan.\nDoes oven rack placement matter?\nThese are the basics of oven rack position. A good rule of thumb is that, if it is more important for the bottom to brown while baking, place the rack low. If it is more important that the top brown, place the rack high. … For most baking, positioning the food in the center of the oven is ideal.\nHow do you keep cookies shaped when baking?\nUse a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Coating your baking sheet with nonstick spray or butter creates an overly greasy foundation, causing the cookies to spread. I always recommend a silicone baking mat because they grip onto the bottom of your cookie dough, preventing the cookies from spreading too much.\nDo you flip cookies when baking?\nNot rotating the cookies during baking\nJust as home oven temperature indicators are misleading, most oven temperatures vary from top to bottom and from side to side. So you want to rotate your cookie sheets halfway through to ensure an even bake.\nWhat mode should my oven be for baking?\nUpper and lower heat is a preferred option especially for baked goods that need to rise. Because of the air stream produced by the fan of the fan oven, your rising pastry might collapse. For this setting, you should also use only 1 baking sheet or oven rack.\nCan you bake cookies at 375?\nBake at 375 degrees F until golden and crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside, 10 to 12 minutes. For super-chewy cookies: Substitute cake flour for all-purpose flour.\nHow do I know if my cookies are baked?\nHere are some ways that recipes tell you to know if your cookies are done:\n- Time (i.e. they’ll bake in 10-13 minutes)\n- They’ve lost their “glossy sheen”\n- They’ll be “cracked” or “golden brown” around the edges.\n29 июл. 2019 г.\nWhat is a baking tray in oven?\nA sheet pan, baking tray or baking sheet is a flat, rectangular metal pan used in an oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, Swiss rolls and pizzas.\nWhich rack is the hottest in an oven?\nMost (if not all) ovens are hotter at the top than at the bottom. Thus, if you have two baking sheets in your oven, one on a higher rack and one on a lower rack, the one on the higher rack will cook faster.\nCan you bake on the bottom of the oven?\nRather than using the middle racks, place your baking sheet directly on the floor of the oven. This will “provide the hottest, most even and direct heat possible.”\nWhat is bottom part of oven for?\nGas ovens that contain their heating unit in the bottom may save the space as a broiler drawer. This is often a very narrow space that acts as a broiler and fits baking sheets and casserole dishes. It’s ideal for browning the tops of casseroles, caramelizing chicken skin, or even roasting vegetables.","Leaving out the baking powder will result in a cookie that is more tough and dense. There are tons of reasons why cookies spread even with a perfect recipe and baking powder is rarely the reason. Read THIS POST to find out WHY COOKIES SPREAD.\nWhat happens if you don’t put baking powder in cookies?\nExpect about one teaspoon per five ounces of flour; thin and crispy cookies may need a little less, thick and chewy cookies may need a little more. Even without baking powder, a well-aerated dough will still puff with steam. If that supply cuts off before the cookies set, a soft dough will collapse in on itself.\nIs baking powder necessary for sugar cookies?\nWith or without baking powder? … If you prefer the texture of the cookies to be light and fluffy, add baking powder and beat the butter and sugar for longer (I’ll explain more in the recipe). The thing is, by beating too much air into the dough or adding baking powder, the cookies will be more prone to spreading.\nIs baking powder necessary for cookies?\n1. Unless you want cakey cookies, avoid using baking powder: The cookies made with both the single- and double-acting baking powders were just too darn cakey. 2. Baking soda helps cookies spread more than baking powder.\nWhat happens if you don’t have baking powder?\nTo replace 1 teaspoon baking powder, mix ¼ cup molasses and ¼ teaspoon baking soda. Most baking powder substitutes require the use of baking soda, but if you don’t have that on hand either, you may be able to use whipped egg whites to add a bit of volume in some recipes.\nWhat can you use instead of baking powder in cookies?\nHere are 10 great substitutes for baking powder.\n- Buttermilk. Buttermilk is a fermented dairy product with a sour, slightly tangy taste that is often compared to plain yogurt. …\n- Plain Yogurt. …\n- Molasses. …\n- Cream of Tartar. …\n- Sour Milk. …\n- Vinegar. …\n- Lemon Juice. …\n- Club Soda.\n9 июн. 2017 г.\nWhat happens if you use baking powder instead of baking soda in cookies?\nIf you are using baking powder as a baking soda substitute, for every one teaspoon of baking soda a recipe calls for, substitute three teaspoons of baking powder. … While baking soda will create a coarse, chewy cookie texture, baking powder will produce a light, fine cookie texture.\nCan you bake without baking powder?\nYou can, however, make a baking powder substitute by using baking soda. All you need to make baking powder are two ingredients: baking soda and cream of tartar.\nCan you leave baking soda out of cookies?\nIf you’re fresh out of baking soda, just replace the amount of baking soda with four times the amount of double-acting baking powder (2 tsp. baking powder for every 1/2 tsp. … Yes, really—baking soda has four times the leavening power of baking powder. Pro Tip: There is sometimes a bit of salt in baking powder.\nWhat does cream of tartar do in cookies?\nCream of tartar helps stabilize whipped egg whites, prevents sugar from crystallizing and acts as a leavening agent for baked goods. If you’re halfway through a recipe and find that you don’t have any cream of tartar on hand, there are plenty of suitable replacements.\nDoes baking powder make cookies soft?\n4. Baking Powder. Baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate and acidic salts. The reaction of these two ingredients results in a cookie that is soft and thick, but slightly harder.\nWhat happens if I put too much baking powder in my cookies?\nToo much baking powder can cause the batter to be bitter tasting. It can also cause the batter to rise rapidly and then collapse. (i.e. The air bubbles in the batter grow too large and break causing the batter to fall.) … Too much baking soda will result in a soapy taste with a coarse, open crumb.\nWhat makes chocolate chip cookies go flat?\nMistake: When cookies turn out flat, the bad guy is often butter that is too soft or even melted. This makes cookies spread. The other culprit is too little flour—don’t hold back and make sure you master measuring. Finally, cookies will also flatten if placed and baked on hot cookie sheets.\nCan I use baking powder instead of baking powder?\nIf you have a recipe calling for baking soda, you might be able to substitute baking powder. However, you will need up to 4x as much baking powder to get the same amount of leavening. And, depending on the recipe, you might end up with a baked good that’s a little bitter with that much baking powder.\nCan you use corn starch instead of baking powder?\nBaking Powder Substitute Options\nTo make 1 tsp, all you need is cream of tartar, cornstarch, and baking soda – the three ingredients used in baking powder. Use 1/2 tsp cream of tartar, and 1/4 tsp of the remaining ingredients, and you’re good to go!\nCan I use baking powder instead of bicarb?\nIt turns out that bicarbonate of soda, sodium bicarbonate and baking soda are one and the same thing – NaHCO3 for the technically minded. … So, yes, you can substitute baking powder for bicarbonate of soda/sodium bicarbonate/baking soda, but you’ll need more baking powder, which may affect the taste."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3184b8f0-48ad-4915-8359-022a07e5609a>","<urn:uuid:2b38034c-d437-4e1b-a01c-cfb3eb031b64>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What diagnostic tests are used to confirm parasitic and tick-borne diseases in dogs?","answer":"For Leishmaniasis, diagnosis requires demonstrating the presence of parasites through blood tests, skin biopsies, or lymph node punctures, along with additional blood tests to check organ function. For Lyme disease, diagnosis involves the C6 test, which checks for antibodies against the C6 protein unique to Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. If positive, a Quant C6 test determines the antibody concentration. Additional blood and urine samples may be needed to assess kidney damage through the presence of protein in urine.","context":["Leishmaniasis in dogs is a chronic parasitic disease which can be serious in dogs. The responsible parasite, Leishmania infantum, is transmitted by certain mosquitoes, sandflies. They are mainly present in the Mediterranean Basin, even if their distribution tends to extend little by little towards the north.\nIn addition, it is a zoonosis, that is to say that it can be transmitted to humans, also by bite of sandflies. It can be serious in humans, especially in immunocompromised people and children.\nIt is therefore important to know the existence of this disease. The risks of contamination and the means of prevention. Especially if you are staying or going to stay in the Mediterranean Basin.\nCauses of leishmaniasis\nWhen a sandfly carries the parasite, it transmits it to the dog during the bite. Parasites, or leishmanias, first multiply in skin cells. A small sore then appears at this location, most often on the ears or nose. But this can remain discreet and go unnoticed. Then it multiplies, disseminates in the body and will distribute in different organs. Thus, the clinical forms differ according to the locations and the animals. The main organs affected are the skin, kidneys, liver, eyes, or even the joints.\nSymptoms of leishmaniasis in dogs\nLeishmaniasis disease usually starts with a decrease in immunity and most often progresses slowly. The state of the dog’s immune system involves in the clinical expression (appearance of symptoms). In fact, approximately 50% of dogs will eliminate the parasite spontaneously; 40% will remain carriers of the parasite without triggering symptoms. And 10% will remain carriers of the parasite and trigger clinical signs.\nThe dog may have been infected several months or years before exhibiting symptoms.\nSymptoms vary according to the organs mainly affected:\n- General symptoms : weight loss, loss of appetite, the presence of lymph nodes all over the animal’s body, nosebleeds, joint pain and swelling, possibly fever. The size of the liver may increase.\n- Cutaneous symptoms when the parasites will mainly distribute in the skin. These symptoms are loss of hair, dandruff, thickening of the skin with possibly the presence of dandruff, ulcers, abnormally long and often fragile claws, thickening of the pads.\n- Kidney symptoms if the kidneys are affected. The symptoms are increase in the amount of drink and urine, decrease in general condition, possible vomiting.\n- Eye symptoms : These are rarer but may appear if the parasites have reached the eyes. The eyes are then red, with discharge and often associated pain.\nAll symptoms may be present at the same time, or only some. The onset of clinical signs can be very progressive over several months to years, with jagged changes; it can be more brutal.\nAs the symptoms are very nonspecific, the disease is often difficult to diagnose. During the clinical examination, the veterinarian may suspect the disease in the presence of one or more of the symptoms described above, and especially in the event of a stay in areas where it is present. It is therefore essential that you tell your veterinarian if you have traveled with your dog, even if it was several years ago.\nAdditional examinations are necessary, on the one hand to confirm or refute the diagnosis of Leishmaniasis, and on the other hand to give a prognosis according to the severity of the attack.\nThe diagnosis of certainty rests on the demonstration of the presence of the parasites. For this, your veterinarian may take a blood test, skin biopsies, or even a lymph node puncture.\nAdditional blood tests will also make it possible to check the general condition of the animal. And also it will check the functioning of the kidneys and other organs.\nTreatment and prognosis of Leishmaniasis\nThe prognosis of leishmaniasis in dogs is often reserved. Because the treatment does not completely eradicate the presence of the parasite in the body. It allows to decrease their quantity and to decrease the symptoms. But relapses are possible throughout the life of the animal. A dog carrying parasites will never be “bleached”: therefore, regular medical monitoring is necessary.\nThe prognosis is even more reserved when there is kidney damage because the lesions of these organs are irreversible.\nTreatment is most often in the form of tablets or injections. It is often long, at least 12 months. Sometimes it will even have to be given for life if the animal supports it well. It happens in fact that it is badly tolerated and it must then be stopped.\nPrevention of Leishmaniasis\nGiven the seriousness of this disease and its transmissibility to humans, preventive measures are important. Several means exist and can be combined.\nIf you live or need to stay in an area where leishmaniasis is present, speak to your veterinarian. He will be able to advise you on the means of prevention best suited to your animal. There is indeed a vaccine against this disease, making it possible to significantly reduce the risk of infection by allowing the body to defend itself more effectively against parasites.\nIn addition, several measures can be taken to prevent your dog from being bitten by sandflies. Your veterinarian can recommend suitable antiparasitic treatments.\nThe use of insecticides in the environment, in the form of bombs or sockets, can repel these insects. The use of mosquito nets can be useful to prevent them from entering homes. Plus, since they’re mostly active after dark, keeping your dog indoors at that time of day can help prevent bites.","Lyme disease is the most common illness transmitted by ticks. It’s a bacterial infection, which makes its way into the bloodstream through bites. Both humans and dogs are vulnerable to Lyme disease, and the illness can trigger a range of unpleasant symptoms including fever and swollen joints. Lyme disease can usually be treated with a course of antibiotics.\nBoth dogs and their owners are particularly vulnerable to Lyme disease in the summer months, when young ticks are most prevalent. This means that now is the perfect time to make yourself aware of Lyme disease symptoms to watch out for, and find out how you can help to prevent it.\nLyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and is usually carried by the eastern black-legged tick (also known as the “deer tick” or “bear tick”). The bacterium is a spiral shaped microorganism, which is harboured in the tick’s digestive system, and can enter the bloodstream of its host animal through a bite. Ticks themselves are thought to pick up the disease through feeding on mice and other rodents during the larval stage of their lifecycle.\nTicks pose a risk to humans and dogs throughout the US and much of the world, but the following US areas have particularly high rates of Lyme disease:\n- The Northeast\n- The Upper Midwest\n- The Pacific coast\nGenerally, ticks must be attached to their host for 36 to 48 hours before Lyme disease can be transmitted. Because of this, the disease is actually quite preventable if owners are vigilant. Most cases of Lyme disease are caused by bites from immature ticks, which are called nymphs. This is because their small size – only around 2 millimetres (just under a tenth of an inch) – makes them very difficult to see, meaning they’re more likely to stick around for the 36 hours required for Lyme disease infection. There is currently no evidence that Lyme disease can be transmitted through any means other than tick bites. If your dog does contract the disease, it will not be spread to you through contact with them. Similarly, if you contract Lyme disease, you won’t be at risk of spreading it to other humans or your pets.\nIf Lyme disease does manage to enter an animal’s bloodstream, it tends to gather around the joints, so swelling in these areas can be a good indication that Lyme disease might be present.\nLyme disease has quite a wide range of unpleasant symptoms in both humans and their canine companions. If your dog exhibits one or more of the following symptoms, Lyme disease could be the culprit:\nLike many infections, Lyme disease raises the body’s temperature, which makes antibodies more effective at fighting the bacteria. This change can sometimes manifest itself as a fever.\n- Loss of appetite\nLoss of appetite can be another sign of infection in animals. Sometimes their bodies attempt to purge themselves of the infective agent, and part of the process involves reducing food intake.\n- Lethargy and tiredness\nWhen an animal’s body is busy fighting off infection, little energy is left over for activities they usually find enjoyable. Dogs who have contracted Lyme disease are far less likely to enjoy their usual games and walks, and will probably sleep more.\n- Stiffness, discomfort, or general pain\nLyme disease can also cause some flu-like symptoms, including achy muscles. If your dog is unusually stiff or appears to be experiencing pain – especially in the summer months – the disease could be at play.\n- Swollen joints\nAs mentioned earlier, Lyme disease bacteria tend to gather around the joints when they enter an animal’s bloodstream. The body’s immune system will try to fight off the invading microorganisms, and the chemicals involved can cause the area to swell and become inflamed. If your dog appears unwell, check to see whether their joints are swollen, as this is one of the biggest indicators that they may have contracted Lyme disease.\n- Kidney failure\nIn extreme cases of Lyme disease, a dog’s kidneys can fail, which sometimes proves fatal. This is due to the strain put on the organs as they attempt to process the toxins associated with the bacterial infection.\n- Cardiac issues\nIt’s very rare, but in some cases Lyme disease can also affect the heart’s function in a variety of ways, including arrhythmia and heart disease. Dogs suffering from heart conditions might exhibit symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and tiredness.\nIf your dog is suffering from one or more of these symptoms, you should consult a veterinary professional as soon as possible.\nTo predict the development of Lyme disease, you could check your dog carefully for ticks, or signs of bites. If you do come across a tick, it can be sent by your vet for analysis, to find out whether it’s a member of the Lyme disease spreading black-legged family, and if so whether it is infected with Lyme disease. If the tick is found to harbor the disease, your vet may suggest pre-emptive Lyme disease treatment, such as a course of antibiotics.\nWhen your dog shows some of these symptoms, or you suspect they have been bitten by a tick, your vet will probably want to test for Lyme disease. Luckily, Lyme disease is fairly easy to identify through the C6 test, which can be carried out either in-clinic, or by sending a blood sample away for laboratory analysis.\nThe tests work by checking for the presence antibodies which work against the “C6” protein – a protein uniquely present in Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Antibodies generally develop in a dog’s body three to five weeks after the initial tick bite, and their presence in the bloodstream suggests that your dog’s immune system has been attempting to fight off Lyme disease.\nIf the results of the C6 test are positive, your vet will proceed to carry out the Quant C6 test. As its name suggests, this test determines the quantity of C6 antibodies present in the dog’s blood. If the concentration is relatively low, your dog is unlikely to require treatment, but at higher concentrations they could benefit from medical intervention.\nIf the initial test for C6 antibodies proves positive, your vet will probably need additional blood samples, as well as a urine sample. This will help to determine whether the dog’s kidneys have been damaged by Lyme disease, which would be suggested by the presence protein in their urine. This indicates that the kidneys are not carrying out their proper function of breaking down waste products before they leave the body.\nChecking for kidney damage is essential, since this is a potentially fatal issue which Lyme disease can trigger, and should be treated as swiftly as possible.\nSurprisingly, some dogs can carry Lyme disease without actually showing any symptoms. This means it’s sometimes difficult to know whether treatment would be worthwhile or even necessary. Your vet will be able to advise you based on your dog’s unique symptoms and medical history, but the decision is usually influenced by the following factors.\n- The quantity of C6 protein in their bloodstream\nIf the Quant C6 test reveals that your dog has moderate to high levels of the protein in their bloodstream, your vet is more likely to recommend that treatment is pursued. Conversely, if the concentration is low, they may decide against it.\nIf your dog has been displaying one or more of the symptoms closely linked to Lyme disease, such as swollen joints or stiffness, a positive C6 test would support the argument for treating the animal.\n- Medical history\nIf your dog has exhibited similar symptoms within the past year, Lyme disease is more likely to be the culprit, since it can stick around in the body for fairly long periods of time, and periodically flare up in some cases.\n- Urine sample results\nIf the presence of protein in a dog’s urine is found alongside C6 antibodies in their bloodstream, your vet is very likely to recommend treatment. This is because the combination of these indicators suggests that Lyme disease is causing some fairly serious problems in your dog’s body.\nSome vets might be reluctant to treat Lyme disease without symptoms for a number of reasons. Firstly, the over-use of antibiotics is a serious issue which has resulted in some harmful bacteria developing a resistance. Additionally, if your dog tests positive the presence of C6 antibodies, especially in low concentrations, it can be difficult to tell whether the bacteria are still present, or if the antibodies are simply left over from a previous infection which went undetected. Finally, since symptoms only develop in around 10% of dogs who contract Lyme disease, treating a symptomless illness could put unnecessary stress on the dog and owner, as well as incurring unnecessary costs.\nIf your vet does decide to treat your dog for Lyme disease, they will likely suggest:\n- Antibiotics, most commonly doxycycline and amoxicillin. Symptoms should begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours, and the course will usually last for around 30 days.\n- If necessary, kidney treatment. This could include intravenous fluid therapy, and drugs.\n- Depending on symptoms and severity, additional treatment. For instance, if inflammation has been an issue and anti-inflammatory drug might be prescribed.\nOnce treatment has been completed, your vet might decide to carry out another Quant C6 test, and require another blood sample. If treatment has been successful, you can expect to see a significant reduction in the quantity of C6 antibodies in your dog’s bloodstream. This result, combined with the improvement or alleviation of symptoms are key indicators that the treatment has done its job.\nAs mentioned earlier, Lyme disease is fairly preventable, since as far as we know it can only be transmitted through tick bites. To protect both yourself and your best friend against the illness, you should try to prevent these bites, and endeavour to catch them as early as possible when they do happen. To decrease the likelihood that your dog will be bitten, you can:\n- Use a spot-on treatment on your dog’s coat. These will repel and kill both ticks and fleas, and each application can remain effective for up to a month.\n- Consider an oral anti-tick medication. These pills are usually given once a month, and kill ticks and immature fleas in your dog’s coat.\n- Wash your dog with an anti-tick shampoo every now and again, especially in the spring and summer.\n- Keep your lawn and any bushes or hedges in your garden or yard well-trimmed, as this reduces the tick populations.\n- Consider treating your home for ticks with an anti-flea and tick spray.\n- Try applying a tick spray to your dog’s coat between shampoos, to ensure they’re kept at bay.\n- Avoid long walks through long grass and brush if possible, since these environments are ideal for ticks hoping to find hosts. They cannot jump or fly, but will crawl to the top of tall plants and try to crawl onto animals as they brush past.\n- Thoroghly check your dog for ticks after walks, especially in the spring and summer.\nFinding and Removing Ticks\nTicks can be tricky to spot on your dog, especially the tiny nymphs. Here are a few tips for finding and removing ticks:\n- Brush your fingers through your dog’s hair rather than using a comb; you’ll be able to feel any bumps which could be ticks more easily.\n- Make sure you check between the toes, behind the ears, under their limbs, and around the tail and head.\n- Be careful when removing ticks, as parts can sometimes break off and remain embedded in the skin.\n- To remove a tick, use tweezers, gripping it very close to the skin, before pulling it away gently. Do not burst its body, as this will increase the risk of Lyme disease infection.\n- Always wear rubber gloves to protect yourself from Lyme disease when removing a tick from your dog.\n- If you are unsure about removing a tick, consult your vet. They will be able to do so safely and effectively, and possibly teach you how to do so for future reference.\n- Remove any ticks within 24 hours to minimize the risk of infection.\n- How to treat Lyme disease in Dogs, Pet MD\n- Lyme Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Tests, Treatment, and Prevention, American Kennel Club\n- Lyme disease in Dogs, Pet Health Network"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:17542719-be7c-4b74-a1c1-358f7b42ebdc>","<urn:uuid:d4528c7d-72fa-4c11-8cae-536582946c39>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do you make a basic rolled fabric flower? Really excited to try this for my first DIY project! 🌸","answer":"To make a rolled fabric flower, you need a strip of fabric about 1 inch wide and a felt circle. First, tie a knot close to one end of the fabric strip. Hold the knot in your left hand and begin twisting the strip loosely with your right hand. Start wrapping the twisted strip around the knot until the rosette is slightly bigger than your felt circle. Finally, tuck the end under the rosette and hot glue it to the felt circle. Alternatively, you can sew these together instead of using hot glue.","context":["Since we do fabric or felt flowers around here a lot I thought it would be fun to have a page with all the directions – in one handy dandy place!\nRolled Fabric Flowers\nFor each rosette you’ll need one strip and one felt circle. The longer and/or wider your strip, the larger your flower will be. I like to tear a long strip about 1″ wide for most rosettes – then I can cut the length off if I don’t need it. Tie a knot close to one end of the fabric strip.\nHold the knot in your left hand and begin twisting the strip loosely with your right hand. Start to wrap the twisted strip around the knot.\n(Ignore my scritchy sad little painted fingernail please. :)\nKeep wrapping until your rosette is a little bigger than your felt circle.\nTuck the end under the rosette and hot glue it to the felt circle. (You can also sew these together if you don’t want to use hot glue.)\nNow you have a cute little fabric rosette!\nRolled Felt Flowers\nTo make these rolled felt flowers you’re going to cut out a spiral circle. To give them the little ”petal” look – you want to cut out a wavy spiral like the one below. If you want, you can draw out a spiral as a guide, or you can free hand it. It doesn’t have to be a perfect circle (obviously :). You just don’t want the spiral sections to be too wide – otherwise you’ll have really tall flowers. You might want to have some “practice felt”. My first flowers were a little sad and chunky looking.\nOnce your spiral is cut, start rolling up the flower at the outside end. Roll it tightly into a spiral.\nYou want the center pretty tight – then you can start rolling it a little more loosely so the outer sections look more like open petals.\nWhen you’ve rolled the whole flower, you’ll have the little center section left. Glue this down to the center of the flower, then cut a small felt circle to glue to the base. This will hold the flower in place.\nCombining a Rolled Felt Flower with a Fabric Petals Flower\nCut two petal shapes out of paper, one longer than the other by about a 1/2″. Cut 5 of the larger petals out of fabric and 7 of the smaller petals out of fabric.\nSew a gathering stitch along the bottom of the large petals, about 1/4″ from the straight end.\nSew the last petal to the first and pull up the gathering stitch. Knot the thread.\nRepeat with the seven smaller petals.\nLayer the smaller flower on top of the larger and glue together.\nGlue a small felt circle to the back of the fabric flower and glue one of your small cream rolled flowers in the center. You can also rough up the edges of the flower a bit to give it more of a frayed look.\nFolded Fabric Ruffle Flower\nTo make a ruffle flower, cut 12 circles out of white satin. The bigger the circles, the bigger your flower will be.\nFold the circles in half, then in half again. Glue the point to a felt circle.\nCover the rest of the circle with one row of folded circles, then add another two or three rows, depending on how full you want your flower.\nAdd a button to the center and fluff up the circles.\nTiny Puffed Fabric Flowers\nCut 5 small circles out of fabric. To make tiny flowers – use the top of a large spool of thread. If you want to make larger ones, just increase the size of your circle.\nSew around the edge with little gathering stitches. (kind of like if you were making a yo-yo)\nPull up the stitches just a bit to start to form a ball. Add a wee tiny bit of stuffing inside.\nPull the stitches tight and then sew along the bottom edge to hold everything in place.\nRepeat for the other four circles, then sew them together in a flower shape.\nWith some ribbon, create a little rolled flower center and glue that in the center of your puffy flower.\nFolded Ribbon Flowers\nYou can also create little flowers with ribbons. These will work best for small flowers.\nut small strips of ribbon and fold them in half. Sew gathering stitches along the ends.\nPull up your threads until the ribbon is all gathered, then sew the last ribbon to the first one.\nAdd rolled ribbon flowers to the centers to finish them off. You could add buttons or little beads too!\nRhinestone & Chiffon Flowers\nThese sweet chiffon flowers are easy to make in any size! You can decorate them with rhinestones or other beads in the center.\nStart by tracing a small flower pattern. This one is 1 1/4″ in diameter. Cut 8 flowers out of chiffon.\nCut a small circle of felt, about 1/2″. Take your first chiffon flower and fold it into fourths. Sew the top folded center of the flower to the center of the felt circle.\nRepeat with three more flower pieces, placing them so the centers are in the middle of the felt and the flowers only overlap a little bit.\nRepeat with 4 more flower pieces, sewing these to the center as well. You should now have eight flowers sewn on and your flower should be nice and fluffy.\nGlue a rhinestone piece in the center of the flower to cover up the stitching and to add a little bling.\nFelt Bow Instructions and Pattern\nClick here for Pattern pieces for Felt Bow\nInstrustions: 1.

{"question":"Being interested in sports history, I'd like to know: who has achieved more success in rowing competitions - the 2019 Oxford rowing teams or Paralympic athlete Naomi Riches?","answer":"Naomi Riches has achieved more documented success in rowing competitions. She won multiple World Championship gold medals (2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011), a silver medal (2010), a bronze medal at the 2008 Paralympics, and ultimately a gold medal at the 2012 London Paralympics. In contrast, the 2019 Oxford teams were preparing for their upcoming race, with the men's team having lost the previous year, as indicated by Cambridge winning all four races in 2018.","context":["Rowing for Oxford – The Dark Blues’ presidents reflect on the coming race\nThe annual Oxford vs. Cambridge Boat Race, which will take place this Sunday 7th April, is perhaps the most widely watched university sporting event in Britain, drawing around a quarter of a million spectators to the banks of the Thames each year. Competition for one of eight seats and one coxswain position in each of the four boats (Men’s and Women’s Blue boats as well as the second boats, Isis and Osiris) has been incredibly tight and the Boat Race marks the culmination of each team’s training since last September. As preparations for both the 165th Men’s and 74th Women’s Boat Race head into their final few days, The Oxford Student spoke to two rowers as they prepare to take to the water. Eleanor Shearer, the OUWBC President, is returning to cox the Women’s Blue Boat, having coxed for the Women’s Blues in 2017 and Osiris in 2018. Felix Drinkall, the OUBC president and junior world champion, will row for the Men’s Blue Boat at number 6. 2019 is his second year in the Blue boat.\nHow long have you been rowing and how did you get into it?\nEleanor: I started rowing in 6th Form in 2012. I have always liked outdoor sports, and also have always loved being in or around water, whether it’s rivers, lakes or the sea, so rowing seemed like a good pick. I really enjoyed being in boats right away, and knew when I came to Oxford that I wanted to continue. However, because I had accepted I probably wasn’t going to get any bigger (I’m 5’3 and about 50kg) I knew that switching to coxing would be the best way for me to compete at a higher level.\nFelix: I have been rowing since January 2014. I started at school and enjoyed a fun introduction to rowing, the goal of which was to make sure people had fun whilst doing the sport and provide the passion for being in a boat. I made a lot of friends and enjoyed being on the water so it was an easy step to make to start taking it more seriously and to try and win races. It’s that enjoyment of being in a team and pushing yourselves together that makes the whole process very fulfilling.\nWhat sort of preparation and training are you doing for the race?\nEleanor: At the moment, we are staying in London and training on the river twice a day. The rows this week are shorter than they would usually be – around an hour as opposed to more like an hour and a half – because we want to keep people fresh for the race on Sunday.\nFelix: The Boat Race is pretty unique in the rowing world in terms of its distance and unpredictability which makes it an interesting race to prepare for. Ultimately it’s a very long race, so we work on our fitness and technical efficiency daily to give us the best chance of going fast on the day. In the Boat Race you need strength to start the race and endurance to finish it, so we primarily use weights and indoor rowing machines to train both areas of physiology.\nHow about psychologically?\nEleanor: Psychologically, we just try to be really open with each other about how we’re feeling and help each other keep our nerves in check and focus on delivering the best possible performance at the weekend.\nFelix: The unpredictability of the race makes it a very fun event to be part of. You’ve got to be ready for every situation. We’ll watch previous years’ races in order to build up knowledge of racing on the tideway and of what can happen in a race. We’ll speak to alumni about their races in order to build up a bank of experiences. Primarily though we will look to control the controllables, we’ve found that this gets the best response from our crew.\nDoes last year’s race impact on this one or does each year feel separate?\n(Cambridge won all four races in 2018.)\nEleanor: My experience every year has been pretty different, but that’s partly because between 2017 and 2018 we got a new coach. This year, having the same coach as last, I’ve definitely noticed similarities. But it never feels like the result from last year means much – the clubs on both sides usually have a fair amount of turnover year to year so each season feels like a bit of a fresh start.\nFelix: We take experience from the years that have been and gone to make sure that we are better prepared for certain situations and so that we continue to improve as a programme. However, each year is its own project and the results in previous years have very little bearing on any future results. We have a number of people with a great deal of experience within the OUBC, whether that be in the Blue Boat or in our second boat ‘Isis’. However, of the 18 people who competed for both Oxford and Cambridge in last year’s Men’s Boat Race only 3 have returned for this year’s race. That stat alone tells you how different this race is.\nHow does it feel to be part of such a big sporting tradition?\nEleanor: It feels incredibly special to be a part of the Boat Race, especially the Women’s Race. I am always acutely aware of all the incredible women that came before me and paved the way for the women’s race to be able to be on the same platform as the men, and it’s great to feel connected to that history. Every year, before the race, when we stay in London, alumni from as far back as the 1970s will send cards and letters wishing us luck, which is a great reminder of how many people there are behind us.\nFelix: It’s a huge privilege to be entrusted to represent OUBC this year. For most of the season you can forget how big the race truly is and the impact that it has had on people’s lives. Only really through meeting and talking to alumni do you realise the enormity of it all. However, the size and history of the event doesn’t affect our one objective: to win a rowing race.\nThe Women’s Boat Race will start from Putney at 2.13pm this Sunday, followed by the Men’s at 3.10pm. Both races will be covered by BBC1 and BBC5Live Radio.","Riches was born on 15 June 1983 in Hammersmith, London, England.She attended Cannon Lane school as a child.

{"question":"What safety measures are needed when applying Weed B Gon, and how does it impact water management?","answer":"When applying Weed B Gon, users must wear chemical-resistant gloves, safety goggles, long sleeves, long pants, closed-toe shoes and a respirator mask. The herbicide should not be applied when rain is forecast within 24 hours or near storm drains. This timing consideration is important for water management since stormwater runoff from developed areas can carry pollutants into waterways, creating environmental problems in nearby creeks and streams.","context":["When weeds are overwhelming the lawn, it may be time to consider an herbicide to clear out unwanted broadleaf and grassy weeds. Products like Ortho's Weed B Gon, available in ready-to-use sprays and concentrates, can eliminate the weeds without affecting common lawn grass species. Wait four weeks after using Weed B Gon to plant grass seed and fill in bare spots in the lawn.\nThe minimum waiting period for planting grass seed after using a Weed B Gon product is four weeks.\nAbout Weed B Gon Products\nWeed B Gon Weed Killer Ready-to-Use spray contains 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), mecoprop-p acid and dicamba acid. These herbicides target broadleaf weeds, such as clover and dandelions, but also affect a wide range of wildflowers as well as fruits and vegetables, fruit trees, vines and other ornamental plants. Weed B Gon Weed Killer should only be used on bahiagrass, bermudagrass, buffalograss, centipedegrass, fine and tall fescues, Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, St. Augustinegrass (except 'Floratam') and zoysiagrass lawns.\nAnother ready-to-use spray is Weed B Gon Chickweed, Clover & Oxalis Killer for Lawns, which contains triclopyr. Intended to eliminate persistent weeds like chickweed, clover, creeping Charlie, oxalis and wild violet, it can also be applied to buffalograss, fescues, Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass and zoysiagrass. It can also adversely affect fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants.\nIf crabgrass has infested your lawn, Weed B Gon Plus Crabgrass Control may be able to eradicate it because it incorporates three herbicides: 2,4-D, quinclorac and dicamba. These herbicides eliminate broadleaf weeds like chickweed, clover and dandelion as well as grassy weeds like crabgrass and foxtail. This product is designed for use on bermudagrass, buffalograss, fine and tall fescues, Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass and zoysiagrass lawns.\nSafety Precautions and Herbicides\nPut on chemical-resistant gloves, safety goggles, long sleeves, long pants, closed-toe shoes and a respirator mask before mixing or applying any chemical products, including Weed B Gon and other herbicides. After applying Weed B Gon, wash your hands while still gloved, then remove the gloves. Rewash your hands and any exposed skin with soap and water. Also, remove and launder your clothing as soon as possible.\nAvoid applying to lawns on windy or hot days when temperatures are above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. If the lawn is bermudagrass, then refrain from application when the temperature is above 85 degrees F. If rain is in the forecast, wait to apply the herbicide until no rain is predicted for 24 hours after the application. Don't use Weed B Gon where it may run into storm drains or within 25 feet of wetlands, ponds or waterways; it is toxic to fish and invertebrates like crayfish and dragonflies.\nKeep humans and pets away from the lawn until the herbicide is completely dry. Store Weed B Gon products in the original containers and keep them out of reach of children and pets.\nWeed B Gon Application\nApply in spring or fall when the weeds are actively growing. Mow two days before treating the weeds, then wait at least two days to mow afterward and discard the grass clippings in the trash. Water the lawn 24 hours before applying Weed B Gon. If applying to a new lawn, wait until you've mowed at least three times to ensure the grass is firmly established.\nSpot-treat the lawn by spraying the individual weeds, aiming at the center of the plant and lightly wetting the leaves. Wait at least 12 hours before watering the grass. Reapply Weed B Gon Weed Killer after 30 days or when weeds reappear, but no more than twice a year.\nWhen treating persistent weeds like crabgrass or oxalis, use the appropriate Weed B Gon ready-to-use or concentrate product. Attach the sprayer to the garden hose, turn on the water, then slide the sprayer switch to \"ON\" and apply evenly across the lawn. Wait at least 24 hours before watering the lawn to ensure that the weeds absorb the herbicide. You can reapply Weed B Gon Chickweed, Clover and Oxalis Killer in 14 to 21 days and Weed B Gon Plus Crabgrass Control in 21 days, but no more than twice a year.\nWhen to Plant Grass Seed\nWait four weeks after applying Weed B Gon products before planting grass seed in the treated areas. Prepare the soil in any bare spots by loosening with a shovel and adding compost and other amendments as needed. Wet the area, then scatter the grass seeds. Press the seeds into the soil or compost with your foot or a lawn roller, cover with a light layer of sand, compost or straw mulch and water again.\nKeep the area damp, watering once or twice daily if necessary, until the grass seeds germinate. When the grass is one-third taller than the recommended height, or four to six weeks after planting, it's time to mow. Leave the clippings on the lawn so they decompose and return their nutrients to the new grass.\nRuth de Jauregui is the author of 50 Fabulous Tomatoes for Your Garden.

{"question":"Working in climate policy, I need to understand what makes environmental policies effective - what are the economic incentives and implementation challenges?","answer":"Environmental economics shows that economic incentives are key to changing behavior, as people respond better to financial motivations than moral appeals. Effective policies include carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes that make environmentally harmful actions more expensive. However, implementation faces several challenges. Carbon taxes may burden developing countries, and emissions trading schemes can be ineffective if permits are distributed too liberally. Additionally, while subsidies can help businesses transition to green practices, they can be administratively complex and may divert investments from beneficial existing technologies. The success of these policies depends heavily on proper implementation and enforcement.","context":["Understand environmental economics by reading this article.\nThere is worldwide recognition that natural resources are finite. Hence, if used improperly, resources become scarce and finally get exhausted through time.\nAnything in this world that gets scarce becomes more important, much more valuable than when it was in great supply. There is a need, therefore, to manage scarce resources to maximize their utility. This is the realm of economics.\nThe same applies to natural resources. As human population increases, more natural resources are required to provide for their needs. Thus, natural resources become scarce. Scarce natural resources, therefore, should be managed to ensure their availability not only for this generation but in generations to come. Environmental economics aims to satisfy this goal.\nEnvironmental Economics Defined\nEnvironmental economics is a branch of economics that uses economic principles in the study of people’s behavior in relation to their environment. It examines the way people make decisions that may either lead to environmental destruction or environmental enhancements. It clarifies options for decision-making by using economic tools.\nThis goes to say that whatever environmental degradation that results nowadays is a result of man’s deliberate disregard of the value of maintaining a viable store of natural resources. This behavior is considered unethical or immoral as it negatively impacts on other people’s welfare. The question of equity arises.\nExamples of Unethical or Immoral Behavior Towards the Environment\nWhat are examples of decisions that threaten environmental integrity? The following is a list of things that people do due to lack of ethical standards and immoral behavior:\n- indiscriminate throwing of wastes into waterways,\n- use of dynamite in fishing,\n- clear-cutting of forests especially in steep mountain slopes,\n- use of fine-mesh nets in catching fish,\n- trading of endangered species of plants or animals,\n- cutting of mangroves for charcoal,\n- mineral extraction without rehabilitation,\n… and many others.\nWhy do people behave this way?\nIn the environmental economics perspective, the above behaviors occur because people have failed to see the value, or cost of their actions. This failure prevents them from making sound, rational decisions that work towards their advantage.\nFor example, had fishers known that if they have caught only the large or moderate-sized fish using the prescribed mesh size for their nets, there will still be enough fish to catch in the future. Enough fish populations are allowed to reproduce and the young allowed to grow to more valuable sizes, instead of just being dumped as by-catch. This means more profit for fishers as they don’t need to go farther away to catch migrating fish.\nWhy Use the Environmental Economics Approach?\nAppealing to people’s morality or adherence to ethics does not usually appeal to many people. Changing people’s attitude and behavior take time. Actions to save the environment may be too late when finally, behavioral change is instituted among those who directly interact with their environment to make a living.\nThe economic incentive is one of the main reasons why people behave the way they do. If they realize that their action will have long-term consequences on their livelihood, they will voluntarily exhibit behavior towards adopting a better alternative. Thus, environmental economics help make clear the options by offering tools to balance the costs and benefits of their action.\nField, B. C. and M. K. Field, 2006. Environmental economics: an introduction, 4th ed. London: McGraw-Hill Irwin. 503 pp.\n© 2014 June 7 P. A. Regoniel","Examining Governmental Policies\nClimate change has become one of the most significant issues of our time, with Earth’s temperatures already rising above pre-industrial averages and polar ice caps melting at an unheard-of rate. The United Nations defines Climate Change as a “change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.” In response to the crisis, world governments have developed and implemented a variety of different policies and laws to reduce emissions and limit global warming, as part of an effort to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature increases to below 2°C.\nIn this article, we’ll examine some of the most significant governmental policies related to climate change, discussing their purpose and how they work in theory. We’ll also take a look at some of the potential issues that could arise from implementing these policies, as well as their potential effectiveness in helping to tackle the crisis.\nOne of the most significant governmental policies that exist to address climate change is the introduction of carbon taxes. Carbon taxes typically involve the government imposing a fee on the burning of fossil fuels, measured in terms of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The goal of the tax is to induce producers and consumers to move away from carbon-intensive forms of energy and towards solutions that are less polluting. By making it more expensive to release carbon into the atmosphere, the theory is that this will incentivise businesses and individuals to change their habits and reduce their carbon emissions.\nIn practice, one of the potential issues with carbon taxes is that they can exacerbate poverty among some parts of the population, generally in developing countries. Further, it’s not necessarily clear how much of an effect the taxes will have. If the penalty is not steep enough, it may not be enough to incentivise companies to switch to greener and more sustainable practices.\nEmissions Trading Scorcles\nEmissions trading schemes, sometimes referred to as cap-and-trade, are another of the main strategies employed by governments to reduce emissions and tackle climate change. The idea is to limit the overall amount of carbon that can be emitted by creating a cap on the number of permits that allow for the burning of fossil fuels. The permits are then distributed amongst companies or buyers, who can then trade them with each other to control their emissions.\nThe advantage of such a system is that it puts the economic burden on those who are actually causing the emissions, rather than simply raising taxes on everyone. However, the effectiveness of this system is highly dependent on the nature and implementation of the rules, as well as the number of participants involved. If the permits are distributed too liberally, there may be little or no incentive to reduce emissions, and in some cases, the scheme can be easily manipulated, such as in the case of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\nRegulations and Laws\nGovernments can also address climate change by instituting regulations and laws that prohibit certain emissions, or require companies to offset their emissions through investments in green technology or other forms of carbon sequestration. These regulations can be both legally binding and voluntary.\nOne example of a legally binding regulation is the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, which requires companies to acquire a certain portion of their energy from renewable sources or face significant fines or even the suspension of their operations. Similarly, the US’s Clean Air Act regulates the total amount of pollution that motor vehicles are allowed to emit.\nVoluntary regulations, on the other hand, usually take the form of corporate responsibility programs, in which companies commit to certain sustainability standards. For example, the Aleron Group has a Clean By Design program, which commits member companies to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce their impact on the climate. The UN Global Compact is another example of a voluntary program, in which hundreds of companies have agreed to work towards a set of sustainability goals.\nSubsidies and Other Financing Mechanisms\nFinally, governments can also implement policies that provide subsidies or other financing mechanisms to help businesses transition to green practices. These subsidies can take many forms, such as direct payments to companies to invest in green technology, loans or grants to cover the cost of making the transition, or tax credits for companies that make significant investments in renewable energy.\nThese subsidies can be an effective way of providing an economic incentive for businesses to switch to green technology, as it reduces their overall out-of-pocket costs. However, there are some potential issues with using subsidies, as they may end up diverting investments away from existing technologies or economically beneficial practices. Additionally, subsidies can be difficult to manage, as they can be difficult to quantify and require considerable administrative resources to sustain.\nUltimately, governmental policies are an essential part of the effort to combat climate change, as they provide the necessary financial and legal incentives to reduce emissions while ensuring that the burden of the transition to cleaner methods of energy production is shared fairly. Carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, regulations, laws, and subsidies are some of the most significant strategies employed by governments, though their effectiveness is dependent on the specifics of their implementation and execution. As governments continue to develop and implement new policies to address climate change, it is essential that their approach considers the potential pitfalls of their plans and takes steps to ensure that the necessary investments are made in the most efficient and effective manner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e8cb93ad-78cb-4503-83b5-b535c5b54719>","<urn:uuid:eed61778-c2ed-4c70-b92d-7f471c4daa3d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a supply chain professional, I'm curious about how modern warehouse logistics and supply chain management education approach automation and technology. Could you compare the technological aspects emphasized in warehouse operations versus those taught in supply chain management programs?","answer":"In warehouse operations, automation focuses on practical implementation through warehouse management systems, Wi-Fi coverage, and automated equipment for loading, unloading, and moving goods. The emphasis is on minimizing manual labor, optimizing space usage through automated storage systems, and maintaining digital databases for inventory tracking and documentation. In contrast, supply chain management education takes a broader technological approach, incorporating modules like 'SCM 4.0 – Technical Building Blocks', 'Business Intelligence', and 'Big Data'. The educational program emphasizes enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, particularly SAP, and focuses on analyzing and optimizing both business and IT processes across entire value creation chains. Both domains recognize technology as crucial for reducing costs and improving efficiency, but warehouse logistics concentrates on facility-level automation while supply chain education addresses technology's role in managing global networks and information flows.","context":["Goods, products, raw materials need storage. They participate in the turnover in accordance with the development plans of the company and are placed in warehouses. That is why warehouse logistics is so important. It uses theoretical base and practical skills to optimize the process.\nTasks performed by modern warehouse logistics\nThis is a set of measures that consists in different actions aimed at achieving one goal, that is, optimization. So, modern warehouse logistics is an analysis of incoming information about the efficiency of using warehouses and other sites for storing goods, products or raw materials. In addition, it performs the following tasks:\n- Analyzes the methods of working with consignments of goods, choosing the most effective ones, allowing you to optimize and control the process as much as possible.\n- Development, study of the logistics process at a specific point, at a specific warehouse. General methods are used, but the specifics of the business are also taken into account.\n- The optimal number of warehouses is calculated, the desired layout and configuration are selected. As you know, these premises differ not only in area, but also in belonging to one class or another. For example, class “A” warehouses are considered the best, since they were originally built precisely as storage facilities for goods. There are also other warehouses that have been converted from utility rooms. According to some indicators, they are inferior to analogs of category “A”.\nYes, warehouse logistics is an understanding that the success of the company, good trade performance, and the number of customers largely depend on the organization of storage and goods movement. This is true for many other enterprises and organizations.\nCorrect arrangement of warehouse operation\nAn effective collection of logistic information, accounting and inventory are performed. In this way a normal workflow is ensured. In addition, the following table will help you understand what the arrangement of warehouse operation is:\n|Warehouse technical performance||Automation, the ratio of automation and mechanization, the specifics of equipment|\n|Products for which this particular storage facility has been selected||As a rule, these are tools, raw materials, finished goods, containers, processing waste, components and consumables. They are also divided into food and nonfood products.|\nCorrect arrangement of warehouse operation is a whole process that takes into account the specifics of the premises from a constructive point of view. So, there are one-story, two-story or even multistorey warehouses; indoor and outdoor; ordinary or insulated, prepared for use in any seasons, there are also analogues with awnings. When organizing the warehouse operation, it is also taken into account whether these structures are leased or belong to the owner of the company. Thus there may be internal bases of the enterprise, temporary logistic demountable constructions.\nThe importance of the warehouse management\nWarehouse is the movement of goods, accounting and control. The modern warehouse management traditionally divides the movement of any material objects and valuables into categories:\n- Internal movement of material valuables\nThat is, loading, unloading and moving of the objects within the company, inside the warehouse. It is here that transport, warehouse logistics, sorting and labeling take place, the costs of cargo delivery, their redistribution among vehicles are optimized. The warehouse management is also the performance of the employees. They collect batches, complete orders in accordance with the customer preferences.\nIn the process of warehouse management, it is important to regroup the goods quickly, collect the batch required by the customer, prepare the documents for transportation, that is, make consignment notes. Personnel database everything so that the movement of commodity groups is displayed in logistic accounting reports. The movement of goods occurs automatically or mechanically, for example, using loaders or collectors.\nEfficient operation of warehouses\nThe main principle of operation is the optimal use of space. Therefore, a suitable layout is selected. Everything is divided into compartments that have their own purposes. Typically, logistics warehouses have the following compartments:\n- Goods issue area.\n- Sorting and marking area.\n- Storage area.\n- Returned goods collection area.\n- Order packaging area.\nOf course, this is an approximate list, since logistics warehouses largely adapt to the specifics of business, product features. In most cases, similar products are located nearby, in the immediate vicinity. Not only horizontal, but also vertical storage in the warehouse is extensively used and shelving equipment is of help here. The number of tiers can vary, but in most cases there are no more than five of them.\nIn addition, in logistics warehouses equipped in accordance with the rules, the optimal aisle width is also considered. It should be sufficient for a person to walk easily along the aisles and for small warehouse equipment to move without problems. As a rule, these are lift trucks of different types.\nModern warehouse logistics in Ukraine\nIn many respects, foreign experience is adopted, because this area began to develop intensively a little earlier than in Ukraine. Today, modern warehouse logistics in Ukraine also takes into account local realities and legal requirements. There is no secret that many standards differ, including fire safety, sanitary and hygienic. In all countries of the world there is a tendency to toughen the requirements for the functioning of the warehouse in order to guarantee the safety of life, health of people, and the safety of property.\n|Ensuring the safety of objects in the warehouse||They must be protected from damage, theft, loss. For this, modern equipment and technologies are involved. The quality of packaging is also checked.|\n|Profitability||It means the efficiency of the links in warehouse logistics, the ability for several people to work simultaneously, performing different logistics operations.|\nIn modern warehouse logistics in Ukraine, the throughput capacity and the speed of each procedure are taken into account. Such factors as energy consumption required for the warehouse maintaining, operation rate of equipment, route optimization for the movement of goods inside the premises are also studied.\nWhat does the warehouse management begin with\nThis procedure also involves several stages aimed at achieving a single goal. To begin with, organizing the warehouse operation means choosing a suitable premises, carrying out calculations. It is also very important to estimate costs. It will clearly show what is more profitable to buy a warehouse or to rent it. The following factors are also taken into account. They are: features of the nearby infrastructure, storage area, the ability to place racks and racking equipment in several tiers.\nAlso, when organizing the work of a warehouse, it is necessary to take into account the specifics of packaging, for example, pallets, boxes. It is important to select appropriate equipment for transportation and lifting. As a rule, entrepreneurs choose comfortable racks. But here the choice won’t be so simple either, since there is a huge variety of racking equipment for the warehouse, which differs in the maximum allowable load per square meter, the number of tiers, compartments, dimensions, the ability to fix narrow or wide aisles.\nLots of things depend on the qualifications of the staff as well as their motivation. The managers who organize the warehouse operation, in most cases, have a university degree in logistics. Practical experience, knowledge in logistics, forwarding, auditing, information technology, financial reporting, and inventory are also welcomed. That is, in fact, he is an expert able to perform various (related) functions. There is no surprise that warehouse logisticians and auditors are the most well-paid jobs not only in Ukraine, but also in the world.\nManagement of warehouse operation is a profitable investment in the company’s success\nThat is true, that in order to equip everything properly, to establish logistics, to introduce automated programs that minimize manual labor in the warehouse, investments are required. Sometimes these investments are quite substantial. But if everything is calculated correctly, such expenses will definitely pay off, since they:\n- Allow you to abandon some of the costs in logistics.\n- Reduce the time for customer service, packaging, sorting, labeling, preparation for shipment.\n- Allow you to reduce manual labor in the warehouse and get rid of the so-called “human factor”, since the processes will be automated\n- Help to establish monitoring and control. The high quality of Wi-Fi is demanded, since it must cover the entire warehouse area, including the upper tiers and floors.\nHigh-quality modern warehouse logistics in Ukraine means not only a successful launch after preliminary preparation and the search for a suitable premises, but also subsequent control. That is why auditors are occasionally invited for an independent assessment, to identify the efficiency of the warehouse. The efficiency is influenced by many factors, even the height of the ceilings, the specific features of finishing materials in the warehouse, ventilation in the room, heating, floor material, its thickness, the ability to carry out various loading and unloading operations. Convenient access to the warehouse and the safety of logistics are also important.\nOther aspects you need to know when organizing warehouse logistics\nIt is necessary to decide on the storage units: pallets, nets, boxes. It is also taken into account whether the warehouse belongs to a production, trading, forwarding, transport or logistics company. Some premises can be operated all year round, while others have a defined seasonal focus. There are specialized, multipurpose or mixed warehouses. Depending on the equipment, warehouses can be automatic, mechanized, automated or non-mechanized ones. It is advisable to choose some warehouses with a good access or even with railway sidings. Everything depends on the specifics of the company’s operations.\nWarehouse logistics should be aimed at optimizing business chains, convenient unloading and collecting. It should also be environmentally friendly. This issue has become very urgent recently.\nThe unitization of goods is often carried out in the warehouse, which means the formation of large lots from a variety of small ones. This allows you to reduce costs, since the delivery will be provided to several customers at once. The main principles of a successful warehouse launch are the correct choice of premises, taking into account area and location, selection of suitable equipment, optimization of the information flows, correct staff selection, reporting, accounting and control. Any movement of goods must be reflected in the database, in documents.\nA journal of goods arrival is also kept, the grant of power of attorney is registered; there are receipts, material cards, invoices allowing the release of materials. As you can see, the list of documents is quite impressive; most of them imply the possibility of online drafting with entry into a single logistics database and with subsequent archiving.\nThe main experts working in the warehouse are markers, pickers, packers, loading operators, accountants, storekeepers, loaders, security. They report directly to the manager, the head, who is responsible for the correct logistics, compliance with the interaction algorithms of employees with each other and with customers. Occasionally, it is important to check all the aspects, including, for example, the quality of the packaging, protective film, marking, the application of all information regarding the specifics of the goods in the warehouse, manufacturing date, information about the manufacturer, and so on.\nЭксперт в сфере транспорта и логистических процессов","Supply Chain Management (M.Sc.)

{"question":"What's the key difference between a vision statement and a mission statement?","answer":"A vision statement is focused on the future of the company and is written for those working within the organization, while a mission statement is based on the present and identifies actions to be taken on behalf of the customer. Your vision statement expresses the desired outcome, while a mission statement expresses how you will get there.","context":["What is a vision statement?\nA vision statement is often confused with a mission statement. In fact, the terms are often used interchangeably; however, there are subtle differences that have a big impact on your business. A mission statement is based on the present and identifies consistent action to be taken on behalf of the customer. After all, a mission statement is written with the customer in mind.\nA vision statement, on the other hand, is written for those who work within the organization and identifies the future of the company. Your vision statement should express the desired outcome, whereas a mission statement expresses how you will get there. In essence, your vision will be the result of your mission.\nWhy should I write a vision statement?\nRemember the old adage: “Begin with the end in mind.” If you are preparing your business plan for the first time, start with where you want to go (vision) and then decide how you will get there (mission). If you already have a mission statement, remember that it started as a vision in your head. Now it’s time to articulate it, so everyone in the organization can share it. The vision statement is the magic “why” behind the mission. People thrive on purpose. Tell them why the mission is important. Tell them what we will achieve together.\nWhat are the key elements of a solid vision?\nYou can build a solid vision statement on personal values or business aspects. This is entirely up to you. What motivates and inspires you? That should be the heart of your vision. Personal values include fundamental beliefs like: adaptability, cooperation, integrity, and reliability. Business aspects include finances, reputation, service standards, and growth.\nHow should I structure my vision statement?\nYour vision statement should be short and easy to remember.
