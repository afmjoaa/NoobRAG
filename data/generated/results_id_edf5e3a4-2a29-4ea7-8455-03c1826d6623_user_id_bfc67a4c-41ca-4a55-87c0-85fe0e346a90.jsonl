{"question":"I'm considering legal action for unpaid wages - what are the key procedural differences between pursuing a class action settlement versus filing in small claims court?","answer":"In class action settlements, the process involves working with attorneys and potentially opting out if unsatisfied with the settlement terms, while being mindful of time-bar limitations. Small claims court has a more structured procedure: filing a statement of claim, serving process to the defendant (either by certified mail or through a sheriff/process server), attending a mandatory pre-trial conference where the judge reviews pleadings, possibly going through mediation, and if no agreement is reached, proceeding to trial. After trial, the judgment is recorded and parties have 10 days to request a rehearing if they believe there was an error.","context":["I'm a representative in a class action lawsuit. However, after I was finally given the final details, feel only the attorney benefits. The amount of unpaid wages owed to me is much more than the settlement amount I will receive from the class action lawsuit. I feel I was lead to believe I would receive all my unpaid wages in addition to a settlement amount from the lawsuit. I would have been better off filing a wage claim with the California Labor Board.\nYou would have to \"opt out\" of the settlement. Further, you would need to make sure that if you opt out, your claims would not be time barred. You should discuss this issue with your lawyer and perhaps obtain a second opinion from an unaffiliated lawyer.\nEmployment / Labor Attorney\nIt is a rare event when a class member ever gets the full amount of their claim as a part of settlement. A settlement is a compromise of the full value of the claim. By its very nature, when a claim is compromised, the plaintiff will receive less than what they want and the defendant will pay more than they believe they should. In class actions, class representatives usually receive more than the class members, for their involvement as a representative. Settlements also require approval of the representative(s). These are issues you must discuss with your attorneys. As Mr. Kane says, you may be able to opt out, but there are risks in doing so, so consider this carefully.\nThey say you get what you pay for, and this response is free, so take it for what it is worth. This is my opinion based on very limited information. My opinion should not be taken as legal advice. For true advice, we would require a confidential consultation where I would ask you questions and get your complete story. This is a public forum, so remember, nothing here is confidential. Nor am I your attorney. I do not know who you are and you have not hired me to provide any legal service. To do so would require us to meet and sign written retainer agreement. My responses are intended for general information only.\nEmployment / Labor Attorney\nYou have received good advice here. If you can opt out, yes, you can proceed to vindicate your rights, but you will have to deal with the statute of limitations. You have more than the DLSE option. You can file a lawsuit in small claims court if the amount is low enough. If you need to file, or elect to file in superior court you can possibly extend the statute of limitations for another year (4 years out total) by making a claim under the Unfair Business Practices Act.\nGood luck to you.\nThis answer should not be construed to create any attorney-client relationship. Such a relationship can be formed only through the mutual execution of an attorney-client agreement. The answer given is based on the extremely limited facts provided and the proper course of action might change significantly with the introduction of other facts. All who read this answer should not rely on the answer to govern their conduct. Please seek the advice of competent counsel after disclosing all facts to that attorney. This answer is intended for California residents only. The answering party is only licensed to practice in the State of California.\nWrongful Termination Lawyer\nYou may have believed that you would receive all of your unpaid wages in addition to a settlement amount, but I find it hard to accept that you were \"led to believe\" that. Why would any defendant settle a case to pay everything you think you're owed? There is no value in the settlement to such a defendant; any defendant would instead take the matter to trial. So while you may have believed going in that you were going to get everything owed to you without going to trial, it's hard to accept that your belief was based on anything the attorney said.\nWhen entering into litigation, it's important to be realistic about what it can and can't accomplish. If you're determined to get every penny owed to you, the only way to do that is to go to a jury and risk getting nothing at all if things don't go your way. Moreover, if you go to trial and lose, you could wind up owing the other side tens of thousands of dollars in their costs. That's why most cases settle: both sides have risk.\nIt's unfair now to say that you were \"led to believe\" something different, or that \"only the attorney benefits\" when you and the entire class are getting some part of what you owed. It may not have been everything you wanted, but it's more than you had before the attorney got involved.\nDisclaimer: Please be aware that I am not offering legal advice, nor forming an attorney-client relationship with you. I am not representing you, nor doing anything to protect your legal rights. If you believe that you have suffered a legal wrong, take action before any statute or limitations expires, or your right to do so may be lost forever. Good luck in your legal matter.","Small Claims Court\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a small claims action?\nIt’s when there is a dispute between two parties, and the issue in controversy does not exceed $5,000. You should review Chapter 34 of the Florida Statutes for a description of which causes of action are covered under small claims in the county court. Also review the small claims rules of procedure located in section 7 of the Florida Rules of Court for more detailed information. The statutes and rules of procedure which apply will depend upon the type of case filed. It is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the laws that apply to your particular case by visiting your local law library.\nThe first step in filing a small claims action is obtaining and filling out the necessary forms usually consisting of a statement of claim and a notice or service of process which requires the parties to appear at a specified pre-trial conference. Small claims forms are available at your local Clerk of Court's Office.\nWhat happens after filing?\nOnce the statement of claim has been completed and filed with the clerk of court, the plaintiff must provide the defendant with the copies of the statement of claim and the service of process form. In a small claims case, there are two general ways to provide the defendant with these forms.\nIf the defendant lives in Florida, the statement of claim and services of process form can be sent by certified mail through the United States Postal Service. If the defendant refuses to accept the service of process through certified mail, or does not live in the Florida, or is a corporation within Florida, the statement of claim and service of process must be delivered to the defendant by the sheriff of the county where the defendant lives or is located. A private process server who is authorized to serve legal papers may also serve the defendant.\nOnce the defendant has been served, the process may continue. If service of process is done incorrectly or not done at all, the case may not proceed. Once the defendant has been served with the statement of claim and the service of process form, both parties must attend a pre-trial conference.\nWhat happens at the Pre-trial Conference?\nAt the Pre-trial Conference, the judge will review the pleadings and documents and may simplify the issues, refer the case to mediation, and take care of any other matters as needed. You may settle the case with the other party before or at the pre-trial conference by entering into and filing a stipulation agreement. This agreement can settle all or part of the case and becomes part of the court order.\nSometimes, the participation of a third, neutral party is helpful in aiding the litigants in reaching an agreement. This process is called mediation, and your case may be referred to it at the pre-trial conference.\nWhat if we are not able to reach an agreement through mediation?\nIf the parties are unable to reach an agreement through stipulation or mediation, they must appear for trial on the date and the time scheduled by the Clerk during the pre-trial conference. When the defendant fails to respond or show up to defend against the statement of claim, the Clerk or the judge may enter a default judgment. All parties are bound by the applicable law and the court cannot help you to present your case. The parties must make certain to bring all evidence and witnesses to the trial but keep in mind that letters, affidavits, and estimates may not be accepted as evidence.\nWhat is a judgment?\nA judgment is the written decision of the case and includes the amount of money to be paid by one party to another, acts which must be performed, or property which must be transferred. After the judgment is signed, it will be recorded in the county's public records and will be provided to the parties either at the conclusion of the trial or later by mail.\nIf the parties feel the judge has made an error, they have ten days from the date the judgment is entered by the court to file with the clerk for a rehearing.\nAfter the judgment is entered, the winning party may need to execute and enforce the terms of the judgment in order to collect money or property. If judgment monies are paid in full, the plaintiff must furnish the defendant with a completed satisfaction of judgment form which can be obtained from your local Clerk of Court.\nPlease note that the Court does not guarantee collection. It is important to realize that just because you have won a judgment does not mean collection of judgment monies is guaranteed. The Court cannot and does not guarantee collection of judgment monies.\nSmall Claims Resources"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f432177-355b-4149-a561-d7f48c256297>","<urn:uuid:4337f2ae-7896-4ff0-b43b-167d36451cf3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the three main components that make up a living cell?","answer":"A cell consists of three main components: cytoplasm, various organelles contained within the cytoplasm, and a cell membrane boundary that surrounds everything.","context":["Cellular Structures: Components of a cell.Cells: The fundamental, structural, and functional units or subunits of living organisms. They are composed of CYTOPLASM containing various ORGANELLES and a CELL MEMBRANE boundary.Electron Microscope Tomography: A tomographic technique for obtaining 3-dimensional images with transmission electron microscopy.Microscopy: The use of instrumentation and techniques for visualizing material and details that cannot be seen by the unaided eye. It is usually done by enlarging images, transmitted by light or electron beams, with optical or magnetic lenses that magnify the entire image field. With scanning microscopy, images are generated by collecting output from the specimen in a point-by-point fashion, on a magnified scale, as it is scanned by a narrow beam of light or electrons, a laser, a conductive probe, or a topographical probe.Microscopy, Fluorescence: Microscopy of specimens stained with fluorescent dye (usually fluorescein isothiocyanate) or of naturally fluorescent materials, which emit light when exposed to ultraviolet or blue light. Immunofluorescence microscopy utilizes antibodies that are labeled with fluorescent dye.Organelles: Specific particles of membrane-bound organized living substances present in eukaryotic cells, such as the MITOCHONDRIA; the GOLGI APPARATUS; ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM; LYSOSOMES; PLASTIDS; and VACUOLES.Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton: Fluorescence microscopy utilizing multiple low-energy photons to produce the excitation event of the fluorophore. Multiphoton microscopes have a simplified optical path in the emission side due to the lack of an emission pinhole, which is necessary with normal confocal microscopes. Ultimately this allows spatial isolation of the excitation event, enabling deeper imaging into optically thick tissue, while restricting photobleaching and phototoxicity to the area being imaged.Cell Physiological Phenomena: Cellular processes, properties, and characteristics.Cytoskeleton: The network of filaments, tubules, and interconnecting filamentous bridges which give shape, structure, and organization to the cytoplasm.Microscopy, Confocal: A light microscopic technique in which only a small spot is illuminated and observed at a time. An image is constructed through point-by-point scanning of the field in this manner. Light sources may be conventional or laser, and fluorescence or transmitted observations are possible.Imaging, Three-Dimensional: The process of generating three-dimensional images by electronic, photographic, or other methods. For example, three-dimensional images can be generated by assembling multiple tomographic images with the aid of a computer, while photographic 3-D images (HOLOGRAPHY) can be made by exposing film to the interference pattern created when two laser light sources shine on an object.Microtubules: Slender, cylindrical filaments found in the cytoskeleton of plant and animal cells. They are composed of the protein TUBULIN and are influenced by TUBULIN MODULATORS.Actins: Filamentous proteins that are the main constituent of the thin filaments of muscle fibers. The filaments (known also as filamentous or F-actin) can be dissociated into their globular subunits; each subunit is composed of a single polypeptide 375 amino acids long. This is known as globular or G-actin. In conjunction with MYOSINS, actin is responsible for the contraction and relaxation of muscle.Microscopy, Electron: Microscopy using an electron beam, instead of light, to visualize the sample, thereby allowing much greater magnification. The interactions of ELECTRONS with specimens are used to provide information about the fine structure of that specimen. In TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY the reactions of the electrons that are transmitted through the specimen are imaged. In SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY an electron beam falls at a non-normal angle on the specimen and the image is derived from the reactions occurring above the plane of the specimen.Staining and Labeling: The marking of biological material with a dye or other reagent for the purpose of identifying and quantitating components of tissues, cells or their extracts.Nanotechnology: The development and use of techniques to study physical phenomena and construct structures in the nanoscale size range or smaller.Models, Biological: Theoretical representations that simulate the behavior or activity of biological processes or diseases. For disease models in living animals, DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL is available. Biological models include the use of mathematical equations, computers, and other electronic equipment.Actin Cytoskeleton: Fibers composed of MICROFILAMENT PROTEINS, which are predominately ACTIN. They are the smallest of the cytoskeletal filaments.Luminescent Proteins: Proteins which are involved in the phenomenon of light emission in living systems. Included are the \"enzymatic\" and \"non-enzymatic\" types of system with or without the presence of oxygen or co-factors.Microscopy, Electron, Scanning: Microscopy in which the object is examined directly by an electron beam scanning the specimen point-by-point. The image is constructed by detecting the products of specimen interactions that are projected above the plane of the sample, such as backscattered electrons. Although SCANNING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY also scans the specimen point by point with the electron beam, the image is constructed by detecting the electrons, or their interaction products that are transmitted through the sample plane, so that is a form of TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY.Fluorescent Dyes: Agents that emit light after excitation by light. The wave length of the emitted light is usually longer than that of the incident light. Fluorochromes are substances that cause fluorescence in other substances, i.e., dyes used to mark or label other compounds with fluorescent tags.Microtubule-Associated Proteins: High molecular weight proteins found in the MICROTUBULES of the cytoskeletal system. Under certain conditions they are required for TUBULIN assembly into the microtubules and stabilize the assembled microtubules.Microfilament Proteins: Monomeric subunits of primarily globular ACTIN and found in the cytoplasmic matrix of almost all cells. They are often associated with microtubules and may play a role in cytoskeletal function and/or mediate movement of the cell or the organelles within the cell.Green Fluorescent Proteins: Protein analogs and derivatives of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein that emit light (FLUORESCENCE) when excited with ULTRAVIOLET RAYS. They are used in REPORTER GENES in doing GENETIC TECHNIQUES. Numerous mutants have been made to emit other colors or be sensitive to pH.Tubulin: A microtubule subunit protein found in large quantities in mammalian brain. It has also been isolated from SPERM FLAGELLUM; CILIA; and other sources. Structurally, the protein is a dimer with a molecular weight of approximately 120,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 5.8S. It binds to COLCHICINE; VINCRISTINE; and VINBLASTINE.Cell Compartmentation: A partitioning within cells due to the selectively permeable membranes which enclose each of the separate parts, e.g., mitochondria, lysosomes, etc.Cell Membrane: The lipid- and protein-containing, selectively permeable membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.Cell Line: Established cell cultures that have the potential to propagate indefinitely.Image Processing, Computer-Assisted: A technique of inputting two-dimensional images into a computer and then enhancing or analyzing the imagery into a form that is more useful to the human observer.Proteins: Linear POLYPEPTIDES that are synthesized on RIBOSOMES and may be further modified, crosslinked, cleaved, or assembled into complex proteins with several subunits. The specific sequence of AMINO ACIDS determines the shape the polypeptide will take, during PROTEIN FOLDING, and the function of the protein.Cytoplasm: The part of a cell that contains the CYTOSOL and small structures excluding the CELL NUCLEUS; MITOCHONDRIA; and large VACUOLES. (Glick, Glossary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 1990)Molecular Sequence Data: Descriptions of specific amino acid, carbohydrate, or nucleotide sequences which have appeared in the published literature and/or are deposited in and maintained by databanks such as GENBANK, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF), or other sequence repositories.Proteomics: The systematic study of the complete complement of proteins (PROTEOME) of organisms.Cell Nucleus: Within a eukaryotic cell, a membrane-limited body which contains chromosomes and one or more nucleoli (CELL NUCLEOLUS). The nuclear membrane consists of a double unit-type membrane which is perforated by a number of pores; the outermost membrane is continuous with the ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM. A cell may contain more than one nucleus. (From Singleton & Sainsbury, Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, 2d ed)Cells, Cultured: Cells propagated in vitro in special media conducive to their growth. Cultured cells are used to study developmental, morphologic, metabolic, physiologic, and genetic processes, among others.Protein Transport: The process of moving proteins from one cellular compartment (including extracellular) to another by various sorting and transport mechanisms such as gated transport, protein translocation, and vesicular transport.Amino Acid Sequence: The order of amino acids as they occur in a polypeptide chain. This is referred to as the primary structure of proteins. It is of fundamental importance in determining PROTEIN CONFORMATION.HeLa Cells: The first continuously cultured human malignant CELL LINE, derived from the cervical carcinoma of Henrietta Lacks. These cells are used for VIRUS CULTIVATION and antitumor drug screening assays.Fluorescent Antibody Technique: Test for tissue antigen using either a direct method, by conjugation of antibody with fluorescent dye (FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE, DIRECT) or an indirect method, by formation of antigen-antibody complex which is then labeled with fluorescein-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin antibody (FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE, INDIRECT). The tissue is then examined by fluorescence microscopy.Membrane Proteins: Proteins which are found in membranes including cellular and intracellular membranes. They consist of two types, peripheral and integral proteins. They include most membrane-associated enzymes, antigenic proteins, transport proteins, and drug, hormone, and lectin receptors.Protein Binding: The process in which substances, either endogenous or exogenous, bind to proteins, peptides, enzymes, protein precursors, or allied compounds. Specific protein-binding measures are often used as assays in diagnostic assessments.Recombinant Fusion Proteins: Recombinant proteins produced by the GENETIC TRANSLATION of fused genes formed by the combination of NUCLEIC ACID REGULATORY SEQUENCES of one or more genes with the protein coding sequences of one or more genes.Nuclear Proteins: Proteins found in the nucleus of a cell. Do not confuse with NUCLEOPROTEINS which are proteins conjugated with nucleic acids, that are not necessarily present in the nucleus.Mitochondria: Semiautonomous, self-reproducing organelles that occur in the cytoplasm of all cells of most, but not all, eukaryotes. Each mitochondrion is surrounded by a double limiting membrane. The inner membrane is highly invaginated, and its projections are called cristae. Mitochondria are the sites of the reactions of oxidative phosphorylation, which result in the formation of ATP. They contain distinctive RIBOSOMES, transfer RNAs (RNA, TRANSFER); AMINO ACYL T RNA SYNTHETASES; and elongation and termination factors. Mitochondria depend upon genes within the nucleus of the cells in which they reside for many essential messenger RNAs (RNA, MESSENGER). Mitochondria are believed to have arisen from aerobic bacteria that established a symbiotic relationship with primitive protoeukaryotes. (King & Stansfield, A Dictionary of Genetics, 4th ed)Signal Transduction: The intracellular transfer of information (biological activation/inhibition) through a signal pathway. In each signal transduction system, an activation/inhibition signal from a biologically active molecule (hormone, neurotransmitter) is mediated via the coupling of a receptor/enzyme to a second messenger system or to an ion channel. Signal transduction plays an important role in activating cellular functions, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation. Examples of signal transduction systems are the GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID-postsynaptic receptor-calcium ion channel system, the receptor-mediated T-cell activation pathway, and the receptor-mediated activation of phospholipases. Those coupled to membrane depolarization or intracellular release of calcium include the receptor-mediated activation of cytotoxic functions in granulocytes and the synaptic potentiation of protein kinase activation. Some signal transduction pathways may be part of larger signal transduction pathways; for example, protein kinase activation is part of the platelet activation signal pathway.Immunohistochemistry: Histochemical localization of immunoreactive substances using labeled antibodies as reagents.Mutation: Any detectable and heritable change in the genetic material that causes a change in the GENOTYPE and which is transmitted to daughter cells and to succeeding generations.Kinetics: The rate dynamics in chemical or physical systems.Cell Line, Tumor: A cell line derived from cultured tumor cells.Time Factors: Elements of limited time intervals, contributing to particular results or situations."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1ad7b72d-978c-46e7-b686-4cce797ecea4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between early video artists' approach to documenting performances versus Yang Yongliang's representation of urban transformation in his photographic work?","answer":"Early video artists like Marina Abramovic and Vito Acconci used video primarily as a documentary tool to preserve their live performances, creating direct recordings of events that allowed future generations to witness their work. In contrast, Yang Yongliang's approach to documenting urban transformation is more conceptual and manipulated - he digitally combines multiple photographs to create artificial landscapes that appear traditional at first glance but are actually composed of modern urban elements like skyscrapers and construction sites. While performance documentation aimed to capture reality as it happened, Yang's work deliberately constructs an artificial reality to comment on urbanization. The performance videos serve as historical records, while Yang's compositions are intentionally crafted critiques that use traditional Chinese landscape painting aesthetics to highlight the destruction of heritage and natural environment through urban development.","context":["July 6, 2016, by Editor\nUrbanization and its artistic discontent: Yang Yongliang’s urban dystopia\nWritten by Meiqin Wang.\nAlong with its apparent prosperity and great wealth, China’s top-down and profit-driven urbanization has provoked ever intensive and perplexing social changes and environmental degradation. In response, a growing number of critically-minded Chinese artists have investigated the downsides of this process in art making. Shanghai artist Yang Yongliang is such an artist who examines the sweeping geographical and physical reconfigurations of Chinese cities and their destructive consequences. Since 2006, he has created several conceptual photographic series and video works which reveal a unique personal style through which he visually engages with various problems brought about by mainstream urbanism. These works include Phantom Landscape, Heavenly City, The Peach Blossom Colony, Artificial Wonderland, and The Day of Perpetual Night.\nFig 1: Yang Yongliang, Artificial Wonderland 1, 2010. Courtesy of the artist.\nYang’s work Artificial Wonderland 1 (Fig. 1) exemplifies his perception of the rampant urban development in China. This large digital photograph looks like a reproduction of a typical Chinese landscape painting of the Song dynasty, with its broad vista, overlapping mountain ranges and misty atmosphere, and the opulent presence of rivers and lakes. Upon close observation, however, one might be greatly surprised and even shocked. The beauty of nature, a topic rhapsodized about in Chinese paintings and literature throughout the ages, is achieved by the artist’s careful piecing together of numerous photographed images of the cityscape that he took with his digital camera in and around Shanghai.\nWhat seem to be mountain ranges and hills, trees and plants, boulders and foliage, and pathways, are actually formed by various urban structures such as skyscrapers, elevated highways, voltage lines, electrical towers and poles, and construction cranes. Through his painstaking arrangement of countless urban structures and motifs, Yang has constructed an artificial landscape, a megalopolis disguised as natural landscape, with a wide range of details that can be readily associated with the consequences of China’s consumerist urbanization.\nFig 2: Yang Yongliang, Artificial Wonderland 1, 2010, detail. Courtesy of the artist.\nIn the foreground, by the shores and in the water, what seem to be villages, boats, and greenswards are actually construction sites, collapsing buildings, and rubble-covered ground, speaking to the endless construction and demolition. Behind all this at the center of the composition, there emerges an amusement park whose giant Ferris wheel and roller coasters hint at the hedonism of contemporary urban culture (Fig. 2).\nThis section is full of ambiguous details, and the amusement park exists in a complex architectural environment. In front of it are ruins of ancient Greek structures with remaining stone sculptures standing over a field of debris. An edifice of Roman style is to the right of the park, and behind it emerges a number of Chinese palatial buildings. To the left and in front of it is a forest of electric towers over a group of overlapping high-rises. Further left and behind those is a cluster of European-style villas, and next to that is an empty thatch-roofed pavilion. The ground that supports all these structures is a mix of earthy land, heaps of concrete rubble, and trash dumps. This is a space where old and new, Eastern and Western, fictional and real randomly co-exist without any inner logic. History and time do not make sense in this zone, which very much reflects how urban development unfolds in China. In the rush to urbanize and prompt GDP growth, the history of a place seems to bear minimal value in the mind of decision-makers. And ironically, when authentic historical sites are demolished, new structures in vulgar and fragmented pseudo-antique styles (Chinese and European) are often established.\nThis work and those others mentioned above are informed by Yang’s first-hand experience of the disruptive process of Shanghai’s urban expansion. Yang was born in the historical county of Jiading, near the old Shanghai city and renowned for its beautiful scenery, historic cultural sites, and residential quarters and streets built in the characteristic southern architectural style. In the early 1990s, Shanghai began rapid economic development and found itself in need of more land to fuel its economy. Its solution was to expand its urban territory by annexing its neighboring rural counties, including Jiading.\nFor Yang, that was when the destruction of his historical county began. As the speculative and commercialized urban development took hold of the ancient country (renamed ‘Jiading district’), a lot of historical sites were torn down and the beautiful landscape was destroyed to make way for industrial complexes, commercial districts, and apartment compounds. Many of these new urban structures, oddly, are made to resemble the style of the authentic traditional buildings that were demolished. Having traveled to other cities across China, Yang sees similar phenomena everywhere and laments: “A country that carries a long civilization and is full of traces of history shall have been replaced by a new, soulless kingdom which is littered with concrete cement!”\nThe work clearly expresses Yang’s critical assessment of the mode of development Shanghai and China as a whole is taking. Numerous buildings of similar architectural style populate the foreground of the composition. Other than obvious ruins, it is often unclear whether the standing structures are being spared from demolition, or if they are in the middle of collapsing and will be reduced to rubble. This is a state of transition between construction and demolition, a condition that has actually become perpetual in China’s nonstop urban renewal and expansion. The ambiguity and uncertainty here reflect the artist’s response to an observed reality and reveal a certain level of psychological truth. The distant skyscrapers are piled up in a congested and precarious way so that the whole situation looks horrendous, especially when one considers that these structures are where human beings live. This photographic image bears the atmosphere of an apocalyptic prediction: the once tranquil and pristine nature has been entirely abolished with the invasion and infiltration of the urban world. It might well be seen as an urban dystopia.\nIn Yang’s meticulously simulated image of the traditional landscape painting, however, there is one important element missing: the human figure. This intentional omission might serve as a pointed comment on the anti-humanistic nature of recent urban development in Shanghai, which bears typical features of overall Chinese urban transformation. As many scholars point out, the development is predominantly driven by the desire to accelerate economic growth, maximize financial profit and political prestige, and enhance the competitiveness of the city to attract foreign investment and international tourism. In the drive to create a global city, the everyday life of ordinary local residents is ignored by the grand scheme of social progress designed by a few political and economic elites.\nFig 3: Yang Yongliang, Artificial Wonderland 1, 2010, detail. Courtesy of the artist.\nTherefore, the human-less urban environment portrayed in Yang’s work is essentially an alienated one. The tightly overlapped skyscrapers appear threatening and fundamentally unsuitable for organic life, while the collapsing structures and rubble-covered ground look like a scene after an epic disaster (Fig. 3). Either as a comment on the increasingly estranged contemporary lifestyle or a critique of the problems embedded in Chinese urban development, or both, this work can be seen as an honest and poignant representation of the conflicting and distressing urban space that Yang sees himself living in. The magnificence of Shanghai’s newly built urban environment renders the destruction of heritage and communities, and the distress inflicted upon its inhabitants, invisible, much like the beautiful and orderly surface of the photograph which conceals such disturbing and chaotic content.\nMeiqin Wang is Associate Professor of Art History at California State University Northridge.

The first nationalities to pick up on the Portapak as an artistic tool - and therefore those who made the earliest pieces of Video art - were, unsurprisingly, from those countries where it first became commercially available (the US and the UK were the early practitioners).\nNam June Paik - 'The Father Of Video Art'\nIn the same way that the 'father of conceptual art' Marcel Duchamp had declared an ordinary urinal to be a work of art when he created his first and most infamous readymade in 1917, the \"father of Video Art\" Nam June Paik first established video as a credible artistic medium in 1965, when he claimed his footage of the Pope's visit to New York to be a serious artwork. When Korean-American Fluxus artist Nam June Paik, glimpsed the pontiff by chance while sitting in traffic, he recorded it on his Portapak, and presented the grainy, barely edited result later that evening at a screening at the Cafe A Go Go in Greenwich Village (though some art historians have disputed Paik's claim that it was indeed the Portapak that he used, asserting that Sony did not release it until 1968.) What is not disputed is that this work, along with Paik's 1963 Fluxus exhibition at Galerie Parnass in Paris - where he showed his first reworked television sculptures - were some of the first pieces of art made using the newly accessible medium of video.\nAfter his seminal 1965 screening, Paik wrote a short manifesto encouraging artists and activists to use video as a tool for empowerment to fight back against the establishment, especially what he called 'one-way' broadcast television companies - a utopian mission he would continue to pursue throughout his long career. He also predicted that 'as collage replaced oil paint, the cathode ray tube will replace the canvas' He would go on to pioneer the use of broadcast, video installation, live events, and artists' screenings, all of which are modes practiced by artists today.\nBroader Adoption of Video\nIt was in the 1970s that many of the key figures in Video art started to make their most important works. Many of these early practitioners were, like Paik, eager to explore the impermanent and transient qualities of the medium. It was adopted notably early by American artists such as John Baldessari, Joan Jonas, and Bruce Nauman to further their conceptual agendas. In the UK, David Hall campaigned vigorously for video to be accepted as a valid art form and wrote widely about it as a medium, as well as producing important works of his own.\nAn interest in video as a tool for activism arose in the 1970s as well. It allowed for documentation, which to some activists offered an opportunity to prove the injustices they sought to change; or, it allowed for a presentation of their message in a boldly, undeniable way. A powerful example of this was Videofreex's Davidson's Jail Tape (1971). After getting arrested at the 1971 May Day events in Washington D.C., a Videofreex member films rarely seen raw footage of his ride on the bus to jail, his detainment in the cell, and an up close and personal look at the inmates.\nTechnology Dictating Art\nAs technologies such as color television, special effects, thermal imaging, consumer electronics, surveillance cameras and video projection were introduced and developed, their impact was seen in the work of video artists. The toolkit available in the 1980s became immeasurably larger than the prior decade and allowed artists to produce more spectacular works. Laurie Anderson often played with voice distortion, most memorably when she created The Clone, a digitally altered male version of herself. Bill Viola became known for his use of extreme slow motion. Gary Hill would go on to experiment widely with electronic sound and language, creating his own \"electronic linguistics.\"\nAdditionally, some of the most prominent experimental filmmakers became intrigued with video and later developed highly regarded Video art practices that sat alongside and were informed by their cinema-based work. Chris Marker, for example, made a number of well-known pieces of Video art in the 1990s, including Zapping Zones (1992), featuring a mixture of his previous film and television works in an immersive gallery installation, and an interactive 'multimedia memoire' on CD-ROM called Immemory in 1998.\nVideo Art: Concepts, Styles, and Trends\nVideo allowed artists from various movements to expand their existing toolkit and get their diverse ideas across in an unprecedentedly immediate way. Video's portability and ease of use allowed practitioners to record their actions or performances in a way previously unimaginable. These artists all used video to produce extraordinarily direct and personal artworks that hadn't been possible with any other medium. Thus, the innovation of the technology equaled an evolution in artistic possibility.\nThe Power of Television\nThe growing popularity of broadcast television had a strong influence on early Video art practitioners in particular. Artists such as Wolf Vostell and Martha Rosler sought to highlight what they saw as TV's progressively insidious power by producing parodies of advertising and television programs. Some feminists used video to showcase society's sexism via popular culture. Dara Birnbaum, for instance, often deconstructed popular television programs, like Wonder Woman, with key female characters, which she then compiled as moving visual images that questioned stereotype and objectification. Still others, like Nam June Paik and Brian Hoey, challenged viewers to think about their own passive role in television's domination by using live video feeds in their installations to reflect audience images back at themselves. Paik was also inspired by the question of how television and its relationship to modern technology vis-a-vis contemporary man might affect the profound and the spiritual vis-a-vis ancient man. His work Buddha Watching TV (1974-1997) became a twenty-three year meditation on this question; a stone head of a Buddha contemplating a television set reflective of Paik's sentiment. Many of these works represented a desire by artists to morph the television experience into a redefined impetus of focusing on the unique, the personal, the political and the non-commercial.\nDefying Film Conventions\nWhen Video art was in its birthing stages, film had already been widely established as a credible means of entertainment, a medium for telling stories, and a widespread, mainstream choice in encountering the multitude of human experience, once removed from self. But artists working with video were quick to give themselves permission to ignore Hollywood's conventions, even ignore rules of narration, and to experiment with presenting moving pictures and sound according to their own terms. This meant work that defied expected notions of plot or character establishment, but instead put forth pictures (sometimes with sound) that denoted an artist's emotion, statement, or snapshot). In some cases, Video offered no real explanation, but was intended merely for the viewer to experience a feeling, reflect on a theme, or get a glimpse into the artist's mind, as chaotic or calm that might be. With no tight weave from beginning to end, these works were impact-established and went against everything film was supposed to mean. In some way, this defiance can be said about almost all Video artists from the 1960s through now - in particular, Andy Warhol slashed cinema's ideas of presenting long stories in condensed spaces by producing videos such as Andy Warhol's Sleep, (1971) which is nothing more than an hours long glimpse at a sleeping man. And, in Joan Jonas' Vertical Roll (1972), we find a gradual unfolding of the self portrait of the artist through random images of her body interspersed with other objects and elements - a distinctly non-narrative collage, radical in its non-linearity or logical make-up.\nVideo as Medium\nVideo is an electronic signal that can be manipulated, distorted, amplified, and transformed. For many video artists, an interest in video for these inherent qualities was akin to an abstract painter's interest in oils, brushes, shapes, and structure. Some artists produced works that played with the medium itself and as technologies have improved, the opportunities in using video for its material qualities have also vastly evolved. A prominent example in this category is artist Peer Bode, who has been enacting this type of mechanical collaboration since the '70s. In his Flute with Shift, (1979) we see an image on screen of a man playing the flute, which shifts in brightness according to the controlled analog synthesizer parameter of the live flute sounds. Video Free America Founder Skip Sweeney was known for installations that played with video feedback, abstract image processing, and synthesis. Bill Viola has always regularly tweaked video to achieve multi-layered effects in ways that visually collude with his investigations into spirituality, humanity, the body's place within the context of space, experience and time, and other probes into our existence.\nThe early works of Paik and Vostell that presented televisions as sculptural elements laid the foundation for later 'video installation' works. Contemporary Video art shown in a gallery can be classified as either 'single-channel' (one screen) or 'installation' works (those that are designed specifically to be projected into an exhibition space, potentially with more than one image and including additional components such as props or sculpture.) Artists such as Gary Hill, Bill Viola, and Joan Jonas are considered pioneers of video installation as an art form, taking full advantage of the architectural features in a gallery, for example, to fully involve their work within the space. Again, the development of display technologies has had a huge impact on the kind of work being produced. US artist Peter Campus, for example, projected viewers' own images onto their shadows in his 1974 work Shadow Projection, while multimedia artist Tony Oursler started making his immersive environments featuring projections of faces onto sculptures in the early 1980s.\nVideo Recordings of Events and Performances\nVideo also became an invaluable tool for artists such as Paik, the Viennese Actionists, Robert Smithson, and Marina Abramovic to make a permanent record of their live art events. This type of Video art is more about preserving a piece for perpetuity than a work in its own right, though some pieces (such as Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty (1970)) are often installed and shown in galleries as artworks rather than mere documentation. Four of Abramovic's performances at the Galerie Mike Steiner in Berlin from 1975-76 can be found online. Each of the events made history and are written about widely, yet their impact surely may have been diffused had they not continued to exist in video form for future generations to witness as an important historical part of the performance genre. Similarly, with Vito Acconci's Sounding Board (1970) performance in which he lay naked on a pair of speakers to virtually feel the music pulsate through his body while a collaborator massaged him in accordance with the beats. What makes these pieces of Video art so important is that they reach not only audiences in the years in which they were spawned, but they continue to be seen by future generations on such mass-accessible means as YouTube and social media, remaining important remnants of the overall art canon.\nLater Developments - After Video Art\nNam June Paik's early prediction on the dominance of video has become, at least partially, true. Although Video art has by no means replaced the more traditional mediums in the contemporary art world, it has become an exhaustive field which certainly complements them.\nContemporary Video art practices continue to expand in both form and content, allowing artists to experiment with new ideas and new technologies. The growth of high definition digital video over the last decade, for example, has enabled artists to produce work of expanded clarity. The humorous mock-documentaries of American performance artist Alex Bag, complex animations of British Ed Atkins and French artist Laure Provoust's detailed projections are all made to an extremely high production value far removed from the grainy, scratchy videos made in the 1960s. This technology is now available through a wide proliferation of intuitive and DIY software programs easily adaptable across computers, tablets, cameras, smartphones and the Internet. This has opened the context of how and where art can be shown as well.\nToday's video artists build upon inspiration from early Video art pioneers yet bring an enhanced knowledge of the constantly transforming technology to the table. Some examples are more true to video's origin much like the large, highly atmospheric projections of French artist Phillippe Parreno, or the ever more elaborate, architecturally-scaled video installations of Swiss Pipilotti Rist - both of whom use modern projectors and special effects to push the medium in ever more visually impressive and conceptually complex directions. One can find hints of Warhol's love of real time footage with doses of the video collagist in Christian Marclay's The Clock (2010), which ran for 24 hours and featured a mash up of images of clocks from iconic movie scenes. Additionally, Andrew Thomas Huang gained worldwide attention in 2007 with his video Doll Face; a critique on the influence television has on our self-image. Ryan Trecartin is noted for bringing a gay male angle to Video art by interjecting oftentimes garishly presented stereotypes into otherwise normative images and video clips.\nSome video artists tote signs of the post-millennial age with cutting edge video works. Revolutionary post-Internet artist, Cory Archangel's most famous piece Super Mario Clouds (2002) featured hacked, pixelated images of the popular video game sailing across blue skies on a website, which can still be seen on YouTube. Although the original launch of the piece took place in a gallery on various screens of different heights and sizes to create a fully immersive experience, the online video is now all that remains. Incredibly smart British artist Hannah Black usually sources online imagery by typing in search terms to find pieces that will eventually inform her themed collage videos. In her piece My Bodies (2014), she Googled \"CEO\" and \"executive\" to compile images of white men upon which she overlaid audio tracks of black recording artists such as Rihanna. As more video artists look to the Internet as a platform, and the current methodology continues to morph toward the use of webcams, virtual reality, and interactive animation, the field that has consistently burgeoned like a self-feeding mushroom, will no doubt continue to expound upon itself at a rapid pace.\n- Nam June Paik worked with a variety of media and is considered to be the first video artist. Paik is credited with coining the term \"information superhighway\" and was known for making robots out of television sets.\n- Matthew Barney creates films based on performance and body art, most notably in his Drawing Restraint series and the five-film Cremaster Cycle.\n- Austrian performance artist VALIE EXPORT is known for her guerilla performance pieces, as well as her video and sculptural work, much of which focuses on the female body and feminist ideals.\n- Bruce Nauman is a contemporary American artist concerned with language, process, manipulation, and the registers of irony. His work includes performance, video, installation, neon sculpture, and other materials.\n- John Baldessari, born in 1931, is an American conceptual artist. He often combines image and languages in his art. His early works were canvas paintings that were empty except for painted statements derived from contemporary art theory. His juxtaposition of image and text is reminiscent of Rene Magritte's surrealist paintings.\n- Joan Jonas is a pioneer of video and performance art often dealing with identity and feminist topics.\n- Rosler's work with performance, video, and photography has garnered wide attention in the postmodern era for its feminist connotations, addressing body image issues and domesticity. Rosler's work has also explored the imagery of war, from Vietnam to Iraq.\n- Andy Warhol was an American Pop artist best known for his prints and paintings of consumer goods, celebrities, and photographed disasters. One of the most famous and influential artists of the 1960s, he pioneered compositions and techniques that emphasized repetition and the mechanization of art.\n- Jack Goldstein was a Canadian born, California-based performance and conceptual artist turned painter in the 1980s art boom. During the 1970s, he became one of the linchpins of the Pictures Generation.\nDo Not Miss\n- British artists of the 1950s were the first to make popular culture the dominant subject of their art, and this idea became an international phenomenon in the 1960s. But the Pop art movement is most associated with New York, and artists such as Andy Warhol, who broke with the private concerns of the Abstract Expressionists, and turned to themes which touched on public life and mass society.\n- The Pictures Generation was a loosely knit group of artists working in photography, and video who utilized appropriation and montage to reveal the constructed nature of images.\n- In the digital age, artists would grasp its progressive technologies for their own creative output including television, computers, a/v software, and the internet. Beginning in the 1960s, artists and innovators have expanded art into new, and sometimes virtual, worlds.\nContent compiled and written by The Art Story Contributors\nEdited and published by The Art Story Contributors\nContent compiled and written by The Art Story Contributors\nEdited and published by The Art Story Contributors\nFirst published on 21 Aug 2017.

{"question":"As a veterinarian, I'm curious about how drug resistance mechanisms compare between MDR1 mutations in dogs and MDM2 regulation in cancer cells - what are the key differences in how these affect drug responses?","answer":"The key difference lies in their mechanisms and effects. The MDR1 mutation in dogs affects P-glycoprotein, a drug transport pump that normally limits drug absorption and distribution, particularly to the brain. When mutated, it makes dogs unable to properly limit drug absorption and elimination, leading to severe adverse reactions to normal doses of certain drugs. In contrast, MDM2 in cancer cells acts through a different mechanism - it regulates p53 protein by binding to it, inhibiting its transcriptional activity, promoting its nuclear export, and causing its rapid degradation. This MDM2 regulation affects how cancer cells respond to chemotherapy, since functional p53 is needed for efficient induction of apoptosis in response to platinum-based drugs.","context":["Multi-drug Resistance 1 (MDR1) is a genetic mutation found in many of the herding breeds, some sighthound breeds, and many mixed breed dogs. The MDR1 gene is responsible for production of a protein called P-glycoprotein. The P-glycoprotein molecule is a drug transport pump that plays an important role in limiting drug absorption and distribution (particularly to the brain) and enhancing the excretion/elimination of many drugs used in dogs.\nSome dogs, particularly herding breeds or mixed-breed dogs with herding breed ancestry, have a mutation in the MDR1 gene that makes them defective in their ability to limit the absorption and distribution of many drugs. These dogs are also slower to eliminate drugs from the body that are transported by P-glycoprotein. As a result, dogs with the MDR1-mutation may have severe adverse reactions to some common drugs, so it is important to test your dog and share your results with your veterinarian so they can provide your dog with for the best possible care.\nCan Collie crosses or other herding breed crosses carry the mutant MDR1 gene and have an adverse reaction to a normal dose of some drugs?\nYes, it is less likely in a mixed breed, but still possible. For example, the mutant gene was found in a Saint Bernard mix that had an adverse drug reaction. The veterinarian did note that each eye was a different colour, like some Australian Shepherds.\nHow old must a dog be before it can be tested?\nJust like breed testing, a puppy can be tested as soon as it is weaned from its mother. We recommend waiting until the puppy is weaned, because the sample is collected from inside the dog's mouth, and milk can contain a cells from the mother. Therefore, it is possible that the puppy's sample could contain enough of the mother's DNA to generate a false result.\nCan mixed-breed dogs have the MDR1 mutation?\nYES! Even if we don't find a pedigree herding or sighthound breed in the last three generations of your dog's family tree, doesn't mean he or she doesn't have one further back in their ancestry. Therefore, even mixed-breed dogs should be tested for the MDR1 mutation¬¬-in particular before receiving therapies for some common parasitic diseases, such as Demodectic mange. The results of this test can give owners with mixed-breed ancestry important information to share with their veterinarian or better yet…peace of mind.\nWhat heartworm prevention products can I use if my dog has the MDR1 mutation?\nAlways consult with your veterinarian before administering any drugs to your dog. Fortunately, the doses of ivermectin, selamectin, milbemycin and moxidectin in the FDA approved heartworm prevention preparations are low enough to be used safely even in dogs that have two copies of the MDR1 mutation. It is only when these drugs are administered at high doses that dogs with the mutation will develop signs of toxicity. Attempting to use formulations of these drugs approved for use in large animals will increase the risk of overdosing the dog and causing severe toxicity, because it is difficult to accurately measure the small doses needed for dogs using these large animal formulations.\nThe discovery of the mutation of the multi-drug resistant gene (MDR1) and its effects on multidrug sensitivity in dogs was made by Washington State University. It is a patent-protected diagnostic test offered by Washington State University that has been licensed to Wisdom Health for use in the WISDOM PANEL tests.","|Reles, Angela : MOLECULAR GENETIC ALTERATIONS IN OVARIAN CANCER The Role of the p53 Tumor Suppressor Gene and the mdm2 Oncogene |\nBackground: The p53 tumor suppressor gene, the ’guardian of the genome‘ (Lane, 1992), is involved in key responses to genotoxic stress and plays a central role in the maintenance of genomic stability. Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage is associated with a rapid increase in its level and with an increased ability of p53 to bind DNA and mediate transcriptional activation. Upon low or repairable levels of DNA damage, p53 mediates delay or arrest of replication to give the cell the opportunity to repair the damage before its fixation and propagation. Upon high or irreparable DNA damage, p53 promotes apoptosis. Mutations of the gene which inactivate some or all of p53´s functions provide a selective advantage for clonal expansion of neoplastic cells.\nFunctional p53 must be tightly regulated and the mdm2 (murine double minute 2) gene plays an important role in this regulation. The transcription of the mdm2 oncogene is induced by the p53 gene after DNA damage. The MDM2 protein then binds to p53 and downregulates it in an autoregulatory feedback loop. MDM2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity, promotes nuclear export to the cytoplasm and rapid degradation of the p53 protein. It, therefore, plays a crucial role as a regulator of p53 in early embryonic development and for recovery of cellular proliferation after repair of DNA damage.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and type of p53 and mdm2 alterations in ovarian cancer and to correlate the results with clinico-pathological variables, response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome of the patients.\nMethods: 178 cases of primary epithelial ovarian cancer, snap frozen and stored at -80°C, were used in this study. Mutations of the entire p53 coding sequence (exons 2-11) were analyzed by SSCP (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism) and DNA-sequencing. p53 protein expression was analyzed immunohistochemically with the monoclonal Ab DO7 in frozen tissue sections. p53 was considered to be overex-pressed, if more than 10% of the nuclei in the sections showed immunostaining. Clinical follow-up of the ovarian cancer patients was documented up to 12 years. In the total cohort, the median time of follow-up was 31 months and among the survivors, 52 months. 74 patients who received Cis- or Carboplatin in combination with Cyclophos-phamide were evaluated for platinum-sensitivity.\nAnalysis of the mdm2 gene for alternative splicing was performed by using PCR amplification of full length mdm2 cDNAs. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then the cDNA was amplified by nested PCR. Cases with RT-PCR products other than the full length mdm2 cDNA were cloned into a pCR 2.1 vector and\n151sequenced or the PCR products were directly sequenced. p53 and mdm2 splice variant cDNAs were cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector. p53 and MDM2 full length and mdm2 splice variant proteins were expressed in vitro by transient transfection of the pcDNA3 constructs into HeLa-cells. The HeLa cells had been previously infected with the vTF7-3 virus, a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase.\nResults: p53 mutations were seen in 56% (99/178) of the ovarian cancer cases of which 72% were missense mutations. p53 overexpression (> 10% positively stained nuclei) was seen in 62% (110/178) of cases. 62% of the p53 mutations were located in the evolutionary highly conserved domains of the gene. p53 mutations were significantly correlated with shortened time to progression (p=0.028) and poor overall survival of the patients (p=0.015). Comparing clinical outcome of patients with mutations in highly conserved domains with those who had either wildtype p53 or a mutation in a nonconserved domain, the difference in time to progression (p=0.007) and overall survival was even more obvious (p=0.005). Furthermore, time to progression and overall survival were seen to be shorter in patients with p53 overexpression as compared to normal p53 expression, but the results only reached marginal statistical significance (p=0.073, p=0.058). Patients with p53 overexpression (p=0.001) or p53 missense mutations (p=0.008) were significantly more often platinum resistant than patients without p53 alterations. Overall, the most favorable prognosis in terms of overall survival was seen in patients who had wildtype p53 sequence and normal p53 expression, as opposed to those who had either one or both alterations of the p53 gene and protein (p=0.007).\nBesides p53 mutations 45 sequence alterations were identified and considered polymorphisms. The codon 72 arginineproline polymor-phism was identified in 5% (9/178) of the cases. Furthermore, alterations were found at codon 36 (exon 4), codon 213 (exon 6), codon 224 (exon 6), and codon 231 (exon 7). The 16 basepair repeat polymorphism of intron 3 was identified in 14% (24/178) of the cases. Three novel intron alterations were identified by sequencing the introns 6 and 10. A gc nucleotide exchange at position 13964 in intron 6 was found in two cases. An at polymorphism was found at nucleotide 17708 of intron 10 in a frequency of 1.1% and a ct polymorphism at nucleotide 18550 of intron 10 in a frequency of 2.3%. Both intron 10 polymorphisms were confirmed in normal tissue of the patients. Most of the cases (7/8) with intron 6 or intron 10 polymorphisms showed p53 over-expression.\nThe mdm2 gene was neither amplified nor overexpressed in any of the ovarian cancer cases. An mRNA transcript of 7.4 kb, 5.5 kb and 2.8 kb was seen at normal levels in all ovarian carcinomas. However, mdm2 alternative or aberrant splicing was\n152seen in 66/92 (72%) of the ovarian carcinomas, 7/9 (78%) of borderline tumors, 5/6 (83%) of benign ovarian cystadenomas and 11/20 (55%) of the normal ovarian tissues. A total of 30 splice variant sequences were identified. 67% of these had a partial and 7% a complete loss of the p53 binding site. 28/30 splice variants do not splice at exon/intron boundaries but use cryptic splice sites within exons and were therefore considered aberrant splice variants.\nA 654 bp splice variant (mdm2-b) was expressed in 41% of ovarian carcinomas, but only in 1/9 (11%) borderline tumors, none of the benign cystadenomas, and 1/20 (5%) normal ovaries. This splice variant splices out exon 4-11, including 90% (81 of 90 amino acids) of the 3‘end of the p53 binding domain as well as the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear export signal (NES). Expression of this splice variant in ovarian carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor grade of differentiation (p=0.004), residual tumor after surgery (p=0.004), and high S-phase fraction (p=0.016) of ovarian carcinoma. Presence of mdm2-b was furthermore correlated with p53 protein overexpression (p=0.018). A small splice variant of only 221 bp, which has lost most of the functional mdm2 domains was present in only 16% of the ovarian carcinomas but in 5/9 (56%) of borderline tumors, 1/6 of the cystadenomas, and interestingly also in 8/20 (40%) of the normal ovarian tissues. The 221 bp splice variant was correlated with early stage of ovarian cancer (FIGO I and II) and longer overall survival (p=0.048).\nThe absence of the full length mdm2 transcript respectively, the presence of mdm2 splice variants in general were correlated with a higher proportion of ovarian carcinomas, which were resistant or refractory against a platinum-based chemotherapy but were not correlated with survival.\nDepending on the diagnosis for which the patient underwent surgery, different mdm2 RNA splicing patterns were seen in normal ovarian tissue. The presence of splice variants in the unaffected normal ovary was significantly correlated with the diagnosis of gynecological cancer, either in the contralateral ovary or in the uterine cervix or endometrium (p=0.017).\nConclusions: p53 mutations are present in more than 50% of epithelial ovarian carcinomas and are associated with early progression and shortened overall survival. Mutations in evolutionary conserved domains correlate with significantly shorter survival, compared to mutations in nonconserved regions and p53 wildtype sequence. p53 protein overexpression reached only marginal statistical significance as a predictor of clinical outcome. With multivariable analysis however, p53 alterations were not an independent prognostic factor. Evaluation of adjuvant treatment showed that p53 overexpression as well as p53 missense mutations were correlated with resistance to\n153platinum-based chemotherapy. This provides further clinical evidence that the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells for Cis- or Carboplatin depends on the efficient induction of apoptosis mediated by a functional p53 protein.\nmdm2, which inhibits p53‘s transcriptional activity and downregulates it in an autoregulatory feedback-loop by promoting nuclear export and rapid degradation of the protein, was found to be frequently altered in ovarian carcinomas. mdm2 alternative and aberrant splicing was found in the majority of ovarian carcinomas and borderline tumors, but also in cystadenomas and normal ovarian tissue. A distinct difference in patterns of splice variants was notable in comparing benign and malignant tissues. While the mdm2-b splice variant was found in nearly 50% of the ovarian carcinomas and was associated with more advanced and histologically more aggressive tumors, smaller size variants were typically seen in early stage ovarian carcinomas and benign tissues.\nThe mdm2 splice variants mostly lack part, or all of the p53 binding sequence. mdm2 alterations appear to stabilize p53 protein and may cause p53 accumulation in the absence of p53 mutation. If these results are corroborated by other investigators, alterations of mdm2 may be considered to be an important step in carcinogenesis and may have important implications for the response to chemotherapy and clinical course of ovarian carcinomas.\nSince most of the mdm2 splice variants lack various functional domains of the gene, such as the p53 binding site and the nuclear localization signal, the purpose of the alternative splicing remains unclear. But the fact that splicing is found in the majority of ovarian carcinomas and splice variants of identical sequence occur throughout this cancer cohort and in benign tissues, suggests that these splice variants have distinct, as yet unknown functions and are not simply a by-product of RNA processing.\n© Die inhaltliche Zusammenstellung und Aufmachung dieser Publikation sowie die elektronische Verarbeitung sind urheberrechtlich geschützt.

{"question":"Can you compare the recommended strategies for combating sleepiness between sugar-based and caffeine-based solutions?","answer":"For combating sleepiness, sugar-based solutions like soft drinks with high sugar but little caffeine are not recommended as they can actually worsen sleepiness. Instead, the more effective strategy is to consume drinks containing useful amounts of caffeine, and this can be combined with a short nap for better results. Caffeine works as a central nervous system stimulant to restore mental alertness, though its use should be occasional rather than regular to prevent developing tolerance. When used regularly, individuals need increasingly more caffeine to produce the same alertness effects due to the body's adaptation through increased adenosine receptors.","context":["Feeling sleepy? Don't have a high sugar, low caffeine drink -- it could make things worse\nResearch news from Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental\nAn hour after consuming a high sugar, low caffeine drink you will tend to have slower reactions and experience more lapses in concentration than if you had simply drunk a decaffeinated, nil carbohydrate drink.\nThis was the finding of research performed at the University of Loughborough and published in this month's Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental.\nTen healthy adults had volunteered to restrict their sleep to 5 hours on the day before participating in the trial.

Whether it is in coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate or in tablet form, caffeine is easily accessed by people of all ages in virtually every culture. Caffeine belongs to the group of medicines called central nervous system stimulants. It is used to help restore mental alertness when unusual tiredness or weakness or drowsiness occurs. Caffeine is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive substance, but unlike most other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions.\nCaffeine’s use as an alertness aid should be only occasional. It can be used to combat sleepiness as in the case of those who work graveyard shifts or simply as a stimulant to wake one up in the morning, quick-starting the metabolism and helping one focus on the tasks at hand.\nCaffeine can also be used as a medication to help treat other conditions. When combined with other drugs, it can be used to combat cluster headaches and intense migraines. It can also be combined with pain-relieving medications to help increase the effectiveness up to 40% and increase their absorbency. In premature infants, caffeine in monitored doses can help with breathing problems and in combination with a nutrition and exercise program, can help to curb one’s appetite and reduce hunger. There are many causes to use caffeine but the most widespread use of the drug is as a stimulant to help fight fatigue and sleepiness, aiding one in the morning and speeding up one’s metabolism.\nConsumption of caffeine does not eliminate the need for sleep: it only temporarily reduces the sensation of being tired and the amount of caffeine needed to produce effects varies from person to person and those who regularly use caffeine as a stimulant need increasingly more caffeine to produce the same effects. This is because caffeine is an antagonist for adenosine, a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Individuals who regularly consume caffeine adapt to the continual presence of caffeine in the system by increasing the number of adenosine receptors, thus increasing the tolerance to caffeine.\nCaffeine is proven to improve both mental and physical performance. Mentally, caffeine stimulates the brain and helps one to focus and concentrate, increasing work productivity and learning capacity. It can also increase the capacity for physical performance, enabling athletes to increase their speed or energy during physical activity.\nHowever the stimulant effects of caffeine are not without side-effects. Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, they may be more likely to occur if caffeine is taken in large doses or more often than recommended. Common side effects of caffeine intake include dizziness, an increased heartbeat, dry mouth, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness, insomnia, or unusual tiredness as the caffeine wears away. Caffeine can also act as a diuretic causing frequent urination which can also lead to a feeling of being more thirsty than usual. Although small amounts of caffeine can increase concentration and help one to focus and increase productivity, caffeine in large or concentrated doses can also have the effects of jitteriness, shakes, tremors, irritability and nervousness.\nCaffeine has a half-life of six hours meaning that only after six hours, only half of the initial dose of caffeine remains in the system. During this time, many people experience headaches as the blood vessels in the head begin to expand as the caffeine wears off. This headache, well known among coffee drinkers, usually lasts from one to five days, and can be alleviated with analgesics such as aspirin. It is also alleviated with simply taking more caffeine. Reduced catecholamine activity may cause feelings of fatigue and drowsiness. A reduction in serotonin levels when caffeine use is stopped can cause anxiety, irritability, inability to concentrate and diminished motivation to initiate or to complete daily tasks. Tremors and shakiness are also most apparent during this stage and side effects such as dry mouth and a sudden appetite often accompany caffeine withdrawal. Regular caffeine consumption reduces sensitivity to caffeine.\nTypically, caffeine is consumed without intention. A coffee in the morning, an ice tea for lunch, soda pop in the afternoon with some chocolate can be common ways to consume caffeine on a daily basis without giving second thoughts to the side-effects it may have on one’s health. Caffeine in energy drinks is often mixed with alcoholic drinks allowing party-goers to caffinate themselves and stay up late into the night without any tiredness or fatigue. Children many times consume large doses of caffeine through soda and combined with the high sugar levels in these drinks, have sudden rushes of energy and “highs.” These can result in moodiness and irritability during the caffeine and sugar withdrawal, drawing criticism from parents who are against vending machines at schools that sell soda. But caffeine is relatively mild as a stimulant and as long as it is taken in moderation with respect to its inherent side-effects and avoiding high doses in short periods of time, caffeine can be beneficial for increasing one’s alertness and helping mental and physical performance.\nBealer, Bonnie K., and Bennett Alan Weinberg.

{"question":"Looking back at historical developments in programming, how have C pointers aided in array processing, and how has their computational power usage evolved compared to modern crypto technologies?","answer":"Historically, C pointers revolutionized array processing by allowing direct manipulation of memory elements - array names themselves are pointers to their first elements, and pointer arithmetic enables easy access to subsequent elements since arrays are contiguously stored in memory. This pointer-based approach made array operations more efficient. In contrast, modern computational technologies like crypto-assets have proven to be highly energy-intensive - their power usage has grown dramatically from 2018 to 2022, with current global electricity consumption reaching 120-240 billion kilowatt-hours yearly, making it comparable to the total electricity usage of all conventional data centers worldwide.","context":["In the previous post we learnt what pointers are, their properties, and how to use them. However, most likely this didn’t help understand why pointers are so useful or why we even need them at all. Today we’re going to take care of that.\nPointers are most valuable when combined with other functionalities of the C language. Let’s start by taking a look at how they work with arrays.\nWorking with arrays using pointers\nIn the previous chapter we saw that if we have a pointer to int and we increment it, now the pointer contains the address of the next int, and the same happened with pointers to char. Let’s see a short example to refresh our memory:\nThe program above declares two variables (an int and a char) and a pointer to each of them. Integer variables take up two bytes in memory, so incrementing a pointer to int makes it point to an address two bytes higher. Similarly, character variables only take up one byte and incrementing a pointer to char makes it point to an address one byte higher:\nHowever, note that in this particular example it isn’t very useful to increment these pointers. Showing a diagram of what’s in the computer’s memory will help understand why:\nIn this case the variables and pointers are arranged in memory in the order they were defined in the program. Remember that a pointer is also a variable and it also takes up two bytes in memory. The reason why pointer arithmetic isn’t useful in this scenario is that incrementing the pointer doesn’t make it point to the correct type of data. See this:\nOn the left diagram we see what happens when we increment pi:\n- pi + 1 doesn’t point to an integer, but to a pointer to integer\n- pi + 2 points to a char instead of an integer\n- pi + 3 points to the high byte of a pointer to integer\n- pi + 4 points to an unused memory address\nThe same goes for pc on the right:\n- pc + 1 points to the low byte of a pointer to integer\n- pc + 2 points to the high byte of a pointer to integer\n- pc + 3 points to an unused memory address\nPointers didn’t help much in this case.\nHowever, consider what happens when we’re working with an array. All the elements in an array are perfectly aligned in memory one after the other. This is when things get interesting: if we have an array of integers called a, and a pointer p to the element a[i], then p+1 will certainly point to the next element in the array, a[i+1].\nLet’s see an example. The program below defines an array a that contains three integers, and p is a pointer to int. We can use p to access all the elements in the array:\nIn this case the memory is arranged as in the diagram below. It’s easy to see that incrementing the pointer will allow us to easily access each of the elements in the array:\nCompile and run the program to confirm that it works as expected:\nWe can optimize this program a bit. In the example we used the i variable to iterate inside the for loop, but we can simplify and use the pointer as the loop variable instead:\nThis version will do exactly the same as the previous one (compile and run it to confirm), but using one less variable. At the beginning it’s normal to feel that pointers make the program a bit more difficult to follow, but when we get used to working with pointers they often feel more natural and are easier to use.\nWe can still optimize the previous program a bit more, because…\nArray names are actually pointers\nIn the program POINT3.C we referred to the address of the first element of the array a like this:\nHowever, we could also have written the same thing like this:\nThat’s not a typo. That’s just the name of the array a. This is because in C, the name of an array is always a pointer to its first element. Let’s confirm this with another example. The program below should print the same value for both &a and a:\nSo, if a is a pointer to a then a+1 will be a pointer to a, or, in other words, is equivalent to &a. Based on this it follows that in general, a+i is exactly the same thing as &a[i] regardless of the type of the array a.\nMaybe you can see already how we can use this to make C functions even more powerful…\nUsing pointers in function declarations\nWe learnt some time ago that we can’t use an array as a function parameter. However, we can achieve the same thing by passing a pointer to an array. Similarly, we can use pointers to implement functions that return more than one parameter and also use them to modify local variables that belong to other functions.\nLet’s see how these techniques work.\nPassing pointers as function arguments\nUsing pointers as function arguments works just like passing any other value. We just need to declare the type of the argument so the compiler knows we’re passing a pointer and not something else. For example, the program below defines a function called cleari() that takes a pointer to an integer and clears the value pointed to:\nThis program follows a very simple flow:\n- When main() starts the variable i has some memory address already assigned, but its content is still undefined (random) because the program hasn’t initialized it. At this point the pointer p doesn’t even exist yet.\n- main() calls cleari() and passes it the address of variable i. Inside cleari() the pointer p is created and assigned the address of i.\n- cleari() sets the integer value pointed to by p to 0.\n- cleari() ends and now main()‘s i variable is set to 0.\nNotice what happened here: inside the cleari() function main()‘s local variable i was reset to 0. We already know that a function’s local variables can’t be accessed by other functions. However, using pointers allows us to bypass this restriction and perform operations with memory addresses that belong to other parts of the program.\nUsing pointers to implement functions that return more than one value\nWe’ve just seen that functions accept pointers as parameters and that in this way we can modify variables that belong to other functions. We can use this technique to our advantage in order to implement functions that return more than one value.\nAs an example, consider the addsub() function below. It takes two integer parameters and returns both their addition and their substraction:\nThis addsub() function takes four arguments. The first two are the two integer values that we want to add and substract. The other two (s and d) are pointers to integer that the function will use to store the results. Notice that in this case we’re declaring the return type of the function as VOID to indicate that it doesn’t return any value. Instead, the results are stored directly in the addresses pointed by s and d.\nTo use this function we just need to pass it the two integer numbers to add/substract and the addresses of two integer variables to store the results. For example, to add and substract the numbers 100 and 700 and store the results in the variables sum and dif we would call it like this:\naddsub(1000, 700, &sum, &dif);\nAfter this function call the variable sum will contain 1700 and dif will contain 300.\nImplementing functions that work with arrays\nWe can’t pass an array as a parameter to a function, but we can pass a pointer to any element in it and use pointer arithmetic to access each of the elements in turn. Consider the nprint() function below:\nnprint() takes two arguments: a pointer to an integer (p) and an integer number (n). It then prints n integer numbers on the screen starting from the one pointed by p. For example, if we have an integer array a that contains 5 elements we can print all of them by just calling nprint(a, 5) as in the program below:\nIn this simple way we can pass a whole array as an argument and access its elements from inside a function. Compile and run the program to confirm that it works as expected:\nActually, we can use the same function to print part of the array by passing it the address of some element in the middle and the number of elements to print from there. For example, to print the three elements in the middle of the array:\nNote that in the POINT6.C program we passed nprint() the name of the array a. We could also have called it passing the address of the first element: nprint(&a, 5). In practice they’re both the same, though each notation has its nuance:\n- a refers to the start address of the array as a whole.\n- &a refers to the address of an element in the array, in this case the first one.\nThe compiler doesn’t care which notation you use. Feel free to write it in whichever way makes you feel more comfortable.\nIn this chapter we’ve learnt how to use pointer arithmetic to access each of the elements of an array and we’be seen that array names are actually pointers to the first element in the array. We’ve also seen how to pass pointers as arguments to functions and how to use this to expand the capabilities of C functions.\nIn the next post\nNow that we’ve learnt about pointers and their relationship with arrays, next we’ll take a deeper look at strings in C.\nThis series of articles is supported by your donations.

Among the President’s commitments are: protecting communities from pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity grid by 2035, and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, we must ensure that emerging technologies contribute to a net-zero, clean energy future. The use of digital assets based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) is expanding. Digital assets are a form of value, represented digitally. As an emerging technological innovation, digital assets have provided some benefits and value for some residents and businesses in the United States, and have the potential for future benefits with emerging uses.\nCrypto-assets are digital assets that are implemented using cryptographic techniques. Crypto-assets can require considerable amounts of electricity usage, which can result in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts to communities living near mining facilities. Depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve U.S. climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\nIn March, in Executive Order 14067 on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets, President Biden made clear that the responsible development of digital assets includes reducing negative climate impacts and environmental pollution. The Executive Order directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other federal agencies, to produce a report on the climate and energy implications of crypto-assets in the United States. OSTP assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts to assess and extend existing studies with new analysis, based on peer-reviewed studies and the best available data.\nToday, OSTP published its report, examining the challenges and opportunities of crypto-assets for the United States’ clean energy and climate change goals, and providing a set of recommendations to further study and track impacts of the sector, develop potential performance standards, and provide tools and resources to reduce negative impacts. This report’s assessment and recommendations align with federal actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare, grow a clean energy economy with good-paying jobs, and improve environmental justice.\nCrypto-Assets Can Be Energy-Intensive, and the United States Has a Major Crypto-Asset Sector\nFrom 2018 to 2022, annualized electricity usage from global crypto-assets grew rapidly, with estimates of electricity usage doubling to quadrupling. As of August 2022, published estimates of the total global electricity usage for crypto-assets are between 120 and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, a range that exceeds the total annual electricity usage of many individual countries, such as Argentina or Australia. This is equivalent to 0.4% to 0.9% of annual global electricity usage, and is comparable to the annual electricity usage of all conventional data centers in the world.\nNearly all crypto-asset electricity usage is driven by consensus mechanisms: the DLT used to mine and verify crypto-assets. The dominant consensus mechanism is called Proof of Work (PoW), which is used by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin and Ether combined represent more than 60% of total crypto-asset market capitalization. The PoW mechanism is designed to require more computing power as more entities attempt to validate transactions for coin rewards, and this feature helps disincentivize malicious actors from attacking the network. As of August 2022, Bitcoin is estimated to account for 60% to 77% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage, and Ethereum is estimated to account for 20% to 39%.\nThe energy efficiency of mining equipment has been increasing, but electricity usage continues to rise. Other less energy-intensive crypto-asset ledger technologies exist, with different attributes and uses. Switching to alternative crypto-asset technologies such as Proof of Stake could dramatically reduce overall power usage to less than 1% of today’s levels.\nThe United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage. This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States. Crypto-asset mining is also highly mobile. The United States currently hosts the world’s largest Bitcoin mining industry, totaling more than 38% of global Bitcoin activity, up from 3.5% in 2020. Despite the potential for rapid growth, future electricity demand from crypto-asset operations is uncertain, demonstrating the need for better data to understand and monitor electricity usage from crypto-assets.\nCrypto-Assets Can Have Significant Environmental Impacts\nGlobal electricity generation for the crypto-assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. Crypto-asset activity in the United States is estimated to result in approximately 25 to 50 Mt CO2/y, which is 0.4% to 0.8% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This range of emissions is similar to emissions from diesel fuel used in railroads in the United States.\nBesides purchased grid electricity, crypto-asset mining operations can also cause local noise and water impacts, electronic waste, air and other pollution from any direct usage of fossil-fired electricity, and additional air, water, and waste impacts associated with all grid electricity usage. These local impacts can exacerbate environmental justice issues for neighboring communities, which are often already burdened with other pollutants, heat, traffic, or noise. The growth of energy-intensive crypto-asset technologies, when not directly using clean electricity, could hinder the ability of the United States to achieve its National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Broader adoption of crypto-assets, and the potential introduction of new types of digital assets require action by the federal government to encourage and ensure responsible development. This includes minimizing negative impacts on local communities, significantly reducing energy intensity, and powering with clean electricity.\nDistributed Ledger Technologies May Help with Climate Monitoring or Mitigation\nDLT may have a role to play in enhancing market infrastructure for a range of environmental markets like carbon credit markets, though other solutions might work as well or better. The potential benefits of DLT would need to outweigh the additional emissions and other environmental externalities that result from operations to merit broader use, relative to the markets or mechanisms that DLT displaces. Use cases are still emerging, and like all emerging technologies, there are potential positive and negative use cases yet to be imagined. Responsible development of this technology would encourage innovation in DLT applications while reducing energy intensity and minimizing environmental damages.\nKey Recommendations of the Report\nTo help the United States meet its climate objectives, crypto-asset policy during the transition to clean energy should be focused on several objectives: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid operations that will increase the cost of electricity to consumers, avoid operations that reduce the reliability of electric grids, and avoid negative impacts to equity, communities, and the local environment.\nTo ensure the responsible development of digital assets, recommendations include the following actions for consideration:\n- Minimize greenhouse gas emissions, environmental justice impacts, and other local impacts from crypto-assets: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies. These should include standards for very low energy intensities, low water usage, low noise generation, clean energy usage by operators, and standards that strengthen over time for additional carbon-free generation to match or exceed the additional electricity load of these facilities. Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. DOE and EPA should provide technical assistance to state public utility commissions, environmental protection agencies, and the crypto-asset industry to build capacity to minimize emissions, noise, water impacts, and negative economic impacts of crypto-asset mining; and to mitigate environmental injustices to overburdened communities.\n- Ensure energy reliability: DOE, in coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and its regional entities, should conduct reliability assessments of current and projected crypto-asset mining operations on electricity system reliability and adequacy. If these reliability assessments find current or anticipated risks to the power system as a result crypto-asset mining, these entities should consider developing, updating, and enforcing reliability standards and emergency operations procedures to ensure system reliability and adequacy under the growth of crypto-asset mining.\n- Obtain data to understand, monitor, and mitigate impacts: The Energy Information Administration and other federal agencies should consider collecting and analyzing information from crypto-asset miners and electric utilities in a privacy-preserving manner to enable evidence-based decisions on the energy and climate implications of crypto-assets. Data should include mining energy usage and fuel mix, power purchase agreements, environmental justice implications, and demand response participation. OSTP could establish a National Science and Technology Council subcommittee to coordinate with other relevant agencies to assess the energy use of major crypto-assets.\n- Advance energy efficiency standards: The Administration should consider working with Congress to enable DOE and encourage other federal regulators to promulgate and regularly update energy conservation standards for crypto-asset mining equipment, blockchains, and other operations.\n- Encourage transparency and improvements in environmental performance: Crypto-asset industry associations, including mining firms and equipment manufacturers, should be encouraged to publicly report crypto-asset mining locations, annual electricity usage, greenhouse gas emissions using existing protocols, and electronic waste recycling performance.\n- Further research to improve understanding and innovation: For improved analytical capabilities that can enhance the accuracy of electricity usage estimates and sustainability, the National Science Foundation, DOE, EPA and other relevant agencies could promote and support research and development priorities that improve the environmental sustainability of digital assets, including crypto-asset impact modeling, assessment of environmental justice impacts, and understanding beneficial uses for grid management and environmental mitigation. Research and development priorities should emphasize innovations in next-generation digital asset technologies that advance U.S. goals in security, privacy, equity, and resilience, as well as U.S. climate goals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9999ac13-0a8c-45d5-86d1-81a55850c84a>","<urn:uuid:c2b3e9e1-0ef3-465d-9a23-92fdbe2309a6>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do genetic circuits in living cells perform logic operations similar to computers?","answer":"Genetic circuits use DNA modules based on plasmids (circular strings of DNA) inserted into E. coli cells. These modules use recombinase enzymes as inputs to cut and rearrange promoter and terminator DNA sequences, turning them on or off. This controls gene transcription, similar to how electronic logic gates work with voltage inputs. For example, a genetic 'AND' gate transcribes the output gene only when two terminator sequences are neutralized by two recombinase enzyme inputs.","context":["– How to turn living cells into computers (Nature, Feb 13, 2013):\nGenetic system performs logic operations and stores data in DNA.\nSynthetic biologists have developed DNA modules that perform logic operations in living cells. These ‘genetic circuits’ could be used to track key moments in a cell’s life or, at the flick of a chemical switch, change a cell’s fate, the researchers say. Their results are described this week in Nature Biotechnology1.\nSynthetic biology seeks to bring concepts from electronic engineering to cell biology, treating gene functions as components in a circuit. To that end, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge have devised a set of simple genetic modules that respond to inputs much like the Boolean logic gates used in computers.\n“These developments will more readily enable one to create programmable cells with decision-making capabilities for a variety of applications,” says James Collins, a synthetic biologist at Boston University in Massachusetts who was not involved in the study.\nCollins developed the genetic ‘toggle switch’ that helped to kick-start the field of synthetic biology more than a decade ago2. A wide range of computational circuits for cells have been developed since, including a simple counter that Collins and his team devised in 20093.\nBut “to make this a really rigorous engineering discipline, we need to move towards frameworks that allow you to program cells in a more scalable fashion,” says Timothy Lu, a synthetic biologist at MIT who led the latest research. “We wanted to show you can assemble a bunch of simple parts in a very easy fashion to give you many types of logical functions.”\nCircular logic Lu’s logic modules are based on plasmids, circular strings of DNA, that are inserted into Escherichia coli cells. He and his colleagues devised 16 plasmids — one for each of the binary logic functions allowable in computation. Each variant comprises promoter and terminator DNA sequences, which start or halt gene transcription, and an ‘output gene’ that encodes a green fluorescent protein.\nThe key to the system is the use of recombinase enzymes, which cut and rearrange promoter and terminator DNA sequences to turn them on or off. In other words, recombinase enzymes are the inputs that determine whether the output gene is transcribed.\nAn electronic ‘AND’ gate, for example, gives a positive output only when voltage is applied to both of its inputs. In the genetic version, the output gene is transcribed only when both terminator sequences between it and the promoter sequence are neutralized by two inputs in the form of recombinase enzymes.\nLu says that although recombinases have been used similarly in the past — to write data into a DNA memory, for example — the latest work takes the idea a step further by making the DNA part of the computation itself. “If the DNA that you alter is a regulatory element, like a promoter sequence or a terminator, then that gives you the ability to control something inside the cell. And it’s that control that gives you the logic.”\nChristopher Voigt, a synthetic biologist also at MIT, calls the artificial modules “a very digital and permanent way to store information in DNA. The logic can store multiple experiences — for example, if the cells had encountered two environments and in what order.”\nVoigt says that there is another advantage to this system. “[The change] is permanent. After the cells die, the information can still be retrieved from the DNA.” Indeed, the researchers found that the altered plasmids are passed down through at least 90 cell generations — which would be important for a biologist wanting to record key moments in a cell’s ancestry.\nLu says that the approach could also be useful in biotechnology. Using simple forms of these addressable switches, manufacturers could grow cell cultures in which key genes are turned off until activated by a signal compound, permanently turning on production of a drug, for example, when the system is ready. Other switches could halt production, he says, when some threshold has been reached."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:501a62e8-8624-47b1-b32c-91d4e65bd7b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a plumbing inspector, I need to understand backflow prevention requirements. What are the main types of backflow prevention assemblies allowed, and what are the specific installation requirements for commercial buildings in New York State?","answer":"There are several types of backflow prevention assemblies: Air Gap (AG), Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP), Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly (DC), Pressure Vacuum Breaker (PVB), Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB), and Spill-Proof Pressure Vacuum Breaker (SVB). For commercial buildings in New York State, newly constructed buildings must install a Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) device. Existing commercial buildings require either an RPZ or Double Check Valve (DCV), based on the degree of hazard determined by health guidelines and water authority regulations. These devices must be installed above ground, though in some cases DCVs may be approved for underground installation. RPZs and vacuum breakers can never be installed in underground boxes or vaults as this could render them ineffective.","context":["A cross-connection is an actual or potential connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (drinking) water system and any source or system containing non-potable water or other substances. (Non-potable water is water that is unfit or unsafe to drink.)\nWater normally flows in one direction, from the public water system through your water service, to your plumbing fixtures. However, under certain conditions water can flow in the reverse direction – creating “backflow”. Backflow can contaminate the water supply and cause serious health issues. Backflow is the reverse flow of non-potable water or other substances through a cross-connection hazard into the piping of the consumer's potable water system or the public water system.\nThere are two conditions that can cause backflow:\n1. Backsiphonage – occurs due to a loss of pressure in the public water system providing your water. This can be caused by a rapid withdrawal of a high volume of water from the system due to a system shutdown, a break in the supply mains, or active fire protection. This reduction of pressure creates a vacuum in the piping which draws water back into your home from your irrigation lines, hot tub, or any plumbing fixture with a submerged inlet. These sources of water can contaminate your home’s drinking water and even enter the public system contaminating others’ potable water.\n2. Backpressure – is created when the source of pressure, such as a household pump, creates pressure greater than that supplied through the public water system. A pump from a landscape pond, pool, hot tub, hydronic heating system, fire sprinkler system or other system containing non-potable water, pumps that water into the potable water supply affecting your home, and even the entire public drinking water system.\nA backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical device that prevents water from \"backflowing\" into a potable water system (either the consumer’s internal system, the public water system, or both).\nYes, there are several different types of backflow prevention assemblies, which are listed below:\n• Air Gap (AG)\n• Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP)\n• Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly (DC)\n• Pressure Vacuum Breaker (PVB)\n• Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB)\n• Spill-Proof Pressure Vacuum Breaker (SVB)\nThe North Tahoe Public Utility District (District) recognizes all of these as acceptable forms of cross-connection control. However, each assembly must be approved prior to installation to ensure that the assembly is on the approved list and that the type of assembly used shall be based on the existing or potential degree of hazard.\nThe District can tell you which type of assembly is appropriate for your particular need. You may then choose the specific model from a list of approved assemblies available at the District office, or you can work with a Backflow Prevention Assembly General Tester or Cross-Connection Control Specialist to select a specific assembly.\nThe District maintains a list of currently approved testers, available on our website. Some of these testers are also Cross-Connection Control Specialists, which can be determined by speaking with each company.\nIn order to protect your family’s health and the public drinking water system, the State of California requires all water suppliers to maintain ongoing backflow prevention and cross-connection control programs so that your water is protected from hazards that originate on private property. The California Department of Public Health requires the District to eliminate cross-connections by maintaining these programs. The backflow prevention and cross-connection control program mandates the installation of backflow prevention assemblies by the consumer where the District determines they are needed, in accordance with Title 17 of California state law and District Water Ordinance 11.\nA plumber, fire sprinkler contractor, landscaper, Backflow Prevention Assembly General Tester, or anyone with plumbing expertise can install an assembly. However, only Backflow Prevention Assembly General Testers holding current certification by the California-Nevada Section of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) can test, maintain and repair backflow prevention assemblies. The tester must provide the District with evidence of AWWA certification and proof that the test equipment he or she will use is currently calibrated. The District maintains a list of currently approved testers, available on our website.\nThe installation of the assembly must be inspected and approved by the District. Call the Water Quality Technician to schedule an inspection.\nAfter the installation has been inspected and approved, the assembly must be tested. Per California State Law, all backflow prevention assemblies must be tested upon installation. A District-approved, certified Backflow Prevention Assembly General Tester must test the assembly to ensure that it is operating correctly and will complete the District’s “Backflow Prevention Assembly Test Report”, available on our website or at our office. The tester will then mail, fax, or email the completed form back to the District.\nBackflow prevention assemblies protect against two types of hazards: pollutants and contaminants.\n1. A Pollutant – is any substance which affects the aesthetic quality of the water (taste, color or odor), but does not pose a health hazard.\n2. A Contaminant – may cause illness or death when ingested, and is considered to be a health hazard. Some common examples of hazards or systems requiring backflow prevention assemblies are:\n• Fire Sprinkler Systems\n• Hydronic Heating Systems\n• Irrigation Systems\n• Boilers/Water Heat Exchangers\n• Auxiliary Water Supplies (e.g., lake intakes, wells)\nAn auxiliary water supply is a water source on your property in addition to the public drinking water service. An auxiliary water supply can be any one of the following: well, lake intake, stream/river intake, spring, rainwater cistern, grey water, etc.\nWhen there is an auxiliary water supply on a property, it can be a potential cross-connection if that auxiliary supply accidentally gets connected to the public drinking water supply. For example, if your property has a lake intake or a private well that feeds your irrigation system, but your irrigation system is also fed from the public water system, the water from the auxiliary supply could get into the public drinking water system. For properties with an auxiliary water supply, the District requires an approved backflow prevention assembly to be installed at the meter.\nYes, even if it is a drip irrigation system. Weed killers, fertilizers and animal waste may enter the water supply through an irrigation system that is not properly protected with a backflow prevention assembly, contaminating the water. District staff will help you determine which assembly is the right one for your particular needs.\nYes. In our cold climate, fire sprinkler systems are typically charged with a glycol solution. Additionally, systems constructed out of black iron pipe typically contain a rust inhibitor. Even systems that are charged only with water may be hazardous to the water supply. Bacterial growth can occur in the stagnant water, which sits undisturbed in the pipes for many years. A loss of system pressure can draw this polluted or contaminated water into your own system and potentially into the District’s water supply. Systems that are charged only with air, but include a Fire Department Connection (FDC) also pose a hazard to the water supply; if the FDC is connected to a fire truck during a fire situation, the potential exists for water that may contain other substances to backflow into the drinking water supply.\nTitle 17 of California state law and District Water Ordinance 11 requires annual testing of backflow prevention assemblies to ensure that they are functioning properly. With the exception of the air gap, backflow prevention assemblies are mechanical units with internal seals, springs, and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear, or fatigue. The annual test ensures a properly functioning assembly, and certifies that the assembly has not been removed or had a by-pass line installed around it. Air gaps are “tested” by conducting a visual inspection.\nNot for most hazards. However, when there is an auxiliary water supply, medical facility, lethal hazard,failure to allow the District to perform a cross-connection inspection, or other circumstance, asdetermined by the District, backflow prevention assemblies must be installed immediately behind themeter, on private property. RP backflow prevention assemblies installed at the meter must be installed in an above-ground, continually heated enclosure. DC backflow prevention assemblies installed at the meter may be installed in an underground box or vault, but must be approved on a case-by-case basis.\nIn general, the District has taken the approach of requiring internal protection with regards to the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, in order to protect the drinking water within the property as well as the public water system. This approach has been determined to be the best method for the protection of public health and safety. Furthermore, requiring internal protection, at the point of potential cross-connection, typically allows our customers to install smaller backflow prevention assemblies within their structure, and generally eliminates the need to house these assemblies in an above-ground, continually heated enclosure.\nBackflow prevention assemblies are designed to be installed above-ground. However, because of our severe winters, the District may approve the installation of a DC within an underground box, on a case-by-case basis. RPs and vacuum breakers may never be installed in a box or vault, as this installation would subject the assembly to potentially becoming submerged in the underground box or vault, rendering it ineffective. (RPs and vacuum breakers are open to the atmosphere, which, if submerged, would create another cross-connection).\nFailure to install the required type of assembly could result in termination of water service as described in the District’s Water Ordinance 11. The District will work with you to ensure that you are able to install the assembly, by selecting a location that would allow for the smallest size and fewest amount of assemblies, if more than one assembly is required. The District will also work with you to select a due date that is reasonable given your budget and schedule, while still addressing this matter in a timely fashion.\nThe form is available on the District’s website. Alternatively, you can call the District and request that a copy be emailed, faxed or mailed to you, or stop by the office to pick one up.\nYes! Backflow prevention assemblies, particularly irrigation assemblies, will freeze if left exposed. They must be kept from freezing by providing insulation and by providing a heat source, if needed. Irrigation assemblies are recommended to be installed with unions on either side, which will allow them to be removed during the winter months. Other assemblies can often be installed within the building in a heated area. District staff will help determine what location is appropriate for the assembly. We will endeavor to allow you to install the assembly within the building to prevent it from freezing.\nThe District maintains a database containing all of the permitted backflow prevention assemblies within our water system. We will notify you when your assembly is due to be tested, and we will provide you with a test form accompanied by a list of certified Backflow Prevention Assembly General Testers. It is the customer's responsibility to schedule the test with the tester. These notifications are typically sent out the first of June of every year, with a typical test due date of the end of August. Mark your calendars to have your assembly tested every spring!\nYes. The District owns and maintains 28 backflow prevention assemblies throughout our service area. We test all irrigation assemblies prior to first use each season, and test the remaining assemblies by the same due date as our customers.\nA stop and waste drain and a stop and waste valve are the same thing. A stop and waste valve is used to drain the piping above or beyond it, when it is in a closed position. These are typically used on irrigation lines and for domestic water service lines.\nThese can be a potential cross-connection if the stop and waste valve is installed below the ground surface; the water (including any contaminants, such as chemicals, dirt, bacteria, fertilizer, etc.) can pool up and then enter your internal plumbing and potentially the drinking water system through the valve when it is opened back up.The California Plumbing Code and the District requires that “Combination stop-and-waste valves…shall not be installed underground.”\nA yard hydrant and a frost-free/freeze proof hose bibb are the same thing. A yard hydrant is an outdoor water supply outlet that has a valve and outlet above ground and a drain opening below the frost level. When the valve is opened, water flows. When the valve is closed, the water supply to the hydrant is shut off below the frost level and a drain hole is opened that allows the water in the yard hydrant pipe to drain into a gravel bed. This drains the yard hydrant and its riser so that the hydrant will not freeze.\nA yard hydrant can be a potential cross-connection through the drain hole; when a backsiphonage condition occurs, contaminants (such as chemicals, dirt, bacteria, fertilizer, etc.) can potentially enter your internal plumbing and the public drinking water system through the drain hole.\nThe District requires that yard hydrants have an RP assembly installed upstream of them, or that they are replaced with a sanitary yard hydrant. A sanitary yard hydrant still has a drain hole, but the water drains into a sealed tank. When the hydrant is turned on again, the water in the tank is expelled; there is no crosscontamination with the yard hydrant and the soil.\nFor approved sanitary yard hydrants, contact the District.\nFor more information:\n• Visit our website, at www.ntpud.org/bfp\n• View the District’s Water Ordinance at http://ntpud.org/sites/default/files/docs/general/\n• For any other questions, please use the following contact information:\nMichael D. Warren\nLead Water Quality Control Technician\nNorth Tahoe Public Utility District\n530-546-4212 ext 5452","New York State Sanitary Code 5-1.31 requires the complete containment of water on many commercial customers’ property by use of an approved backflow prevention device i.e. RPZ, DCV, or air gap. Under state regulations governing the requirements for backflow prevention devices, the Suffolk County Department of Health requires controls be in place for hazardous operations under private control in order to safeguard the water supply. Further information can be obtained by contacting the Suffolk County Department of Health directly or our Cross Connection Control Department. Both are listed on the last page of this document.\nThe \"RPZ/DCV\" device, as it is commonly referred to, is a backflow prevention device used to prevent \"backflow\" of foreign liquids and other matter into the potable supply of water which could result in contamination. Backflow can occur when the pressure in our system is less than the pressure in a customer’s system. For example if a fire department were to draw too much water while fighting a fire, it would reduce the pressure in the area’s water main below that which exists in, say an industrial building, thus back-siphoning chemical mixtures from the building into the water main through cross connections. This could contaminate the area’s water. While uncommon, pressure differentials can happen and protective devices must be used as required by law to protect the water supply.\nThe RPZ/DCV device which actually prevents the backflow of water stays open when water is flowing in one direction only. If a change of direction occurs, as it would during a major reduction in pressure, the RPZ/DCV device would close and prevent a contamination backflow.\nDomestic Water Service Requirements\nNewly constructed Commercial Buildings are required to install a Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) device.\nExisting commercial buildings will require the installation of either a Reduced Pressure Zone Assembly (RPZ) or Double Check Valve (DCV), based upon degree of hazard determined by the Cross Connection Department under NYS Department of Health guidelines and Suffolk County Water Authority Rules & Regulations.\nWhile residential backflow prevention is not mandated by law, residential accounts with high degree of hazard are required by SCWA to install a RPZ device. These include, but are not limited to, private well(s) connected to the house, chemical-fed irrigation systems, and geothermal HV/AC systems. All of the above require an approved backflow preventer commensurate with the degree of hazard, which is determined by the Cross Connection Department at SCWA.\nNew non-residential dock services also require an RPZ device.\nFire-Flow Requirements and Effects\nRPZ/DCV devices while very effective in protecting the water supply from backflows can cause reductions in pressure and fire-flow capacity. Fire-flow capacity is regulated by fire departments, fire marshals, fire underwriting agencies and other regulating agencies. While we realize the importance of maintaining good fire protection, the installation of an approved backflow prevention device is essential in protecting the water supply. Contact the Cross Connection Department for options for fire line backflow device installations.\nNew construction buildings, services over 2\" on existing buildings, and fire lines services require plans be filed. Please refer to our Cross Connection Booklet which will aid you in the filing procedure."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a239fa75-4b3f-4749-83e8-f437b39bcaa1>","<urn:uuid:91b9fd48-1378-45aa-8c40-668696b05156>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do current plant monitoring systems track environmental pollutants, and what advanced analytical methods are being developed to study plant-environment interactions?","answer":"Current plant monitoring systems use indicator plants like spinach, kale, and grass grown in standardized soil containers to track environmental pollutants. These plants are harvested every four to eight weeks to analyze for compounds such as heavy metals, PAHs, fluorides, and dioxins. The analytical methods being developed include sophisticated DNA technology to study root-associated microbes, high-resolution scanners with WinRhizo software for root morphology analysis, and molecular techniques such as bacterial/archaeal and fungal primer pairs to amplify rhizosphere bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions. These technologies are being used to characterize how plants respond to environmental stressors and to understand the complex interactions between plants and their environment.","context":["Biomonitoring is the use of plants to measure air quality. Plants can absorb and store substances from the air. After harvesting, these can be analysed for compounds such as heavy metals, PAHs, dioxins and PCBs. Biomonitoring has been found to be a powerful tool for monitoring air quality around waste incineration plants, ore-processing industries and airports.\n1. What is biomonitoring?\nIn order to measure air quality using biomonitoring, WUR researchers grow sensitive plants such as spinach, kale and grass in the vicinity of industries with airborne emissions (the ‘source’). These plants are grown as indicator plants. They can absorb and store substances from the air, usually without visible symptoms. The plants are grown in containers with standardised soil to exclude any influence of local differences in soil quality and to limit measurements to airborne absorption. As an additional measure, milk samples are sometimes taken from dairy farms in the vicinity of industrial sites.\nEvery four weeks, the researchers examine whether the plants are showing abnormalities and look for the presence of any harmful compounds such as heavy metals, PAHs, fluorides and dioxins in the plants. If abnormalities do occur, this becomes apparent at an early stage. The measurements mainly have a signal function. As long as the standards are not exceeded in the indicator crops and products, all the crops grown in the immediate vicinity of the source are safe. Further investigation is only needed if the norms are exceeded.\n2. What kinds of industrial situations is biomonitoring used in?\nBiomonitoring can be used to measure air quality around individual point sources such as waste incineration plants, ore-processing industries, power plants and airports. It can also be used in areas with a lot of industry or around large industrial estates. Another use is for monitoring the quality of food crops grown in an urban area.\n3. What substances can biomonitoring identify?\nThe range of compounds that can be included in a biomonitoring programme depends on the emissions being released. Other selection criteria include properties such as toxicity, volatility, demonstrability and societal relevance (such as dioxins in milk).\nMonitoring air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter, ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) is less useful since these substances are emitted by many different sources such as industry, agriculture, households and traffic. These components cannot be identified in plants as such because of the conversions that take place in the plant and because it is impossible to distinguish the contribution made by an individual source from the ‘blanket’ that already covers the Netherlands.\n4. Where are measurements taken?\nAs the name suggests, the main function of a biomonitoring programme is to monitor. This requires spatial distribution with measuring points in as many wind directions as possible in relation to the source. It can then be investigated whether there is a correlation between the wind direction and the levels found. The number and location of the monitoring points is determined on the basis of the geographical location of the source and the likely distribution pattern of the emissions. A reference measurement point is also set up at a greater distance from the direct sphere of influence of the source to determine the local background load. Between five and eight measuring points are sufficient for most situations.\n5. How often are measurements taken?\nA biomonitoring programme can monitor the air quality around an industry all year round. The frequency of sampling depends on the plant species:\n- Spinach is grown in spring and summer and is harvested and analysed every four weeks.\n- Kale is grown in autumn and winter and is analysed every eight weeks.\n- Fluoride levels in grass are determined every four weeks throughout the year.\nIn order to reliably determine trends over time (whether environmental quality is better, the same or worse than the background load), a multi-year measurement programme is required.\n6. Who carries out the biomonitoring?\nThe monitoring activities, which include setting up the measuring points, growing the crops, harvesting, reporting and discussing the results with the parties concerned, are carried out by WUR employees. The crop analyses are outsourced to external certified laboratories.\n7. What are the measurements tested against?\nTo determine the effects on crops, the measured levels around the source are compared with those at the reference point, which is in the same area but outside the direct sphere of influence of the source (local background levels). The levels are also compared with the national background levels.\n8. When are the results available?\nAfter each sampling it takes about three weeks for the analysis results to become available. A measurement programme of at least one year is required to identify trends over time.\n9. Who can view the results?\nEach biomonitoring programme has a supervisory committee on which the parties involved are represented. The supervisory committee meets once or twice a year to discuss the outcomes of the programme. Potential adjustments to the monitoring programme are also discussed at these meetings. Once the annual report has been drawn up, it is generally made public.\n10. What previous projects have there been?\nAn example of a previous project is the biomonitoring carried out to map the situation around Lelystad Airport. The future consequences of the planned expansion of Lelystad Airport on crops in the immediate vicinity was determined by taking measurements near Bremen Airport, which has similar activity levels to the future Lelystad Airport. This study found that emissions of aircraft exhaust fumes have no adverse impact on the quality of the crops grown in the immediate vicinity of Bremen Airport.","Location: Plant Science Research\nProject Number: 6070-11000-010-000-D\nProject Type: In-House Appropriated\nStart Date: Oct 24, 2018\nEnd Date: Oct 23, 2023\nObjective 1. Assess conservation agricultural systems for the capacity to enhance productivity, reduce environmental impacts, build strong rural connections, and be profitable. Objective 2. Develop soil biological testing to improve nitrogen fertilizer recommendations for grain and forage crops. Objective 3. Identify crop stress-tolerance traits, assess germplasm and identify genetic sources of these traits for cultivar improvement. Sub-objective 3A. Identify sources of heat stress tolerance in soybean and wheat. Sub-objective 3B. Identify sources of ozone tolerance in soybean and wheat. Sub-objective 3C. Characterize root architecture under heat or ozone stress. Sub-objective 3D. Characterize the impact of heat, ozone stress, and management on the microbial communities associated with plant roots.\nTwo long-term field experiments located at the Farming Systems Research Unit at Goldsboro, North Carolina, are the basis for the research on conservation agricultural system evaluation. One experiment compares conventional cropping, organic agriculture, integrated crop-livestock system, plantation forestry, and a naturalized fallow. Soil samples from all treatments will be tested periodically for soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions, bulk density, water infiltration, and penetration resistance. Crop, animal, and timber production data will be used to assess the trajectory of sustainability from different farming systems. Intact root systems will be characterized for long-term management effects on microbial communities associated with roots using DNA technology (see below). The second long-term field experiment is an agroforestry study with the presence or absence of trees with the alleys planted to native warm-season grasses and tested for effects of harvest management. Forage, animal, and timber production data along with soil resource data will be used to assess the sustainability of the different types of forage utilization and type of shade management for cattle. Soil biological testing to improve nitrogen fertilizer recommendations will be conducted on research stations and on-farm trials. Treatments will be a series of different nitrogen rates to determine yield response of a crop to supplemental nitrogen. Soil biological activity will be determined with the flush of CO2 following rewetting of dried soil method and results used to develop site-specific fertilizer recommendations. Soybean and wheat germplasm selected in consultation with plant breeders will be screened for response to heat stress and elevated ozone. Plant response to heat stress will be assessed based on yield and harvest index using temperature gradient greenhouses and Air Exclusion System (AES) field technology to impose elevated temperature treatments. Plant response to ozone stress will be assessed based on foliar injury and yield using greenhouse chambers and open-top field chambers (OTC) to provide elevated ozone treatments. Genotype differences in biochemical (antioxidant enzymes and metabolites) and physiological (chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis, respiration, and stomatal conductance) processes will be characterized to identify useful traits for phenotyping during development of cultivars with improved stress tolerance. Plants evaluated for heat stress and ozone tolerance will also be assessed for differences in root morphology and root-associated microbes. Root systems will be divided into root classes and assessed for genotype and treatment effects on biomass, diameter and length using high resolution scanners and WinRhizo software. Root associated microbes will be separated from roots and the rhizosphere DNA isolated. Bacterial/archaeal and fungal primer pairs will be used to amplify rhizosphere bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). After sequencing, 16S rRNA sequences and ITSs will be analyzed to characterize genotype and stress effects on root associated microbial communities."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:560fd0fe-1e98-4678-8e3b-ca1e61854ee9>","<urn:uuid:eb13ba1f-ba43-4b03-89b3-9afd742b4f38>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does racial bias manifest in modern technology and AI applications?","answer":"Racial bias appears in several ways in technology. Social media apps like Nextdoor, Citizen and Neighbours have shown to exacerbate racist stereotyping by disproportionately flagging people of color as 'suspicious'. Machine-learning algorithms used in predictive policing often unfairly target people of color, reflecting existing police biases. Additionally, AI applications can perpetuate bias when human prejudices are introduced into data sets, particularly when white people's experiences are used as the default focus for development. This issue is compounded by lack of diversity in the tech sector, with a survey showing only 16 of 152 board positions in the UK's top Tech companies were filled by people of color.","context":["Citizens’ fight against racist bias: What role can Civic Tech play?\nUpdated: Jul 10, 2020\nLondon BLM protest. Photograh: Ehimetalor Akhere Unuabona / Unsplash.\nOver the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed demonstrations in the US against the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer grow into a global call for change. Even the exceptional context of the COVID-19 pandemic couldn’t stand in the way of a global show of solidarity; citizens from Mexico City to Berlin broke with social-distancing rules to demand a reckoning with the persistent inequality, discrimination and violence faced by people of colour.\nThe incident didn’t find this level of global resonance because it was exceptional but precisely because it wasn’t.\nThe killing found such global resonance precisely because it wasn't exceptional. “I can’t breathe”, a phrase used repeatedly by George Floyd in the minutes leading up to his death, already stood as a slogan associated with ‘Black Lives Matter’ before his killing. It was the same phrase Eric Garner used before he died during a violent arrest in Staten Island in 2014 and stands symbolically for the persistent, all too often deadly police violence that people of colour in the US are subjected to.\nOutside the US, citizens used the protests not only to show their solidarity but to turn the focus inward and expose racial violence and inequality within their own countries as well. And amidst the toppling of statues of former slave-owners in the UK, CEOs resigning to make way for more diversity at the executive level and global leaders acknowledging their countries’ struggle with racism, the effects of this can already be felt.\nFor the Civic Tech sector, too, the past weeks have raised - or renewed the focus on - central questions that go to the core of its work. Standing at the interface between government and citizens, Civic Tech must engage with the demands raised by citizens across the world, critically reflect on its work and find its role within citizen’s fight against racial inequality.\nCitizens’ global push against racial inequality.\nThe speed at which the BLM-led demonstrations in the US turned into a transnational wave of protests that captivated the attention of millions stands as the latest example of the mobilising power of social media. Images and videos of police violence were shared widely, with those using the hashtag “BlackLivesMatter” being viewed over 8 billion times, making the brutal reality of racial violence inescapable for people around the globe. Simultaneously, social media platforms were used to organise protests while symbolic acts of solidarity, such as the hashtag #blackoutuesday that was posted 20 million times, travelled across the world.\nThe issues raised go far beyond anything that could be condensed into, let alone be resolved by, a social media post.\nWhat the protests call into focus, however, doesn't fit into a social media post - and it certainly cannot be sufficiently addressed by one. Central to the discourse is the demand to connect the killings of people of colour at the hands of the police to the system(s) of institutional and structural racism that enable them. Rather than treating them as an isolated case linked solely to the police officers’ personal beliefs and actions, attention is shifted to the institutions (police policies and practices that perpetuate oppression) and structures (oppressive effects across institutions and history) that perpetuate racial bias and, ultimately, violence.\nBLM protest in Paris. Phortograph: Thomas de Luze / Unsplash\nDespite differences in history, institutions and political set-up, systemically-embedded racism is a sad commonality shared across countries. And the grappling with systemic racism poses a monumental challenge to all societies.\nIn the US, for example, George Floyd’s death came just weeks after the outbreak of the Corona-virus - a virus that served as a reminder of the disproportionately poor protection black Americans receive under the US healthcare system. According to the APM Research Lab, the death rate of black Americans from COVID-19 was more than double that of any other race.\nAny debate around the systemic nature of racism is routinely met with resistance.\nIn France, racist police practices are increasingly in focus, also thanks to recent BLM-demonstrations. Open debate around the systemic nature of racism, however, is still largely met with scepticism or denial. For example, when a well known French singer revealed on TV that she, as a woman of colour, at times doesn’t feel safe in the presence of police, on Twitter, her remarks were dismissed by the government as ‘false’ and ‘shameful’. This makes palpable the difficulty of addressing an issue as sensitive as racism, especially within a large institution.\nIn neighbouring Germany, disproportionate discrimination and violence by the police against people of colour has come into focus as well, including a list of unresolved deaths in police custody. Head of the SPD-party Saskia Esken was one of the first to acknowledge systemic racism within the police in response to the protests. Her statement was immediately met by backlash across the political spectrum.\nIt is these wider, systemic contexts of racial inequality that citizens are calling their governments’ and fellow citizens’ attention to. Each society faces the challenge of reckoning with the systemic level of racial inequality that permeates its every layer - and that has gone largely unchallenged for much too long. But as this process begins to unfold, we’re also seeing the obstacles and resistances it encounters.\nAs a Civic Tech company, Civocracy stands at the interface between government, citizens and technology. We strive to empower citizens by strengthening community growth through effective collaboration. Overcoming such deep-seated divisions that obstruct collaboration is central importance for our work.\nEngaging with the issues raised by the protests is necessary to work towards true inclusivity and realise Civic Tech’s potential.\nA central element of our work is a commitment to fostering inclusive projects. The current discourse around racial (in)equality highlights systemic barriers to inclusivity that compromise this very mission. Engaging with the issues raised by the protests is therefore paramount, both in order to work towards true inclusivity and realise Civic Tech’s potential as an intermediary between citizens and governments as a whole.\nBLM protest in Los Angeles, US. Photograph: Nathan Dumlao / Unsplash.\nCivic Tech as medium for change?\nBy definition, Civic Tech aims to strengthen the relationship between citizens and government through innovative Tech solutions. The sector’s rapid expansion has been driven by inventive tools that have the power to fundamentally reshape the way citizens interact with their governments and thereby pave the way to a more collaborative future.\nCivic Tech is not exempt from critical analysis.\nBut even with its focus on citizen empowerment, Civic Tech is not exempt from critical analysis. In recent years, more and more technological appliances were found to exhibit signs of discrimination. A number of social media Apps, for example have shown to exacerbate racist stereotyping. Apps like Nextdoor, Citizen and Neighbours, created to allow users to view local crime in real time and debate it with other users, overwhelmingly flag people of colour as ‘suspicious’, feeding into existing biases and racism.\nAnother concern for Civic Tech is the racial bias routinely found in machine-learning algorithms. Predictive policing, which relies on algorithms fed with data collected by the police to help fight crime, often unfairly targets people of colour, for example, mirroring a general tendency in police policy. In 2016, Microsoft’s “Tay”, a Twitter bot, famously turned from an innocent conversation tool into a hatred-stirring chat tool that uses racist slurs.\nWhile this may not stem from racist malice per se, racial oversight at the very least pervades the sector.\nAI appliances exemplify clearly how racial bias can be perpetuated by tech. Human bias is introduced into data sets and generated in the outcomes of the application of those data sets. While this may not stem from racist malice per se, racial oversight at the very least exists as white people’s experiences are routinely used as the default focus for development. The lack of diversity in the tech sector is certainly a contributing factor. A survey by colorintech.org recently found that only 16 of 152 board positions in the UK's top Tech companies were filled by people of colour.\nBy extension, Civic Tech actors must also assume that, unless critical focus was placed on the issue of race and ethnicity at all times, biases are built into their appliances. And while these may go largely unnoticed, they nevertheless contribute to the perpetuation of a racist system.\nCivic Tech certainly has the potential to play as central a role in furthering the protesters’ cause as social media does, complementing it by providing tools for more constructive and nuanced exchange than most social media platforms can. But this potential can only be realised by way of a critical self-assessment of Civic Tech’s work.\nCivocracy’s Call to Action\nDriven by its mission to empower citizens, Civocracy wants to use this moment of citizen-led change to reinforce and broaden its inclusive approach. It will be one of our key priorities to work towards building a platform that actively fights racial bias and enables citizens and governments to connect in a truly inclusive way.\nHowever, we recognise our limitations in identifying and implementing an appropriate approach without prior critical self-assessment. Like other Civic Tech organisations and those concerned with the public sector at large, we must reflect critically on our work before we can formulate a stronger, more inclusive approach towards connecting citizens and governments in the future.\nBy connecting Civic Tech actors, government, public sector stakeholders and experts on overcoming racial bias , an in-depth discussion on inclusivity in and through Civic Tech will be possible.\nCivocracy has decided to initiate and provide the frame for this process. We will bring together a group of experts to work together on exposing, understanding and addressing racial bias in Civic Tech. By connecting Civic Tech actors, government and public sector stakeholders, as well as experts on overcoming racial bias and discrimination, an in-depth discussion on inclusivity in and through Civic Tech, will be possible. The exchange will take place on Civocracy’s platform. Communication-management, organisation and results-analysis will be carried out by our own experts.\nUltimately, we hope to gain a clear understanding and concrete roadmap for how bias can be eliminated from Civic Tech and how Civic Tech, in turn, can facilitate the fight for racial equality. The insights gained will be crucial not only for Civic Tech organisations but the public sector at large.\nWe invite all organisations and individuals with ties to the public sector and/or the Civic Tech sector to join this project.\nThe past weeks have opened up a long-overdue debate. Now, this must be formed into tangible action. Innovative approaches are exactly what is needed - but collaboration essential to set them up in the right way."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:496b38df-e4af-427d-b62b-be37402f48e4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hola! I need help with bean preparation methods: What are the recommended soaking techniques for dried beans in a pressure cooker, and what solutions exist if the beans still don't soften during cooking?","answer":"For soaking, you have two main options: 1) Traditional overnight soak for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator, which reduces cooking time and improves texture, or 2) Quick-soak method by bringing beans to a boil and letting them stand for one hour. If beans don't soften during cooking, several solutions exist: check if your water is hard (which can prevent softening), ensure beans aren't too old, and try adding 1/4 teaspoon baking soda per pound of beans. You can also avoid acidic ingredients during cooking as they can prevent softening. Additionally, always use fresh dry beans when possible, as beans stored over 12 months may never soften properly.","context":["How long does it take to cook raw beans in a pressure cooker?\nThe electric pressure cooker is a bean-cooking dream. A “rapid soak” of just one minute at high pressure eliminates the overnight soak, and an average cook time of 10 minutes for most beans means that you can have a fresh pot in less than an hour.\nWhat is the ratio of beans to water in a pressure cooker?\nAll you need to do to cook beans in the instant pot is add them into your pot, followed by 2 – 3x that amount of water. So if you’re using 1 cup of dried beans (unsoaked), you’d follow that with about 2 – 3 cups of water. Basically, you want the beans to be fully submerged or else they won’t cook evenly.\nHow long does it take to soften beans in a pressure cooker?\nAdd water to the beans. Close the lid and pressure cook on High Pressure for 5 minutes. Drain the liquid and use the beans in any recipe that calls for soaked beans.\nDo I need to soak beans before pressure cooking?\n3. Beans should be soaked at least 4 hours before cooking. Rinse the soaked beans before pressure cooking. If you forget to soak beans in advance, use the quick-soak method: Cover washed and sorted beans with water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.\nHow long to pressure can beans?\nProcess filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure 20 minutes for pints and 25 minutes for quarts, adjusting for altitude. Remove jars and cool. Check lids for seal after 24 hours. Lid should not flex up and down when center is pressed.\nWhy should you pressure cook beans?\nPressure Cooking Beans From Soaked\n- Reduces indigestible sugars by over 75%.\n- Removes a majority of the anti-nutrients, allowing the digestive process to absorb more iron, for example.\n- The beans cook evenly.\n- They’re nice to look at and also eat, because they’re evenly cooked so no more crunchy beans.\nWhat happens if you don’t soak beans before cooking?\nSoaking beans in the refrigerator overnight will reduce the time they have to cook drastically. And the texture of the beans will also be it their best, with fewer split-open and burst ones. … Here’s the thing: Beans that have not been soaked ahead of time will always take longer to cook, but they will, indeed, cook.\nDoes pressure cooking beans reduce gas?\nPressure Cooking The Beans\nIf you own a pressure cooker or Instant Pot, using one to make beans less gassy is a possibility. This is because they can help to break down the sugars within the beans to eliminate the unwanted side effects.\nHow much water do you put in 2 cups of beans in a pressure cooker?\nUse a 3:1 ratio (water:beans) when cooking the soaked beans in the pressure cooker. For example, if you are cooking 1 cup soaked beans, then you would use 3 cups water. In this recipe 2 cups beans are used, so use 6 cups water.\nHow much water do I need for 2 cups of beans?\nIn a large pot, add 6 cups of water for each pound (2 cups) of dry beans. Heat to boiling; boil for 2–3 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and soak for at least 1 hour.","Some beans refuse to soften. You can soak them overnight and then simmer them all day long, and they’re still hard as pebbles. The main causes of this are age and improper storage.\nWhat do I do if my beans are too hard?\nAlways use fresh dry beans if possible. Beans that have been stored for over 12 months or in unfavorable conditions may never soften. Hard water may also cause hard beans. If the cooked beans still seem tough, add a 1/4 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) for each pound of beans to increase tenderness.\nWhy are my dried beans not getting soft?\n2 Answers. There are three primary reasons why dried beans do not soften despite extensive cooking time: 1) they are old; 2) hard water; or 3) the presence of an acid. If you don’t think your beans are old, then perhaps your water is the problem. Beans cooked in hard water will never soften properly.\nHow do you soften soaked beans?\n- In the same pan add the soaked beans, 4 cups of water, and 1 teaspoon of salt.\n- Bring water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover and reduce heat to low. …\n- Gently cook beans over low heat until tender and creamy, about 60 to 90 minutes.\n- Drain and serve them warm.\nCan you eat hard beans after cooking?\nBeans actually have a better nutritional profile after they are cooked. Beans must be boiled to destroy the lectins. Lectins are thought to exist to discourage animals and other pests from eating the raw beans or seeds of the plant.\nWill baking soda soften beans?\nIf there is too much acid in the pot, the beans may never soften enough to be ready to eat. … Along with brining and soaking, baking soda can work wonders on beans, saving you up to an hour of cooking time.\nHow do you tell if a bean is undercooked?\nCheck them at regular intervals until the beans are tender but still firm. They shouldn’t be falling apart. A great way to tell that beans are done or almost done is to blow on a spoonful of them.\nHow do you soften dry beans quickly?\nBoil the beans: Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Cook the beans for 1 minute, then remove the pot from the heat. Soak for 1 hour: Cover with a lid and let the beans to soak in the warm water for one hour. Drain the beans: Drain the beans into a colander.\nHow much baking soda do I add to beans?\nAdding baking soda also may affect the texture, making the cooked beans mushy instead of tender. If you do add baking soda, the amount your friend suggested is too large. Usually, you only use 1/4 teaspoon baking soda to a pound of beans. The best way to reduce the problem is simply to eat more beans.\nWhy are my beans crunchy?\nThe main reason for beans that are still hard after cooking is the quality of the beans. Drying beans preserves them for a long time, but not forever. Even if you just got them, they may have been sitting in the grocery store for months or longer. Choose dried goods from stores with a lot of turnover.\nHow do you cook beans seriously?\nHow to Quick-Soak Beans: If you don’t have time for a longer soak, use this quick-soaking method: Cover the dried beans with ample water and season with salt (again, the water should taste pleasantly salty). Bring to a boil over high heat, then remove from heat. Let stand one hour, then drain and proceed to cooking.\nWhat to put in beans to prevent gas?\nTo degas with baking soda, add a teaspoon of baking soda to 4 quarts of water. Stir in the dried beans and bring to a boil. Then turn off the heat and let the beans soak at least four hours (I usually do this the night before I want to use them; the longer soak won’t hurt them). Drain, rinse and rinse again.\nWhat if I forgot to soak my beans overnight?\nRinse your beans in a colander with cool water. … Cover the beans in a pot with about 2 inches of water. On high heat, bring the water to a boil and cook the beans for 5 minutes without a lid.\nHow many raw beans will kill you?\nToxic dose: As few as four or five raw beans can trigger symptoms. Onset: Usually begins with extreme nausea and vomiting within 1 to 3 hours of ingestion of the product, with diarrhea developing later within that timeframe. Illness + complications: Upper and lower gastrointestinal illness. Vomiting may become severe.\nHow do you make beans more digestible?\nSoak: in plenty of cold water.

{"question":"Do both APU units and RV tank sensors require gentle water cleaning to prevent damage? What cleaning methods are similar between them?","answer":"Yes, both APU units and RV tank sensors require gentle water cleaning. For APUs, a gentle stream of water should be used while avoiding pressure washers that could damage components. Similarly, RV tank sensors can be cleaned using a tank cleaning wand with water, but the pressure should be reasonable and not excessive. Both systems can also benefit from specialized cleaning solutions - dielectric grease for APU connections and specific sensor cleaners for RV tanks.","context":["We are all aware of the damage salt does to vehicles. Corrosion is mother nature’s response to the salt we use on our roads to keep us safe from the snow and ice. While doing its job by melting snow and ice, this salty water mixture turns into a fine mist and manages to work its way to the smallest hard to reach areas. Proactively keeping your rig clean helps combat corrosion but not much attention goes to the refrigeration units and APU’s mounted in the path of this corrosive salt spray.\nAs we near spring, there is a lingering effect the winter can have on our on-road equipment. We all know the effect that salt has on our vehicles. In this post, we are going to talk about what we can do to combat the lasting effects of salt on our refrigeration units and APUs.\nRefrigerated trailer units are the hard workers of the cold chain. They are sophisticated pieces of equipment designed to cool down to -20 degrees and heat to 90 degrees. They do not get a break, even during the cold winter months.\nNewer refrigerated units have technology that rivals today’s on-highway vehicles, and they are subject to the same harsh elements, from 110 degrees out in Phoenix to -40 degrees in Minnesota. And they do not catch a break when it comes to corrosion. Luckily, there are a few things you can do that help keep that unit in great shape for years to come.\nSimply rinsing down your unit from time to time will go a long way in preventing corrosion. Start at the top and rinse the condenser with a gentle spray of water. Keep away from pressure washers or high-powered water streams which can easily damage the aluminum fins on the condenser. Keep rinsing down the salt and grime, across the engine and through the belly pan. Do not forget about the frame rails where unseen salt and grime can hide for years.\nNext, check your connections near the starter. These connections tend to hold water so pay special attention to them. After rinsing the unit, and once everything is dry, apply a little dab of dielectric grease to these connections to help prevent any water intrusion in the future.\nFinally, do not forget about your fuel tank. Fuel tanks are especially susceptible to corrosion near the tank straps. Rinse the area around the straps and inspect the tank for any signs of corrosion. If you do see something that may be an issue, get it taken care of. Every year, we have several trailers brought to us with leaks in the fuel tank. Things get messy quickly. It is better to err on the side of caution than to have to make an emergency stop.\nThe way APU units are mounted, they are subject to the harshest conditions on the road. Mounted near the road, APUs are inundated with the salty spray from treated roads. Just like the trailer units, however, there are simple things that you can do to help prevent any issues down the road.\nAPUs’ also have many electronics on board. While much has been done to protect the APU against its environment, there are still opportunities for issues to appear. Being aware of these potential issues will go a long way to maintaining your APU for years to come.\nAgain, one of the simplest and beneficial things you can do, is simply to rinse off the APU with fresh water. All the components on the APU power unit can handle a gentle stream of water, so as long as you are not blasting the unit with a pressure washer, you will be ok. Go ahead and remove the diamond plate covers and give the engine and enclosure a good rinse. Just be careful with the grey plastic APU Control Module at the top left of the unit near the frame rail.\nOver the years, product improvements have helped combat issues with corrosion. One of the most notorious culprits is the APU enclosure. While advances have been implemented over the years in paint technology to help the enclosure stand up to corrosive road grime and salt, you can extend the life of the enclosure by inspecting the enclosure on a regular basis. Look for any chips or scratches in the paint. If you find any, clean up the area, and touch up the spot with either a touch up pen or a bit of spray paint. That will help the paint protect your APU and keep your unit looking great.","Clean RV tank sensors let you know if the vehicle’s holding tanks are full. In many rigs, they should have sensors for both black and gray water tanks. But unclean sensors can provide you with false results. So how to clean RV holding tank sensors?\nAn RV tank sensor cleaner is an excellent solution for this problem. But you can also use a tank cleaning wand and a dishwashing detergent.\nMake sure that you follow the correct steps in cleaning a gray and black water tank sensor. Keep reading to know those important details to avoid committing costly mistakes.\nWhat You’ll Need\nEach RV black water tank sensor cleaning method needs the right tools for the job. It is the same idea if you are about to clean your RV gray water tank. The following are the items that you will need for this operation.\nRV holding tank cleaner\nA reliable tank cleaning agent has chemicals that can eliminate debris and gunk from the sensors. It should break down the built-up waste, allowing the device to work as intended.\nTake note that some sensor cleaning solutions contain harsh chemicals. It is best to use a product that does not contain harmful ingredients, making them safe to use around animals and people.\nAdditionally, consider spending the extra cash on a high-quality, premium holding tank cleaner. Some inexpensive options may not have enough cleaning power to remove gunk and debris from your RV’s sensors properly.\nRV tank cleaning wand\nThis tool sprays high-pressure water while installed in an RV black or gray water tank. It will move in a circular motion, allowing it to remove filthy substances from the vehicle’s tanks and their sensors.\nTake note that tank cleaning wands tend to come in different shapes and sizes. Make sure to use an option that will fit in your RV’s holding tank and the connected water lines.\nMoreover, the water pressure delivered by the wand should be reasonably strong to remove and flush stubborn waste.\nDish soap can be an effective tool in removing grease and grime from holding tank sensors in motorhomes and travel trailers.\nPlus, many RVers should already have this product in their kitchen, making it a fairly accessible solution. If you do not have a dishwashing detergent yet, or if you ran out, the product is reasonably easy to find in local shops.\nCleaning black tank sensors\nWith a dishwashing detergent that does not create a significant amount of soap suds. Otherwise, the suds may enter the device, causing it to malfunction or short circuit.\nAfter choosing and purchasing your desired black and gray RV holding tank sensor cleaning solution, you should use the appropriate technique to sanitize the component.\nUse a Sensor Cleaner\nSome rig owners, particularly beginners in RV camping, may assume that using an RV holding tank sensor cleaner is fairly straightforward. But missing a few details might increase the risks of ruining the entire system.\nTake note of these steps to use an RV tank sensor cleaner properly:\nStep 1: Close the holding tank’s valve.\nStep 2: Fill the tank with fresh water until it reaches the same height as the sensor.\nStep 3: Shake the bottle of your preferred sensor cleaner and pour half of the bottle into the tank through the vehicle’s toilet.\nStep 4: Let the solution sit for about 3 days or more.\nStep 5: Open the holding tank’s valve and dump the wastewater in it.\nStep 6: Use a wand or back flusher to flush the holding container thoroughly.\nStep 7: Test the sensors.\nUse a Tank Cleaning Wand\nSome users might think using an RV tank cleaning wand is the same fairly straightforward procedure as using a sensor cleaner. But mistakes can still occur if you use this tool haphazardly.\nHere are the steps to use the right cleaning wand to remove filth and gunk from the sensor:\nStep 1: Dump any wastewater in the holding tank.\nStep 2: Connect the want to a fresh water hose using a clean hose.\nStep 3: Flush the RV toilet.\nStep 4: Keep the flush button or lever pressed down as you insert the cleaning wand.\nStep 5: Repeat as many times as necessary until the sensor is spotless.\nUse a Dishwashing Detergent\nMany dishwashing soaps are excellent degreasers, allowing them to be quite effective in removing certain unclean substances on tank sensors.\nThe following steps will help you remove grease and grime from the holding tank sensor of travel trailers and campers:\nStep 1: Close the holding tank valve.\nStep 2: Fill the container with fresh water up to the highest point of the sensor.\nStep 3: Pour over 20 ounces of an appropriate dishwashing detergent into the RV’s kitchen sink line.\nStep 4: Wait until the dishwashing soap foams back out of the sink.\nStep 5: Let the detergent sit overnight.\nStep 6: Open the tank valve and dump the wastewater in the water holding container.\nStep 7: Fill the tank with more water and dump it frequently until no wastewater remains.\nStep 8: Repeat this process as many times as necessary to give the tank and its sensor a deep clean.\nHow to Prevent Gunk in RV Sensors\nAs the old saying goes, prevention is better than cure. Therefore, save yourself the trouble of cleaning holding tank sensors in RVs by making sure filth and gunk stay away from those parts.\nHere are some tips to help avert this issue from recurring:\n- Flush the tanks with water regularly\n- Open the RV black water tank only when you are dumping its contents\n- Use an enzymatic cleaner in the holding tank for care and maintenance\n- Use ‘RV Safe’ toilet paper\n- If you are not using RV Safe toilet paper, do not flush regular toilet paper down the drain\n- Avoid throwing food and grease down the kitchen drain\nDid you enjoy reading this article? What did you think about this guide on how to clean RV holding tank sensors? Do not forget to leave a comment and share it with other rig owners to help them out in this matter.\nRemember, you have different options to clean black and gray water holding tank sensors. Choose from using a dedicated sensor cleaner, a holding wand, or even a reliable dishwashing detergent.\nMake sure to follow the instructions on how to clean your vehicle’s tank sensors properly. Do not rush the process to ensure that you will gain more than satisfactory results.\nWelcome to a new journey! I am Rober Clark, also a full-time RV-er and currently exploring the US with Dane.

{"question":"How did Albert Camus and Anna Maria Maiolino respond artistically to authoritarian regimes?","answer":"Both artists used their work to challenge authoritarian systems, though in different contexts. Camus opposed Soviet totalitarianism and took a controversial neutral stance during the Algerian War, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria. Maiolino's work became an explicit critique of authoritarianism in Brazil during the late 1960s when artists faced censure and intimidation. As the regime attempted to undermine language and culture, she responded through performances that challenged the dictatorship's co-opting of everyday objects and disruption of dissident language. Her work engaged with the social exchange of information and affect as a form of resistance.","context":["The following people are considered by Pantheon to be the top 10 most legendary Algerian Writers of all time. This list of famous Algerian Writers is sorted by HPI (Historical Popularity Index), a metric that aggregates information on a biography’s online popularity. Visit the rankings page to view the entire list of Algerian Writers.\nWith an HPI of 88.59, Albert Camus is the most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 125 different languages on wikipedia.\nAlbert Camus ( kam-OO, US also kə-MOO; French: [albɛʁ kamy] (listen); 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was an Algerian-born French philosopher, author, dramatist and journalist. He was awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient in history. His works include The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus was born in French Algeria to Pieds Noirs parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the University of Algiers. He was in Paris when the Germans invaded France during World War II in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the French Resistance where he served as editor-in-chief at Combat, an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the left that opposed the Soviet Union because of its totalitarianism. Camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho-syndicalism. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the Algerian War (1954–1962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties. Philosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. Some consider Camus' work to show him to be an existentialist, even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\nWith an HPI of 81.01, Apuleius is the 2nd most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 61 different languages.\nApuleius (; also called Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis; c. 124 – after 170) was a Numidian Latin-language prose writer, Platonist philosopher and rhetorician. He lived in the Roman province of Numidia, in the Berber city of Madauros, modern-day M'Daourouch, Algeria. He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. This is known as the Apologia. His most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel, the Metamorphoses, otherwise known as The Golden Ass. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the adventures of its protagonist, Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey. Lucius goes through various adventures before he is turned back into a human being by the goddess Isis.\nWith an HPI of 70.30, Marcus Minucius Felix is the 3rd most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 26 different languages.\nMarcus Minucius Felix (died c. 250 AD in Rome) was one of the earliest of the Latin apologists for Christianity. Nothing is known of his personal history, and even the date at which he wrote can be only approximately ascertained as between AD 150 and 270. Jerome's De Viris Illustribus No. 58 speaks of him as \"Romae insignis causidicus\" [one of Rome's notable solicitors], but in that he is probably only improving on the expression of Lactantius who speaks of him as \"non-ignobilis inter causidicos loci\" [not unknown among solicitors].\nWith an HPI of 69.92, Assia Djebar is the 4th most famous Algerian Writer. Her biography has been translated into 42 different languages.\nFatima-Zohra Imalayen (30 June 1936 – 6 February 2015), known by her pen name Assia Djebar (Arabic: آسيا جبار), was an Algerian novelist, translator and filmmaker. Most of her works deal with obstacles faced by women, and she is noted for her feminist stance. She is \"frequently associated with women's writing movements, her novels are clearly focused on the creation of a genealogy of Algerian women, and her political stance is virulently anti-patriarchal as much as it is anti-colonial.\" Djebar is considered to be one of North Africa's pre-eminent and most influential writers. She was elected to the Académie française on 16 June 2005, the first writer from the Maghreb to achieve such recognition. For the entire body of her work she was awarded the 1996 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. She was often named as a contender for the Nobel Prize for Literature.\nWith an HPI of 69.89, Bernard-Henri Lévy is the 5th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 37 different languages.\nBernard-Henri Lévy (; French: [bɛʁnaʁ ɑ̃ʁi levi]; born 5 November 1948) is a French public intellectual. Often referred to in France simply as BHL, he was one of the leaders of the \"Nouveaux Philosophes\" (New Philosophers) movement in 1976. His opinions, political activism and publications have also been the subject of several controversies over the years.\nWith an HPI of 69.76, Robert Merle is the 6th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 29 different languages.\nRobert Merle (French: [mɛʁl]; 28 August 1908 – 27 March 2004) was a French novelist.\nWith an HPI of 67.33, Hélène Cixous is the 7th most famous Algerian Writer. Her biography has been translated into 30 different languages.\nHélène Cixous (; French: [siksu]; born 5 June 1937, Oran, Algeria) is a professor, French feminist writer, poet, playwright, philosopher, literary critic and rhetorician. Cixous is best known for her article \"The Laugh of the Medusa\", which established her as one of the early thinkers in post-structural feminism. She founded the first centre of feminist studies at a European university at the Centre universitaire de Vincennes of the University of Paris (today's University of Paris VIII).\nWith an HPI of 66.44, Kateb Yacine is the 8th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 25 different languages.\nKateb Yacine (Arabic pronunciation: [kæːtb jæːsiːn]; 2 August 1929 or 6 August 1929 – 28 October 1989) was an Algerian writer notable for his novels and plays, both in French and Algerian Arabic, and his advocacy of the Berber cause.\nWith an HPI of 65.01, Mohammed Dib is the 9th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 23 different languages.\nMohammed Dib (Arabic: محمد ديب; 21 July 1920 – 2 May 2003) was an Algerian author. He wrote over 30 novels, as well as numerous short stories, poems, and children's literature in the French language. He is probably Algeria's most prolific and well-known writer. His work covers the breadth of 20th century Algerian history, focusing on Algeria's fight for independence.\nWith an HPI of 65.01, Isaac Alfasi is the 10th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 18 different languages.\nIsaac ben Jacob Alfasi ha-Cohen (1013–1103) (Hebrew: ר' יצחק אלפסי, Arabic: إسحاق الفاسي) - also known as the Alfasi or by his Hebrew acronym Rif (Rabbi Isaac al-Fasi), was a Maghrebi Talmudist and posek (decider in matters of halakha - Jewish law). He is best known for his work of halakha, the legal code Sefer Ha-halachot, considered the first fundamental work in halakhic literature. His name \"Alfasi\" means \"of Fez\" in Arabic, but opinions differ as to whether he ever lived in Fez.\nPantheon has 19 people classified as writers born between 110 and 1955.

Maiolino was born in Italy. Her family immigrated to Brazil in the mid-40s. In the early 1960s, she became associated with the thriving performance and conceptual art movements of Neo-Concretism, Objectivism and the Nova Figuração, establishing a strident Tropicalia, with bright colors, incorporating the moods and indigenous imagery of Amazonia.\nMaiolino works across media, focusing on performance, sculpture, and video; she first gained prominence in the 1960s. The Brazilian Neo-Concretism of the 1950s and 1960s rigorously developed an aesthetic defined by the explicit performance and interrogation of the social exchange of art. In 1959, Ferreira Gullar, a prominent Brazilian poet, wrote a “Neo-concrete Manifesto” decrying the scientism of modern art. He urged creative inquiry towards the “moment of becoming” for art “non-objects.” For Gullar spectators become part of the art experience, through contemplating and participating the work. It is only through social exchange that art objects have any meaning.\nMaiolino’s early experiments are documented in procedure based diagrams and performance directions.\nThe exhibit is spare. Curators focus on the textural elements of Maiolino’s large scale performance pieces. There’s a floor covered in modeling clay. There are the inky and trailing diagrams of her dances.\nObjectivism, as a kind of process based performance, does not suggest the possibility of a performance without subject, rather, the exposing of subject through constraint or procedure.\nHer imagery returns to the vessel, something that cannot be filled. There’s an aspect of latent nationalism. But it’s the utopian nationalism of 1950s Brasilia; steeped in the notion that Brazil might emerge as a multicultural state that also had a coherent sense of self. Tropicalia, and especially the Nova Figuração was hyper technological, using new colors and methods, and hypervisceral in every sense of the word.\nMaiolino explicitly drew on psychoanalysis often describing the human body as constructed around an essential lack. This lack, and the duodenum, make up a piece of human bodies moving forward through the world.\nIn one piece, Maiolino converted a friend’s room into a clutter of dung heaps, modeling clay squeezed out into long trailing castings. For Maiolino, this is an apartment, empty save the phantom casings of a missing person.\nFor Maiolino, looking at the waste that bodies produce, celebrates those bodies, and affirms the existence of those bodies.\nThe process of moving through the world, creating waste, and especially moving against a lack or void within our bodies, that urges us forward, is an important aspect of her compulsive and intricate set pieces. There is an ethic in devouring social affect, and the humanizing experience of putting another person’s body inside your body, in cannibalism or in love.\nIn another piece, three women share a piece of thread that winds through their mouths. Pulling thread in, the drawing in of a line, captures that essentially modernist mode of seeking the thread, the pattern; this emerges in the assembling of mass mediated dispatches into a coherent story, the modernist mystery, or of assembling a truth from many disparate parts.\nMaiolino shares many tones and compulsions with her peer Lygia Clark. Another peer is essentially Doris Salcedo. All three of these artists honed in on the manner the mechanics of authoritarianism necessarily co-opted the technology and cultural artifacts of everyday life into a system of control.\nMaiolino and the broader cohort of Lygia Clark, Hélio Oiticica, Lygia Pape and others, inaugurated a vocabulary for performance art that has persisted across the last sixty years. By the late 1960s, the leading voices of Brazilian art faced censure and intimidation. And her work, engaging the social exchange of information and affect, became an explicit critique of authoritarianism. As the regime disrupted the reality of the republic and sought to create new realities by undermining language and culture, everyday objects became complicit in the breaking down of dissident language. Chairs, shoes, radios, and telephones were warped in obscure performances, and Neo-Concretist appropriation of these mundane objects took on a desperate tenor. Challenging the dictatorship’s tendency to co-opt and destroy the language of peace and the language of community, Maiolino’s work became essential.\nHer pieces include defecation, mastication, and the ritualized performance of cannibalism.\nHelene Cixous wrote about the encounter, between bodies and other bodies that are inherently unknowable, represent a kind of cannibalism. She described the exchange of social affect between bodies, representing a kind of eating, and reinterpreting external bodies and languages with a newly constituted truth emerging from the encounter. Cannibalism, obviously, has never been about nourishment, rather it persists in relief against cultural edict. Oswald de Andrade, a seminal Brazilian Modernist, wrote a “Cannibal Manifesto,” in 1928 that argued for this exchange and performance. Evoking the Andrade call for a Brazilian art that centers indigenous folk cultures, Brazilian artists have return to ritualistic cannibalism describing a performance of the compulsive drive towards the little death. Both indigenous and European cultures have historical instances of ritualized cannibalism. Amazonian surrealist Pablo Palacio wrote about cannibalism as indigenous as well as in relation to Rabelais, representing a celebration of corporeality and the excess of body. Early modernists identified the way cannibalism often occurs as a recreation of a divine creation myth, or the symbolic consumption of a divine body. Cannibalism establishes the traditional erotic transcendental rupture. The sacrificial causing a little death. Like the fire sacrifice in a mid-summer festival. The procedure of tasting death, seeks to establish a knowable death.\nIn 1981, Maiolino performed a piece called Entrevidas, now included at the MOCA retrospective. In it, she laid out dozens of eggs across a city street, creating a minefield of perfect white orbs, and then danced across the street, perfectly avoiding the eggs. It’s a bravado celebration of the ecstatic as she danced faster and faster over the eggs, joined by partners, each touching down without rupture.\nThe bodies dancing across the field without collision captures a lovely and foundational tension of modernism. It recalls Kafka’s trapeze artist, who sought to remain forever suspended in the air, or Benjamin’s angels burning up and being reborn each day. All of this concerns the compulsive performance of language culture, against the inevitable collision, Oulipian clinamen. The uncanny aspect of the piece emerges as the eggs remain unbroken excluding a dramatic and symbolic crushing of an egg in the hand of a performer. As such, it’s an exuberant and energetic sleight of hand.\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher Lucretius elaborated on the tradition of Epicurean atomism famously establishing the notion of the swerve. For atoms falling across a void, in parallel paths, there is an inevitable swerve, or clinamen. This became an important organizing principle for chance operations in the service of the 20th century avant-garde. And important work emphasized the inevitability of the encounter, the performance of constancy, and the ritual of everyday performance.\nAs a post script, I’m reminded by this piece of a classic gag by the early film duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Hardy walks into a cantina where tough dockworkers drink and carouse. He orders a drink. He sets an egg on the table, and watches it. A tough asks him, “What are you going to do with that?” He replies, “I’ll bet you can’t put that egg in your mouth without breaking it.” The tough takes him on. And no sooner has he put the egg fully in his mouth, Hardy hits him on the chin, forcing him to break the egg. This starts a full on brawl and a line of toughs chase the little man from the bar. Outside his partner is waiting to knock them out and sell them as indentured sailors on a commercial ship bound for Shanghai. The egg always breaks."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a519129b-69cf-48c8-bb87-64b5650b886e>","<urn:uuid:3577cbbc-730d-4df8-aee2-abf363af8899>"],"error":null}

This modern certification system connects to the deep spiritual history of the pilgrimage, which became established as Europe's third great pilgrimage route following the discovery of St. James's remains in the early 9th century. The route gained significance because it met traditional pilgrimage criteria: it was challenging to reach, involved hardships and dangers (including wolves, bandits, and difficult river crossings), and was well-supplied with religious shrines and relics.

It should also have compartments and side pockets so you don't have to take everything out when you're looking for something.\n- As for weight, the overriding rule is “less is more”. Your rucksack should never weigh more than 7 kilos, or 10% of your weight. Remember how many footsteps and how many kilometres you're going to have to carry it on your back until you reach Santiago de Compostela. Don't succumb to the temptation to take things \"just in case\", as you'll find supermarkets, chemists, and a whole range of shops all along the route where you can pick up everything you need.\n- A sleeping bag, rain cape and mat are essential equipment. Don't forget your personal documents (ID card, passport or any other identifying document, and your medical card) and a basic first-aid kit. Remember to take a water bottle, and in addition to your sponge bag, a towel, soap powder for washing clothes, and clothes pegs.\n- Footwear is another key feature. It's best to use water-resistant mountain boots which adapt well to the shape of your foot (you should use half a size larger that your normal shoe size), well broken-in if possible. If they're new, try to get in some training with them at home before setting out.\n- Wear cotton socks always dry and put them on carefully to avoid chafing and blisters. A good way to prevent this is to put Vaseline on your feet. Take a pair of flip-flops for the shower and to give your feet a bit of a rest at the end of each stage.\nIf you're travelling by bike…\n- Bear in mind that there are sections and stages with variants for anyone doing the Way by bike. Some of these follow the main roads. They are usually well signposted, although you'll also find them described in specific guides.\n- If you can choose, the best thing is a mountain bike. Before setting out, it's a good idea to do a bit of training, as it's not at all the same thing pedalling along while carrying saddle bags with all your luggage, as without them.\n- Don't forget to give your bike a tune-up, and make sure to check particularly the brakes, gears and wheels. A helmet, cycling gear, waterproof, gloves and suitable footwear are essential equipment. And remember to pack a puncture kit and some tools for any possible breakdowns.\n- If you're sleeping in pilgrims' hostels, head for the ones with the greatest capacity, as until 8 pm pilgrims travelling on foot have priority.\n- Once in Santiago de Compostela, there's a Left Luggage service for rucksacks and bikes at the Pilgrims' Office (Rúa do Vilar).\nIf you're travelling on horseback…\n- Doing the Way on horseback requires more preparation. As well as getting your horse used to carrying loads, you'll also need to take the animal to the vet for its vaccinations, and to take out some insurance.\n- It's a good idea to reserve places for your horse to stay overnight and to prepare the sacks of feed it'll need along the route.\n- The local police need to be given several days' advance notice if you're entering Santiago de Compostela on horseback (tel. 092), so they can tell you what time to come and the route you have to take. They'll also issue a permit allowing you to enter the Plaza del Obradoiro square, and to stay in front of the Cathedral for a limited period of time.\nAccommodation on the Way\nYou'll find a whole range of different kinds of accommodation to choose from all along the route, according to your needs and preferences: pilgrims' hostels, rural lodgings, hotels, Parador hotels, guesthouses, campsites…\n• Pilgrims' hostels\n- There are public hostels which are free, and others where you're required to pay a small donation to cover the costs of cleaning and maintenance. There are also private hostels which cost a little more. The public hostels are usually the first to fill up.\n- At times when the Way is very busy, for example in the summer months and in Jacobean years, other spaces such as sports centres, churches etc. are sometimes called into service to accommodate pilgrims overnight if everything is full.\n- Places in hostels can't be reserved; they're allotted to pilgrims strictly on a first-come, first-serve basis. Foot pilgrims have priority, then those on horseback and then cyclists.\n- You can only spend one night in each hostel, except in the case of illness. They usually open at midday, and after 9 or 10 in the evening there is a \"rule of silence\", when no noise is permitted so people can get some rest. In the morning you have to be out by 8 or 9 to allow time for the staff prepare to receive the day's pilgrims. In some hostels, breakfast is included.\n• Other accommodation\n- All along the route, you'll find a range of different possibilities in the various towns and villages you pass through. You can choose from the family-style welcome you'll find in the rural lodges, to the charm of sleeping in genuine restored historic buildings, as is the case of the Parador hotels in León and Santiago de Compostela.\n- This is the best option when you feel like staying on for a few days to explore a particular spot that has caught your attention, when you want to enjoy one of the local festivities, or simply to make a stop on your route.\n- It's also a good idea to choose an option other than the pilgrims' hostels if you're travelling with a support car or with a large group.\nOther things you need to know…\n- The established stages for foot pilgrims generally consist of stretches of between 20 and 30 kilometres a day; and between 60 and 70 kilometres for cyclists. However, everyone can plan their route according to their age, pace or physical condition, making the stages longer or shorter as they wish.\n- Always follow the yellow arrows. Keep your eyes open, as you'll find them all in a variety of places: on walls, on the ground, on trees, stones, posts, etc… If you ever get lost or can't make out which way to go, just ask. There will always be someone happy to point you in the right direction.\n- It's a good idea to start the day with a hearty breakfast. Sweets or dried fruit and nuts are ideal for a quick energy fix along the route. Remember to drink lots of water while on the road, even if you don't feel thirsty. You'll find plenty of drinking fountains along the way where you can fill your water bottle or flask.\n- And for lunch and dinner, there are all kinds of restaurants, cafés and bars where you can get your strength up again, as well as sampling the typical gastronomy of each area. Some places also offer a “pilgrim's menu ” at a reasonable price.\n- Dress according to the time of year. From spring to autumn is a good time to do the Way, always bearing in mind that July and August are the hottest months, and the time when you're likely to find the most people.\n- Make sure you take comfortable clothing which breathes. Take a sweater or something warm for the nights, and a hat and some sun cream to protect yourself from the sun.\n- You show your \"passport\" (or \"credencial\") when you stay in the pilgrim's hostels. You can acquire it in the hostel where you start out on the Way; or else at the associations of Friends of the Way (Amigos del Camino) before you start your journey.\n- The \"passport\" is not the same as the “Compostela”: this is granted to pilgrims who are travelling for religious or spiritual reasons and who have done at least the last 100 kilometres to Santiago on foot or on horseback, or the last 200 kilometres by bike, as a general rule.","History: Pilgrims have been travelling to Santiago de Compostela on foot or on horseback (and more recently by bicycle) for over a thousand years. Godescalc, Bishop of Le Puy, France, went to Santiago in 951 AD and was one of the first pilgrims to make the journey. At the height of the pilgrimage’s popularity in the 11th and 12th centuries over half a million people are said to have made the pilgrimage from different parts of Europe each year, the majority of them came from France.\nPilgrimages had been popular with Christians ever since Constantine the Great had the Church of the Holy Sepulcher built over the site of Christ’s burial in Jerusalem in 326 AD, and the discovery, shortly afterwards of the Holy Cross itself. Those journeying to this shrine were known as palmeros (palmers). Romeros went to Rome, the burial-place of Saint Peter and the great center of Christian pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. The third pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela was established after the finding of the remains of Saint James the Great (son of Zebedee, brother of John, Christ’s cousin and one of the twelve apostles) during the early part of the 9th century.\nThe high point of the Camino de Santiago de Compostela occurred between the years 1000 and 1500. Although numbers dwindled after that due to the Reformation and other political factors, the stream of pilgrims trudging westwards from different parts of Europe to the far reaches of Galicia in northwest Spain never completely dried up. Since the late 20th century the Camino has been experiencing somewhat of a resurgence.\nLegend: After the death of Christ, the disciples dispersed to different parts of the then known world to spread the Gospel as they had been bidden. Little is known about the life of St. James, but after Christ’s death, he went to Spain where he spent a couple of years evangelizing. He returned to Jerusalem but was beheaded by Herod shortly after his return in 44 AD.\nImmediately following his martyrdom, his followers are said to have taken his body to Jaffa, on the coast, where a ship was miraculously waiting for them and they set off back to Spain. They landed in Iria Flavia on the coast of Galicia, present day Padrón, some 20 kms from what is now Santiago de Compostela. The journey from Jaffa to Iria Flavia, in a stone boat, has been purported to have taken only a week thereby providing proof of angelic assistance.\nSt. James’ body was buried in a tomb on a hillside, along with two of his disciples and forgotten for the next 750 years.\nEarly in the 9th century a hermit living nearby had a vision (which he subsequently reported to the bishop of Iria Flavia) of a very large bright star, surrounded by a ring of smaller stars shining over a deserted spot in the hills. This matter was investigated and a tomb containing three bodies was found, immediately identified as those of St. James and two of his followers.\nWhen the King of Asturias, Alfonso II, visited the site, he declared St. James the Patron Saint of Spain. Alfonso had a church and a small monastery built over the tomb in the Saint’s honor, around which the town of Santiago sprung up. It was known as Santiago (for St. James) campus de la stella or campus stellae, later shortened to Compostela.\nAnother explanation of the word Compostela is that it is derived from the Latin componere (to bury), as a Roman cemetery or early Christian necropolis is known to have existed under the present day cathedral in Santiago – where the remains of St. James are still believed to be housed today.\nThe Pilgrimage: News of the discovery spread and soon the Camino de Santiago de Compostela was established as the third great pilgrimage route in Europe.\nSantiago de Compostela was attractive as a pilgrimage route because it fulfilled the various criteria necessary to make a pilgrimage worthy of merit. It was far and difficult to reach, thus requiring a good deal of hardship and endurance to arrive there. It was sufficiently dangerous – there were wolves, bandits, fever, rivers that were difficult to cross, unscrupulous ferrymen – as well as being in Spain, then locked tight in a struggle with the Moors.\nThe road itself, both through France and in Spain, was also well supplied with shrines, relics and other sights worth seeing. As pilgrim numbers increased, roads, bridges and hospices were built. The pilgrimage churches were characterized by their ambulatories round the inside of the building to facilitate viewing of the relics exposed behind the high altar.\nMany churches in Spain are dedicated to St. James, many of which contain his statue, whether as Apostle or Pilgrim or as Matamoros (the Moor slayer)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2cb326df-eaf0-4c43-931d-55471c330826>","<urn:uuid:5a2ee882-a8bc-4199-b35e-44b751ef5faa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the demographics of student protesters differ between Kent State University in 1970 and Peking University during the 1919 May Fourth Movement?","answer":"The student protesters at these institutions came from notably different backgrounds. Kent State was characterized as a working-class university with 80% of students coming from Ohio, many from surrounding counties and cities like Cleveland and Akron. Many Kent State students held after-school jobs to meet tuition costs, and the university had modest admission standards, accepting any graduate from an accredited Ohio high school. In contrast, the Peking University students who participated in the May Fourth Movement were influenced by Western thought and were part of the intellectual elite, with many being traditional scholar-officials who were advocating for cultural reforms and modernization of Chinese society.","context":["May Fourth Movement (1919)\nAt the end of the First World War, in 1918, China was convinced it would be able to reclaim the territories occupied by the Germans in present-day Shandong Province. After all, it had fought along with the Allies. However, it was not to be. The warlord government of the day had secretly struck a deal with the Japanese, offering the German colonies in return for financial support. The Allies, on the other hand, acknowledged Japan's territorial claims in China. When it became known in China in April 1919 that the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles would not honor China's claims, it gave rise to a movement that might be considered even more revolutionary than the one that ended the Empire.\nIn the course of this May Fourth Movement (五四运动, Wusi Yundong), some 5,000 students from Peking University hit the streets to demonstrate against the Versailles Treaty. But more was at stake than Japan's grabbing of land. When one considers the 1911 Revolution as a mere regime change, it becomes clear that the numerous popular demands for modernization had not been satisfied yet.\nThe May Fourth Movement was part cultural revolution, part social movement. On the cultural side, the students had been inspired in the preceding two decades by Western thought, creating a feeling of frustration and dissatisfaction with Chinese tradition. In the intellectual ferment that resulted from this, answers were sought for the questions why and how China had lagged behind the West. The negative influences of traditional morality, the clan system and Confucianism were seen as the main causes. China in its sorry state could only be cured by 'Two Doctors': Doctor Science and Doctor Democracy.\nAt the same time, intellectuals united in the New Culture Movement attempted to make Chinese culture more accessible to social groups beyond the traditional scholar-officials. To this end, they advocated a Literary Revolution, in which wenyan 文言, the ossified system of written language, was to be replaced by a system based on the vernacular, so-called baihua 白话. Hu Shi is one of the scholars identified with this movement, whereas Lu Xun is seen as one of the most prolific practitioners of this type of writing that came into being in the 1920s.\nThe social aspects of May Fourth consisted of attempts to emancipate the Chinese woman, although this was often limited to movements to bring footbinding to a halt. Nonetheless, in the cities newly liberated women, 'modeng [modern]' girls who had been educated, became a loud voice for further changes.\nMay Fourth is seen as a catalyst for the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Before 1919, there was hardly any interest in what was happening in Russia. After May Fourth, Marxism was seen as a workable revolutionary ideology for a predominantly agrarian society such as China still was.\nEven today, May Fourth functions as a point of reference for China. The Party may interpret the events of 1919 as being brought about by its earliest members, it may turn Lu Xun into the Marxist writer he would refuse to be, the fact remains that May Fourth truly set China on its revolutionary path.\nChow Tse-tung, The May Fourth Movement: Intellectual Revolution in Modern China (Cambridge, etc.: Harvard University Press, 1960)\nRana Mitter, A Bitter Revolution: China's Struggle with the Modern World (Making of the Modern World) (Oxford, etc.: Oxford University Press, 2004)","Read an excerpt from Howard Means’s new history of the Kent State shootings\nBy Stephanie Bastek\nApril 26, 2016\nThis year marks the 46th anniversary of the Kent State shootings, when the Ohio National Guard killed four unarmed students and injured nine others, changing the course of the Vietnam War. Days before, Richard Nixon had announced a new invasion of Cambodia, and campuses erupted in protest across the country. At Kent State, a demonstration quickly turned into riots, leading the mayor of Kent to call in the National Guard. It was during a rally of 2,000 people on the university commons that the National Guard fired into the crowd.\nHoward Means’s new book, 67 Shots—so named for the number of rounds fired over 13 seconds—incorporates newly available oral history from the university’s archives and extensive interviews to make sense of a volatile, violent moment in America’s history. Read an excerpt from Means’s analysis of the shootings, in which “every party to the tragedy made the wrong choices at the wrong time in the wrong place.”\nLater, after Neil Young’s “four dead in Ohio” anthem, after the nine wounded and the national shock and the bitter editorial recriminations in all directions, it would be common to ask: Why Kent State? This wasn’t Berkeley or Columbia or even Ohio State, about three hours southwest, where students and police had been in running battles for more than two weeks when Kent State finally erupted so spectacularly.\nKent State was commonly described as a working-class university and a local one: 80 percent of the students were from Ohio, many from surrounding counties and close-in cities like Cleveland and Akron. Admission standards were modest. By law, Kent State had to accept any graduate of an accredited Ohio high school. Someone had nicknamed the school “Suitcase U” because so many students headed home for the weekend. After-school jobs were common to help meet tuition. One popular work option as the Vietnam War heated up was the National Guard, a sure paycheck and a refuge from the Selective Service draft.\nMany Kent students assumed that a kind of firewall—part demographics, part tradition, part “otherness”—exempted their school from the front lines of the war against the war. Richard Karl Watkins, an undergraduate in 1970, recalled talking only a few weeks earlier about the Ohio State unrest with one of the cafeteria workers as he stood in line at an on-campus eatery. “I remember one of us saying we were glad we were in Kent because that [kind of thing] wouldn’t happen here. We’re not like Ohio State. . . . In retrospect, it seems absurd. Seemed very real when we were talking about it.”\nIn fact, Kent State had a robust history of political unrest that had flown under the radar of national attention, precisely because the school was so regional. By the mid-1960s, antiwar activism was a staple of campus life, sometimes with a dramatic flair. Timothy App recalled the homecoming parade his freshman year, 1966: “All the organizations on campus built floats. The parade went right down Main Street. One float was an old, burned-out car. The members were walking in silence beside it, with gas masks on and dressed in military paraphernalia. The townspeople hated it.”\nExcerpted from 67 Shots: Kent State and the End of American Innocence by Howard Means. Copyright © 2016.

{"question":"What are the standard betting options at sportsbooks, and what new challenges have emerged with online sports betting in Ohio?","answer":"Standard sportsbooks offer bets on various sports including baseball, basketball, football, soccer, and golf, with options like spread bets and parlays. Spread bets are based on margins of victory - for example, if a team is favored by 11.5 points, they must win by more than that margin. With online sports betting in Ohio, new challenges have emerged due to the rapid-fire nature of betting apps and websites. These platforms enable repeated betting and micro-bets on small parts of games in real-time, which can lead to patterns of chasing losses and potential gambling problems.","context":["Sports betting is a fun way to wager on a variety of sporting events. Whether you’re into football, basketball, hockey or any other sport, there’s a sportsbook that can suit your needs. Depending on your state, you may be able to place a bet in person or online.\nA sportsbook accepts bets on a wide range of sports and popular events, including baseball, basketball, football, soccer, golf and more. They also offer parlays and other special bets. Some sportsbooks also offer rewards and bonuses for placing bets, so it’s worth checking out a few before you make your first one.\nThe odds you see at a sportsbook are usually displayed on an odds board or in paper format. They’re updated throughout the day and can fluctuate based on the number of bets placed by customers.\nYou can also check the odds and payouts online if you have an account with an online sportsbook. Oftentimes, these numbers will include the amount you bet and any potential winnings, so it’s worth taking a look before you decide to place your bet.\nBetting odds are a key factor in choosing the best sportsbook for your money. You want to find a book that has odds you can afford, especially if you’re new to sports betting. You should also research how long it takes to withdraw funds from your account, as some sportsbooks will take longer than others.\nSpread bets are a type of betting that offers odds based on margins of victory. These bets can be placed on any team or player and are based on their expected margin of victory. For example, if the Los Angeles Rams are a 11.5 point favorite against the Seattle Seahawks, the sportsbook will set the line at 11 points. This means that the Rams must win by more than that margin to win the bet.\nIn order to keep the odds competitive, sportsbooks set a minimum wage for employees and pay them a commission on every bet they place. They must also comply with local laws, including those regulating online gambling.\nA sportsbook can also adjust their lines and odds to attract more bettors. This is done in an attempt to generate more profit, but it can also result in losing bets for players. When the majority of bettors bet on a side, it can skew the odds to favor that team, so adjusting the lines and odds is an important part of making sportsbook business profitable.\nBettors can bet on a single game or they can wager on multiple games in a row. This is a great strategy for those who want to take advantage of multiple teams’ strengths and weaknesses.\nYou can also bet on a game’s total score, or the combined number of runs, goals and points scored by the two sides in a matchup. This type of bet is a great way to predict how a game will end, and it’s especially useful in games where both teams are likely to score a lot of points.","Authorized Sports activities Betting Has Began in Ohio.

{"question":"Being involved in religious architecture projects, I wonder what are the qualification requirements for murti installation in temples, and how should the construction documentation address these special requirements?","answer":"For murti installation, qualified priests must perform the Prana pratishta ceremony, as murtis are only considered worthy of worship after the divine is properly invoked. The murtis must follow specific religious proportions and gestures according to tradition, particularly for mantramurti (idol with power) installation in classical temples. From a construction documentation perspective, these special requirements need detailed specifications that describe: quality of materials, construction methods, specific dimensions, and installation procedures. Since this involves special religious requirements, it would fall under 'special specifications' rather than standard specifications, requiring consultants to write specific guidelines for this specialized work to ensure proper execution while maintaining religious authenticity.","context":["In Hinduism, a murti (Devanagari: मूर्ति) typically refers to an image which expresses a Divine Spirit (murta). Meaning literally \"embodiment\", a murti is a representation of a divinity, made usually of stone, wood, or metal, which serves as a means through which a divinity may be worshiped. Hindus consider a murti worthy of serving as a focus of divine worship only after the divine is invoked in it for the purpose of offering worship. The depiction of the divinity must reflect the gestures and proportions outlined in religious tradition.\nThe murti is regarded by Hindus and also by some Mahayana Buddhists (e.g. Muktinath) during worship as a point of devotional and meditational focus. Puja of murtis is recommended, especially for Dvapara Yuga, and described in Pañcaratra texts.\nRole of murtis in worship EditMurtis are sometimes abstract, but are almost always representations of gods in anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms like Shiva, Ganesha, Rama, Kali, etc. Murtis are made according to the prescriptions of the Śilpa Śāstras. The alloy Panchaloga is sometimes used. They are installed by priests through the Prana pratishta ('establishing the life') ceremony.\nDevotional (bhakti) practices centered on cultivating a deep and personal bond of love with a god often include veneration of murtis. Some Hindu denominations like Arya Samaj and Satya Mahima Dharma, however, reject it, equating it with an idol worship.\nAccording to Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, “This is similar to our ability to communicate with others through the telephone. One does not talk to the telephone; rather the telephone is a way to interact with another person. Without the telephone, one could not have a conversation across long distances; and without the sanctified image in the temple, one cannot easily talk with the Deity.” \nAccording to the Agamas, the स्थूलमूर्ति / बिम्बमूर्ति (bimbamurti, corporeal idol) is different from the मन्त्रमूर्ति (mantramurti, the idol with power), which is worshipped in classical temples. The mantramurti in the bimbamurti is worshipped only by the use of the appropriate rituals, gestures, hymns and offerings.\nMaterials used in MurtisEdit\nSee also Edit\n- ↑ 1.0 1.1 Klostermaier, Klaus K.

They provide a detailed description of the materials, products, systems, and techniques to be used in the construction of a building, and serve as a guide for contractors and subcontractors during the construction phase.\n- Detailed description of the process of all workmanship and materials which are required to complete a building or project in accordance with its drawings and details.\n- The data regarding the materials and workmanship is conveyed in a separate contract document known as the “Specification” for the work.\n- Best example to understand the specification is, making Tea.\n- There are different steps in making tea.\n- Collecting ingredients\n- Method and right quantity of all ingredients.\n- If any of the ingredients vary from there quantity, tea losses its taste & looks.\n- Similarly Specification in construction tell about quantity of the material & method of the preparation of the material like RCC, casting slab, about excavation, masonry work etc.\n2) Need of specifications\n- Support for our drawings\n- Agreement between client and architect\n- Providing solution to challenges\n- The cost of an unit quantity of work is governed by its specification.\n- Specification of a work are required to describe the quality & quantity of different materials required for a construction work and is one of the essential contract documents.\n- This also specifies the workmanship and the method of doing the work.\n- A work is carried out according to its specification and the contractor is paid for the same.\n- As the rate of a work is based on specification, a contractor can calculate the rates of various items of works in a tender with his procurement rates of the material & labour.\n- Specification is necessary to specify the equipment’s, tools & plants to be engaged for a work and thus enables to procure them before hand.\n- The necessity of specification is to verify and check the strength of material for a work involved in a project.\n- Specification is an essential contract document and is required for arbitrator or court cases.\n- A structure, such as a wall, built of bricks\n- Providing and doing 230 mm thick brickwork in first class brick in 12mm thick mortar 1:5 (1 cement : 5 – badarpur sand) in English bond in straight or curved profile at all levels in perfect alignment, level and plumb to the entire satisfaction of engineer in-charge.\n- The brickwork shall be cured for 7 days with portable water.\n3) Good specifications\ni) Time management\n- Each stage of Project proceeds smoothly.\n- Procuring and organising materials and labour ensures proper Time Management of the Work\nii) Quality control\n- Specifications written with clarity about the materials and the process of workmanship have better control on the Quality of work\niii) Minimal litigations\n- Clarity and accuracy on description of work and procedure of carrying out works will avoid and confusion and litigation\niv) Financial planning\n- Clarity and specific instructions help in working out accurate pricing/ cost of the items of works of the Project\n4) Types of specifications\ni) Brief Specifications\n- Brief specification gives the nature and class of work and materials in general terms to be used in the various parts of the work.\n- It is a short description of different parts of the work specifying materials, proportions, qualities etc.\n- General specifications give general idea of the whole work or structure and are useful for preparing the estimate.\n- These general specifications do not form part of the contract document.\nGeneral specifications of some works involved in the construction of a residential building\n- Foundation Concrete: Cement concrete 1:4:8 using 40 mm size blue granite broken stone.\n- Foundation and Basement: Brickwork in cement mortar 1:5 using first class bricks.\n- Super Structure: Brickwork in cement mortar 1:6 using first class bricks.\nii) detailed specification\n- The detailed specification of an item of work specifies the qualities and quantities of materials, the proportion of mortar, workmanship, the method of preparation and execution and the method of measurement.\n- The detailed specifications of different items of work are prepared separately which describe what the work should be and how they should be executed and constructed.\n- Detailed specifications are written to express the requirements clearly in concise form avoiding repetition and ambiguity.\n- The detailed specifications are arranged as for as possible in the same sequence or order as the work is carried out.\n- The detailed specifications form a part of the contract document.\niii) Standard specifications\n- Standard specifications are those which remain same for various types of projects.\n- Different public sector organizations collect data from various types of construction work and published data in the form of a book. (CPWD Specifications)\niv) Special specifications\n- Sometime construction projects are of special type.\n- Specifications for these types of projects are not mentioned in detailed specifications book. Consultant has to write specifications for this type of work\n5) Essential Requirements of good Specification writing\ni) Subject matter\n- The subject matter of specifications should relate to the information required after the contract is given to a particular contractor. The requirements which are to be enforced should only be included in the specifications.\n- All sentences of the specifications should comply with the rules of grammar. The style and tense should remain the same throughout.\niii) Selection of words\n- While writing specifications, only suitable words with desired meaning should be used. Unfamiliar words or words having more than one meaning should never be used in the specifications.\n- The information given in the specifications should be complete and correct.\nv) Practical limits and commercial sizes\n- The specifications should be framed keeping in view the practical limitations of materials and workmanship and they should not specify practical impossibilities.\n- The specifications should be fair and they should not be framed in such a way as to throw all the risks on the shoulders of the contractor.\n- The sentences of the specifications should be short, simple and concise.\n6) Points to be Included in the Specifications\nThe specifications shall contain the following points:\n- Quality of materials to be used with strength/size requirements,\n- Quantity of materials to be used and the methods of measurements to be followed.\n- Method of mixing when different materials are used.\n- Construction methods to be followed mentioning the equipment and machinery to be used.\n- Dimensions of works such as breadth, thickness etc.,\n- Methods of measurements of works for payments.\n7) Detailed specification of for brickwork in cement mortar 1: using first class bricks in super structure\n- Bricks shall be table molded, well burnt in approved kiln, copper coloured, free from cracks and with sharp and square edges.

{"question":"What are the fundamental design principles in formalist architecture, and how does postmodern philosophy impact architectural meaning and purpose?","answer":"Formalist architecture emphasizes rational design principles where form follows function, with theorists like Viollet-le-Duc asserting that beautiful buildings must be rational and Otto Wagner promoting consistency between form, purpose, and materials. These principles established that architectural elements should have clear purposes and meanings. However, postmodern philosophy fundamentally challenges this approach by arguing that there is no universal truth or meaning that can be discovered through rational investigation. This philosophical stance translates into architecture through the deliberate rejection of purposeful design, as demonstrated in postmodern buildings that incorporate meaningless elements like purposeless pillars and stairways leading nowhere. The postmodern view suggests that since truth is socially constructed rather than objectively determined, architecture need not adhere to traditional functional principles or contain inherent meaning.","context":["This is a flash visit to architectural theory. Because I was really intrigued by a statement toward particular design in the studio: “This is obviously just a form making. And this is wrong.” Curious.\nAnd the thing is, the author of a resource in this visit is actually the Head of School in UQ.\nWhat is Formalism?\nThe definition is vary, because there’s no agreement upon this subject.\n- K. Michael Hays: “The comparative absence of historical concerns in favor of attention to the autonomous architectural objects and its formal operations\n- Russian Formalism: anti-realist, denying that morality or philosophy should be the concern of literature.\n- Germany Formalism: their aesthetic emerged antagonistically in response to classical theories of imitation and representation in the arts. Form was no longer thought of as an expression of content but as co-existing with the idea. à Art aim new reality.\n- Joseph Kosuth: “Art is abstract in relationship to cultural meanings, in the way that the noises we utter called words are meaningful only in relation to a linguistic system, not in relation to the world.”\n- Perez-Gomez: “For more than two centuries, architects, critics, and theoreticians have been arguing functionalist and formalist positions, opposing art to social interest and ethic to poetic expressions.\n- Mieke Bal: “Aesthetics is also a context, which is why formalism necessary fails.”\n- Formalism has been used to promote, provoke, or dismiss one art or architectural practice over another, not so much on aesthetic grounds as on ethical or moral differences. (Kaji-O'Grady, 2012)\n- Clement Greenberg: introducing “Flatness”, which then also influenced the advent of ‘minimalism’ ‘pop’ and ‘novelty art’, and also influenced a shift of optical formalism in abstract painting to phenomenological formalism.\n- Viollet-le-Duc: good form was concieved as the outcome of the rational procedure of a careful consideration of function and structure.\n- Otto Wagner: shaping of form (Formgebung) should be consistent with its purpose and material. à well this is what we know as honesty which is really famous related with Modern architecture.\n- Mies van der Rohe: “We know no forms, only building problems. Form is not the goal but the result of our work..”\n- Viollet-le-Duc: a rational design method may not always result in a beautiful and satisfying formal outcome, buat a beautiful building is necessarily rational.\n- Formalist ambitions in the practice of architecture are, consequently, denied, or dismissed as socially irresponsible, culturally irrelevant, solipsistic, and arbitrary. (Kaji-O'Grady, 2012)\n- Jacques Derida: Architecture must have meaning, it must present it and through it signify. The signifying or symbolical value of this meaning must direct the structure and syntax, the form and function of architecture. It must direct from outside, according to a principle (arche), a foundmental foundation, a trancendence or finality (telos) whose locations are not themselves architectural. The experience of meaning must be dwelling.\n- Eissenman: Post-functionalism. Architectural autonomy (which is reminds me about Libeskind’s idea about architect’s signature) consist two part: (1) the search of the way to make the elements of architecture the wall, the beam, the column self-referential; (2) the development of the process of making that could produce self-reference without referring to the formal conventions of modernism.\n- Thomas Mical: Surrealism and Architecture (2005), that modernist architecture was essentially involved in formlessness. “Architecture must reamain void to function and incomplete to produce effects, because architecture can only be completed in the spatial immersion of the subject.”\n- Bataille: “Forms have become more and more static, more and more dominant”. Architecture is concerned with systematic aith the regulation of the plan, and with inspiring fear and control as a mechanism for social order. Then architecture and formlessness are oppositional categories.\n- Blur Building: Architecture of nothing. Obfucates visuality. Pursue non-form or temporary form through making their architecture from material from each situation – the human subject, climate, the object, and territory. (this is differennt from formlessness)\n- Robert Morris: “What art now has in its hands is mutable stuff which need not arrive at the point of being finalized with respect to either time or space.”\n- Software-generated architecture à neologism ‘performalism’. Works of Greg Lunn, Gehry, Eisenman, Open source, Reiser & Umemoto, etc. “Digital architecture’s formalism, realized through a multidimensional use of performance, offers a field of action by far wider than mere formalism, actually defining new needs and a new inessential concept of subjectivity.” (Grobman and Neuman, 2008 as cited in (Kaji-O'Grady, 2012))\n- Frei Otto: finding form through experiments intended to arrive at the optimization of materials and structure.\n- Performalism: (1) curvilinear and complex form Cartesian geometries. (2) some of which are not yet contructable, some are considered ‘ugly’ and formless by architects that remained commited to the orthogonal forms of modernism.\n- Catherine Ingraham: computatuional naturalism perpetuates a classical formalism in which programme, inhabitant, and occupant are cast aside from form-making.\nIn conclussions: formalism is neither a dead argument nor a fixed moment in history but it constantly reworked in light of new theories and practices. Formalist practice as a means for achieving some expression of resistance to the instrumentalism of capitalist society. (Kaji-O'Grady, 2012)\nKAJI-O'GRADY, S. 2012. Formalism and Forms of Practice.

I was minutes away from beginning my lecture, and my host was driving me past a new building called the Wexner Center for the Performing Arts.\nHe said, “This is America’s first postmodern building.”\nI was startled for a moment and I said, “What is a postmodern building?”\nHe said, “Well, the architect said that he designed this building with no design in mind. When the architect was asked, ‘Why?’ he said, ‘If life itself is capricious, why should our buildings have any design and any meaning?’ So he has pillars that have no purpose. He has stairways that go nowhere. He has a senseless building built and somebody has paid for it.”\nI said, “So his argument was that if life has no purpose and design, why should the building have any design?”\nHe said, “That is correct.”\nI said, “Did he do the same with the foundation?”1\nThe Foundation of Postmodernism\nI fully admit that I am not a professional philosopher and, while I was researching postmodernism, I stopped more than once to ask, “What did that just say?” I find it to be a very mind-bending philosophy, but will try to communicate the basics clearly and concisely.\nPostmodernism rejects the idea that objective, universal truth can be discovered through reason, observation and rational investigation. No person, institution, or discipline is neutral in its pursuit of truth and will therefore always offer an interpretation that is colored by its culture, language, history and gender. Truth is not something external that we can determine, but is socially constructed through our collaborative interactions. There is no ultimate “Truth” that corresponds with reality, but there are collective “truths” that are built by each individual. Postmodern philosopher Richard Rorty puts it this way, “We…[should] give up the correspondence theory of truth (i.e. truth is that which corresponds with reality), and start treating moral and scientific beliefs as tools for achieving greater human happiness, rather than as representations of the intrinsic nature of reality.”2\nLanguage plays a central role in the construction of “truth.” Jeff Myers explains, “Postmodernists think we cannot know the world directly. We only know it as we interpret it. Since our language structures our relationships, our talk about the objects in the world isn’t really about those objects at all: it’s really about ourselves.”3 So when we talk about an object, a moral truth, or a scientific idea, we aren’t talking about something with an objective, concrete essence but are only communicating our interpretation. Recognizing the role in which language shapes these interpretations, postmodernists hold suspicion about how language is used by the powerful as a tool of oppression to impose ideas on everyone else. One way this is accomplished is by the crafting of metanarratives, which provide a unifying story about reality. Postmodern philosopher Jean-Francois-Lyotard encouraged “incredulity towards metanarrative”4 because people’s experiences are too varied to provide a general, overarching statement about the world.\nTo postmodern literary critics, ultimately, even words themselves have lost objective meaning. In an essay titled “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes argues that the original and intended meaning of the text is not important, rather it is the interpretation of the reader that determines the text’s meaning. Postmodern literary critics claim that words cannot accurately describe the world. The writer cannot communicate about reality, but can only communicate about reality as understood by the reader.5\nOrigin – How did we get here?\nPostmodernism is skeptical of claims that science can provide a neutral, objective description of reality. Author Nancy Pearcey recounts the following story from a conference on science and postmodernism:\nPostmodernist philosophers led off by arguing that “there are no metanarratives,” meaning no overarching, universal truths. Responding on behalf of the scientists was Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who replied: But of course there are metanarratives. After all, there’s evolution – a vast metanarrative from the Big Bang to the origin of the solar system to the origin of human life. And since evolution is true, that proves there is at least one metanarrative….To which the postmodernist philosophers responded, ever so politely: That’s just your metanarrative. Evolution is merely a social construct, they said, like every other intellectual schema – a creation of the human mind.6\nPostmodernists claim that our observations are culturally and linguistically influenced and the knowledge that we gain from science cannot describe an objectively true nature. Terry Eagleton asserts, “Science and philosophy must jettison their grandiose metaphysical claims and view themselves more modestly as just another set of narratives.”7 Objective “Truth” about the origin of the universe, our solar system, and life on Earth is beyond our grasp.\nIdentity – What does it mean to be human?\nNothing at all. In their book on postmodern economics, David Ruccio and Jack Amariglio claim there is “no singular or unique ‘I.””8 Human beings do not possess a personality or human nature. We do not have souls, but are a “collage of social constructs.”9 Mitchell Stevens explains, “It’s not just that we have different sides to our personality; it’s that we have no central personality in relation to which all our varied behaviors might be seen as just ‘sides.’ We are, in other words, not absolutely anything.”10\nFrom a postmodern view, things, including human beings, don’t have any real, intrinsic essence. Human nature and value is not something that we can objectively describe, but something that is socially constructed and colored by our unique experiences and cultural perspectives.\nMorality – How should we live?\nAccording to British essayist Phillips, “Universal moral principles must be eradicated and reverence for individual and cultural uniqueness inculcated.” Postmodernism denies the existence of any universal morality against which we might judge right and wrong action. Instead, we must be content to live with what Jean-Francois Lyotard called “little narratives.” Moral truth is not revealed by a divine being or discovered by reason, but resides within the community. Each culture and community determines what is moral within its own circumstances and experiences. This leads to the obvious question, however. How does one judge between two communities with opposite, incompatible moral views?\nMeaning – Why are we here?\nAlbert Camus once said, “I have seen many people die because life for them was not worth living. From this, I conclude that the question of life’s meaning is the most urgent question of all.”11 Can postmodernism provide satisfying answers to this question? The worldview dismisses the existence of any external purpose and meaning for human life that we can apprehend and rejects any metanarrative that would attempt to provide an answer to the question of ultimate purpose.\nWhat we are left with is pragmatism. Since ultimate meaning and purpose are not “out there” waiting to be discovered, we must generate our own purpose, informed by our experiences and culture. In other words, each person must discover purpose, meaning, and significance in a manner that works for them.\nDestiny – What happens to us when we die?\nProbably at this point, you’ve noticed a pattern that postmodernism can’t really provide any answers to the big questions of life. Based on its own central tenets, postmodernists would deem these answers to be unknowable in an objective sense. However, metaphysical truth can be discovered in a pluralistic sense, based on preference rather than objective standards. A person’s claims about eternal matters may be true for them, but they don’t apply to everyone else.\nDespite claims of religious plurality, it seems that some postmodern thinkers have no problem rejecting certain metaphysical propositions. Richard Rorty claimed there was “no room for obedience to a nonhuman authority (i.e. God)” and endorses “forgetting about eternity.”12 Matters of heaven, hell, sin, and salvation compose a metanarrative that has been used by institutions to control and oppress. The very idea of God has been socially constructed through language. “God is a projection. When children have problems, they run to their father for protection. When adults have problems, they project their earthly father into the skies, and they run to this entity for comfort.”13\nAlthough reading about postmodernism sometimes feels like swimming in the philosophical deep waters, it seems to me that a person can refute the worldview without needing to graduate from “swimmies.” The worldview is self-defeating, which can be shown with simple logic. Postmodernism claims that there is no universal truth that can be known, but in doing so, makes a truth claim of its own that should be universally accepted. By rejecting all metanarratives, aren’t postmodern philosophers building their own metanarrative that there are no metanarratives? Postmodern literary critics assert that the words of the author have no objective meaning; instead, it is the interpretation of the reader that has meaning. Yet, I suspect that when these critics write books expressing this view they expect that the reader will be able to understand the message they are trying to communicate. If a student completely misinterprets their message, would they correct them or be satisfied that the student had constructed their own meaning?\nTo be charitable, I do think that postmodernism does raise some valid concerns, but takes them too far. We should be humble about the limits of our own knowledge, but that does not mean that truth is unknowable or does not exist. It is worthwhile to recognize how own life experiences and culture impact our own beliefs and pursuit of truth, but again, this does not mean that we are unable to perceive that which corresponds with reality.\nI want to return to the opening example of the Wexner Center for the Performing Arts, the postmodern building at “The” Ohio State University (a little joke for Michiganders, there). The architect felt the liberty to do all sorts of cute tricks with the building: false stairways, purposeless rooms, meaningless pillars. Yet, he didn’t dare do the same thing with the foundation that supported the building, but recognized its objective function and purpose.\nIn the same way, I feel that postmodernism plays a lot of cute, fancy words games while discussing the big questions of life. Yet, do they really live out their worldview? If we were standing in a road and a truck was hurdling towards us, would they say, “That’s just your opinion” if I warned them to move from its path? When they take a flight, do they want the pilot to trust that the instruments on the control panel are providing information that conforms with reality or would they rather the pilot construct their own truth? When the rubber meets the road, postmodernists do live as though objective truth does exist.\nMore than that, what would happen if we were to build the superstructure of human civilization on the foundation proposed by postmodern philosophy? We would be left with a foundation in which there is no intrinsic human nature or value, there is no standard by which to judge moral decisions, and there is no ultimate purpose or meaning to human life. I hope that humanity never needs to rise from the rubble that would ensue.\n1) Gilson, Tom. “The Wexner Center’s Foundations.” The Thinking Christian.

{"question":"How do the metrics used to measure growth differ between social media marketing and SaaS businesses, particularly in terms of customer retention and revenue tracking?","answer":"Social media marketing and SaaS businesses use distinctly different metrics to measure growth. In social media marketing, metrics focus on engagement levels, profile consistency, and audience reach, with both qualitative and quantitative objectives that need to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-framed). In contrast, SaaS businesses primarily focus on recurring revenue models and customer retention metrics. Key SaaS metrics include churn rates, customer lifetime value, and monthly recurring revenue (MRR), which help predict future revenue. While social media marketing looks at 'vanity metrics' like likes and followers alongside engagement and sentiment, SaaS companies concentrate on financial metrics like customer acquisition cost (CAC) and the CAC:LTV ratio to ensure business viability. The fundamental difference stems from SaaS's subscription-based model where revenue is collected over time, versus social media's focus on building ongoing engagement and reach.","context":["Developing a comprehensive strategy involves more than just planning your content and hoping to go viral.\nAs you work your way through each of the following 8 steps you’ll learn all the different elements of a strategy that you can work with to achieve great results.\nAll the elements of your strategy are connected to each other. Choices made in one element will affect the other elements. It’s important to realise this connection and to hold all the elements together.\n1. Start where you are\nIt’s important to understand the activity currently occurring on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube profiles. You’ll need to conduct a social media audit – a really important way to see what is and isn’t working when it comes to social media. Here’s how to do it:\n- Review and analyse your current online presence\nLook at which platforms you already have social accounts with and whether you should be looking into expanding onto other platforms to increase your reach. Look at your results and any goals you set and see if you met them. If you didn’t, look at why.\n- Assess your profile consistency\nNow you know where you are online, make sure your brand identity, style and profiles are consistent across all platforms. You want to make sure your brand (even if it’s a personal one) is clearly recognisable. This doesn’t mean each profile should be identical – just consistent.\n- Examine key and emerging competitors\nBy looking at those who are doing well in the social space, you can mimic and learn a lot. Find your key competitors and see how they are succeeding.\n- Review SEO results\nYour social media activity has an impact on your overall SEO results. Reviewing your current results gives you a benchmark to compare your success with down the track.\n- Conduct a SWOT analysis\nHaving gathered all the data, it’s important to now reflect on it and identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.\n2. Define Your Objectives\nYour objectives need to be driven by your organisation’s priorities. It’s a top-down process – a social media strategy exists to serve the broader marketing strategy which exists to meet your organisations vision, mission and values. It’s important that the tail isn’t wagging the dog!\nThe first step in developing an effective social media strategy is to clarify the organisation strategy. Similar to the Vision, Mission and Values this likely already exists. Making sure that this strategy is acknowledged at the top of the process will also be a great first step to getting buy-in from senior management and ensuring that the social media strategy serves its purpose.\nMoving down from the organisation strategy we come to the overall marketing strategy. This will be defined by your marketing team.\nNext in line is the social media strategy. Achieving success with social media requires a significant investment of time and resources. Aligning the social media strategy will help the organisation to allocate the right level of expenditure to achieve the desired return on investment. The social media strategy must align with both the business and marketing strategies.\nFinally, the content strategy is developed so that the content is aligned with the overall social media strategy.\nYour objectives need to be both qualitative and quantitative, they need to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-framed) and remember to include some BHAGS (Big Hairy Audacious Goals!)!\n3. Identify Your Audience\nKnowing your audience, their demographics, interests, motivations and preferred channels is crucial. This allows you to shape your message to suit your ideal audience. The creation of audience personas will help to create and serve relevant content to that audience.\nSo where exactly do we go to find all this information?\nFor a large, established company, buyer personas would come from analysis and research of existing data, questionnaires and customer interviews. If you already have a customer database, you may be able to extract some information from this, such as names and locations.\nIf you don’t have the means to collect and analyse this information, try looking to your customers. Pick someone who is either a top customer or one who is very engaged on your social channels. You can even reach out to them and ask if they are happy to be interviewed by your team – perhaps in exchange for free product or a discount code. This is a great way to get a true insight into who you are targeting.\nMarket or Online Research\nThere are multiple existing sources online where you can research and gather data about customer behaviours. Sites such as the Sensis Social Media report enable you to view statistics about social media usage in Australia.\nThis includes, frequency of use, most popular times, most popular platforms, where people are using social media, how different age groups compare, and more.\nYou really want to get into the head of your customer and think the way they would. This will help you target them even more effectively.\n4. Choose the Right Channel\nThe desire to be on all networks at once, or simply diving into all the well-known ones because you think you have to be on them, often sets in motion social media marketing activities which are hard to rewind. Choosing the right channel/s to use will mean more effective and efficient social media marketing.\nSelecting your channel based on these five ideas will help to ensure you use the right content, to engage the right people, on the right channels while meeting your business objectives and maximising your return on investment.\nPurpose: Your choice of channel/s will be guided by what suits your organisation’s purpose.\nAudience: Who is your audience on this platform? Are they your ideal audience? For example, If you are looking for business managers, then LinkedIn would be the best choice and you probably won’t find Instagram nearly as useful.\nChannel purpose: Understanding what each channel is for will also guide your choice. For example, Twitter is to share current news in short snippets, does this suit your organisation?\nContent: What type of content suits your organisation? Images? Videos? Infographics? What do you have the resources to develop? This will help determine which channels are a good fit for you.\nCost: This refers to a cost in $$ for advertising, but also a cost in time. Perhaps you are spending hours each week scheduling on Facebook, but getting nothing in return? Is it worth your time, or are you targeting the wrong platform?\n5. Create GREAT Content\nGood content is not good enough! To cut through the noise and sheer volume of content you have to be GREAT! You need to understand content categories and formats. Feeding your audience with great quality content will build an engaged relationship and is pivotal to success on social media\nThere are three content categories – Created, Curated and Co-created.\nCreated content is what you make yourself. Curated content is made by others and you share it (perhaps resizing by breaking it down or combining it). Co-created content is made in collaboration with others (including influencers and user-generated content).\nYour content will also serve one or more of three purposes – to entertain, to educate or to inspire. These are the three core purposes of good social media content. All three must add value to your audience.\nNathanial Bibby of Bibby Consulting Group says, “Before you post, you need to define your goal. Always ask ‘why would someone share this?’ ‘How is this going to engage my audience in conversation?’”\nTo entertain, consider posting amusing industry commentary, or thought-provoking content. To educate, include thought leadership content, tips, tricks, and insights. To inspire, share stories of relevant organisations or individuals who are excelling.\n6. Be Social\nIt’s called SOCIAL media for a reason! How you interact with your audience can make a big difference to their engagement levels. Collaborating with others and integrating influencer marketing alongside positive community management will strengthen your strategy.\nLook at brands that are working in a similar space. You ideally want to find a brand you can work alongside, rather than one you are in direct competition with. This way you will both benefit from the collaboration, rather than competing for the customers.\nThere are several benefits of integrating influencer marketing into your overall social media marketing strategy.\nLift in brand awareness\nMany influencers have significantly more followers and engagement than most brands. With the right influencer and the right content, you create a genuine lift in brand awareness.\nPositive brand association\nInfluencer marketing is a form of word-of-mouth marketing, creating powerful brand associations for an organisation.\nWith all forms of marketing, it’s important to convey your message to the right audience. If you look for an influencer in your niche, their followers will match your target market. This means you won’t just reach a larger audience, but also a more receptive and engaged audience.\nMost influencers have built their large follower-base through consistent content and community engagement. This means that partnering with an influencer could generate an organisation substantially more post engagement than their own brand is capable of getting.\nThe basic function of a community manager is to engage with the community on social platforms and encourage the conversation there. This involves responding to messages, comments and enquiries from the audience.\nCommenting and replying means that every post can result in a larger, potentially more intimate, conversation with your audience, which is not only imperative for brand management, but can also increase organic reach.\nA community manager also set the brand voice on the network and ensures that it stays consistent.\nComments that ‘surprise and delight’ will also keep your audience engaging with your posts, as well as looking out for further content in their newsfeed.\n7. Implement the Strategy\nAll the strategy in the world won’t give you results if you don’t implement it. Developing the strategy into an implementation plan to ensure the work is actually completed correctly and important deadlines are met will make all the work on your strategy worth it.\nOnce you’ve started creating valuable, relevant content, you must work out how to deliver (or ‘distribute’) the content to your target audience. After all, there is no point creating content if hardly anyone sees it!\nPaid social media advertising is imperative in today’s social media landscape because it:\n- Drives relevant reach at scale\n- Offers unique formats and call-to-actions (E.g. ‘Swipe up to learn more’ in Instagram Stories)\n- Generates greater ROI on your content creation efforts\n- Unlocks additional data and insights surrounding your performance\nIt’s important to have a framework or a plan around your paid social media ads to avoid wasting money or missing an opportunity to promote content. When running large campaigns with big budgets, marketers can outsource the management of paid social advertising to agencies who have experience in setting up, managing, and reporting on the success of campaigns.\nYou’ll need to set up you budget, identify the required human resources (both in-house and outsourced) and make sure that you pay attention to the relevant legal and ethical requirements.\nYou may need to consider the use of management tools to make your implementation plan efficient and save you some time!\n8. Analyse for Improvement\nTest, measure, analyse, reflect, repeat!\nOne of the key strengths of social media marketing is the availability of clear data and analytics on what you do. This data allows you to continually go back to all the other elements and improve your strategy and your results!\nYou’ll need to find and analyse the metrics that matter – understand your business objectives, put them into a marketing perspective, and then map them to tangible social media metrics.\nIt’s not just about ‘vanity metrics’ – likes, followers, reach and views. You’ll also need to research engagement, sentiment, traffic, subscribers and sales!\nA ‘One post, one metric’ approach will help you to have clarity about what each result means. Bringing all the data together will enable you to calculate the all-important cost-per metrics and ultimately your return on investment.\nBring it all together\nIf you’re serious about social media marketing (and we are!), then before you get into it, you need to invest the time in developing a comprehensive social media strategy. This will make your social media marketing stand out from the crowd and deliver the results that you’ve been looking for.","Top 10 SaaS Growth Metrics in 2023\nPlanning ahead to expand on these marketing strategies can give you an edge over the competition by allowing you to craft a plan that will deliver measurable results.\nOver the past few years, the SaaS industry has exploded onto the scene and won’t be slowing down anytime soon. The highest performing companies continue to grow exponentially, more doubling their teams and initial public offerings (IPOs) per year.\nAs SaaS companies continue to expand so rapidly, the possibility of market saturation does too. For that reason, it’s imperative that they are paying attention to the right growth metrics.\n- The rapid expansion of the SaaS industry necessitates a focus on the right growth metrics.\n- SaaS growth metrics are distinct due to recurring revenue models and emphasize customer retention.\n- The top 12 SaaS growth metrics include churn rates, customer lifetime value, customer acquisition cost, months to recover CAC, and monthly recurring revenue.\n- Also important are MRR growth rate, quick ratio, CAC : LTV ratio, customer engagement score, and customer health score.\n- Continuous tracking and analysis of these metrics are crucial for effective SaaS marketing strategies.\nWhat is a SaaS Growth Metric?\nThe key SaaS growth metrics are vastly different from metrics of other businesses that are one-time sales and transaction based. Primarily due to the fact that revenue is collected over time rather than upfront. This means that there should be a strong focus on retention.\nA strategic SaaS growth model should not only center around customer retention rates, but also be able to answer the following questions:\n- What is working well?\n- Is my business financially operable?\n- What areas need improvement?\n- What areas should be focused on to accelerate growth?\nThe growth metrics that matter most can be compared to the body’s temperature, heartbeat, and blood pressure. Much like a routine check-up at the doctor’s office, it’s important that SaaS companies are regularly monitoring these growth metrics to keep an eye on the health of their business.\nIt can be confusing to know which analytics will actually help you evaluate your growth accurately and which ones will not. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the top 12 SaaS growth metrics that will help you analyze the momentum, or your business’s ability to grow and keep growing, and make the right decisions to help your company expand.\n1. Churn Rates\nThe first SaaS growth metric we’d like to highlight is customer churn rate. This is a measurement of how much business you’ve lost within a certain amount of time and it is an essential aspect of monitoring the day-to-day vitality of your SaaS business.\nChurn metric provides you with specific insight on customer activity across a certain date or time period to help you better understand your customer retention rates.\nIf you only focus on driving new customers to your business, you won’t get too far as an SaaS. Since most SaaS businesses are based on annual subscriptions, it is just as important to maintain your existing customers. A certain amount of customer or revenue churn is inevitable, but tracking it can help you stay ahead of it, and identify any issues early on that might be pushing your customers away.\nIn order to effectively track your churn rates on a monthly or quarterly basis, it’s crucial to not only look at the customer count, but also any definitive information about the customers that might identify the reason why they decided to not renew their subscription. This information might include their demographic, job title, industry or other persona details. Be sure to discuss these characteristics across all departments, including marketing, sales and customer service to align goals.\nThere are multiple ways to measure your customer churn rate. User churn is calculated as the percentage of customers that were lost during a given time frame, while revenue churn is the percentage of revenue lost to churn during a given time frame.\nEither one of the two following churn rate calculations can be used to monitor growth. However, many companies will argue revenue churn is more crucial to focus on due to the fact that revenue is the ultimate goal.\nUser Churn = (Cancelled Customers in the last 30 days divided by Active Customers 30 days ago) x 100\nRevenue Churn = (MRR Lost to Downgrades & Cancellations in the last 30 days divided by MRR 30 days ago) x 100\n2. Customer Lifetime Value\nNext on the list as an essential metric to effectively evaluate your SaaS growth rates is your customer lifetime value, or CLV. This describes the average amount of money that your customers pay throughout their engagement with your business.\nThis SaaS growth metric will provide your company with a true representation of your growth and can be explained in just a few steps.\n- First, find your customer lifetime rate. To calculate your customer lifetime rate, you want to divide the number 1 by your customer churn rate (see above). For example, if your monthly customer churn rate is 1%, you would divide 1 by 0.01, which would give you a customer lifetime rate of 100.\n- Second, find your average revenue per account (ARPA). This is calculated by dividing your total revenue of a certain time frame by the total number of customers. For example, if your monthly revenue is $100,000 and your total number of customers is 100, your ARPA would be $1,000.\n- Finally, find your customer lifetime value. This is calculated by multiplying your customer lifetime rate by your ARPA. Continuing with the examples above, you woud multiply 100 (customer lifetime) by $1,000 (ARPA) and discover that your customer lifetime value is $100,000.\nUnderstanding your CLV gives you insight into what your average customer is worth. It can also work as a way to display value of your company to investors if your business is in the early stages and still considered a startup.\nBecause most SaaS businesses are based on subscription-based models, each renewal has the ability to yield another year of recurring revenue. This increases the lifetime value per customer.\n3. Customer Acquisition Cost\nAs you build your SaaS growth strategy, another key metric to pay attention to is your customer acquisition cost, or CAC. This will tell you exactly how much it costs your business to acquire new customers and the amount of value they bring to your business. Customer acquisition costs works hand in hand with CLV to help SaaS companies ensure that their business model is viable.\nIn order to calculate your CAC rate, you need to divide your total sales and marketing spend by the total amount of new customers added during a certain time period. Be sure to include personnel expenses. For example, if your monthly expenditures come out to a total of $100,000 and your acquired customers come out to a total of 100, your CAC would be $1,000.\nThis particular SaaS growth metric is especially important for newer companies to focus on. It allows you to manage your growth and correctly gauge the value of your acquisition processes.\n4. Months to Recover Your CAC\nTo piggyback on the importance of CAC, it is also helpful to analyze the amount of time it takes to recover your total customer acquisition costs. This metric allows you to understand how quickly a customer begins to generate revenue for your company. The goal is for this number to decrease over time as your business grows.\nTo accurately calculate this metric, you can follow this equation: CAC divided by MRR x GM. In other words, divide your CAC by your total monthly-recurring revenue (see below) and your gross margin.\n5. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)\nThe recurring nature of the typical subscription-based payment model makes it somewhat simple to track and gauge revenue. Monitoring your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) allows you to work out the amount of predictable revenue your customers generate each month.\nSaaS revenue run rates are guesses, at best. For example a SaaS platform that raised Series A of $10M, but is still pre-revenue stage needs to throw out big numbers for investors. While dozens of factors make-u a composite of monthly recurring revenue, it is a very core financial metric to track religiously in order to properly manage the month-over-month revenue growth of your business and boost momentum. When appropriately paired with your SaaS customer acquisition costs (CAC) and your customer churn rates, your SaaS monthly recurring revenue (MRR) can be used to anticipate and predict future revenue.\nTo successfully calculate your MRR for any given month, you simply add the recurring revenue generated by that specific month’s customers. The next few metrics we’ll be covering dive a little bit deeper into how MRR can help you manage your growth.\n6. MRR Growth Rate\nOnce you’ve calculated your MRR, you can then measure your SaaS MRR growth rate and evaluate the improvement of your revenue generation over time. For SaaS platforms, monthly recurring revenue growth rate is a percentage of your revenue run rate. For example, if your business generates $1,500 in MRR in March and then $2,000 in April, your MRR growth rate will be about 33%.\nTo maintain a steady MRR growth rate, your business needs to continuously generate more revenue each month. Therefore, if your MRR growth rate is steady, this is indicative of rapid, augmented growth.\n7. Quick Ratio\nThis next SaaS growth metric, known as the quick ratio, is the measurement of a business’s growth efficiency. Quick ratio allows you to understand how reliably your business can grow its revenue numbers given its current churn rate.\nTo accurately calculate your company’s quick ratio, you must divide your gained MRR by your lost MRR. If you have a quick ratio that is above 1.0, your company is growing. If it is under 1.0 however, this means your company is not. The bottom line is the higher your quick ratio, the healthier your company’s growth is going to be.\nQuick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR + Reactivation MRR) ÷ (Contraction MRR + Churned MRR)\nWhen calculating your quick ratio, it is important to note that all MRR is not created equal. There are different types of MRR that contribute to your MRR growth and understanding each of these types is key. The following is a list of the different MRRs to consider.\n- New MRR: MRR from new customers\n- Expansion MRR: MRR from existing customers (upgrades)\n- Reactivation MRR: MRR from churned customers who reactivated their account\n- Contraction MRR: Lost MRR from existing customers (downgrades)\n- Churned MRR: Lost MRR from canceled customers\nFor example, if a company has $10,000 in MRR growth, this might be a combination of any of the types of MRR listed above. The quick ratio helps you comprehend the difference in growth efficiency between them and provides the most straightforward picture of your business’s health.\n8. CAC : LTV Ratio\nAnother important calculation to include in your SaaS strategy to monitor your SaaS growth rates is your CAC to LTV ratio. This is a single metric that displays the lifetime value (LTV) of your customers and the total amount of capital that you spend to acquire them. It can point to the health of your SaaS marketing program as a way to show you what is working and what isn’t, so you can know what campaigns to invest in or change.\nTo find your CAC to LTV ratio, simply compare the two calculations. Generally speaking, your SaaS company should have an LTV that is at least three times more than your CAC. If it is lower, that could mean you’re spending too much money. If it is higher, you’re not spending enough.\nCustomer engagement scores allow you to see how likely a customer is to churn. It shows you how often they log in, what they use your software for and any other metrics pertaining to their engagement with your product.\nThe scales vary from business to business, depending on how a typical customer uses the software. In order to build your own SaaS customer engagement score, you should create a list of inputs and value assignments that predict a customer’s satisfaction and longevity. Start by looking at your happiest and longest-lasting customers.\nWith a clear list, you can calculate an overall client engagement score for your customers. This will allow you to efficiently evaluate customer health from one data point.\n10. Customer Health Score\nAnother metric that is similar to your customer engagement score is your customer health score. This helps your front-line customer service managers understand the health of a customer’s relationship with your company and if there are any issues that might indicate that it is at risk.\nCustomer heath scores can be generated by using a SaaS specific customer success tool that includes predictive customer analytics and forward looking client engagement trends. Health scoring assigns different values to different signals of customer longevity or churn. It also provides your customer-facing team members with insight into how their customers are doing so that they can properly engage with any users that might be at risk - before they cancel or fail to renew their subscription.\nThe SaaS growth metrics above are essential to any SaaS marketing strategy. It is important to continuously track, measure and report on these growth metrics at the various SaaS growth stages. Working with a leading SaaS marketing agency can help you stay up to date with these growth metrics and effectively put them into action.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhich SaaS growth metrics are essential for assessing customer acquisition?\nKey customer acquisition metrics include Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), and the Customer Acquisition Rate.\nHow can I measure customer retention and satisfaction in SaaS?\nCustomer retention metrics like Churn Rate, Net Revenue Retention, and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) surveys help gauge customer loyalty and satisfaction.\nWhat are expansion revenue metrics, and why are they significant in SaaS growth?\nExpansion revenue metrics, such as Upsell Rate and Expansion MRR, measure the revenue generated from existing customers, indicating the potential for upselling or cross-selling.\nWhat is Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), and how is it calculated?\nMRR is a fundamental SaaS metric representing the total recurring revenue a company generates each month.

{"question":"What are the environmental and cultural impacts of mass tourism in Venice, particularly regarding cruise ships and local businesses?","answer":"In Venice, cruise ships have significant negative impacts. A dozen cruise ships dock daily, keeping their engines running in port, which contributes to air and water pollution. These ships clog the canals while thousands of tourists disembark to visit landmarks. This mass tourism has driven up living costs, forcing locals to leave the city. As a result, traditional businesses like small bakeries and trattorias have closed. Additionally, the famous Venetian glass industry on Murano islands has been affected, with many factories shutting down. Many 'Murano' or 'Venetian' beads sold today are either cheap imports or made by Chinese workers brought in as cheap labor rather than native Venetian glassblowers.","context":["Overbooked: The Exploding Business of Travel and Tourism by Elizabeth Becker is an eye-opening read for anyone who loves to travel or is interested in the travel business. This thoroughly researched, provocative look at the travel industry will not only have you looking at travel in a new light but may also dampen your enthusiasm for future trips.\nBecker traces the explosion in world leisure travel to Arthur Frommer, whose best-selling book, Europe on 5 Dollars a Day was originally published for soldiers on R&R in the 1950s and was subsequently followed by his travel books for other parts of the world. Countries began to realize what an economic boon travellers could be. Add in the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, cheaper TransAtlantic travel, and the rest is history.\nSome of Becker’s statements about this unregulated industry may startle you as she addresses the effects of tourism on various cities and countries. Consider these facts:\n—Travel & Tourism is one of the world’s largest industries and accounts for 9% of global GDP.\n—Almost 260 million people around the world are associated or employed by the travel and tourism industry, far more than those employed in the global chemical, mining, communication, auto manufacturing and financial services sectors.\nHere’s how the tourism surge has worked out in some locations:\n—Cambodia has opened up its sacred temples at Angkor Wat with little regard for maintaining and protecting the site for future generations. The overwhelming number of tourists may be wearing down the delicate ancient stones surrounding the temple. And, the highways and mega hotels built to support the tourism onslaught have undermined the country’s water table, weakening the ground around the sacred site while raw sewage from the hotels flows directly into the rivers.\n—In Venice, a dozen cruise ships are ‘parked’ daily, leaving their engines running in port as thousands of cruisers disembark to see the city’s famous landmarks. The ships clog the canals and substantially pollute the already polluted air and water. The large influx of tourists is blamed on the rising cost of living by many Venetians making the city effectively too expensive for the natives to live in. This has caused population shrinkage, the closing of many of the small bakeries and trattorias that Italy is known for and the shuttering of many of the famous Venetian glass factories on the nearby Murano islands. When tourists buy Murano or Venetian beads these days, it is likely that they are either cheap imports or beads not manufactured by native Venetian glassblowers but rather by the Chinese who have been brought to Italy as a cheap labor supply.\n—In Dubai, the shimmering principality has taken conspicuous consumerism to new heights with its hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, nightlife and indoor ski slopes. Much of this has been built and maintained by foreign laborers sent to work and live in substandard conditions most developed countries would not tolerate. Dubai is centrally located in the Middle East and is receiving millions of tourists from that region of the world as well as from the Far East, Europe and America. The need for fresh water continues to be a problem in the area and the desalination plants used to produce potable water are a major source of carbon emissions damaging the Gulf’s ecosystem.\n—The cruise industry employs people who seem to have the best job in the world, sailing through beautiful waters and visiting islands and areas of the world they might otherwise never see. However, their pay is so poor that it’s incomprehensible — some waiters, busboys and ship stewards can make as little as $50 a month-not a day, but a month, with little or no days off for months at a time. They do share in tips but this still doesn’t bring them up to what would be considered a fair wage. This modern day version of indentured servitude is one of the reasons most cruise lines have their ships registered in countries that will not interfere with the employee/employer relationship. It appears that this industry is the wild, wild west of travel because there is no international governance board which regulates cruise lines policies.\nAs grim as some of the facts are, all is not lost since some countries have acted judiciously to protect their natural assets while welcoming travellers and still benefiting economically from these relationships. France (winemaking) and Costa Rica (green tourism) stand out as stellar examples of keeping their heritages vibrant and not compromising to the world of tourism.\nBefore you plan your next trip, why not read Becker’s book to educate yourself on the impact of your travelling?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:82fe87fc-063e-4d96-82da-9ee54431187e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do modern farming practices affect both economic sustainability and environmental impact, particularly regarding carbon emissions and market prices?","answer":"Modern farming practices have significant dual effects on economics and the environment. Economically, farming's share of GDP in industrialized nations fell to less than 1% by 2000, though real prices have improved since then due to stabilizing yields and increasing global protein demand. Environmental measures like carbon pricing are beginning to influence land values - in New Zealand, carbon prices around NZ$25 per tonne have increased marginal sheep and beef country prices from $8,000 to $11,000 per hectare. Environmentally, conventional agricultural practices generate substantial emissions - up to 800-2,000 kg CO2 ha-1 year-1 in Brazil and the US. However, alternative practices can reduce emissions while maintaining economic viability. No-till farming, for instance, provides carbon storage 5-6 times higher than emissions, storing 2063-3940 kg carbon equivalent per hectare yearly while only emitting 375-616 kg. Solutions like agroforestry, cover crops, and reduced irrigation can both sequester carbon and potentially improve farm economics through reduced input costs.","context":["Is the price of food catching up with energy?\nExploring the likely pathways of food versus energy commodities\n1. Will agriculture finally out-perform energy?\nThis Commentary explores the likely pathways of food vs. energy commodities in the 2020s and ‘30s. It explores key factors including renewable energy and synthetic food technologies that are likely to drive their relative performance. It concludes that prices of food commodities are likely to out-perform those of energy in the years ahead.\n2. Why may relative commodity prices matter in a post-Coronavirus world?\nThe world economy is currently reeling from the Coronavirus shock to the real economy (which via business losses will, in turn, hurt the financial and insurance industries). The responses of Governments to Coronavirus are significantly impacting discretionary sectors (particularly services)*. For example, it is estimated 25% of jobs in the UK are likely to be either made redundant or furloughed in 2020.\n* See the Craigmore commentary “Analysing a Possible Coronavirus Recession”\nTo counter falls (estimated at an annual rate of 10% to 20% for at least two quarters) in GDP of the advanced economies, widespread income support is being made available by governments to citizens. In the UK it is likely that the income of approximately 5 million citizens will be supported by the government to maintain their solvency and some of their spending power.\nFor this period the productive capacity of the UK economy will be smaller (due to the lost services of e.g. restaurants and tourism that were until very recently part of GDP). If we assume that those who are supported do not save all the hand-outs, the question then arises; on which goods and services will citizens spend this borrowed (or will it be printed) income?\nPutting it another way, since citizens will not be able to spend as much on foreign holidays or restaurants this year, where will they spend that part of their income they do not use to repair their bank accounts?\nAs before they will of course spend some of it on consumer staples, like food and energy. As before, if well supplied, prices of these will not necessarily increase. However, if the supply of energy or food falls short in coming months, then it is likely a population with the same spending power as before yet fewer things on which to spend it, may bid up any such “tight” commodities.\nThis is the reason why we focus in this Commentary on the likely path of supply and demand for commodities, to seek to identify which are likely to remain abundant, and which might go into short supply?\n3. What has been the history of food commodities vs oil?\nThe graph below plots the relative performance of oil, as the benchmark energy commodity, vs. a simple basket of US$ spot prices of Corn, Wheat, Soy, Live Cattle and Milk over the 50 years since 1970.\nAs can be seen oil significantly out-performed food commodities for most of this period creating a shift in the allocation of world incomes to the oil sector. While the wealth and influence of rural landowners languished. Basically “Dallas” replaced “Downton Abbey”.\nMore recently, however, oil prices have “returned to earth”. Indeed, as can be seen in the graph, indices of energy and food are level-pegging again in 2020, for the first time in 50 years (in fact this graph is a 2-year moving average showing an oil price of around $35. In fact, oil has traded as low as $20 in the last few days).\nFigure 1: After 1970 oil outperformed food – until 2020\nLooking more closely at the (less volatile) price of food commodities these spiked in 2010-2013 (a period of US and Russian droughts coming immediately after the world had eaten up the subsidy driven excess food stocks of the ‘80s and ‘90s). At the peak of this short boom prices had doubled to approximately twice their 2007 levels. They have since fallen back 25% when measured in US$.\nThe US$ has however risen more than 25% since then against many currencies (the US$ TWI index has risen 26% from 102 to 129 in the six years since 2014). As a result, as can be seen in the graph below, farm-gate prices received by most non-US farmers, including in New Zealand after its currency softened over the past three years (as it brought interest rates into line with those of other countries), are right “on trend” i.e. close to as good as they have ever been.\nFigure 2: NZ$ (blue) vs US$ (red) Dairy Prices\n4. What drives the “terms of trade” of commodities?\nPrices of both energy and food commodities are of course primarily determined by changes in the volumes of supply and demand. Increases in productive capacity should lower prices whereas increases in demand for a commodity should lift them. Until 1970 this situation applied in both the oil and the food markets. Large numbers of oil companies and large numbers of farmers competed to supply their commodities to growing markets. And large numbers of consumers paid intermediaries (oil and food companies) for the respective end products. This “Adam Smithian” arrangement remains the case in the (highly fragmented) agricultural markets i.e. prices there continue to be driven almost entirely by supply and demand. Particularly by supply since food demand tends to be fairly constant whereas production varies in the short term as a result of climatic, political and economic events (including, we may soon discover, measures designed to protect human health but which have unintended consequences in terms of labour supply to agriculture, and hence food production).\nHowever, from 1970, the energy markets were transformed when the major oil exporting nations, led by Saudi Arabia, began to influence supply, not in the traditional way (by allowing many companies to each make their own capacity decisions) but by “rigging the market” via the OPEC oil cartel. The cartel actively restricted supply to lift oil prices from $3 per barrel in 1970 to $40 by 1980. Such has been (until recently) the concentration of global supply of oil from the Middle East, that OPEC was able to heavily influence movements in the price of oil for 44 years, from 1970 until 2014. However, as can be seen from the brown line on the graph, since 2014 the price of oil has significantly fallen, especially in the past 10 weeks (when it has fallen from $63 per barrel for WTI Crude on 6th Jan to a price range between $20 and $30 in March, 2020).\n2014 was the year that oil (and gas) from fracking began to surge and put the US on track to become the largest oil producer in the world and a net energy exporter (which was achieved in 2019). This pressure, plus the rise of cheap and attractive renewable energy alternatives has effectively broken the OPEC cartel, further damaged by the withdrawal of Russia as an OPEC observer and ally. It seems likely, now that there are many competing suppliers each making their own decisions on volume of production, oil prices will return to being set, “at the cost of marginal production” (presumably of extraction via fracking in the US mid-west, west and south). Given how rapidly fracking and renewable energy technologies and regulations are advancing, it does not seem likely that these supply (and demand) decisions, at the margin, are now going to drive up the price of oil.\nTherefore, I conclude that abundant supplies of energy make it unlikely the current crisis will lead to sharp rises in prices of oil or other energy commodities. On the contrary, energy and especially oil are likely to remain cheap (and in so doing create a transfer of wealth from energy exporting countries to net importers). Before discussing prospects for food commodities in Section 6, the next Section will review the historic correlation of the two sets of commodity prices.\n5. Are farm commodity prices correlated with oil?\nAs we saw in the previous section, in the 1970s oil prices increased by over 12x. Over the same period farm commodity prices increased by 2.5x. In the 1960s and 1970s a “green revolution” in crop production was sweeping world farming, raising yields and efficiency via improved genetics, fertiliser and machinery. This meant that, although farm commodities kept pace with the high inflation of that decade (the US CPI also increased by 2x during that decade) they did not outperform in line with oil.\nAs can be seen in the graph below, this period of significant out-performance by oil in the 1970s was then replaced by 30 years, from 1984 until 2014, when oil and food commodities traded in lock-step. There were good reasons for that. The green revolution had made farming so efficient that in some countries the price of ethanol from crops was cheaper than that of ethanol from oil. The produce of the two industries traded on an effective “wholesale energy equivalence” basis for most of those three decades.\nFrom 2014, as noted, farm commodities, although soft (down about 25% in US$ terms), significantly outperformed oil, which fell 75% from $100 per barrel in early 2014 to, say, $25 today.\nFigure 3: Relatively Weak Correlation > Strong Correlation > Weak\nMight food prices now revert to their previous high level of correlation, i.e. “follow oil down”? This is the topic of the next sections.\n6. Supply factors for foods\nWe farmers are our own worst enemies. For two centuries we have over-produced and lowered our terms of trade:\nIn the nineteenth century we discovered the “new world” prairies, invented refrigeration, and massively lowered farm relative incomes (from about 70% to 10% of GDP) as a result.\nIn the last century we added only very little new land, and this continues. However, we have adopted technology after technology to produce more grain, meat and dairy from each of those hectares. These techniques have also increased productivity per labour unit and per $ of capital employed. Meanwhile subsidies to farmers in most wealthy countries protected farms against the odd bad harvest – encouraging further over-production.\nThose two centuries period of declining terms of trade for agriculture ended up in the year 2000 with farmers being rewarded, as the rest of the economy grew but our share did not, with farm incomes of less than 1% of GDP in the industrialised west.\nHowever, pleasingly for us farmers in the first 20 years of this century this “fall” in real prices of farm produce has levelled off and indeed real prices of farm produce has increased (the graph below replicates the indices from the first graph but deflated by US$ inflation i.e. shown as real prices).\nWhat is the reason for this improvement in farmers’ pricing power?\nFigure 4: Inflation Adjusted Commodity Indices\nThe two main reasons for improvements in real farm produce prices are:\nYield growth per hectare, while still increasing for some crops (e.g. US corn or NZ dairy), has stabilised across much of the farming sector e.g. average European cereal yields per hectare have been “stuck” at 7 tonnes for 20 years (graph below).\nFigure 5: Western European Cereal Yields\nDiets are significantly changing around the world as, for example, the E Asian middle-class rockets from 500 m people in the year 2010 to 1.5 bn now and heading to 3 bn in 2030. Despite concerns in the west with health and the environmental impacts of animal protein, these newly wealthy people want infant formula, yogurt, cheese, pizzas, chicken nuggets and hamburgers just as do their counterparts in the west. And, since average protein consumption in many of these countries is below the levels experts believe are optimal, it is hard to see how rich western countries, even if they are able to bring down their own (in many cases excessive) consumption of “land intensive” proteins, are going to be able to prevent the populations of these countries gaining the health benefits of moderate amounts of protein in their diets? Since it takes a lot more land to grow animal rather than vegetable protein estimates are that the production of the world farming industry will need to grow by 25-70% by 2050. In order to persuade the “marginal producer” of food to deliver this increase it is likely higher prices will be needed.\n7. Substitutes for “farmed foods”\nHopefully, for environmental reasons, some of the demand of this emerging middle class for protein will be met with synthetic foods, e.g. re-constituted soy into burgers, oats into milk substitute. However, it seems unlikely, as plant based and highly processed foods seldom have the same nutritional density as animal protein, that these synthetic proteins will take over the roles of especially the low-cost parts of the current protein value chain i.e. dairy farming (cheese and fresh milk are after all a big part of the diet of most vegetarians) and also white meat production. We will discuss red meat in the next and final section, below.\n8. Environmental factors\nMankind’s attempts to combat climate change are driving energy innovation to reduce energy costs and substitute production away from fossil fuels. As discussed in Section 2 this is likely to lower the terms of trade of energy products, especially fossil fuels such as oil.\nMany urge a parallel shift in protein production from livestock systems to vegetable protein and synthetic foods. And especially away from red meat, since ruminant animals are more polluting per kg of nutrition than animal protein from dairy, poultry or fish. If implemented (as discussed not all of an emerging middle class will accept limitations on their right to beneficial nutrition) this may, other things equal, also be a negative for the equilibrium prices of conventionally grown food.\nHowever, as readers will be aware, there are simultaneous environmental imperatives for planting trees. Conveniently these are most suited to the same class of land (extensive rangelands) that grow cattle. This fact may make the environmental calculus for farming different from fossil fuels. There are no other uses for oil wells and refineries than to produce and then distil their production into a series of chemicals, most of which will be burned. Forestry and other forms of biological sequestration (e.g. low input, low stocking rate regenerative farming to sequester carbon into pastoral soils) represent viable alternative land-uses in a world that is seeking to address climate change. Therefore, if a reduction in demand for farmed red meat does eventuate, then prices of these and other agriculture products will only fall if demand for land shifted to biological sequestration does not fully off-set reductions in demand for land for red meat.\nTo illustrate this point with a brief case study; Craigmore Sustainables, on behalf of our investors, has been an active purchaser of marginal sheep and beef country in NZ for afforestation i.e. livestock have been retired from this land and it has been planted with trees. The rise in the NZ carbon price (to around NZ$25 per tonne) over the past three years has lifted the price of such land from around $8,000 per hectare (fair value for pure sheep and beef growing) to now around $11,000 (fair value to forestry investors). If this approx. 35% gain in economic returns and land valuations is reflected in other regions as environmental measures are rolled out, we may find land use industries no longer accrue such a derisory share of GDP. It seems logical to this author, and borne out by NZ’s carbon forestry experience, that if mankind really wants to address climate change (and we must) then society will need to reward farmers with more than 1% of GDP. As soon as this is done then, as argued in the Craigmore commentary In “Praise of Trees”, the farm/forest industry is ready and willing to use our skills to off-set climate change using some of our land to sequester carbon, and enabling us to either sell the credits from this or, indeed, to produce carbon neutral produce.\nShifts in tastes toward (more land intensive) animal protein as well as population growth itself are forecast to require an approx. 50% extra production from the same amount of land in the next 30 years. This is achievable, but it seems logical that society, especially if we wish to raise our game to address climate change, will need to pay farmers more than the 1% of developed country GDP to get this.\nIt is too early to know whether the Coronavirus slump and massive governmental fiscal and monetary responses to it are likely to cause inflation (this risk will be the subject of a future Commentary), however, the above analysis suggests that if this occurs it is foodstuffs, not energy (or at least not fossil transport fuels i.e. oil) that would be more likely to exhibit those rising prices.\nEnvironmental imperatives do not, I believe, change this analysis since biological sequestration will compete with food for land resources, further “tightening” capacity of the global farming industry.\nIt is these factors, which may lift the real prices of farm produce in coming years, that should allow farm commodities to continue the break in their historic correlation with energy prices, which already began with the scaling up of fracking and renewable energy substitution, from 2014.","Agriculture and land use change contribute 24% of greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that this share will increase by 30 to 40% by 2050. The challenge is therefore to counterbalance this with greater carbon sequestration in order to transform agrosystems into greenhouse gas sinks.\nTo determine this role, it is sufficient, in broad terms, to take into account the gases drawn from the agrosystem and to compare them to those emitted by the same agrosystem. To do this, it is necessary to measure the accumulation of carbon in the soil, the quantities of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) released into the atmosphere, as well as all the CO2 coming from agricultural practices: plowing, planting, harvesting, installation and use of irrigation, application of agrochemicals, fertilizers and lime.\nKnowing that CH4 and N2O are greenhouse gases 34 and 298 times more potent than CO₂ respectively, it is sufficient to convert all these emissions into CO2 equivalent to estimate the net global warming potential and compare between different agricultural management methods.\nTo calculate the carbon cost of today's dominant agricultural practices, one must also consider their direct CO2 emissions. According to studies conducted in southern Brazil and the United States, the carbon cost of agricultural practices represents a significant amount of CO2, up to 800 and 2,000 kg ha-1 year-1.\nDiagram showing how to estimate whether an agrosystem is a source or sink of greenhouse gases: measure carbon fixation in the soil, the amount of CH₄ and N₂O released into the atmosphere, and all the CO₂ from agricultural practices: tilling, planting, harvesting, irrigation installation and use, and application of agrochemicals, fertilizers, and lime.\nBased on this observation, the first thing to do is to determine which agricultural practices to adopt in order to transform the soil into a greenhouse gas sink - and not a source.\nThe first element to take into account is that the soil can become a source of greenhouse gases when there is an excessive input, because telluric microorganisms feed on all these inputs and spit them out in the form of GHG.\nEven more so when the land is saturated with water by irrigation and compacted by machinery, as oxygen availability becomes scarce, leading to methanization (a process responsible for the production of CH₄) and denitrification (one of the processes responsible for the production of N₂O). Nevertheless, these methane fluxes remain low or even sometimes negative if the soils have a good structure and are not flooded.\nIn addition, the establishment and use of irrigation accounts for 47-63% of the carbon footprint while fertilization and limestone application rise to 35%. These proportions vary according to the inputs used and their annual input. To mitigate the climate change caused by agriculture, the most obvious solution seems to be the reduction of inputs, with more reasoned spreading.\nAgroforestry and legumes\nOther agricultural practices are just as important in moving from a source to a sink for greenhouse gases.\nThis is particularly true of agroforestry, which has been adopted by some farms. It consists of using cover crops, for which carbon storage exceeds its CO₂ equivalent released into the atmosphere in terms of N2O emissions, and improves soil structure with negative CH4 emissions.\nTwo contrasting agricultural systems, behaving as source (left) and sink (right) of greenhouse gases, according to CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions as well as soil carbon sequestration. Murilo Veloso\nThis is also the case for the use of legumes. As these plants associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they promote carbon storage in the soil and make it possible to substitute part of the mineral fertilization, thus reducing nitrous oxide emissions.\nFurthermore, by maintaining soil moisture and structure, practices such as agroforestry and cover crops provide an alternative to decrease irrigation.\nHowever, transforming an agrosystem into a greenhouse gas sink is not always obvious. For example, plowing, the practice of turning over the soil before seeding, does not necessarily have the same impact on GHGs.\nIn temperate environments, plowing has little effect on soil carbon stocks because low temperatures in early spring slow down microbial activity and the decomposition of soil organic matter.\nIn contrast, in tropical environments where temperatures remain favorable, soil destructuring by tillage stimulates microorganisms to decompose soil organic matter, which releases GHGs.\nExample of conventional agriculture and its practices such as monoculture, tillage and heavy reliance on inputs that contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions and reduced soil carbon sequestration, making the agricultural system a source of greenhouse gases (left). Example of agroecological practices such as cover crops, no-till, intercropping, legumes and agroforestry that contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil carbon sequestration, making the agricultural system a greenhouse gas sink (right).\nFor no-till farming practices, N2O emissions are largely offset by CO2 storage, counterbalancing the 375 to 616 kg of carbon equivalent emitted per hectare per year by the 2063 to 3940 kg of carbon equivalent fixed in the soil per hectare per year. This represents nothing less than a carbon storage five to six times higher than the emissions! Ploughing, on the other hand, clearly reduces the soil's capacity to draw carbon from these tropical zones.\nOn the other hand, plowing also constitutes an additional cost of CO₂ when the use of diesel for machinery is taken into account (35.3 kg of carbon equivalent per hectare per year in conventional and 5.8 kg in direct seeding).\nFrom field to plate\nLet's not forget that greenhouse gas emissions do not stop at production, but also continue during transportation, processing, packaging and redistribution of products.\nIt is therefore necessary to radically change agricultural practices, starting with the fields. The practices mentioned above - the use of cover crops, legumes, intercrops, agroforestry, and the abandonment of tilling the soil - would have a triple effect: strengthening an organic and sustainable agri-food system, respecting biodiversity, allowing a balanced cohabitation between agriculture and the environment, while making farmers less dependent on large industrial companies"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6c6126f0-312a-4e44-91f6-4be818d417f4>","<urn:uuid:af9dd96c-4d30-4a93-9431-853dd63dbf04>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my research about fishing industry, need know regulations and management. What fishing regulations exist in Asia, and why is poor management a problem?","answer":"In Asia, many countries have implemented fishing regulations including catch limits, size restrictions, and protected areas to safeguard fish stocks. However, poor fisheries management remains a significant issue due to lack of oversight and ineffective government regulations. The rules have proven insufficient for limiting fishing to sustainable levels, particularly in high seas where regulations are either insufficient or not properly enforced. Most fisheries management organizations cannot adequately apply scientific advice regarding fish quotas. Additionally, customs agencies and retailers often cannot verify if fish are caught through proper channels. This poor management contributes to illegal fishing, which accounts for about 20% of the world's catch and up to 50% in some fisheries.","context":["Fishing techniques have been developed and practiced by different cultures across the globe. In Asia, a continent rich in natural resources and diverse aquatic ecosystems, fishing holds a prominent place in its cultural heritage. From traditional methods to modern practices, Asian fishing offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of angling. In this article, we will delve into various aspects of Asian fishing, including traditional techniques, thrilling fishing experiences, and the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems.\nFishing techniques encompass a wide range of methods used to catch fish and other aquatic animals. These methods vary from region to region, influenced by cultural traditions, available resources, and environmental conditions. Asia, with its vast coastline, rivers, and lakes, has developed unique fishing techniques over centuries.\nOverview of Fishing Techniques\nBefore diving into Asian fishing practices, let’s briefly explore some common fishing techniques employed worldwide. These techniques include:\nHand-gathering involves manually collecting fish and other marine creatures from shallow waters, such as tidal pools or rocky areas. This technique is often practiced by coastal communities and individuals for subsistence purposes.\nSpearfishing requires a skilled individual to use a specialized spear or trident to impale fish underwater. This technique demands precision, good swimming abilities, and knowledge of fish behavior.\nNetting is a widely used fishing technique that involves casting or setting nets to entangle fish. Nets can be of various types, such as gill nets, cast nets, or seine nets, depending on the target species and fishing location.\nAngling, commonly known as fishing with a rod and reel, is a popular recreational and sport fishing method. It involves using bait or lures attached to a fishing line, which is then cast into the water, waiting for a fish to bite.\nTrapping fish often requires the use of fish traps, such as baskets, pots, or weirs. These traps are strategically placed in water bodies to capture fish as they swim or enter for feeding purposes.\nTraditional Asian Fishing Techniques\nAsia boasts a rich cultural heritage that includes unique fishing techniques passed down through generations. Two notable traditional fishing techniques in Asia are cormorant fishing and Asian fishing rods.\nCormorant fishing is a traditional method in which trained cormorant birds are used to catch fish in rivers. This ancient technique was historically practiced in China, Japan, Greece, North Macedonia, England, and France . While primarily used for tourism today, cormorant fishing offers a glimpse into the historical fishing practices of these regions.\nAsian Fishing Rods\nAsia’s diverse fishing traditions include a wide range of fishing rods and tackle. From spinning to fly-fishing, Asian anglers have developed unique techniques and equipment to target various fish species. Whether it’s salmon fishing in British Columbia or catching mahseer in India, Asian fishing rods are tailored to specific fishing environments and angler preferences.\nFishing in Asia: A Thrilling Experience\nAsia presents an array of exciting fishing opportunities for enthusiasts seeking memorable experiences. The continent offers stunning landscapes, tranquil lakes, majestic rivers, and breathtaking coastlines. Let’s explore some of the best fishing destinations in Asia and the species you can expect to catch:\nExotic Fishing Destinations in Asia\nAsia’s fishing destinations span from the remote rivers of Mongolia to the tropical waters of Indonesia. Japan, known for its traditional fishing culture, offers diverse opportunities, including fly-fishing for trout and salmon. Indonesia, with its vast archipelago, is a paradise for saltwater anglers, featuring species like GT (giant trevally), mahi-mahi, and marlin. China and India also boast impressive fishing grounds, catering to a wide range of angling preferences.\nSpecies Diversity in Asian Waters\nAsian waters are home to an incredible diversity of fish species. From the ferocious giant snakehead in Thailand to the elusive masu salmon in Japan, anglers can target a variety of freshwater and saltwater fish. Some iconic species include carp, catfish, trout, salmon, tuna, and various reef-dwelling fish.\nRegulations for Sustainable Fishing\nTo ensure the preservation of fish populations and the long-term sustainability of Asian fisheries, it is crucial to adhere to local regulations. Many countries in Asia have implemented measures such as catch limits, size restrictions, and protected areas to safeguard fish stocks. Responsible anglers should familiarize themselves with these regulations and practice ethical fishing techniques.\nImpact of Asian Fishing on Marine Ecosystems\nAs fishing activity continues to increase in Asia, concerns arise about its impact on marine ecosystems. The growing appetite for seafood in Asian nations has led to a rise in commercial fishing activities, potentially leading to overfishing and habitat destruction. Some key points to consider include:\nIncrease in Fishing Activity\nAsia’s growing population and economic development have fueled an increase in fishing activity across the continent. The expansion of fishing fleets, both small-scale and industrial, has put pressure on fish stocks and ecosystems.\nThreats to Marine Ecosystems\nUnsustainable fishing practices, such as bottom trawling and illegal fishing, pose significant threats to marine ecosystems in Asia and beyond. These practices can lead to habitat destruction, bycatch of non-target species, and disruption of marine food chains.\nWays to Protect Marine Ecosystems\nPreserving marine ecosystems requires collective efforts from governments, conservation organizations, and individual anglers. Implementing sustainable fishing practices, supporting marine protected areas, and promoting education and awareness about the importance of conservation are crucial steps toward protecting Asia’s marine biodiversity.\nUnconventional Fishing Techniques in Asia\nAsian fishing is not limited to traditional methods; the continent is also home to some unconventional and ingenious fishing techniques. One notable example is spiderweb kite fishing practiced in the Solomon Islands. Fishermen gather spider webs, fashioning them into lures that are trailed along the water’s surface beneath kites. These worm-shaped lures attract needlefish, a species known for its narrow mouth and fast strikes .\nChina’s Expanding Fishing Fleet and Its Consequences\nChina’s expanding fishing fleet has become a global concern due to its impact on fish stocks and marine ecosystems. As areas near Chinese shores are increasingly depleted, Chinese fishing vessels venture into the waters of other nations, depleting fish populations and straining geopolitical relations . This trend raises questions about the sustainable management of marine resources and the need for international cooperation.\nAsian fishing encompasses a rich tapestry of traditional techniques, thrilling fishing experiences, and challenges related to sustainability. From cormorant fishing in ancient rivers to innovative methods like spiderweb kite fishing, Asia offers a diverse and captivating fishing landscape. However, the increase in fishing activity and the depletion of fish stocks emphasize the importance of responsible fishing practices and conservation efforts.\n1. What are some popular fishing destinations in Asia?\n- Japan, Indonesia, China, and India are renowned for their exceptional fishing destinations.\n2. What are some unique fishing techniques in Asia?\n- Asian fishing techniques include cormorant fishing and spiderweb kite fishing, among others.\n3. How can we protect marine ecosystems in Asia?\n- Protecting marine ecosystems requires implementing sustainable fishing practices, supporting marine protected areas, and raising awareness about conservation.\n4. What are the environmental consequences of China’s expanding fishing fleet?\n- China’s fishing fleet has depleted fish stocks and strained geopolitical relations with other nations.\n5. Are there regulations for sustainable fishing in Asia?\n- Many Asian countries have implemented regulations such as catch limits, size restrictions, and protected areas to ensure sustainable fishing practices.","What is Overfishing?\nOverfishing is yet another environmental issue which means consumption of a species of fish from a body of water at a rate which is outpacing its natural reproduction.\nAccording to World Wildlife Fund (WWF), “overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than the population can replenish through natural reproduction.”\nWhile overfishing sounds like a lucrative practice, it is a detrimental environmental issue with wide-ranging impacts on aquatic life and land dwellers.\nOverfishing, for example, has stripped many fisheries across the globe of their fish stocks. About 85% of the world’s fisheries could be over-exploited, totally depleted, or recovering from exploitation.\nFor this article, the purpose is to explore the major causes and effects of overfishing. Shall we start with the causes first?\nCauses of Overfishing\nThere are numerous reasons for overfishing. The major ones include:\n1. Poor Fisheries Management\nThe fishing industry has long been weighed down by a lack of management oversight and proper government regulations. Traceability of fishing activities has been a great challenge as well.\nThe rules and regulations we have today have proven to be ineffective when it comes to limiting fishing capacity to sustainable levels. And the high seas are the most affected.\nNamely, there are insufficient fishing regulations in the high seas. And the existing regulations are normally not enforced. Most fisheries management organs lack the capacity to adequately apply scientific advice of fish quotas.\nMoreover, customs agencies and fish retailers can’t always ascertain the fish coming into their country is caught through proper channels.\n2. Unsustainable Fishing\nUnsustainable fishing encompasses the use of nets, fishing methods and other fishing gear that catch so much fish to a level that they are endangered.\nIt may also involve catching other sea creatures other than fish in the process. The unwanted animals are called By-catch. And they are normally destroyed and discarded into the sea, hence the name Discards.\nDiscards may include turtles, cetaceans, young fish, sharks, corals, and seabirds. Invertebrates such as crabs, starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins, sponges, mollusks, and warms could also be caught, destroyed, and thrown back into the sea.\nSome fishermen also catch tiny fishes, depriving them of the opportunity to grow and reproduce.\n3. Illegal and Unregulated Fishing Activities\nIllegal fishing activities include poaching, taking more than the allowed amount of catch, and fishing out of season. According to WWF, illegal fishing accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s catch and up to 50 percent in some fisheries.\nUnregulated fishing practices that result in grave harm include by-catch (as explained in the previous point) and Trawling. Trawling involves scraping along the bottom of the sea to gather fish. This practice is one of the major causes of destruction to marine habitats.\n4. Economic and Food Needs\nMarket availability and consumer demands are the major factors that determine the amount of fish that fishing companies bring ashore.\nIn the last 100 years, human population has increased in many folds. This has, in turn, pushed the need for food and fish up significantly. Coupled with economic aspirations of fishing industries, these factors have compelled fishers to catch more fish than the seas can replace.\n5. Government Subsidies\nMany governments around the world continue to subsidize their fishing equipment. This allows unprofitable fishing entities to survive, eventually leading to overfishing. Today, fishing fleet across the globe is estimated to be up to 250 percent of the actual capacity needed to catch what the world needs.\n6. Open Access Fisheries\nThe ‘open access’ nature of fisheries is another major problem of overfishing. In light of the fact that there are no or limited property rights, fishermen lack the motivation to leave fish in the water.\nMoreover, only about 1.5 percent of water bodies have been declared protected areas. And most of those areas still remain accessible to fishermen, exposing them to destruction and depletion.\nNow, let’s let quickly look at some of the effects of overfishing.\nEffects of Overfishing on the Environment\nAt the beginning of this article, we pointed out that overfishing has impacted at least 85 percent of the world’s fish resources. The fact that most fisheries are harvested far beyond their sustainable capacity is poised to have wide-ranging effects on marine life and the socio-economic well-being of humans.\nThat said, here are some of the major effects of overfishing:\n1. Marine Ecosystem Imbalance\nTargeted catching of essential predators such as sharks, tuna, and billfish disrupts marine ecosystem in the long run. This results in increased numbers of smaller marine animals below the food chain.\nThis ends up affecting the rest of the ecosystem, with issues such as the increased growth of algae. Coral health becomes compromised as well. Overfishing is also associated with bycatch, one of the major threats to marine life as it causes unnecessary loss of massive fish population along with other marine animals like turtles.\n2. Dwindling Harvests of Targeted Fish\nThe population of fish that is worth consuming is increasingly reducing, thanks to overfishing. Overfishing has led to a decrease in the population of productive fish, resulting in lesser stocking of the fish.\nThere is urgent need to curb overfishing in a bid to restore the dwindling marine population in a couple of years. Limiting fishery activities will allow fish to breed and reproduce, and well will eventually have a great supply of fish available again.\n3. Fishing of Untargeted/Endangered Marine Species\nBycatch leads to the capturing of marine animals that are not used or required. The animals may include protected or endangered species or species that are of little or no economic value. If caught, they are normally destroyed and discarded either in the water or ashore.\n4. Unsustainable Aquaculture\nFish farming requires feed for reared fish. For example, you will need between four and eleven pounds of prey fish to raise just one pound of farmed salmon.\nWith the rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry, prey fish population is reducing at alarming and untenable rates. According to some researchers, if this trend continues, fish farming will have outstripped the supply of fishmeal by 2020.\n5. Socio-economic Impact\nMillions of people around the world have pegged their livelihood and nutritional needs on fishing. Oceans have supplied us with sufficient seafood for years, but that is no longer the case.\nOverfishing and untenable fishing practices over the last couple of decades have stripped the oceans of their fish supply. And this has affected many people’s everyday way of life and source of income. With no valuable fish left in the waters to fish, the fishing industry is on the verge of collapse.\nFishing boats, trawlers, and vessels hurt marine life not only through overfishing but also through oil and liquid, and chemical spills.\nYou may think that oceans are so expansive that these are not significant threats. However, a slight pollution by thousands of fishing vessels every day results in a massive disturbance. And water pollution has grave consequences to both aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms.\nWe may dismiss overfishing as a harmless practice oblivious to the fact that it is causing untold harm to the world’s ocean and marine life. Overfishing depletes the population of adult fish and doesn’t leave enough fish to reproduce and replenish their dwindling numbers. This can be attributed to poor fisheries management, unsustainable fishing, economic needs, as well as illegal and unregulated fishing. And its effects include marine life imbalance, loss of income, and harvesting of endangered marine species.\nPhoto by: pixabay\nLatest posts by Sonia Madaan (see all)\n- Raised Floor System: The Need for Adaptive Whole Building Design - January 13, 2020\n- Sustainability Matters to Long Term Guests - December 5, 2019\n- 25+ Disturbing Facts About Water Wastage That Will Leave You Highly Disturbed - December 1, 2019"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7028a45a-9e03-4f83-bac5-056817b62431>","<urn:uuid:14da101e-6008-4330-b50e-0e7c2b52be04>"],"error":null}

Anyone who loves a good movie flashback, visits to SFMOMA, or in-crowd jokes.\nLET’S BEGIN AT THE END\nWhat Am I Seeing? The co-founder of Complexions Contemporary Ballet, choreographer Dwight Rhoden has worked with companies around the world, but this was his first commission for SF Ballet. Inspired by the versatility of the Company’s dancers, this work for fifteen showcases a central couple, six additional couples who suggest different aspects of the central couple’s relationship, and a solo man. The movement blends classical and contemporary movements creating a vocabulary that’s both expressive and precise.\nWhat Am I Hearing? A mélange of Michael Nyman, Philip Glass, and J.S. Bach. The music traces the arc of the central couple’s relationship.\nWhat Should I Look For? The solo man. This part was a surprise even to the choreographer: when Rhoden entered the studio, he thought he would just be working with seven couples, but then-soloist Esteban Hernandez upended that idea. The role created on him has now become central to the ballet. See how he instigates actions and reactions throughout the piece.\nCOLORFORMS WORLD PREMIERE\nWhat Am I Seeing? A new ballet by SF Ballet Soloist Myles Thatcher. Thatcher is increasingly in demand around the country for his works which are choreographically innovative, musically complex, and often topically relevant. This world premiere for film will be captured both at SFMOMA and at the War Memorial Opera House, allowing Thatcher to explore his art form in a new mode and in new spaces.\nWhat Am I Hearing? Steve Reich’s Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings. This piece was originally conceived as a dance work for contemporary choreographer Akram Khan in 2006.\nWhat Should I Look For? Thatcher’s ballets are, even on a big stage, intimately human, with dancers seeming to be real people as well as stunning artists. Notice how this element of his work is emphasized on film.\nWhat Am I Seeing? Mark Morris, a MacArthur Foundation fellow and one of the world’s most influential living choreographers, has made more works for SF Ballet than for any other ballet company in the world. Sandpaper Ballet, created here in 1999, is a cleverly tongue-in-cheek ballet exemplary of his signature musical sensibility, with bodies on stage articulating different parts of the score. Its bright green Isaac Mizrahi costumes add a surrealist element to this quirky ballet.\nWhat Am I Hearing? A selection of songs by composer Leroy Anderson. If the name isn’t familiar, the music will be, as Anderson was the composer of light orchestral works like Fiddle Faddle, The Typewriter Song, and, most famously, Sleigh Ride, which have made their way out of the concert hall and on to radios and TV screens around the world.\nWhat Should I Look For? Notice the formation the dancers are in at the very beginning, when the curtain opens. They’ll return to this grid over and over—it serves as a kind of home base or structural reset as the music changes. Also, the overture is distinctive (and I don’t want to give it away!). But think about how it impacts your experience of the dance to hear this particular song right before the curtain goes up.\nHeader Image: San Francisco Ballet in Rhoden’s LET’S BEGIN AT THE END // © Erik Tomasson"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3a58e6a6-6e6b-436f-80bb-1fc5cebc3de7>","<urn:uuid:daaa0e96-f8eb-42cf-8225-7d31a4ea6f96>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Russell's views on the certainty of mathematics relate to the computability challenges in First Order Logic?","answer":"Russell believed that reducing mathematics increases the certainty of mathematical theorems by showing mathematical knowledge to be coherently organized. However, this contrasts with the practical limitations found in First Order Logic's computability - while FOL is the most general and powerful method for describing and analyzing information, it is actually too expressive for direct computer implementation, as it can easily express statements that no computer could ever solve. This creates a fundamental tension between theoretical mathematical certainty and practical computational limitations.","context":["Logic in computer science\n- Theoretical foundations and analysis\n- Use of computer technology to aid logicians\n- Use of concepts from logic for computer applications\nTheoretical foundations and analysis\nThe most essential foundations for computer science are grounded in logic and set theory. The logician Gottlob Frege who defined the first propositional calculus essentially created the first programming language. The language he defined has all the formal requirements for a powerful computer programming and specification language. The theory of computation is based on concepts defined by logicians and mathematicians such as Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. In addition some other major areas of theoretical overlap between logic and computer science are:\n- Godel's incompleteness theorem proves that any logical system powerful enough to characterize arithmetic will contain statements that can neither be proven true nor false within that system. This has direct application to theoretical issues relating to the feasibility of proving the completeness and correctness of software.\n- The Frame problem is a basic problem which must be overcome when using first order logic to represent the goals and state of an artificial intelligence agent.\n- The Curry-Howard correspondence is a proof about the relation between logical systems and software. This theory established the theoretical foundation for viewing a computer program as a formal logical statement that could be proven to be correct and consistent.\nComputers to Assist Logicians\nOne of the first applications to use the term Artificial Intelligence was the Logic Theorist system developed by Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon in 1956. One of the things that a Logician does is to take a set of statements in Logic and deduce the conclusions (additional statements) that must be true by the laws of logic. For example If given a logical system that states \"All humans are mortal\" and \"Socrates is human\" a valid conclusion is \"Socrates is mortal\". Of course this is a trivial example. In actual logical systems the statements can be numerous and complex. It was realized early on that this kind of analysis could be significantly aided by the use of computers. The Logic Theorist validated the theoretical work of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their influential work on mathematical logic called Principia Mathematica. In addition subsequent systems have been utilized by logicians to validate and discover new logical theorems and proofs.\nLogic applications for computers\nThere has always been a strong influence from mathematical logic on the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the beginning of the field it was realized that technology to automate logical inferences could have great potential to solve problems and draw conclusions from facts. Ron Brachman has described First Order Logic (FOL) as metric by which all AI knowledge representation formalism should be evaluated. There is no more general or powerful known method for describing and analyzing information than FOL. The reason FOL itself is simply not used as a computer language is that it is actually too expressive, in the sense that FOL can easily express statements that no computer, no matter how powerful, could ever solve. For this reason every form of knowledge representation is in some sense a trade off between expressivity and computability. The more expressive the language is, the closer it is to FOL, the more likely it is to be slower and prone to an infinite loop.\nFor example, IF THEN rules used in Expert Systems are a very limited subset of FOL. Rather than arbitrary formulas with the full range of logical operators the starting point is simply what logicians refer to as Modus Ponens. As a result the computability of rule based systems can be quite good, especially if they take advantage of optimization algorithms and compilation.\nAnother major area of research for logical theory was software engineering. Research projects such as the Knowledge-Based Software Assistant and Programmer's Apprentice programs applied logical theory to validate the correctness of software specifications. They also used them to transform the specifications into efficient code on diverse platforms and to prove the equivalence between the implementation and the specification. This formal transformation driven approach is often far more effort than traditional software development. However, in specific domains with appropriate formalisms and reusable templates the approach has proven viable for commercial products. The appropriate domains are usually those such as weapons systems, security systems, and real time financial systems where failure of the system has excessively high human or financial cost. An example of such a domain is Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) Design—the process for designing the chips used for the CPU's and other critical components of digital devices. An error in a chip is catastrophic. Unlike software chips can't be patched or updated. As a result there is commercial justification for using formal methods to prove that the implementation corresponds to the specification.\nAnother important application of logic to computer technology has been in the area of Frame languages and automatic classifiers. Frame languages such as KL-ONE have a rigid semantics. Definitions in KL-ONE can be directly mapped to set theory and the predicate calculus. This allows specialized theorem provers called classifiers to analyze the various declarations between sets, subsets, and relations in a given model. In this way the model can be validated and any inconsistent definitions flagged. The classifier can also infer new information, for example define new sets based on existing information and change the definition of existing sets based on new data. The level of flexibility is ideal for handling the ever changing world of the Internet. Classifier technology is built on top of languages such as the Web Ontology Language to allow a logical semantic level on to the existing Internet. This layer of is called the Semantic web.\n- Lewis, Harry R.; Christos H. Papadimitriou (1981). Elements of the Theory of Computation. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.

However, the syntax of Principia’s formal language is far from ideal as a tool for the analysis of natural language. Stephen Neale has proposed a reconstruction of the theory of descriptions in a language of restricted quantification that gives a better approximation of the syntax of English (and, arguably, of other natural languages). This has led to resistance from some Russell scholars who object to the identification of descriptions with quantifiers at the level of logical form in this new language on the grounds that the identification fails to respect the Russellian conception of descriptions as incomplete symbols. I defend Neale’s reconstruction of the theory and argue that he has preserved everything essential to the theory, including the notion of an incomplete symbol. However, I then go on to argue, contrary to Neale and his objectors as well as Russell himself, that the doctrine of incomplete symbols is a superfluous and undesirable element of the theory that is best jettisoned from the theory.\n|Ray Perkins, Jr.||“Incomplete Symbols in\nMathematica and Russell’s ‘Definite\nABSTRACT: Early in Principia Mathematica Russell presents an argument that “‘the author of Waverley’ means nothing”, an argument that he calls a “definite proof”. He generalizes it to claim that definite descriptions are incomplete symbols having meaning only in sentential context. This Principia “proof” went largely unnoticed until Russell reaffirmed a near-identical “proof” in his philosophical autobiography nearly 50 years later. The “proof” is important, not only because it grounds our understanding of incomplete symbols in the Principia programme, but also because failure to understand it fully has been a source of much unjustified criticism of Russell to the effect that he was wedded to a naive theory of meaning and prone to carelessness and confusion in his philosophy of logic and language generally. In my paper, I (1) defend Russell’s “proof” against attacks from several sources over the last half century, (2) examine the implications of the “proof” for understanding Russell’s treatment of class symbols in Principia, and (3) see how the Principia notion of incomplete symbol was carried forward into Russell’s conception of philosophical analysis as it developed in his logical atomist period after 1910.\n|Russell Wahl||“The Axiom of\nABSTRACT: The axiom of reducibility plays an important role in the logic of Principia Mathematica, but has generally been condemned as an ad hoc non-logical axiom which was added simply because the ramified type theory without it would not yield all the required theorems. In this paper I examine the status of the axiom of reducibility. Whether the axiom can plausibly be included as a logical axiom will depend in no small part on the understanding of propositional functions. If we understand propositional functions as constructions of the mind, it is clear that the axiom is clearly not a logical axiom and in fact makes an implausible claim. I look at two other ways of understanding propositional functions, a nominalist interpretation along the lines of Landini and a realist interpretation along the lines of Linsky and Mares. I argue that while on either of these interpretations it is not easy to see the axiom as a non-logical claim about the world, there are also appear to be difficulties in accepting it as a purely logical axiom.\n|Conor Mayo-Wilson||“Russell on Logicism and\nABSTRACT: According to Quine, Charles Parsons, Mark Steiner, and others, Russell’s logicist project is important because, if successful, it would show that mathematical theorems possess desirable epistemic properties often attributed to logical theorems, such as aprioricity, necessity, and certainty. Unfortunately, Russell never attributed such importance to logicism, and such a thesis contradicts Russell’s explicitly stated views on the relationship between logic and mathematics. This raises the question: what did Russell understand to be the philosophical importance of logicism? Building on recent work by Andrew Irvine and Martin Godwyn, I argue that Russell thought a systematic reduction of mathematics increases the certainty of known mathematical theorems (even basic arithmetical facts) by showing mathematical knowledge to be coherently organized. The paper outlines Russell’s theory of coherence, and discusses its relevance to logicism and the certainty attributed to mathematics.\n|Brice Halimi||“Generality of Logical\nABSTRACT: My aim is to examine logical types in Principia Mathematica from two (partly independent) perspectives. The first one pertains to the ambiguity of the notion of logical type as introduced in the Introduction (to the first edition). I claim that a distinction has to be made between types as called for in the context of paradoxes, and types as logical prototypes. The second perspective bears on typical ambiguity as described in Russell and Whitehead’s “Prefatory Statement of Symbolic Conventions”, inasmuch as it lends itself to a comparison with specific systems of modern typed λ-calculus. In particular, a recent paper shows that the theory of logical types can be formalized in the way of a λ-calculus. This opens the way to an interesting reconciliation between type theories in the Russellian sense of the word, and type theories in the modern sense. But typical ambiguity is left aside in the paper. I would like to extend the suggestion by taking up the question of typical ambiguity, still in the realm of typed λ-calculus.\nABSTRACT: Ramsey defined truth in the following way: x is true if and only if ∃p(x = [p] & p). This definition is ill-formed in standard first-order logic, so it is normally interpreted using substitutional or some kind of higher-order quantifier. I argue that these quantifiers fail to provide an adequate reading of the definition, but that, given certain adjustments, standard objectual quantification does provide an adequate reading.\n|Roman Murawski||“On Chwistek’s\nABSTRACT: The paper is devoted to the presentation of Chwistek’s philosophical ideas concerning logic and mathematics. The main feature of his philosophy was nominalism, which found full expression in his philosophy of mathematics. He claimed that the object of the deductive sciences, hence in particular of mathematics, is the expression being constructed in them according to accepted rules of construction. He treated geometry, arithmetic, mathematical analysis and other mathematical theories as experimental disciplines, and obtained in this way a nominalistic interpretation of them. The fate of Chwistek’s philosophical conceptions was similar to the fate of his logical conceptions. The system of rational meta-mathematics was not developed by him in detail. He worked on his own ideas without any collaboration with other logicians, mathematicians or philosophers. His investigations were not in the mainstream of the development of logic and philosophy of mathematics.\n|Irving H. Anellis||“Did Principia\nPrecipitate a ‘Fregean Revolution’?”|\nABSTRACT: I begin by asking whether there was a Fregean revolution in logic, and, if so, in what did it consist. I then ask whether, and if so, to what extent, Russell played a decisive role in carrying through the Fregean revolution, and, if so, how. A subsidiary question is whether it was primarily the influence of The Principles of Mathematics or Principia Mathematica, or perhaps both, that stimulated and helped consummate the Fregean revolution. Finally, I examine cases in which logicians sought to integrate traditional logic into the Fregean paradigm, focusing on the case of Henry Bradford Smith. My proposed conclusion is that there were different means adopted for rewriting the syllogism, in terms of the logic of relations, in terms of the propositional calculus, or as formulas of the monadic predicate calculus. This suggests that the changes implemented as a result of the adoption of the Russell–Fregean conception of logic could more accurately be called by Grattan-Guinness’s term convolution, rather than revolution.\n|Kenneth Blackwell||“The Wit and Humour of\nABSTRACT: Except for belatedly proving that “1 + 1 = 2”, Principia Mathematica doesn’t feature in studies of mathematical humour.

{"question":"As a veterinarian specializing in equine nutrition, I'm curious about the relationship between mineral intake and urolithiasis in horses. What are the essential minerals horses need in their diet, and how can excessive mineral consumption contribute to stone formation?","answer":"Horses require several essential minerals including calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and sodium, as well as trace minerals like copper, zinc, manganese, selenium, and iron. However, mineral intake must be carefully balanced as equine urine is typically alkaline with high mineral content, creating an environment conducive to urolith formation. The most common type of stone in horses is calcium carbonate, and high calcium-containing feeds like alfalfa and legumes should be restricted to prevent urolithiasis. Mineral consumption from all feed and water sources should be balanced according to nutritional requirements, and the ratio between minerals like calcium and phosphorus needs to be carefully maintained for optimal benefits.","context":["Urolithiasis and obstructive urolithiasis are far less common in horses than in ruminants. The most common stone type in horses is calcium carbonate and is associated more with older rather than young, growing animals. Males are more often affected, with geldings overrepresented. There does not appear to be a breed predilection.\nThe general principles of urolith formation are common to all species. An initial organic matrix forms and is bound to by inorganic minerals, establishing the stable structure. Horses normally have high amounts of mucoprotein present in their urine, which may serve as a binding substrate for minerals. Equine urine is also typically alkaline and has a high mineral content, providing a suitable environment for urolith formation.\nCalcium carbonate crystals may be found in normal equine urine, and therefore calcium carbonate is the most common urolith type. It can occur in two forms, one in which the surface is rough and the urolith may be crumbled relatively easily and a second that is smooth on the surface and quite resistant to crushing or fragmentation. This second form is most similar to calcium carbonate in ruminants, although both types in horses are chemically identical. Struvite, calcium phosphate, and sabulous uroliths may also occur.\nUroliths in horses form most often in the urinary bladder, where they may remain, or may drop into the urethra and be passed or may obstruct. Less commonly, uroliths form in the renal pelvis and may break off to obstruct the ureters. Renal papillary necrosis associated with NSAID administration may also result in nephrolithiasis.\nHorses with cystic calculi or urethral calculi may present with dysuria, pollakiuria, and hematuria.

Occasionally, in mares, an individual with a small hand may be able to retrieve a urolith transurethrally. Laser lithotripsy may also be performed via endoscopy to fragment a stone for removal without surgery. A variety of surgical options are available for relief of urinary obstruction and removal of uroliths in horses:\nLaser or shock wave lithotripsy may be required as an adjunct to any of these procedures.\nCulture of the urine and urolith analysis is indicated with any retrieved urolith material to guide additional treatment and prevention measures.\nMineral consumption from all feed and water sources should be balanced in light of nutritional requirements and the mineral components of uroliths. Urinary acidification may be achieved using ammonium chloride (50–200, mg/kg, PO, daily) or ammonium sulfate (200–300 mg/kg, PO, daily). Because calcium-containing uroliths predominate in horses and acidification increases calcium excretion and availability in the urine, high calcium-containing feeds, including alfalfa and other legumes, should be restricted.

There are so many options available, it can be a minefield working out the best option for your equine friend. So what about loose minerals – do your horses need them in their diet?\nIf you go down to the feed store you will see a huge range of horse food on offer, including many different supplements. It is vital that your horse gets the correct vitamins and minerals in his diet, and that they are fed in the right amounts. Let’s take a look at the world of horse feed supplements and see what is best for your horse!\nWhy Is A Vitamin And Mineral Supplement Necessary For Horses?\nTo figure out why horses might need a vitamin and mineral supplement, we first need to take a look at their normal diet. Horses are herbivores and eat mainly grass and hay. Domesticated horses may get additional feed, such as cereals, sugar beet pulp, and oils.\nThe grass and hay that horses eat will provide almost all of their nutritional needs. In the wild, a horse would also be able to access a wide range of herbs, bushes, and trees. They would nibble on these plants to gain essential nutrients.\nIn a domesticated situation, we have greatly reduced the amount of plants that a horse can eat. They can graze all day on lush grass and eat hay when in the barn, but will not be able to nibble on herbs, bushes, and trees. This means that they may not get all the nutrients they need.\nAnother factor we need to take into account with domesticated horses is that they may have additional nutritional requirements. This may be because we are asking them to do extra work, in the form of exercise. Horses will also need extra nutrients if they are growing, or during periods of ill health, or old age.\nThis means that, as well as grass and hay, domesticated horses should be fed a vitamin and mineral supplement. If your horse is being fed a complete feed or balancer, then this should contain all the additional nutrients they need. If not, you might consider giving loose minerals instead.\nCan Horses Have Loose Minerals?\nLike all animals, horses need certain minerals to stay healthy. Minerals are inorganic nutrients and are only needed in very small amounts.\nThe essential minerals that horses require are:\nRead more about Caring For Horses: Information For Beginners\nSome minerals are needed in even smaller amounts, and are known as trace minerals:\nSo, while all these minerals are essential, how much do horses need? Well, this is the tricky part! They are all needed in very small amounts, and the ratio between each mineral is also important.\nFor example, high levels of selenium can be toxic to horses, so care must be taken not to feed too much of this trace mineral to your horse. Some minerals, such as calcium and phosphorous, need to be in perfect balance to give optimal benefits.\nSo, how do we get this balance right? Firstly, you need to take a look at what your horse is currently being fed. If you are giving him the recommended daily amount of a complete feed or balancer then he will already be getting all the minerals he needs.\nIf this is not the case, then you should think about adding a vitamin and mineral supplement to your horse’s diet. An easy way to do this is to purchase a complete supplement in powder form and add this to a small feed for your horse each day.\nHowever, it may not always be practical to feed your horse daily, particularly if he lives in a large herd. In this situation then you could consider giving loose minerals instead.\nHow Much Loose Minerals Do Horses Need?\nLoose minerals are salt-based mineral supplement that is fed in a loose form. Unlike mineral blocks, that are formed into a brick-like shape, loose minerals are left as individual grains, that is licked up by the horse.\nLoose minerals are normally fed in a specialized feeder, that the horse can access at any time. This gives the horse free choice to eat as much or as little as he wants. Loose minerals can also be added to the horse’s feed in the same way as any other supplement.\nLoose minerals are made of trace mineral salt and will contain high levels of sodium and chloride as well as other trace minerals. This mineral salt should not contain calcium or phosphorus, as these minerals should be provided in the daily feed rations.\nThe minerals contained in loose mineral salt are not necessarily dangerous if consumed in large amounts, but it is vital that your horse is not allowed to overindulge on them.\nIf your horse has free access to his loose minerals, you will have very little control over how much he eats. He will eat as much or as little as he wants every day! Luckily, most horses will naturally avoid eating too much mineral salt, so an overdose of trace minerals is unlikely.\nHowever, if you are adding loose minerals to the feed, you should always follow the manufacturers’ recommendations.\nWhat Is A Good Mineral Block For Horses?\nMineral blocks are also a form of mineral salt, but that has been pressed into block form. The horse can lick the block at will to get the minerals he needs. This is a slower way for the horse to get minerals, that also reduces the risk of overconsumption.\nLook for a mineral block that contains sodium, chloride, and trace minerals. A mineral block should not contain calcium or phosphorus.\nRead more The Best Salt Block For Horses\nSo, as we have learned, loose minerals for horses can be fed when there are insufficient minerals in the horse’s diet. Horses that are fed the recommended amount of a feed balancer do not need a mineral supplement. Mineral blocks are a solid alternative to loose minerals.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts on horse vitamin and mineral supplements! Do you give your horse loose minerals?

{"question":"Does economic growth translate to increased happiness in nations, and what factors influence this relationship?","answer":"The relationship between economic growth and happiness is complex. While high-income countries generally have greater life satisfaction than low-income countries, after a certain point, extra national wealth does not lead to increased satisfaction and may slightly erode it. This is evident in rich countries where happiness levels have flat-lined despite rising wealth. The relationship is influenced by economic inequality - larger gaps between rich and poor lead to less happiness and more crime. This pattern is seen in Scandinavian countries, which top happiness charts due to having the least socioeconomic inequality in the developed world. The phenomenon is explained through concepts like shifting aspirations, where people's material expectations increase with wealth, and through Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, where poorer countries fulfill lower-level needs as they get wealthier, but after a certain point, material needs are satisfied and additional wealth has diminishing returns on happiness.","context":["Worldwide surveys have consistently ranked the Scandinavian countries — with their generous family-leave policies, low crime, free health care, rich economies and, yes, high income taxes — as the happiest places on earth. But this happiness has always been accompanied by a paradox: the happiest countries also seem to have the highest suicide rates.\nIs it the long, dark winters facing Finland and Denmark that cause the problem? Or some kind of Nordic depression gene? Or none of the above? A new study suggests the problem is not specific to Scandinavia, finding that high suicide rates accompany high rates of happiness in comparisons of U.S. states as well.\nEconomists from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the University of Warwick in England and Hamilton College in New York examined life satisfaction scores provided by 2.3 million Americans state by state, and comparing these with state suicide rates. Utah, for example, ranks highest in life satisfaction — but also has the ninth highest suicide rate in the U.S. The No. 2 happiest state is Hawaii, which comes in fifth for suicides. New York, in contrast, comes in 45th in life satisfaction but has America’s lowest suicide rate.\n(More on Time.com: Paradise Paradox: Why Life in Hawaii Leads to Early Death)\nThe study has been accepted for forthcoming publication in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization.\nBoth happiness and crime rates tend to be tied to rankings of economic inequality in states as well as countries — the larger the gap between rich and poor, the less happiness there is and the more crime. This helps explain why the Scandinavians continue to top the charts for most positive outcomes: they have the least socioeconomic inequality in the developed world.\nOverall life expectancy also tracks with inequality, with a bigger wage gap meaning shorter lives and worse health — for both rich and poor, though the poor are hit much harder.\nResearchers suspect that this gradient is linked to stress caused by our place in the social heirarchy: Stanford’s Robert Sapolsky, for example, has found that even in baboons, lower ranked animals have higher levels of stress hormones and worse health. But when status conflicts are reduced, producing a more egalitarian situation, these differences are also reduced.\n(More on Time.com: Misery Loves Company, Especially on Facebook)\nStudies of British civil servants have also found that stress-related health problems — like heart disease, obesity and stroke — are directly linked with hierarchy, increasing as a person moves lower down the totem pole.\nSo why doesn’t suicide follow this same gradient? The current study doesn’t provide the whole answer but author Stephen Wu told the New York Times’ Well blog that comparisons with others — comparisons of relative happiness in this case, rather than status — may play a role:\n“Perhaps for those at the bottom end, in a way their situation may seem worse in relative terms, when compared with people who are close to them or their neighbors. … For someone who is quite unhappy, the relative comparison may lead to more unhappiness and depression.”\nSadly, this may mean that increasing happiness by reducing economic inequality could paradoxically produce more suicides as a “side effect.” But this is one problem we are unlikely to have, as economic inequality is high and rising in the U.S.","The measurement of happiness has become vogue in economics and public policy. But is there any real use to it, or is it just a gimmick?\nIn May 2006, David Cameron, then recently-elected leader of the Conservative Party, told a Google-sponsored conference that: “it’s time we focused not just on GDP, but on GWB – general well-being”. Since 2010, the UK’s Office of National Statistics has followed through on this idea with regular surveys of the nation’s wellbeing wherein self-reported life satisfaction (strongly related to but not synonymous with ‘happiness’) has played an important part. So too have a number of other nations: USA, France, Canada and so on.\nI can see the rationale. Whereas more objective measures such as GDP per capita and the like have long been traditional goals of public policy, they can be seen not as ends in themselves but rather a means to creating a contented and satisfied population – the truly valuable ‘output’ of an economy. So if happiness is the end surely it is best to measure it? Not least because, in one number, it can encapsulate the benefits of a large number of difficult-to-measure intermediate ‘goods’ – e.g. security, cultural richness, nice environment and the like.\nThe positive news for such an approach is that in many ways studies on happiness are consistent with some of the traditional economic measures in a way that makes intuitive sense. For instance, the results of a Gallup World Poll of life satisfaction indicate that, “high-income countries have greater life satisfaction than low-income countries” even if, for the richest countries there is little relationship between income and happiness. \nPositive news also is that measures of happiness are in line with aspects of society that are often seen as subjectively ‘good’ in their own right. For instance, a study of the effect of democratic participation on happiness conducted in Switzerland (where the large number of decisions put to popular vote and the measureable differences in ability to vote among different cantons allow quantitative analysis) shows that “direct democracy…and federal structure…systematically and sizeably raise self-reported individual well-being”.  More controversially, given its political implications, is a purported link between equality and health and happiness. Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson’s 2010 book ‘The Spirit Level’, was a best-selling presentation of this idea.\nDespite some of these links, I think it’s clear that using happiness as a measure of wellbeing and thus as a tool for policymaking has some serious weaknesses. For one thing, any measure of happiness is, by definition, subjective. It is therefore not possible to disentangle cultural norms from the answers received: in short, if an Englishman tells a survey that he is ‘fairly happy’ is it possible that he is feeling the same emotion as a Swede who is ‘very happy’? Unless I’d just won the Euromillions rollover on the day West Ham signed Lionel Messi, ‘not too bad’ is the best you’ll usually get from me.\nOne puzzle that underlines this difficulty is the issue of suicide. In criminology, homicide rates are often used as a benchmark of crime because – regardless of culture and of time – it is one offence that is always reported and recorded. By analogy, suicide could be seen as a benchmark of unhappiness – no matter what a subjective survey answer says about happiness, it is certain that an individual who commits suicide is not happy. But there is very little relationship between high reported levels of happiness and low suicide rates – indeed “the happiest places have the highest suicide rates” \nIn a less dramatic way, reported happiness levels show some other odd characteristics. For instance, looking at data from the USA, the level of happiness at a point in time for a cross section of the population is positively related to income: high income means high happiness. However, if a cohort (a group of individuals selected for study) is followed though time, its satisfaction levels do not grow despite that fact that its income grows with time (as individuals become more successful and senior within their chosen employment). What’s more, when people are asked to compare their life satisfaction at the time of the survey with their satisfaction in the past they claim they are happier than they were. Likewise, when asked to predict how they will feel in the future they respond that they will be even happier. Taken together, these three observations – positive effect of income at a point in time; constant satisfaction for a cohort moving through time; and an upwards-sloping curve of expectation and recollection of satisfaction – are completely inconsistent.  It’s a paradox.\nThe economist Richard Easterlin proposed a conceptual framework to explain this inconsistency.  If individuals have a set of material aspirations (desire to own a hi-fi, own a car, own a home etc.) then, as more items on the list are ‘crossed off’, the more satisfaction as person could be expected to feel. If people start off with similar aspirations (an assertion that he provides evidence for by referencing a study showing the almost identical ‘wish list’ of young Americans) then higher income would lead to higher satisfaction. It would also explain the observation about past versus present, and present versus expected future satisfaction: compared to an individual’s current state and current aspirations, the past may well have been worse and, if the individual expects a higher future income, the future would be better.\nBut what of the observation that a cohort’s actual satisfaction does not change over time? To answer this, Easterlin suggests that, as individuals become wealthier, their aspirations alter. It takes more to make them happy: instead of any car, they need a fast car; instead of any home, they need a bigger one in a better neighbourhood. If shifting aspirations keep pace with additional income, then, Easterlin proposes, over time a cohort’s satisfaction will remain unchanged. Anyone who has ever worked in the City or on Wall Street will be entirely familiar with this feeling. My first ever bonus (which caused unbridled joy at the time) would have met with a disrespectful sneer by the time of my retirement.\nSeen on a macro scale, this framework would also explain aspects of countries’ self-reported happiness: after a certain point, extra national wealth does not lead to extra satisfaction (and may erode it slightly). Happiness levels in most rich countries have flat lined despite rising wealth.  In my view, these insights relate to the work in the field of psychology by Maslow – in particular his ‘Hierarchy of Needs’ wherein he theorised that “the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction of another more [predominant] need”.  Poorer countries are fulfilling lower level needs as they get wealthier but, after a certain point, material needs are fundamentally satisfied and Easterlin’s ‘shifting aspirations’ model takes over thus reducing the connection between income and satisfaction. It would also explain the link between democratic participation and happiness if this is a higher order need for an already rich country.\nOverall though, the use of happiness as a macro measure of well-being and as a guide to policy seems badly flawed, at least once a country reaches a certain level of material development: it is simply too unresponsive to changes in other variables and lacks explanatory power for some social ills (e.g. suicide). But there is one way that measuring happiness may be useful. Micro studies that explore how various life events affect happiness may have some use. For example, Blanchflower and Oswald’s study of wellbeing in the UK and the US shows that the happiness impact of unemployment and divorce “are large” (unsurprisingly). The dollar income needed to create the same happiness as that of “a lasting marriage…is estimated to be worth $100,000 a year”.  Sounds a bit low in my case; but since there is a chance my wife might read this, I am rather axed to say so.\nBut what studies like this do suggest is that focusing public policy on strengthening the institution of marriage or on using public funds to avoid unemployment (despite the fact that such a measure could possibly reduce GDP growth) could make sense if happiness maximization in a policy goal. It is in this ‘neo-utilitarian’ way, in my view, that indicators like ‘happiness’ may be of use – to provide some quantitative backing to policy debates, which, currently, are based solely on handwaving qualitative or ideological arguments.\nI think we might all be happy with that."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c609433d-a926-4ac2-848a-8f0e71f26d27>","<urn:uuid:7429edb8-c8e9-4512-9749-0ce92d65d6f2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the Arctic Drift House design adapt to the environment, and what potential impacts could increased shipping have on Arctic marine life?","answer":"The Drift House adapts to the Arctic environment by using snow fences that passively utilize snowdrift to form dwellings. It features four nested surfaces made of ETFE panels creating climatic zones, where accumulated snow serves both as part of the dwelling and as a counterweight to the structure. This design combines high-tech thermal materials with natural snow to create thermal gradients. As for impacts on marine life, increased Arctic shipping affects different species differently, with narwhals being most vulnerable due to their restricted range and sensitivity to disturbance. While polar bears and ringed seals show lower vulnerability to shipping in September, the impacts vary by location, with areas near shipping chokepoints like the Bering Strait and Northwest Passage facing greater risks.","context":["With shelters and settlements in northern Canada currently undergoing a housing crisis due to decadent construction and energy costs, the corresponding ramifications on overcrowding and deprivation have resulted. What the Drift House aims to do is hybridize the intelligence of tradition and technology of both housing systems to offer direction on future constructions in the Arctic. Designed by Neeraj Bhatia of The Open Workshop, this housing prototype for northern climates proposes a series of snow fences that passively utilize snowdrift to form a new dwelling type by calibrating the snow fences with differential mesh openings and height. More images and architect’s description after the break.\nWith insufficient core populations to support public structures, the typology of dwelling has attained the highest level of refinement within the Arctic’s unique climate. Pre-WWII indigenous Inuit Housing Types had embedded connections to the local landscape, its orientation, materials and fabrication, while embracing the nomadic Inuit lifestyle. With zero ecological footprint, these temporal dwellings employed opportunities from the landscape and atmosphere to form a complex shelter that negotiated thermal performance, local materials, soft construction techniques, program and cultural values.\nPermanent architecture –in the form of prefabricated Government housing– was employed in an effort to assert Arctic Sovereignty during the Cold War era by the Canadian Government. Despite instilling new notions of comfort and durability, this new housing neglected the cultural and sustainable intelligence of traditional dwellings. Importing a ‘southern’ model of dwelling, these hermetic containers were highly contingent on imported materials, energy consumption, labor, and transport costs, while forcing a transformation to the Inuit lifestyle that severed a connection to the dynamic landscape. These typologies have formed the template for Arctic shelter and settlements in Canada that still persists today.\nWhile the snow fence is a static infrastructure to protect roadways, it is manipulated to produce a precise pattern of passive snow accumulation from the dynamics of snowdrift. By understanding a malleable system, such as snowdrift, architecture can be formed in response to the landscape — calibrating, mitigating and using once ‘problematic’ environments in an opportunistic manner.\nThe house is comprised of four nested surfaces formed of ETFE panels that create a series of climatic zones that are parasitic to the calibrated snowdrifts. The accumulated snow passively ‘builds’ part of the dwelling, while also serving as a counterweight to the light cantilevered structure. The nested thermal environments produce a series of thermal zones related to the interior program and traditional lifestyles.\nThis hybridized space — a series of planes positioned in relation to a dynamic system, meshes high-tech thermal materials with the landscape (snow) to create soft thermal gradients. By using snow as a material, structural counterweight, and enclosure, the Drift House is able to passively accumulate a responsive shelter through the manipulation of a generic technology (the snow fence) to form new a typology of dwelling and construction.\nArchitects: Neeraj Bhatia/The Open Workshop\nLocation: Northern Canada\nProject Research and Design Team: Neeraj Bhatia (Director), Tracy Bremer, Mary Casper, ZachariahGlennon, Alicia Hergenroeder, Brian Lee & Sonia Ramundi\nFunded by: Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, MIT Lawrence B. Anderson Award & Rice School of Architecture Faculty Research Grant","The expected growth in Arctic ship traffic is likely to affect marine mammals in the region, but those impacts will vary from species to species, as well as from one area to another. And gaps in research mean that uncertainty remains about how some of those impacts will play out.\nThose are the findings of a new study just published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, aimed at figuring out how increased shipping will affect seven species of marine mammals as Arctic waters become increasingly ice free in summer months thanks to climate change.\nThe study found narwhals, which were both more exposed to shipping routes and more sensitive to impacts, to be the most vulnerable species. It also found that populations near features that concentrated ship traffic into narrow lanes — such as the Bering Strait and parts of Canada’s Northwest Passage — were more vulnerable than populations elsewhere.\n“There’s a wide body of research at lower latitudes that shows that [vessel traffic] effects marine mammals. We have the opportunity now to prepare for the future, as vessels start using these newly assessable routes in the Arctic,” said Donna Hauser, lead author of the study and a research assistant professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\nThe study focused on major shipping routes in September, when Arctic waters are the most open to vessel traffic (though that may change with further warming). They then looked at the ranges of 80 Arctic marine mammal subpopulations during September, which included polar bears, narwhals, ringed and bearded seals, walruses and beluga and bowhead whales, and identified where they overlap with sea routes, which they calculated as an “exposure score.”\nAlong with this exposure score, the authors also calculated how sensitive each subpopulation could be to marine traffic using seven variables. These included how often the population would be exposed to vessels, if there were threats for acoustic disturbances or vessel strikes, how large the population was and if it was increasing or decreasing in size.\nThese two calculations went into the authors’ vulnerability score for each subpopulation. They found that 53 percent of the 80 subpopulations would be exposed to vessel traffic in either the Northwest Passage or Northern Sea Route (or both) in September.\nNarwhals were the most vulnerable marine mammal species, with the Eclipse Sound population the most vulnerable subpopulation. Walruses were the next most vulnerable, followed by bowhead whales, while polar bears and ringed seals had the lowest vulnerability of all species studied.\nNarwhals’ restricted range makes them particularly vulnerable, as well as their overlap with shipping routes and sensitivity to disturbance. Polar bears are largely on land during September and have less sensitivity to sound, traits that help keep their vulnerability scores low.\nBut, Hauser pointed out, that these scores may have been different if they focused on other months when the polar bears are closer to the shipping routes.\nThe paper also mentioned the uncertainties surrounding some species due to a lack of data and information about the animals’ behavior. The seal species scored the highest and second highest in that measure, followed by polar bears.\n“It’s a broad brush for a number of reasons, probably the main one being we don’t really have the data yet for some of these species; some of these are really poorly documented,” said Peter Boveng, program leader of the Polar Ecosystems Program for seals at the Marine Mammal Laboratory.\nThis lack of data is a common theme in Arctic research, with its high price tags and remote locations. And certain species, including seals and walruses, are simply harder to study, said Boveng.\nBecause of its focus on an open-water month in the Arctic, the study also didn’t look at the impact of icebreakers on some of these species. Disturbing the ice could have more of a negative impact on seals and polar bears, especially during their breeding, molting and foraging periods.\n“One can imagine that not all shipping is going to happen in September and there could be cases that, to make the use of the shipping route economically, perhaps there will be more icebreaking in the early or late season,” said Boveng.\nShip traffic in the Arctic is expected to rise in over the next decade, as companies take advantage of a more direct route between Asia and Europe and North America and as Russia develops more Arctic oil and gas fields.\n“I consider ship traffic as by far the greatest environmental challenge in the Arctic Ocean. Bigger threat than oil and gas,” Paul Wassmann, professor at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, wrote in an email.\nAnd while this study is a good start to understand the impacts of that increase on marine mammals in the region, both Wassmann and Boveng said that other impacts these ships might have on the animals — from leaking chemicals to potential oil spills — should be considered.\n“It’s very difficult to put a number on those things, but they certainly come with the territory,” said Boveng."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38b0946f-05b5-4250-9fe1-99c23bb4434f>","<urn:uuid:dba13b44-390b-47d5-a465-2851498451f1>"],"error":null}

Great information!\nCHILDREN SAVING CHILDREN\nRecently there have been articles in the local paper and the national news about young children saving even younger siblings and friends from drowning. Although they make for a wonderful story that tugs at the heart for the \"little hero\", reality is that the families are very lucky that they did not loose both children to a double drowning. Each year there are stories of parents drowning while frantically trying to recover their drowning child from lakes, rivers, ponds and pools. Friends have drowned together while trying to rescue each other. Husband and wives have drowned from over turned boats and one is not a good swimmer and the second also drowns when attempting to rescue their loved one. Double drownings are not uncommon. The best rule of aquatic safety is to teach your children to yell for help (very loudly), push something out into the water for the other person to grab onto and never swim in an unsupervised area. But the major rule of safety around water is to NEVER GO IN AFTER A PERSON WHO IS IN AQUATIC DISTRESS. Even lifeguards are taught to only enter the water as a last effort to save the victim. ALWAYS, reach, throw or row...never go unless you are a trained lifeguard that has been taught aquatic rescue and extraction techniques. Parents should never become over confident about their child's safety around water. Not even in backyard wading pools. It does not take much water for a person to drown in and the danger is always there. Should we teach our children to be afraid? No. But do teach them to respect the powerful force of water and get them into an instructional program that does teach safety rules first and good swimming and survival techniques. And then, NEVER LEAVE YOUR CHILD UNATTENDED IN A SITUATION THAT CAN TAKE OR ENDANGER THEIR LIVES.\nConfused about life-jacket? Are floaties really safe? We understand your confusion. There are many different types of water equipment now sold on the open market and if you are not trained to tell the difference, it is difficult to figure out what is the best for your child. Maybe we can help with a little bit of the confusion here. Here is a shortened version of our opinion The best method of keeping your child safe in water is to 1) get him/her into a swim program that teaches strong swimming skills and how to make smart decision around water. 2) ALWAYS swim in a supervised area and never allow your child to swim alone. 3) Never assume that because your child is wearing some type of floatation device that they are safe. The best life jackets are the type that come around and behind the neck to keep the head out of the water if the swimmer becomes unconscious. They are actually made to turn a person from a face down position to face up if the swimmer is injured.These are usually orange and are carried on boats. Though uncomfortable and not very stylish, they do tend to be the better one on the market. And of course the main thing to look for is the Coast Guard Approval stamp and what the weight requirements are. Other floatation devices such as a vest can also be a good choice as long as you make sure that they are the proper fit and weight for your child and again, are Coast Guard Approved. The suits with built in floatation should also be cautiously used since a child can become face down and not able to roll over or sit up to get air. Again, be sure there has been testing done with the suit before purchasing it. One on the market now for children, gives us great concern. It is a floatation device that goes around the back in the shoulder blade area and buckles with a strap in front. It also has arm bands attached (much like floaties). And although the device may float a child in an upright position if conscious, it is uncertain if the child would float face up if injured or unconscious. When inspected, we found no Coast Guard approval stamp nor a size or weight limit on it. The worst item we see parents trusting to keep their children safe are the blow up arm band floaties. Although a favorite of young swimmers, we would caution parents about believing that their child is safe with them on. They have been manufactured as a toy and are great fun when properly being supervised by and adult ( we use them for water aerobics and other classes in our school, but never as a safety floatation. The problem with the blow up arm bands is that they do tend to slip off the arms, especially if the child is jumping into water. And since height increases speed on entry, blow up floaties a re NEVER recommended for going off the side of the pool or diving boards in the deep end. Floaties are for fun but if not watched over closely, they can be a deadly toy. Also remember that there is no such thing as water proofing a child or adult.

Rescue work begins in a couple of minutes (or hours depending on where you are) and soon experienced professionals will be rescuing and assisting you for further treatment.\nBut what if an accident occurs at sea? What is a cruise ship is in a distressing situation?\nWe’re talking about 6680 people on board (not to forget a 2200 people crew which equals to a total of around 8800, approx. 9000 people!) a cruise ship now (Let’s say onboard Symphony of the Seas- the world’s largest cruise liner or we all remember Costa Concordia, right?).\nHow do authorities even allow for such vessels to operate in notorious ocean waters where the waves and weather conditions are highly unpredictable? Does the ship have certain means to save lives in event of a disaster by the time they are aided by a rescue team?\nApart from the stringent rules and regulations followed during ship design and construction, it is mandatory to carry onboard certain life-saving equipment and appliances, which are helpful in saving the lives of people in the event of a disaster.\nThis article focuses on such life-saving equipment present onboard ships. One thing to keep in mind is not all ships have all the life-saving equipment mentioned herein.\nIt depends on the ship type, number of passengers (and crew) on board and the requirement pertaining to safety regulations that determine the type and quantity of life-saving equipment available.\nListed below are the main life-saving equipment used for evacuating and saving lives of people when a ship is under distress.\nThese are the primary life-saving equipment used when the crew and passengers are supposed to ‘abandon’ the ship and need out of water support. They must be available in sufficient quantity and support the required capacity and size such that the total number of persons on board can be evacuated from either port or starboard. ( This is done so that in case the ship is capsizing to one side, say port, the lifeboats can be lowered from the starboard side and everyone on board can be saved.)\nIn small vessels, such as harbour and river crafts open lifeboats and semi-enclosed lifeboats are used.\nFor all large vessels plying in oceans totally enclosed lifeboats are provided. This is done to ensure better protection against the weather and sea. They are fitted with small diesel engines for self-propulsion at a speed of around 6 knots and carry fuel for 24 hours of operation.\nIMO adopted Resolution MSC.402(96) highlighting the necessary requirements for the maintenance, repair, overhaul and thorough examination of lifeboats along with testing of their release gear.\nMoreover, following items ought to be thoroughly inspected wherever fitted and checked for satisfactory condition and operation-\n- Sprinkler System\n- Bailing System\n- The fender/skate arrangements\n- Rescue boat righting system\n- Boat structure condition (with a visual examination of external boundaries)\n- Engine and propulsion system\n- Manoeuvring System\n- Power Supply System\n- Air Supply System\nTypes of lifeboats used on ships\nMeasures to stop accidents on lifeboats\nLife Rafts and Inflatable Buoyant Apparatus\nThese are the secondary means of life-saving equipment on ship. Inflation of life rafts is done with carbon dioxide from the storage cylinder packed within the raft inside a container.\nThey may be launched via davits, cradles or free-fall racks (Davit launched rafts are launched usually from a single davit). They are first inflated on-board, boarded and then lowered into the water.\nLife rafts are subjected to a number of tests such as drop test, jump test, weight test, towing test etc. Some additional tests like damage tests, inflation test, pressure test, seam strength test etc. are peculiar only to inflatable life rafts.\nTo read more about each of these tests refer to Resolution MSC.81(70) Part 1-5\nThey are buoyant, rigid and ‘non-inflatable’ platforms with a similar function as life rafts but having downside of occupying more deck space. They are also subjected to various tests like material test, buoyancy test etc. to assess their reliability.\nThese are small, lightweight boats designed with the objective of rescuing people in distress and towing the survival crafts (such as life rafts and buoyant apparatus). They are designed as such to be launched in minutes and must remain stable when recovering a person in the water from either side of the boat. They are usually davit launched and come in different shapes and sizes.\nThe material used for construction is usually fibreglass with the addition of inflated rubber buoyancy chambers for extra stability.\nThey are subjected to tests like towing test, rigid rescue boat seating test, overload test, operation tests, righting tests, manoeuvrability etc.\nTo read in detail about these tests refer to Resolution MSC.81(70) Part 1-7\nA Guide to Different Types of Boats\nLife Preservers or Personal Floatation Devices\nLike rescue boats, personal floatation devices also come in a variety of shapes, sizes and designs. They may be either of solid buoyancy type with closed-cell foam or may be inflatable.\nInflation can be done either orally or carbon dioxide cartridge or combination of both. (We’ve all seen such life jackets present under the seats of every commercial airliner).\nLife Jackets are fitted with whistles to grab the attention of rescue people as well as a light which illuminates as soon as it touches the water to help in easy spotting people in distress. Alternatively, a chemical light stick and a reflective material may be used.\nThe life jackets are also subjected to various tests like temperature cycling, buoyancy, fire, stability, strength etc.\nTo know more about these tests, refer to Resolution MSC.81(70) Part 1-2\nThese are the common life-saving equipment present in all small and large vessels (You may have spotted them even on the sides of swimming pools). They are fitted around the perimeter of ship’s weather deck and are meant to be thrown rapidly to a person overboard.\nA man overboard is a common occurrence and these buoys provide the fastest aid for floatation in such a case.\nThe following table states the minimum number of lifebuoys (based on ship’s length) in accordance with SOLAS requirements.\nThe SOLAS requirements necessitate the below specifications ( for each lifebuoy)\n- The buoy’s outer diameter should not exceed 800mm with the inner diameter measuring at least 400mm\n- It should be installed as such to withstand free fall into the water above the ship’s waterline\n- Should weigh a minimum of 2.5 kg and be able to maintain 14.5 kg of iron afloat in freshwater for 24 hours.\n- It should be made of non-fading material\n- Burning shouldn’t be sustained with no melting after being enveloped in a fire for 2 seconds.\n- The lifebuoys are also subjected to a number of mandatory tests including temperature cycling test, drop test, test for oil resistance, the fire test, floatation test, strength test, test for operation with light and smoke signal and self-activating smoke signal tests.\nTo read more about each of these tests refer to Resolution MSC.81(70) Part 1-1\nWhy did people die despite wearing life jackets after the Titanic sank? The answer is hypothermia.\nWell, that’s where the survival suits become increasingly important. They are also called immersion suits and are used as protection overalls.\nTheir main function is to reduce the body-heat loss of a person in cold water and hence prevent death due to hypothermia.\nTypical designs allow the body temperature to prevent falling below 35 degree Celsius for six hours for a person in the water at 0 degrees Celsius.\nSome of the important requirements highlighted in SOLAS Chap.III/32 is\n- An immersion suit should be provided for every person onboard the ship. For ships other than bulk carriers it can be obviated provided the ship is continuously engaged in warm water voyages.\n- In case of a remotely located watch or work stations, an appropriate number of immersion suits should be provided at these locations itself.\n- They should be readily accessible with a clear indication of their positions\nTo read more about immersion suits, anti-exposure suits and thermal protective aids refer to Resolution MSC.81(70) Part 1-3\nWhen we have around 8800 people on board, it becomes a mammoth (and very important) task to communicate and alert each and every passenger and crew members of the situation and dictate the necessary steps and instructions to be followed.\nAny miscommunication or lack of communication can have disastrous ramifications. Hence these systems also form a part of life-saving equipment. All ships are fitted with general alarm systems so as to alert and summon the crew to their fire stations or boat stations.\nPassenger vessels are to be equipped with public address systems. Communication systems also include Portable Very High Frequency (VHF) Radios (commonly referred to as walkie-talkies) and are provided for emergency crew communications.\nEmergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRB)\nHow does a rescue ship reach the exact location of a disaster? It’s quite obvious it cannot be done visually as the distances are too large for visual navigation. Then how does the rescue team reach the exact site of the disaster?\nThis happens with the aid of geographic co-ordinates sent via radio signals to a satellite receiver by EPIRB so that rescue efforts can be initiated at the earliest at the exact location of the disaster. These are buoyant electronic devices which float on water when a ship sinks and begin transmitting radio signals with geographic coordinates.\nTo know about the general requirements, distress function etc. of EPIRB click the below link referring to Resolution A.810(19)\nIf you’ve watched the movie Titanic you must’ve seen the crew sending distress signals with the use of flares. Distress Signals are typically parachute flares which can be spotted by nearby vessels and rescue personnel and determine the location of the ship in distress.\nResolution MSC.81(70) Part 1-4 outlines the necessary recommendations for various pyrotechnics.\nTests like temperature tests, water and corrosion resistance, handling etc. are of prime importance.\nSince we’ve talked about Titanic let’s shed some light on rocket parachute flares test and their specifications\nRocket parachute flares test\n3 rockets should be fired(vertically). It must be ensured that the parachute flare’s ejection happens after a height of 300 m. Also, the rate of descent should not exceed 5m/s and shall sustain burning for at least 40 seconds. They should also function efficiently when projected at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal.\nIn case the rocket is handheld, its recoil should be minimum\nIt should be established by laboratory tests that the average luminous intensity of flame material (which should burn uniformly) must be a minimum of 30,000 cd with the colour being vivid red.\nVideo: How to Use Maritime Distress Flares & Signals (Pyrotechnics)?\nRequirements Regarding PyroTechnics Put Forth by SOLAS\nFREE eBook: Introduction To Pyrotechnic\nSelf- Contained Breathing Apparatus\nWhat happens if a closed compartment is compromised due to malfunction of equipment and toxic gases such as carbon dioxide are present in it. How will a person diagnose and try to repair and minimise the damage when his breathing is compromised due to the presence of toxic gases.\nNo doubt the person will soon suffer asphyxiation which may lead to unconsciousness and ultimately death. To prevent such a mishap self-contained breathing apparatus are used by personnel entering a closed compartment infiltrated with toxic gases so as to facilitate oxygen supply in that hazardous environment.\nThese were important life-saving equipment which allows to save the lives of crew and passengers in case of an accident and make a ship safe from the point of view of safety of people.\nA ship sailing in the middle of the ocean has to be self-sustainable by all means as external aid might take hours to reach the designated site.

{"question":"For my research project comparing traditional and modern professional practices: what are the key challenges faced by forensic psychologists in their work, and what are the main technical difficulties in implementing vertical farming systems?","answer":"Forensic psychologists face the challenge of potential prejudice due to constant exposure to criminal behavior, which may lead to skewed perspectives and hasty judgments about accused criminals. They also must carefully detect malingering (faking incompetency) in defendants. The stakes are particularly high as their decisions can lead to lifetime imprisonment or death sentences. As for vertical farming's technical challenges, these systems face several significant hurdles: they require high energy consumption, need substantial initial investment costs, and can suffer from indoor issues like excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage. Additionally, vertical farming systems are difficult to scale up beyond community-level implementation and are costly to build and maintain, limiting their potential for addressing food insecurity in developing nations.","context":["Introducing Forensic Psychology\nForensic psychology is not really a \"branch\" of psychology in the same sense that Behaviorism or cognitive psychology are. This is because there is no \"forensic\" theory of psychology, nor any perspectives that are unique to this label. What, then, is it?\nForensic psychology is essentially just the application of psychology to the criminal justice system. Because psychology deals so directly with the understanding and prediction of human behavior, it is a natural area of interest for criminologists and those whose job is to dispense justice. By consulting psychologists, judges and juries hope to gain a better understanding of why defendants may have behaved a certain way.\nIn general, a forensic psychologist is called upon to testify in a trial as an \"expert witness\". As such, he or she must undertake the responsibility of translating his or her clinical training into a form that is appropriate for dissemination in the courtroom. By and large, the aim is not therapeutic so much as it is explanatory.\nThere are several specific tasks that a forensic psychologist might be asked to perform in this capacity.\nEvaluation of Competency\nThe biggest responsibility of the forensic psychologist is undoubtedly the evaluation of competency. In the American justice system, an individual can only stand trial if he or she is \"competent\" to do so. This means that the person must have the physical and mental health to understand the charges against them, and to effectively participate in their own defense. For example, if a mentally retarded man kills someone in an accident, he might not have to stand trial if a forensic psychologists rules that he lacks the intellectual capacity to understand the nature of his deeds. These are the kinds of rulings involved in an evaluation of competency.\nTypically speaking, the evaluation of competency is only brought into question in murder trials when the death penalty is a possibility. Because most people feel that it would be akin to murder to execute a defendant who has no understanding of their crimes, forensic psychologists must take great care to effectively establish that the defendant is indeed capable of such. In the event that the defendant isn't, it is then the job of the forensic psychologist to report this information to the court. This was most famously seen in a criminal case from Florida when a death row inmate took his appeal as far as the Supreme Court, which called upon a veritable army of forensic psychologists to determine the appellant's competency.\nOf course, there are certain risks associated with judging competency. The biggest is that of \"malingering\" or faking incompetency. It is easy to believe that a defendant facing the death penalty might try to falsely pass himself off as incompetent to stand trial in order to avoid this fate. Forensic psychologists are highly trained to detect such ruses, and further discouragement can be seen in the form of harsh punishments if the individual is caught malingering. In many cases, this has led to additional charges of obstruction of justice and an even harsher sentence upon being found guilty.\nAssessment of Risk\nAnother responsibility that the forensic psychologist has is to assist the judge in recommending an appropriate sentence if the defendant is found guilty. For instance, in a case where an individual has committed a violent robbery, but the psychologist has no reason to suspect that the individual will ever do this again (i.e. – the hope for \"rehabilitation\" is high), then a relatively light sentence might be appropriate. By contrast, if someone is a repeat offender and the psychologist finds them to be at risk for committing the same crime upon release, then a stronger sentence may be called for. The forensic psychologist must help determine this.\nOne of the biggest factors weighing in on this decision is that of the defendant's \"mental history\". In the case of robbery, for example, if it is one's first offense, and one has no prior history of antisocial behavior of this extremity, then the risk of re-offense might be judged to be light. If, on the other hand, one had a long history of theft, the risk of re-offense would be high. It's important to be accurate here because it's possible for a sentence to be overturned totally if it is judged that an individual's history was not taken into account. \nThis process has had a great influence in the understanding of abnormal psychology over the years. For example, thanks in large part to forensic studies, we now know that individuals who commit violence against animals as children often go on to be violent towards humans as adults. We also know that people who engage in rape or sexuality-related crimes have a higher tendency to repeat.\nBecause we know these things, the belief is that we can sentence people more fairly. A young offender who still has a good chance to live as a productive member of society is unlikely to receive a life sentence without parole regardless of the severity of his crime. Likewise, a first time murderer with a long history of animal abuse and antisocial behavior might receive a stricter penalty than someone who had an immaculate criminal record until the night they committed a crime of passion.\nThe Risk of Prejudice\nThe role of the forensic psychologist can be a difficult one. There is a great deal of responsibility involved in determining the future of another individual, especially when one has the power to send that individual to a lifetime of imprisonment, or even to his or her death. Because of that, it's a profession that undergoes a lot of scrutiny and criticism.\nMany believe, for instance, that psychologists who work predominately as forensic psychologists will naturally develop a skewed perspective of humanity because, by nature, nearly all of the clients they see exhibit criminal behavior of some kind. The worry is that because these psychologists are presented with an abnormal selection of clients, they develop an abnormal worldview that can lead to hasty and prejudiced sentiments regarding accused criminals. \nClearly, the stakes are high and it is important to be accurate when making judgments of the sort that forensic psychologists are called upon to make. Treating the discipline with a healthy degree of skepticism and scrutiny is vital to ensuring fair results for all.\n1. Ford v. Wainwright.\n2. United States v. Binion.\n3. Hamblin v. Mitchell.\n4. Milton, Theodore. \"Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV and Beyond.\" New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1996.","Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

As a result, many psychologists and psychotherapists may wonder whether teletherapy is as effective as traditional, in-person therapy. In this blog post, we will explore the research on the effectiveness of teletherapy and consider its benefits and limitations.\nThe Research on Teletherapy\nResearch on the effectiveness of teletherapy has been growing in recent years, and the findings suggest that it can be as effective as traditional, in-person therapy for many clients. A meta-analysis of 39 studies on the effectiveness of teletherapy for the treatment of mental health conditions found that it was as effective as traditional therapy for a range of disorders, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD (Cuijpers et al., 2019).\nSimilarly, a randomized controlled trial comparing in-person therapy to teletherapy for the treatment of depression found no significant differences in treatment outcomes between the two groups (Hubley et al., 2016). Additionally, a systematic review of the use of teletherapy for the treatment of PTSD found that teletherapy was an effective treatment option for this condition, with no significant differences in treatment outcomes between teletherapy and in-person therapy (Simpson et al., 2018).\nBenefits of Teletherapy\nTeletherapy has a number of benefits for both clients and therapists. These benefits include:\n1. Accessibility: Teletherapy can increase access to mental health services for those who live in rural or remote areas, have mobility issues, or have other barriers to accessing traditional, in-person therapy.\n2. Convenience: Teletherapy eliminates the need for travel, reducing the time and expense associated with attending in-person appointments.\n3. Flexibility: Teletherapy allows for greater flexibility in scheduling appointments, making it easier for clients to fit therapy into their busy schedules.\n4. Comfort: Many clients feel more comfortable participating in therapy from the privacy of their own homes, reducing anxiety and stress associated with attending in-person appointments.\n5. Cost-effectiveness: Teletherapy can be more cost-effective than in-person therapy, particularly when travel and other expenses are factored in.\nLimitations of Teletherapy\n1. Despite its benefits, teletherapy has some limitations that may impact its effectiveness for some clients. These limitations include:\n2. Technical difficulties: Teletherapy requires a reliable internet connection and the necessary technology (e.g., computer, smartphone, or tablet). Technical issues can disrupt therapy sessions and impact the quality of the therapeutic relationship.\n3. Limited nonverbal cues: Teletherapy can make it more difficult for therapists to pick up on nonverbal cues, which can impact the therapeutic relationship and the accuracy of clinical assessments.\n4. Limited therapeutic modalities: Some therapeutic modalities, such as touch-based therapies, are not possible through teletherapy, limiting the range of therapies available to clients.\n5. Privacy concerns: Teletherapy raises privacy concerns, particularly if sessions are conducted in public places or if the technology used is not secure.\nIn conclusion, the research suggests that teletherapy can be as effective as traditional, in-person therapy for many clients, and has a range of benefits. However, it also has some limitations that may impact its effectiveness for some clients. As such, psychologists and psychotherapists may want to consider teletherapy as an option for their clients, particularly for those who have difficulty accessing in-person therapy or who prefer the convenience and comfort of teletherapy. However, it is important to carefully consider the benefits and limitations of teletherapy and to ensure that clients have access to the necessary technology and support to participate in therapy effectively."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:132c54c9-d276-4135-8688-ab8e6a3b5148>","<urn:uuid:9a953d8b-776c-4bb3-b1ee-2bbfa826492a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a homeowner concerned about safety, how do the preventive measures for cooking fires compare to those for electrical fires in terms of required equipment and monitoring?","answer":"Both types of fires require specific equipment and monitoring. For cooking fires, you need working smoke alarms in each sleeping room, outside sleeping areas, and on every level of the home, plus regular testing monthly and annual battery replacement. For electrical fires, you need electrical circuit interrupters to monitor current and protect against overloads. Both require regular monitoring - cooking requires constant supervision when frying/grilling, while electrical systems need routine checks for damaged cords, loose connections, and warning signs like flickering lights or burning smells. For cooking, you need to maintain a 3-foot kid-free zone and keep flammable items away from heat, while electrical safety requires keeping combustibles 3 feet from heaters and proper cable ratings like plenum cables in air circulation spaces.","context":["MIKE FROELICH Enlarge\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that from 2006 to 2010, U.S. fire departments responded to an average of 157,300 home structure fires that involved cooking equipment per year.\nThese fires caused an average of 380 civilian fire deaths, 4,920 civilian fire injuries, and $794 million in direct property damage.\nOverall, cooking equipment caused 42 percent of reported home fires, 38 percent of home fire injuries, 15 percent of home fire deaths, and 11 percent of the direct property damage in reported home fires during this period.\nThanksgiving is the peak day for home cooking fires, followed by Christmas Day, and Christmas Eve.\nTHESE FIRES ARE PREVENTABLE\nWhat can you do to protect yourself from cooking fires?

Electrical fires are a common occurrence in the United States, causing injuries, claiming lives, and resulting in losses of property. The majority of electrical fires are a result of old wiring and faulty outlets. Damage to appliance cables and extension cords and plugs can also lead to electrical fires in the home. To help prevent electrical fires in your home, it’s important to check your electrical appliances and wiring on a routine basis. Use the following information and tips to learn more about electrical fires, hidden hazards, statistics, circuit interrupters, and safety tips.\nFacts and Figures\n- More than 15 million appliances have been recalled in the last five years for defects that could result in a fire, including 1,942 incidents reported.\n- According to data analyzed by the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), more than 69,000 fires were reported from 2002 to 2009 associated with appliances.\n- Residential appliance fires result in an estimated 9,600 fires, 525 injuries, 25 deaths, and $211 million in property loss annually.\n- Nationwide, there is a home fire death an average of every three hours.\n- According to the National Fire Protection Association, fire statistics data reported that 85 percent of fire deaths occurred in the home in 2009.\n- Each year fires started in electrical systems or lighting equipment result in damage to more than 24,000 homes and cause 830 civilian injuries and 320 civilian deaths.\nHidden Electrical Hazards\nExamples of unsafe home conditions that can lead to fire include:\n- Damaged extension cords, electrical conductors or plug wires\n- Short or overloaded circuits\n- Use of modified, unapproved or faulty electrical equipment\n- Insufficient clearance between combustibles and electrical heating equipment\n- Loose electrical connections\n- Running power cables through walls to a wall-mounted TV. This problem is quickly remedied with a recessed power outlet. Learn how to hide your TV cables safely.\nWarning signs of electrical dangers include:\n- Reoccurring or frequent issues associated with blowing fuses in appliances or tripping circuit breakers\n- Tingling sensation as you touch an electrical appliance\n- Sparks coming from an outlet or discolored or warm wall outlets\n- A continuous burning smell from a room or appliance\n- Lights that frequently flicker or dim\nElectrical Circuit Interrupters\nElectrical circuit interrupters protect against fires by monitoring electrical current. These devices respond to overloads and short circuits, such as with circuit breakers. Electrical circuit interrupters help to save lives and make homes safer by eliminating a significant source of electrical-related fires. When an electrical switch is opened or closed, a discharge of electricity occurs across the circuit, known as arcs. When arcs are unintentional, such as when wires or cords are loose or damaged, sparking can result in possible igniting of combustibles. These devices do not interfere with smoke alarms and other appliances and do not affect power supply reliability.\nWhen you run cable through any building you first need to consider plenum spaces. Plenum spaces are the open spaces above the ceiling or below the floor that are used for air circulation. Technically, any ductwork is considered a plenum space too. These spaces are important for air circulation in any building, but they also bring some problems if you ever have a fire because of the high oxygen content and lack of fire barriers. Using untreated cables in plenum spaces can spread the fire to other areas very quickly and spread noxious smoke throughout the building. Plenum cables are coated with flame retardant and made using special plastics that don’t smoke nearly as much as other plastics to help prevent this problem. Any cable that you run through plenum spaces must be plenum rated, even wiring used for information transfer, like Cat5 wiring.\nThe problem with plenum cables is that they are often more expensive, which is why people can become tempted to cut corners and use non-treated cables. An easy and far less risky solution is to use unterminated bulk cable and terminate it yourself. This process is fairly straightforward with most types of wiring, but Cat5 wiring can be a bit more complicated. To help you out we’ve made a Cat5 wiring diagram that shows you what you need to do.\n- Consider having the wiring inspected in your home if you live in a house that is over ten years old. If the house is over forty years old, an inspection should be immediate.\n- Always follow the usage instructions on all appliances.\n- Fix electrical or appliance problems right away. Use caution if fuses blow often, switches become hot or cause shocks, or circuit breakers trip often.\n- Never place electrical cords under bedding or rugs. Sparks or heat from the wiring can cause a fire.\n- Check labels on lighting fixtures and lamps to ensure you are using the right size bulbs. Check the label on the fuse box to ensure you are using the right size fuses.\n- Always cover unused electrical outlets with plastic plugs.\n- If a cable or cord has three-prongs, always use it properly. Do not remove the extra prong as the appliance must be grounded to reduce the risk of electrical shocks.\n- Do not overhaul electrical outlets. Extension cords should not be used as permanent cords in homes.\n- Routinely check your electrical appliances, electronics and wiring for signs of damage.\n- Replace all damaged, old, or worn appliance cords immediately and do not use appliances with frayed wiring.\n- Keep electrical appliances away from wet counters and floors. Be cautious when using electrical appliances in the kitchen and bathroom.\n- Do not allow children to play with or around electronics or electrical appliances, including hair dryers, space heaters, and irons.\n- Keep curtains, clothes, and other combustible items at least three feet away from heaters.\n- Some electrical appliances are designed to be left “ON” all the time. Check the manufacturer directions if you are unsure.\n- Learn the wiring colors and be sure to follow all instructions given by the manufacturer when fitting a plug.\n- Use proper rated cable, such as plenum HDMI, plenum Cat5e, and plenum siamese cable.\n- U.S. Fire Administration: Fact sheet from the U.S. Fire Administration on home electrical fire prevention.\n- Electrical Appliance Fire Safety: Learn what to check for on your electrical appliances to prevent fires.\n- Home Fire Statistics: Facts and figures associated with home fire statistics, including information on civilian home fires and fire-related deaths.\n- Electrical Safety Foundation International: Series of articles relating to fires caused by electronics and appliances.\n- Microwave Ovens Safety Issues: Learn about the common dangers associated with microwave ovens and how to use them safely.\n- Building and Fire Safety: Tips on how to identify electrical safety problems with this electrical safety check list.\n- The Danger of Electrical Shock: Information on how to stay safe from electrical shocks, injury, and death.\n- Kitchen Fire Prevention: Tips on how to prevent kitchen fires from fireproofing dangerous electrical appliances.\n- Electrical Safety: List of electrical hazards that can lead to shocks, burns, fire, or electrocution.\n- Plug into Electrical Safety: Information on fire-related accidents that can be prevented by taking a few electrical safety precautions.\n- Electrical and Fire Safety: Fact sheet on how to prevent fires and burns from electrical appliances.\n- Electrical Fire Safety: Tips for preventing electrical fires in the winter seasons in the home and workplace.\n- Fire Safety Tips: List of important fire safety tips to use in your own home to keep your family safe."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cde2fed7-205f-4528-bc59-7598ae14d6fd>","<urn:uuid:37293d77-7439-4009-a43f-ad96782b95d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the environmental sustainability efforts compare between the modern forestry and mining industries?","answer":"The forestry industry focuses on sustainable forest management practices that balance current needs with future generations' requirements, emphasizing carbon storage and environmental protection. This includes using AI for forest monitoring and restoration. The mining industry, on the other hand, is addressing sustainability primarily through technological innovations in energy use, with companies implementing renewable energy sources and developing hydrogen-powered vehicles. Mining companies like Rio Tinto and Gold Fields are investing in wind and solar power plants, with around 1GW of wind and solar capacity built at mining sites worldwide in 2020. Anglo American is developing hydrogen-powered trucks that could reduce emissions by 80% and save up to 1 million liters of diesel fuel annually. Both industries are embracing technological solutions to environmental challenges, but their approaches differ based on their distinct environmental impacts and operational needs.","context":["The History of the Forestry Industry\nForests have been an important part of human society for centuries. They provide us with wood for construction, fuel, and paper; they also play a vital role in the environment by providing clean air and water, and by storing carbon.\nThe forestry industry is the sector of the economy that is responsible for managing and harvesting forests. It is a global industry, with operations in every country in the world.\nThe history of the forestry industry can be traced back to the early days of human civilization. In ancient times, forests were often cleared to make way for agriculture or settlement. However, as people began to understand the importance of forests, they began to develop more sustainable practices for managing them.\nIn the 18th century, there was a growing awareness of the need for scientific forestry. This led to the development of new techniques for managing forests, such as planting and harvesting trees in a way that ensured their long-term sustainability.\nThe 20th century saw a rapid expansion of the forestry industry. This was due in part to the increasing demand for wood products, as well as the development of new technologies that made it easier to harvest and process wood.\nToday, the forestry industry is a major economic force. It provides jobs for millions of people around the world, and it generates billions of dollars in revenue. The industry is also facing a number of challenges, such as climate change, deforestation, and invasive species.\nDespite these challenges, the forestry industry is committed to sustainable forest management. This means managing forests in a way that meets the needs of people today without compromising the ability of future generations to enjoy the benefits of forests.\nHere are some of the key milestones in the history of the forestry industry:\n- 1750s: Modern scientific forestry is developed in France and Germany.\n- 1891: The United States Congress passes the Forest Reserve Act, which authorizes the president to set aside forest reserves.\n- 1905: The United States Forest Service is established.\n- 1920s: The pulp and paper industry begins to grow rapidly.\n- 1960s: The environmental movement gains momentum, and there is a growing focus on sustainable forest management.\n- 1992: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is adopted, which recognizes the importance of forests in mitigating climate change.\n- 2015: The Paris Agreement is adopted, which commits countries to taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe forestry industry is a complex and ever-changing sector. However, it is clear that the industry is committed to sustainable forest management. This is essential for ensuring that forests continue to provide the many benefits that they do for people and the planet.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the forestry industry. AI is being used to improve forest management practices in a number of ways, including:\n- Predicting forest fires: AI can be used to analyze data on weather patterns, vegetation, and other factors to predict the likelihood of forest fires. This information can be used to take preventive measures, such as clearing brush and thinning trees, to reduce the risk of fires.\n- Monitoring illegal logging: AI can be used to analyze satellite images and other data to detect illegal logging activities. This information can be used by law enforcement agencies to take action against illegal loggers.\n- Improving timber harvesting: AI can be used to optimize timber harvesting operations. This can help to reduce the environmental impact of logging and improve the efficiency of timber production.\n- Managing pests and diseases: AI can be used to identify and track pests and diseases in forests. This information can be used to develop control strategies to protect forests from these threats.\n- Restoring degraded forests: AI can be used to plan and implement restoration projects for degraded forests. This can help to improve the health and resilience of forests.\nThe use of AI in the forestry industry is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way forests are managed. AI can help to make forest management more sustainable, efficient, and effective.\nHere are some specific examples of how AI is being used in the forestry industry today:\n- The company Vesta is using AI to develop a system that can predict the risk of forest fires. The system uses data on weather patterns, vegetation, and other factors to create a map of the fire risk. This information can be used by firefighters and forest managers to take preventive measures and to respond to fires more effectively.\n- The company Overstory is using AI to monitor illegal logging activities. The company’s software analyzes satellite images and other data to identify areas where illegal logging is occurring. This information is then shared with law enforcement agencies, who can take action against the illegal loggers.\n- The company Intelligent Forest is using AI to improve timber harvesting operations. The company’s software uses data on tree size, location, and other factors to optimize the harvesting process. This can help to reduce the environmental impact of logging and improve the efficiency of timber production.\nThese are just a few examples of how AI is being used in the forestry industry. As AI technology continues to develop, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of AI in forestry in the years to come.","A technological revolution is underway in the segment of the mining industry that is closely linked to metallurgy — working methods that have remained unchanged for decades and centuries are giving way to new ones. Before our very eyes, robots are becoming human assistants and polluting industries are being transformed into clean ones. A number of trends are changing the face of the world’s most important industry before our very eyes.\nThe brain is good, but so is artificial intelligence.\nThe exploration and evaluation of mineral deposits has traditionally been carried out by humans, and it seemed that human intelligence would never be replaced by artificial intelligence. However, more and more geologists are using AI to study mineral deposits; they do not see AI as a competitor, but rather as a reliable assistant that can simplify and speed up the interpretation of various data (geophysical, mineralogical, geochemical, etc.) and make predictions based on it.\nAlthough the use of artificial intelligence in geological prospecting is generally still in its infancy (although the first scientific papers on the subject appeared as early as the late 1980s — early 1990s), there are already a range of information processing methods — expert systems, machine learning, and others. The most important of these is machine learning, i.e. the use of self-learning algorithms that can analyse large volumes of geological data involving multiple sources and types of information. They can identify deposits that have escaped human scrutiny or are hidden by thick rock formations.\nThe possibilities offered by artificial intelligence could not fail to attract the attention of the world’s leading mining companies. In 2021, for example, BHP Group and KoBold Metals agreed to jointly use artificial intelligence to search for copper, nickel and cobalt deposits. The partners have decided to use it in Australia, and it is likely that artificial intelligence will be used on BHP Group projects around the world in the future.\nIn 2022, Canada’s MacDonald Mines Exploration used machine learning to find an interesting copper-gold-silver mineralisation near the shore of Lake Guron. The identification of a large mineable deposit cannot be ruled out in the future.\nThe prospects for AI in mining and mineral processing are equally good, paving the way (in combination with the Internet of Things) for the creation of ‘smart’ mines. Much of the AI will be needed to keep process equipment up and running, providing operators with real-time information on the status of equipment and machinery to identify failures and malfunctions: sensors collect data on operating parameters and transmit it to a central system. AI analyses the data and provides operators with information that indicates when something is wrong. Cloud technology, on the other hand, ensures the security of the data, while blockchain speeds up the transfer of data.\nArtificial intelligence is also suitable for ore refining management. In 2019, Norilsk Nickel used it at its Talnakh concentrator to quickly track rock debris that could lead to equipment damage and cut the conveyor belt if the debris got into the crushing drum.\nA year earlier, Rio Tinto approved the construction of the 43 million tonne per annum Koodaideri iron ore project in Australia. The $2.6 billion investment has become a pioneer in Rio Tinto’s smart mining operations, using autonomous drilling rigs, trucks and data analytics to optimise production and reduce downtime. Last year, Koodaideri, now renamed Gudai-Darri, began delivering raw materials and is expected to reach full capacity by 2023.\nThe smart mines will be well supported by drones that track the terrain in their area. US-based Freeport-McMoRan uses them to monitor the slope angles of quarry walls to prevent collapses. The information gathered by the drones is used to manage the removal of overburden and reduce the amount of waste rock mined.\nWhere it’s dark and damp\nCan you imagine a mine or quarry without people in it when it is in operation? It may seem impossible. But this view is deeply flawed. The possibilities for using robots in mining are vast, and their use is driven by the high demands on human labour and the need to ensure human safety: mines can accumulate methane and explode, the air is often damp, and there are occasional cave-ins. It is therefore better to replace people (where possible) with unassuming machines.\nOne option is to use robots to assess the condition of underground mines. In 2014, the Freiberg Mining Academy launched the Mining-RoX project, which aims to use robots to map and monitor the mining environment. Two machines, Alexander and Julius, named after famous German scientists, were created.\nThey were tested at the Reiche Zeche mine, which had previously been used to mine silver ore. Each vehicle had a different role. Julius acted as an assistant surveyor, transporting heavy equipment and collecting the necessary data with portable measuring instruments. Alexander took care of the 3D mapping of the mine tunnels using a range of cameras and lidar sensors.\nTrials with both robots produced good results, but also revealed a number of challenges for their use underground. These included a lack of GPS capability (as satellite signals cannot pass through opaque obstacles), rough terrain (which could block or even damage the vehicle) and the need to protect it from corrosive mine water.\nHowever, their use makes it possible to automatically create accurate and economical 3D models of mines, greatly simplifying the planning and execution of mining operations. It is no coincidence that Norilsk Nickel began testing the Mark robot, developed at the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys, in September 2022.\nMark is characterised by high mobility, thanks to the design of its wheels: they all have their own motors, vertical rotation axes for turning and systems for changing the ground clearance from 20 to 45 cm. The robot can travel at speeds of up to 4 km/h and is designed for surveying and monitoring the air in the mine.\nOn a motorway without a driver.\nAs well as monitoring mines and quarries, the robots can also be used to transport ore. Machines don’t need clean air, good visibility or a lunch break. Although human drivers can do a good job, autonomous trucks working 24 hours a day can drive the exact route every time without getting bored, tired, resting, or making mistakes.\nJapan’s Komatsu was a pioneer, testing five autonomous trucks at the Radomir Tomic mine in 2005 and beginning to build a fleet of them at the Mistral mine in Cabriela, both owned by Chile’s Codelco, in 2007.\nSince then, the world’s biggest mining companies, including Rio Tinto, Vale and Fortescue Metals Group, have shown interest in operating them. There have been a few hiccups, most notably in 2008 when the machines were found to be malfunctioning at Cabriela Mistral and Codelco asked Komatsu to repair them.\nExperience has shown that unmanned vehicles can increase productivity by 15 to 20 per cent, while reducing tyre wear by 5 to 15 per cent and fuel consumption by 10 to 15 per cent.\nHowever, there have been concerns about human safety, which is why dump trucks supervised by operators in offices are also being developed. Norilsk Nickel, for example, has launched a project to use unmanned dump trucks at its Skalisty mine in 2021. This is currently unprecedented in Russia.\nThe prerequisites for its implementation were as follows: every mine has processes, such as blasting and ventilation, where personnel cannot work in the same place as the process. As a result, time is lost that could be used to transport the blasted ore to the concentrator. Unmanned dump trucks, on the other hand, can work at exactly the same time as any underground workings are being blasted and ventilated.\nAt Skalisty, an approximately 3-kilometre-long haulage tunnel at a depth of 850 metres was chosen as the break-in area for the machines. Switches, Wi-Fi access points and other network equipment were installed there, and the trucks were fitted with control units, laser scanners, video cameras and Wi-Fi antennas, as well as various sensors and detectors.\nThe project included training staff, identifying bottlenecks and key factors affecting the efficiency of ore delivery, and reducing the number of miners.\nThe project has shown that the unmanned trucks work 1.5 hours longer per day than their human-driven counterparts. They are loaded and unloaded remotely. As a result, the amount of material transported increases by at least 1%, or 21,000 tonnes per year.\nThe people on Skalisty are left to do the intellectual work, armed with modern gadgets. On Skalisty, they use lasers to measure, download the data onto tablets and use them to create three-dimensional models of the mine shafts. This makes the job a lot easier and increases the accuracy of the measurements.\n…and on the rails.\nThere’s also a place for robots on the railways that carry raw materials from mines to ports. Between 2012 and 2019, Rio Tinto implemented a massive Autohaul project in Australia, spending almost $1 billion to create an autonomous rail network that transports about 1 million tonnes of iron ore every day.\nThe network consists of hundreds of heavy trains. Each train is 2.4 kilometres long and consists of 2 to 3 locomotives and 240 cars, carrying a total of 28,000 tonnes of raw materials. The trains run between Rio Tinto’s 17 quarries and the ports of Dampier and Cape Lambert. The average turnaround time is 40 hours. The wagons are loaded and unloaded automatically, and the train runs autonomously. The conductor only operates the train as it passes through the port area.\nNo gas emissions\nTransporting ore by dump truck or train involves high fuel and energy costs. Emissions into the atmosphere are also significant: an estimated 28,000 dump trucks currently in use worldwide produce up to 68 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, not including the toxic gases produced by the combustion of diesel fuel.\nTo reduce their negative environmental impact and energy costs, several alternative non-petroleum fuels have been proposed — liquefied and compressed natural gas, ethanol and methanol, and hydrogen.\nHydrogen is the most environmentally friendly of these, producing environmentally friendly water as a by-product. Hydrogen can be produced by either steam conversion, methane pyrolysis, or water electrolysis.\nThe use of hydrogen in mining trucks has been a focus for the UK’s Anglo American, which has agreed with Engie to build the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mining truck. The prototype was unveiled in 2021 at the Mogalakwena mine in South Africa, which mines platinoids.\nTests will determine whether the truck will replace Mogalakwena’s fleet of 40 diesel trucks and is expected to reduce emissions by 80%, saving the company up to 1 million litres of diesel fuel a year.\nSun and wind\nThe use of hydrogen reflects a trend in recent years towards the use of renewable energy sources in the mining industry.\nIn 2019, Rio Tinto announced its intention to reduce its carbon footprint at the Kennecott Utah mine in the US by 65% by purchasing 1.5 million MWh of green electricity from Rocky Mountain Power, which operates wind farms.\nThis was followed by South Africa’s Gold Fields, which signed an agreement with EDL Group to supply its Agnew gold mine in Australia from a hybrid power plant powered by solar, wind, and diesel. The plant has a total capacity of 56 MW, with 18 MW coming from wind and 4 MW from solar.\nIn addition, Barrick Gold, OZ Minerals, BHP Billiton, Sandfire Resources, B2Gold, Antofagasta and other players have shown strong interest in renewable energy. According to Fitch Solutions, around 1GW of wind and solar capacity has been built at mining sites around the world in 2020, with a similar number in the planning or construction stage.\nWhen analysing project information, it is easy to see that much of this is concentrated in Australia and Latin America, which have a high number of sunny days per year and strong coastal winds. However, both solar and wind power have drawbacks: the efficiency of the former depends directly on the angle of the sun, the amount of cloud cover and the time of day; the latter depends on the strength of the wind and the time of year. Solar power plants do not work at night, and wind power plants do not work when it is calm.\nCuriously, the mining industry almost never uses geothermal energy. The only exception is a project by Australia’s Vulcan Energy Resources to extract lithium from heated groundwater in Germany and use the heat as an energy source.\nIn the future, the share of renewable energy in the mining industry’s energy mix will increase, but not everywhere. The main contributors will be North and South America, Australia and, to a lesser extent, Africa, Europe and Asia, due to different geographical conditions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2010a310-c3dc-4ab4-a5a3-7fe6cf40b01c>","<urn:uuid:1ba2a9d5-b903-45be-bb54-9380187426f6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between bacterial pneumonia and compression atelectasis in terms of their underlying causes?","answer":"Bacterial pneumonia and compression atelectasis have different underlying causes. Bacterial pneumonia is primarily caused by infectious agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common cause, followed by Haemophilus influenzae type b. These bacteria cause infection and inflammation in the lungs, leading to pus and fluid accumulation. In contrast, compression atelectasis occurs due to external space-occupying lesions, such as pleural effusion, that physically compress the lung tissue and forcefully push air out of the alveoli. While bacterial pneumonia is an infectious process, compression atelectasis is a mechanical condition caused by external pressure on the lung tissue.","context":["Atelectasis is a loss of lung volume that may be caused by a variety of ventilation disorders, for instance, bronchial injury or an obstructive mass such as a tumor. It may be categorized as obstructive, nonobstructive, postoperative, or rounded. Clinical features depend on the severity and extent of atelectasis, ranging from no symptoms to respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals a dull note on percussion and diminished breathing sounds over the affected area. On x-ray, the atelectatic section of the lung appears condensed and, due to decreased lung volume, may extend to the surrounding tissue. This effect can lead to an elevated diaphragm and mediastinal shift to the affected side. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Complications of atelectasis include pneumonia or, depending on the extent of disease, respiratory failure.\n- Obstructive atelectasis (most common): airway obstruction (e.g., by a foreign body, mucus plug, malignancy) → nonventilated alveoli → reabsorption of gas in the poststenotic space → lung collapse\n- Compression atelectasis: external space-occupying lesion (e.g., pleural effusion) that compresses the lung → forcefully pushes air out of the alveoli\n- Adhesive atelectasis: surfactant deficiency or dysfunction → increases surface tension of alveoli → instability and collapse (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults, respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants)\n- Cicatrization (contraction) atelectasis: parenchymal scarring that leads to contraction of the lung (due to chronic destructive lung processes such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and fibrosis, e.g., secondary to radiation therapy)\n- Relaxation atelectasis: loss of contact between parietal and visceral tissue (e.g., pneumothorax, )\n- Replacement atelectasis: All the alveoli in an entire lobe are replaced by tumor (e.g., bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma) → loss of volume → lung collapse\n- Postoperative atelectasis: one of the most common post-operative complications (especially after chest or abdominal surgery); often occurs within 72 hours of surgery\n- Rounded atelectasis: folding of the atelectatic lung tissue (with fibrous bands and adhesions) to the pleura (e.g., asbestosis)\n- Middle lobe syndrome: intraluminal or extraluminal obstruction or no identifiable cause of obstruction → recurrent or fixed atelectasis of the right middle lobe and/or lingula (e.g., associated with childhood asthma, Sjögren syndrome)\n- Symptoms depend on the acuity and extent of atelectasis.\n- Dull percussion note, diminished breath sounds, and decreased fremitus over the affected lung\n- Possibly tracheal deviation towards the side of lesion\n- Arterial blood gas analysis\nChest x-ray and CT: evidence of lobar collapse \n- Direct signs: displacement of fissures and homogeneous opacification of the collapsed lobe\n- Indirect signs\n- Bronchoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic): A biopsy may be performed if the etiology is uncertain despite imaging (e.g., to exclude malignancy) and mucus plugs can be removed. \n- Adequate analgesia\n- Early mobilization\n- Lung expansion maneuvers that increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)\n- Treatment of underlying condition\nThe risk of atelectasis after surgery can be avoided by prescribing opioids in doses that are sufficient for pain relief, as well as encouraging the use of incentive spirometry. At the same time, opioids should be used with caution due to their suppression on coughing. Smoking should be avoided 6–8 weeks prior to surgery.\nWe list the most important complications. The selection is not exhaustive.","What Happens To Your Lungs When You Are Diagnosed With Pneumonia\nPneumonia, as discussed above, is an infection in the lungs that mainly leads to inflammation in the air sacs called alveoli. Pneumonia leads to the formation of pus and fluid in the lungs, which hinders the breathing process of the individual. There are two categories of patients who are suffering from Pneumonia – Viral pneumonia, and Bacterial pneumonia. Both these types of Pneumonia are contagious and can spread easily from one infected person to another healthy body. In simpler words, Pneumonia damages the lungs by causing inflammation and jamming the way for the oxygen to enter and mix with the bloodstream. Thus Pneumonia can lead to serious breathing issues and death.\nWhen Should I See My Doctor\nPneumonia can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially for certain at-risk people. You should call your doctor if you have a cough that wont go away, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever. You should also call your doctor if you suddenly begin to feel worse after having a cold or the flu.\nTrouble In Breathing Due To Inflammed Air Sacs Or Alveoli\nYou may experience a steady drop in your breathing rate or an unexplained rise in your breathing counts. One may also notice that there is sudden trouble which one may notice every time he/she breathes. This condition is also known as laboured breathing. “The patient may notice that the breathing rate post-COVID recovery has drastically changed. It is either rapid or shallow. One can also find him/herself becoming breathless even while resting,” Dr. Mukherjee told TheHealthSite.com.\nYou May Like: Do You Have To Get The Pneumonia Vaccine Every Year\nLimit Contact With Others\nOne of the best things you can do when recovering from pneumonia is to limit your contact with others. As weve learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemicwhich can cause viral pneumoniastaying at least six feet away from others reduces the amount of viral or bacterial content they are exposed to as you breathe or talk.\nCan Cold Weather Cause Pneumonia\nPneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.\nPneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 808 694 children under the age of 5 in 2017, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children under five years old. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care.\nIn Nigeria, 19% of child deaths were due to pneumonia in 2018, and it was the biggest killer of children under-five in 2017. There are an estimated 56 million episodes of lung infections among Nigerian children every year. Although not all episodes will lead to death, these infections nevertheless cause suffering and require treatment\nPneumonia is caused by a number of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The most common are:\nStreptococcus pneumoniae the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children\nHaemophilus influenzae type b the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia\nAlso Check: Do You Have A Dry Cough With Pneumonia\nVisit A Mana Clinic Today\nEven healthy people can get the flu and suffer complications from the flu.

Hospital treatments may include:\n- Fluids, antibiotics and other medicines given through an IV\n- Breathing treatments and exercises to help loosen mucus\nPeople most likely to be hospitalized are those who are most frail and/or at increased risk, including:\n- Babies and young children\n- People with weakened immune systems\n- People with health conditions that affect the heart and lungs\nIt may take six to eight weeks to return to a normal level of functioning and well-being if youve been hospitalized with pneumonia.\nDon’t Miss: Allergic Reaction To Pneumonia Shot\nDebunked: 5 Myths About Pneumonia\nDirector of Vaccine Delivery at The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nToday the global health community recognizes the third annual World Pneumonia Day with the release of two new studies on pneumonia and events in more than 15 countries calling attention to the disease, which remains the world’s leading killer of young children. Yet despite renewed global attention and its dramatic toll, pneumonia remains one of the world’s least-understood conditions.\nAs we recommit ourselves to defeating this deadly disease on Nov. 12, let’s tackle a few of the leading myths head-on:\nPneumonia is really just a bad cold. In fact, it’s much worse. Pneumonia is an infection of your lungs that can require antibiotics or treatment in a hospital. A “common cold” usually lasts a few days or perhaps a week or two, and causes a runny nose, sore throat, sneezing and coughing. Pneumonia, on the other hand, kills more than 50,000 Americans and more than 1 million children worldwide each year.\nThe confusion exists because, at its start, pneumonia symptoms can be similar to those of a cold, including cough, fever and shortness of breath. Unfortunately, that’s where the similarities end. Left untreated, most colds will run their course as the body’s immune system naturally restores health. In contrast, ignoring early signs of bacterial pneumonia can be a death sentence.\nWhat Are The Common Causes Of Pneumonia For Older Adults\nPneumonia is typically caused by bacteria or viruses. These germs are breathed into your lungs. When your immune system is strong you may be able to quickly fight these germs off.\nThe elderly may be more likely to have the germs cause an infection in their lungs due to weakened immune systems.\nEven if they are usually healthy and fit, they can get pneumonia after you have caught a simple cold or flu. They may even catch pneumonia from being in the hospital.\nThe causes of pneumonia are broken down into three groups:\nYou May Like: How To Tell If It’s Pneumonia\nWhy Is Pneumonia Dangerous What Are The Possible Complications Of Leaving This Condition Untreated\nPneumonia can usually be treated successfully without leading to complications. However, complications like the ones listed below can develop in some patients, especially those in high-risk groups.\nFluid or pus could get accumulated between the covering of the lungs and the inner lining of the chest wall this is called a pleural effusion . A chest tube may be needed to drain the fluid/pus.\nPus might collect in the lung area infected with pneumonia . Rarely this may require surgery.\nBacteria can spread to the bloodstream and other organs. This is a serious complication since the infection can cause the blood pressure to be dangerously low.\nAlthough most people recover from pneumonia, it can be fatal in some cases. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients admitted to a general medical ward, and almost 30 percent of patients with severe infection admitted to an intensive care unit can die.\nCauses And Risk Factors Of Pneumonia\nHow do you get pneumonia? The majority of the germs that cause infection are spread from person to person through droplets, from coughing or sneezing.\n- A weakened immune system due to human immunodeficiency virus or cancer\nPeople who smoke are at higher risk for pneumonia, as are people on immunosuppressive medications, and people who are frequently in close, crowded spaces with others, such as college students and military personnel.\nAlso Check: When Can You Get Pneumonia Vaccine\nSpreading Pneumonia To Others\nIf your pneumonia is caused by a virus or bacteria, you may spread the infection to other people while you are contagious. How long you are contagious depends on what is causing the pneumonia and whether you get treatment. You may be contagious for several days to a week.\nIf you get antibiotics, you usually cannot spread the infection to others after a day of treatment.\nWhat Are The Symptoms Of A Common Cold\nThe common cold is a simple illness that typically is not a serious infection. Its little more than a nuisance unless, of course, you’re the one with the cold symptoms.\n“Colds are caused by viruses, and the most common virus that causes the cold is rhinovirus,” says Aaron M. Milstone, MD, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore.\nWhile a common cold is no fun to deal with, it is not as dangerous as the influenza virus, which can spread to other people more quickly, and even kill, adds Dr. Milstone. There are also far fewer hospitalizations associated with the common cold than with the flu, he adds.\nThe symptoms of the common cold often include:\n- Some muscle aches and headaches\n- Low or no fever\nGenerally, says Milstone, people feel bad and a little run down for a couple of days, then start to perk up as the cold runs its course.\nA good way to tell whether you have the common cold or the flu is by how quickly the symptoms appear. Symptoms of the common cold take their time. Flu symptoms, on the other hand, hit fast.\nRecommended Reading: Do You Need Pneumonia Shot Every Year\nWhat Are The Signs And Symptoms Of Pneumonia In Children\nThe signs and symptoms of pneumonia in children vary from child to child and also depend on your childs age, cause of the infection, and severity of their illness.\nUsual symptoms include:\n- Cry more than usual. Are restless or more fussy.\nAdolescents have the same symptoms as adults, including:\n- Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath.\n- Chest pain.\nNewborns are at greater risk of pneumonia caused by bacteria present in the birth canal. In young children, viruses are the main cause of pneumonia.\nPneumonia caused by bacteria tends to happen suddenly, starting with fever and fast breathing. Symptoms appear more slowly and tend to be less severe when pneumonia is caused by viruses.\nPneumonia From Getting Wet Where Does That Come From\nFacts About Pneumonia\nDespite what your parents and grandparents said, a person cant actually catch pneumonia from getting wet. What people catch is a bacteria or virus that can cause pneumonia. Pneumonia refers to an infection of the lungs caused by these organisms. This infection causes fluid and mucus to block the alveoli, making it difficult for oxygen to travel through your lungs. This will make it harder to breathe, especially if both of your lungs are infected.\nWhere Does the Old Wives Tale Come From ?\nRemember, pneumonia is caused by a bacteria or virus. But you dont necessarily get the bacteria or viruses from getting wet either. What happens is that your immune system can be weakened when youre dealing with physical stresses such as hypothermia and hyperthermia. Just think, when you get wet, your body temperature drops, which can impact your immune system. When your immune system isnt working like it should, you become more susceptible to bacteria and viruses that are all around us.\nEven everyday stress can weaken your immune system and make you more prone to illnesses in general. And because little kids have immune systems that arent fully developed and elderly folks have weaker immune systems, theyre more vulnerable to getting sick, including pneumonia. So although you cant catch pneumonia directly from getting wet, you probably understand what your parents were trying to say now.\nWhen to See a Doctor for Pneumonia\nYou May Like: When Should You Get The Pneumonia Shot\nCaring For Your Symptoms At Home\nMany chest infections aren’t serious and get better within a few days or weeks. You won’t usually need to see your GP, unless your symptoms suggest you have a more serious infection .\nWhile you recover at home, you can improve your symptoms by:\n- getting plenty of rest\n- drinking lots of fluid to prevent dehydration and to loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up\n- treating headaches, fever and aches and pains with painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen\n- drinking a warm drink of honey and lemon to relieve a sore throat caused by persistent coughing\n- raising your head up with extra pillows while you’re sleeping to make breathing easier\n- using an air humidifier or inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water to ease your cough\n- stopping smoking\nAvoid cough medicines, as there’s little evidence they work. Coughing actually helps you clear the infection more quickly by getting rid of the phlegm from your lungs.\nAntibiotics aren’t recommended for many chest infections. They only work if the infection is caused by bacteria, rather than a virus.\nYour GP will usually only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have pneumonia, or you’re at risk of complications such as fluid building up around the lungs .\nIf there’s a flu outbreak in your local area and you’re at risk of serious infection, your GP may also prescribe antiviral medication.\nHow You Catch Pneumonia\nWhile anyone can catch pneumonia, some people are more likely to come down with illness when coming into contact with the germs. Like many other illnesses, pneumonia is caught through contact with the bacteria or virus that creates pneumonia.\nCoughing and sneezing are the most common ways these germs spread.\nIts also possible to catch the illness by touching something like a counter or door handle, sharing cups and utensils, and touching your face without washing your hands first.\nRead Also: How Often Are You Supposed To Have A Pneumonia Shot\nHow Do You Get Pneumonia\nHave you ever been told to bundle up to avoid catching pneumonia? Or told a friend or family member not to walk outside with wet hair because he or she could get it? It might surprise you to find out that neither cold weather nor wet hair can cause you to catch pneumonia. In fact, pneumonia in itself isnt contagious, so you cant really catch it at all.\nIf you are wondering how do you get pneumonia, or have any other questions about this condition, FastMed can help. We are open 365 days a year to provide treatment for non-life-threatening illness and injuries, as well as ready to answer all of your health related questions.\nWhat Is Pneumonia Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment And Prevention\nPneumonia is a lower respiratory lung infection that causes inflammation in one or both lungs.\nAir sacs in your lungs called alveoli can then fill up with fluid or pus, causing flu-like symptoms that can persist for weeks or cause rapid deterioration of breathing leading to hospitalization. Pneumonia doesn’t respond to over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines.\nPneumonia comes in different forms and is caused primarily by bacteria or viruses, which are contagious, and less commonly by fungi or parasites.\nThe type of germ contributes to how serious the illness can become and how its treated. The severity of an infection depends on many factors, including your age and overall health, as well as where you may have acquired the illness.\nYou May Like: Best Treatment For Walking Pneumonia\nTreatment And Medication Options For Pneumonia\nA lot of treatment aspects, as well as outcome, depend on the person, as well as the type of pneumonia they have, says Dr. Barron.

{"question":"How do archaeological excavations from the Battle of Visby and modern cryptocurrency mining both demonstrate resource consumption patterns?","answer":"Archaeological excavations from the Battle of Visby revealed unique resource patterns where soldiers retained their armor after death due to hot weather and the large number of casualties (about 2,000 bodies), making it impossible for victors to strip the dead. These excavations yielded one of the most significant medieval battle discoveries known to archaeologists. In contrast, modern cryptocurrency mining represents a different kind of resource consumption, requiring massive computational power and energy resources. According to research, bitcoin mining alone consumes more energy annually than Argentina (128.84 TWh), primarily from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas, leading to significant greenhouse gas emissions.","context":["Battle of Visby\n|Battle of Visby|\nThe skull of a soldier participating in the 1361 campaign.\n|Commanders and leaders|\n|Valdemar IV of Denmark||unknown|\n|2,000–2,500 men||2,000 men|\n|Casualties and losses|\nOn 22 July 1361, King Valdemar IV of Denmark (Valdemar Atterdag) sent an army ashore on Gotland's west coast. The Gutes of Gotland paid taxes to the King of Sweden, though the population of Visby was diverse and included Russians, Danes and Germans. In 1280, the city of Visby had joined the Wendish City-alliance along with Riga, Lübeck, Tallinn and other large population centres from northern Europe, further separating Visby from the Gutnish countryside. Antagonism between city-dwellers and the Gutnish country yeomen heightened, and the latter were defeated in battle in 1288 despite the aid of knights from Estonia.\nIt is unknown who commanded the Gutnish army. However, he was probably a minor noble of some standing, probably with military experience. The Danish army was composed mainly of Danish and German troops, many mercenaries from the Baltic coast of Germany, with recent experience in the various feuds and wars between the German and Scandinavian states. These men would have worn what was known as Transitional armour, with iron or steel plates over vital areas and joints over a full suit of chainmail. They were led by Valdemar IV of Denmark. Against them was an army of Gutes, mainly freemen and minor nobles. The ordinary freemen appear to have worn more limited but still effective protection, with many skeletons being excavated wearing a chainmail shirt or a coat of plates to protect the torso. Some warriors may have worn a padded Gambeson or a leather jerkin or coat, though these would not have survived the decomposition in the ground after the battle. Unusually, many appear to have not had protection for their head, with many skulls wearing only a mail coif for protection, though any helmets may have been stripped from the bodies after the battle. No weapons have been discovered, but it is likely that both sides used round and heater type shields, spears, axes, Billhooks, pikes and poleaxes. For close combat both sides would have had swords, light axes, war hammers and maces.\nThe Danish troops moved towards Visby. The first day of the invasion, two minor skirmishes were fought on marshy ground between yeomen farmers and the army. The next day, from 800 to 1000 farmers were killed after massing for battle at Mästerby near Fjäle mire.\nOn 27 July a Gutnish yeomen army fought the Danes just outside the city walls, and was severely beaten, with an estimated death toll of about 1,800 yeomen and peasantry killed, while the Danish casualties remain unknown. Only a couple of items that can be linked with Danish soldiers have been found, including a purse and an ornamented armour belonging to a member of the Roorda Family from Friesland. Casualties can be compared with those that the French suffered at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and should be seen as high by medieval standards.\nFollowing the devastating battle, the citizens of Visby decided to surrender to avoid further losses. To save the city from sacking, the inhabitants paid a large amount of their wealth to King Valdemar. This extortion of contributions became a legendary event, although it cannot be confirmed to have taken place, and, if so, the full details are still unclear. Despite the payment, the Danes still plundered several of the town's churches and monasteries.\nKing Valdemar appointed sheriffs to govern Visby and then set sail again. It would take another year before Valdemar officially added \"King Of Gotland\" to his many titles. When Albert, King of Sweden took the Swedish crown he claimed Gotland as part of his domains and held the island at least until 1369; thus the Danish presence there couldn't have been strong, as it so rapidly and easily returned to the Swedish crown. The island would be disputed over by the House of Mecklenburg and the Danish Crown until 1376 when Queen Margaret (the daughter of the late King Valdemar) officially claimed the island for Denmark.\nKing Albert was defeated in a civil war in 1389, in which Queen Margaret supported the \"rebels\", and he was forced to abdicate. However, he was granted Gotland and its \"capital\" Visby, where he remained with a \"pirate\" organisation called the Victual Brothers. It was not until 1408 that the last remains of the house of Mecklenburg and the above mentioned pirates were driven out for good.\nGraves have been excavated in modern times to bring clarification in the events. The first archeological excavations were done in 1905, led by Oscar Wilhelm Wennersten and master builder Nils Pettersson at the place now known as Korsbetningen in Visby, where the first mass grave from the battle was found. The excavation also revealed the location of the Solberga Abbey. It showed that at least a third of the Gotlandic army consisted of minors and elderly. Many of the dead defenders were, unusually, buried in their armour; according to historian John Keegan \"...hot weather and their great number (about 2,000 bodies were disinterred six hundred years later) defeated the efforts of the victors to strip them before decomposition began.\" The site of the excavation \"yielded one of the most fearsome revelations of a medieval battle known to archaeologists.\"\nFive mass-graves were located outside the city's walls.\nMedieval Week on Gotland\nEvery year during the Medieval Week on Gotland a historical reenactment of King Valdemar IV of Denmark's entrance and ransoming of Visby is staged at the historical site. Since 2011, the Battle of Visby itself is reenacted outside the Visby city wall with participants from historical societies from several European countries and the United States.\n- \"det här är Sveriges historia\" season 1 episode 5\n- Ohlén, Carl-Eric; Scharp, Dag W.; Rehnberg, Mats, eds.

Cryptocurrency is one of the newer and rapidly evolving industries that has been called out for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, the cryptocurrency sector is also built on innovation, decentralization, and financial democratization. The challenge is to balance these two seemingly opposing goals – sustainability and innovation. In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5dd0e79a-775b-4244-8707-b48a5adebf32>","<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a nutrition student studying financial topics, I wonder how phytic acid and equity accounts are similar in being both beneficial and potentially problematic?","answer":"Both phytic acid and equity accounts demonstrate dual nature in their effects. Phytic acid, while acting as an anti-nutrient by impairing the absorption of iron, zinc, and calcium, also offers health benefits and may help reduce the risk of colon cancer. Similarly, equity accounts, particularly in elements like treasury stock, can have opposing effects - while share repurchases reduce equity (acting as a contra equity account), they can be beneficial as a tax-effective way to return capital to shareholders and signal that management believes shares are undervalued. Additionally, both systems require careful management: phytic acid's effects can be mitigated through preparation methods like soaking and fermentation, while equity accounts need to be carefully structured and monitored through detailed statements of shareholders' equity.","context":["What are Equity Accounts?\nThe balance sheet of any business comprises of assets, liabilities, and equity. The items in a balance sheet fall into one of these three categories.\nThe equity accounts section of the balance represents the total investment in the business by shareholders. It includes the amount a business has raised by selling equity and preference shares plus other items such as retained earnings (earnings which are reinvested in the business), treasury stock and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – these are sometimes called reserves.\nKey Learning Points\n- The equity account section of a company’s balance sheet represents the total stockholders’ equity. It includes the breakup of preferred stock, common stock, and other accounts relevant to equity holders, such as retained earnings, other comprehensive income (loss), and treasury stock\n- Preferred stock represents the preference shares issued by a company. While it is shown as a part of equity for accounting purposes, it is considered as debt for valuation purposes\n- Common stock represents the par value of stock issued to common shareholders. For financial analysts common stock is not a particularly meaningful number on its own. Companies may issue multiple classes of stock, each with different sets of rights and entitlements (there are some limits to this for public companies in certain jurisdictions)\n- Additional paid-in capital or APIC represents the difference between the issue or subscription price of shares less their par value\n- Retained earnings shows the cumulative net income that has not been paid out as dividends. Instead, it has been reinvested in the business\n- Treasury stock represents any share repurchases made by a company and is a contra equity account – meaning it reduces equity\n- Other comprehensive loss or income shows items that are waiting to be included in the income statement, but cannot be included because these gains or losses have not yet been realized (there are exceptions to this)\n- Non-controlling interest represents the equity owned by third parties in subsidiaries not the parent company\n- The Statement of Shareholders’ Equity gives a detailed breakdown of the different equity accounts\n- The Statement of Comprehensive Income gives a breakdown of the Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) account\nEquity Accounts Explained\nBelow shows a snapshot of the balance sheet of the Hershey Company.

Usually, preferred stock is issued at par value. For valuation purposes, preferred stock is treated as debt. In the example above, the company does not have any preferred stock. Outside financial institutions it’s relatively uncommon to see preferred stock on public company balance sheets. Preferred stock is widely used in private equity capital structures.\nCommons stock represents the stock held by common shareholders. The Hershey Company’s equity accounts include common stock and Class B common stock. In the US, it is not uncommon for companies to issue more than one class of shares to investors. Each of the multiple share classes can have different voting rights, restrictions on sale, and dividends entitlements. In most cases the different classes of shares have the same economic rights (a notable exception to this is Berkshire Hathaway).\nAdditional Paid-in Capital\nAdditional paid-in capital or APIC represents the difference between the issue or subscription price of shares less their par value (usually $1 per share). For example, if the issue price is $10 and the par value is $1, the APIC is calculated by multiplying the total number of shares outstanding by $9 ($10-$1).\nRetained earnings (RE) is the cumulative net income that has not been paid out as dividends but instead has been reinvested in the business. Businesses can use these earnings to reinvest into the company to purchase assets such as property, plant, and equipment or to pay off liabilities.\nIn modeling and forecasting retained earnings is calculated as:\nRE = Beginning period RE + Net Income/(Loss) – Cash Dividends – Stock Dividends\nUnlike building a forecast of retained earnings in a financial model the reality can be more complex. In the statement of shareholders’ equity for Hershey you see retained earnings being increased by net income and reduced by dividends of both sets of shares. However, you also see a big deduction as a result of treasury stock being retired. Often treasury stock is kept, but in this case (which is uncommon) the company has decided to retire the treasury stock so retained earnings is the opposing entry. There is no impact on the income statement from treasury stock retirement. There is also an adjustment for an accounting change related to leases which necessitates a direct adjustment to retained earnings.\nTreasury stock is an account within a company’s financial statements to account for any share repurchases that the company has made. A company may buy back their own shares from the market to signal the management thinks they are undervalued. Share repurchases are also a tax effective way to return capital to shareholders as an alternative to paying a dividend and the sale of shares is taxed as a capital gain rather than income and capital gain taxes are often lower than income taxes. Notice in Hershey’s case they are repurchasing stock and issuing stock from the treasury account. The issuance relates to the company’s share option program, which is a common reason to issue stock directly out of the treasury account.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nOther comprehensive loss or other comprehensive income (OCI) represents items that are waiting to hit the income statement. These could be financial investments made by the company, which have increased or decreased in value. However, because the investments have not been sold or converted into cash yet, the gain/loss cannot be shown in the income statement yet. There are exceptions to gains and losses being moved to the income statement. Under IFRS accounting gains and losses from investments held at fair value to OCI are not recycled to the income statement. Most public companies will also publish a statement of comprehensive income. Here is Hershey’s:\nYou can see here the biggest items are FX adjustments, pensions and OPEBS, and cash flow hedges. Notice the bottom line shows the recycling to the income statement under ‘reclassification to earnings’.\nA non-controlling interest (NCI), formerly known as a minority interest, represents a shareholder or shareholder group that owns a minority stake in a company that is controlled by another company. In this example, the non-controlling interest represents the equity owned by third parties in subsidiaries owned by Hershey.\nGroup accounts are consolidated, and this drives the recognition of an NCI. The consolidated balance sheet for a group reflects 100% of all assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, the group controls (this normally means owning a controlling voting stake or over 50% of the shares). This results in the balance sheet of the group being partially funded by investors that retain non-controlling stakes. The equity accounts in the consolidated balance sheet have an NCI on the financing side to reflect this.\nThe non-controlling interest acts like the equity accounts of the non-controlling party. In Hershey’s case you can see the non-controlling interest increasing by their share of the subsidiary’s net income and decreasing by their share of the subsidiary’s dividends.\nEquity Accounts Example\nA business is reviewing its equity:\nWhat impact will the transactions have on equity based on the historical figures below?\nThe first step is to complete the adjustment calculation for each equity item affected by the transactions.\nThe business has issued an additional 25,000 shares at a par value of 1.0. This increases the common stock account by 25,000 (25,000 * 1.0).\nThe additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and the par value of the share. This is calculated as the issue price minus the par value multiplied by the number of new shares ((40.0 – 1.0) * 25,000). The result is an increase of 975,000 in the APIC account.\nThe information states that the business also repurchases 4,000 shares at a price of 42.0. Share buybacks are recorded in treasury stock and reduce the shares outstanding number. The cash balance will decrease and decrease the treasury balance by an additional 168,000 (4,000 * 42.0).\nThe projected equity items are calculated as follows:\nThe adjustment for each equity line item affected is added to the historical amount (prior to the transaction).","Phytic acid is a unique natural substance found in plant seeds.\nIt has received considerable attention due to its effects on mineral absorption.\nPhytic acid impairs the absorption of iron, zinc and calcium, and may promote mineral deficiencies (1).\nTherefore, it is often referred to as an anti-nutrient.\nHowever, the story is a bit more complicated than that, because phytic acid also has a number of health benefits.\nThis article takes a detailed look at phytic acid and its overall effects on health.\nPhytic acid, or phytate, is found in plant seeds. It serves as the main storage form of phosphorus in the seeds.\nWhen seeds sprout, phytate is degraded and the phosphorus released for use by the young plant.\nPhytic acid is also known as inositol hexaphosphate, or IP6.\nIt is often used commercially as a preservative due to its antioxidant properties.\nBottom Line: Phytic acid is found in plant seeds, where it serves as the main storage form of phosphorus.\nPhytic acid is only found in plant-derived foods.\nAll edible seeds, grains, legumes, and nuts contain it in varying quantities, and small amounts are also found in roots and tubers.\nThe following table shows the amount contained in a few high-phytate foods, as a percentage of dry weight (1):\nAs you can see, the phytic acid content is highly variable. For example, the amount contained in almonds can vary up to 20-fold.\nBottom Line: Phytic acid is found in all plant seeds, nuts, legumes and grains. The amount contained in these foods is highly variable.\nThis applies to a single meal, not overall nutrient absorption throughout the day.\nIn other words, phytic acid reduces mineral absorption during the meal, but doesn't have any effect on subsequent meals.\nFor example, snacking on nuts between meals could reduce the amount of iron, zinc and calcium you absorb from the nuts, but not from the meal you eat a few hours later.\nHowever, when you eat high-phytate foods with most of your meals, mineral deficiencies may develop over time.\nIn well balanced diets, this is rarely a concern, but may be a significant problem during periods of malnutrition, and in developing countries where the main food source is grains or legumes.\nBottom Line: Phytic acid impairs the absorption of iron, zinc and calcium. It may contribute to mineral deficiencies over time, but this is rarely a problem with well-balanced diets.\nAvoiding all foods that contain phytic acid is a bad idea, because many of them (like almonds) are nutritious, healthy and tasty.\nAlso, in many developing countries, food is scarce and people need to rely on grains and legumes as their main dietary staples.\nFortunately, several preparation methods can significantly reduce the phytic acid content of foods.\nHere are the most commonly used methods:\n- Soaking: Cereals and legumes are often soaked in water overnight to reduce their phytate content (1, 4).\n- Sprouting: The sprouting of seeds, grains and legumes, also known as germination, causes phytate degradation (5, 6).\n- Fermentation: Organic acids, formed during fermentation, promote phytate breakdown. Lactic acid fermentation is the preferred method, a good example of which is the making of sourdough (7, 8).\nCombination of these methods can reduce phytate content substantially.\nIn addition, sprouting and lactic acid fermentation of white sorghum and maize may almost completely degrade the phytic acid (10).\nBottom Line: Several methods can be used to reduce the phytic acid content of foods. This includes soaking, sprouting, and fermentation.\nPhytic acid is a good example of a nutrient that is both a \"friend and foe\", depending on the circumstances.\nIt has even been suggested that phytic acid might be part of the reason whole grains may cut the risk of colon cancer (19).\nBottom Line: Phytic acid may have several positive health effects, acting against both kidney stones and cancer.\nThe short answer is, probably not.\nHowever, those at risk of mineral deficiency should diversify their diets and not include high-phytate foods in all meals.This is particularly important among those who suffer from iron deficiency (2).\nThe thing is, there are two kinds of iron in foods; heme iron and non-heme iron.\nHeme-iron is found in foods of animal origin, such as meat, whereas non-heme iron comes from plants.\nNon-heme iron from plant-derived foods is poorly absorbed, while the absorption of heme-iron is efficient. Non-heme iron is also highly affected by phytic acid, whereas heme-iron is not (22).\nIn addition, zinc is well absorbed from meat, even in the presence of phytic acid (23).\nTherefore, mineral deficiencies caused by phytic acid are rarely a concern among meat-eaters.\nHowever, phytic acid can be a significant problem when diets are largely composed of high-phytate foods while at the same time low in meat or other animal-derived foods.\nThis is of particular concern in many developing nations where whole grain cereals and legumes are a large part of the diet.\nBottom Line: Phytic acid is usually not a concern in industrialized nations, where food diversity and availability is adequate. However, vegetarians/vegans and those who eat a lot of high-phytate foods may be at risk.\nHigh-phytate foods, such as grains, nuts, and legumes, can raise the risk of iron and zinc deficiency.\nAs a countermeasure, strategies such as soaking, sprouting and fermentation are often employed.\nFor those who eat meat regularly, deficiencies caused by phytic acid are not a concern.\nIn fact, consumption of certain high-phytate foods as part of a balanced, real food based diet has numerous benefits.\nIn many cases, these benefits outweigh any negative effects on mineral absorption."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f3c4ee4f-438e-4fc6-aaef-0050e44aa364>","<urn:uuid:30074840-2146-40a3-bd75-5e1c1b9e4c26>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the diagnostic techniques for Chagas disease and Lyme disease compare in terms of their serological testing methods?","answer":"Both diseases rely on serological testing but use different specific methods. For Chagas disease, diagnosis uses ELISA tests with antigens from T. cruzi epimastigotes, with ASE (autoclaved stressed epimastigotes) showing 100% sensitivity and specificity. For Lyme disease, diagnosis involves a two-step approach: first using ELISAs to measure IgM/IgG antibodies specific for Borrelia, followed by confirmation with a Western Blot for any positive ELISA results.","context":["Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, 104(6) September 2009\nSerological diagnosis of Chagas disease: evaluation and characterisation of a low cost antigen with high sensitivity and specificity\nILaboratorio de Fisiopatología (Nodo I LANPIP), Instituto de Biomedicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Central de Venezuela, San Nicolás a Providencia, Sector Hospital Vargas, San José 1010, Caracas, Venezuela\nIIFundación Instituto de Estudios Avanzados, Centro de Biotecnología, Caracas, Venezuela\nIn spite of evident progress in the serology of Chagas disease, the requirement for new diagnostic antigens persists. We have evaluated different antigens obtained from Trypanosoma cruzi grown in medium rich in nutrients or under nutrient stress, autoclaved or sonicated and fractionated by differential centrifugation. The resulting antigens were evaluated for diagnosis of Chagas disease using ELISA. Immunofluorescence of the parasites demonstrated that nutrient stress induced changes in the distribution and density of antigens recognised by a pool of sera from experimentally infected mice. When evaluated using ELISA, it was evident that most fractions had good sensitivity but poor specificity. Surprisingly, the best specificity and sensitivity was observed with parasites cultured under nutrient stress and autoclaved. Furthermore this antigen had low cross reactivity with sera from other parasitic diseases, Leishmaniasis in particular. Western blot analysis demonstrated that autoclaving seems to non-specifically eliminate cross-reactive antigens. In conclusion, autoclaving epimastigotes of T. cruzi, after nutrient stress, allowed us to obtain an antigen that could be used in the serological diagnosis of Chagas disease.\nDiagnosis of Chagas disease in patients chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi is generally based on the detection of specific antibodies against antigens from epimastigotes of T. cruzi. Different diagnostic techniques and different antigens have been used to detect these specific antibodies. Because of differences in sensitivity and/or specificity, there is controversy about which antigen is the most efficient (Berrizbeitia et al. 2006, Zarate-Blades et al. 2007). In this context, the availability of an antigen with high sensitivity and specificity, low cross reactivity and high stability and that can be produced at a low cost should facilitate the implementation of at least two different serological tests for the diagnosis of Chagas disease as recommended by the World Health Organization (Saez-Alquezar et al. 2003, Schmunis 2007).\nIn previous studies, we observed that parameters like culture conditions, inhibition of proteolytic activity and processing methods significantly affect the sensitivity and specificity of the antigens (unpublished observations). Based on those studies, we have evaluated the antigenicity of different complex antigens obtained with different culture conditions (with and without nutrient stress) and different methods of processing the parasites (sonication or autoclaving).\nA total of 243 serum specimens from healthy blood bank donors with negative serology for Chagas disease (n = 14), Chagas disease (n = 32) confirmed by three different serological tests, cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 58), visceral leishmaniasis (n = 87), malaria (n = 15), schistosomiasis (n = 23) and toxoplasmosis (n = 16) were used, at dilutions of 1:500, in the present study. The procedures and sample utilisation methods were approved by the Ethical Committee for Human Research at the Instituto de Biomedicina, Universidad Central de Venezuela.\nT. cruzi, strain Y, was grown at 25ºC in a modified LIT medium formulated as follows: 4.0 g of NaCl, 0.4 g of KCl, 8.0 g of Na2HPO4, 5.0 g of tryptose, 5.0 g of liver extract and 2.5 g of yeast extract were combined in a final volume of 500 mL at pH 7.2, autoclaved, adjusted to 1 L with sterile DMEM (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies Inc, USA) and supplemented with 0.2% defibrinated rabbit blood, 2% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% dextrose and 50 ??g/mL gentamicin.\nLeishmania infantum promastigotes were grown at 25ºC in a modified LIT medium containing 15 g of tryptose, 2 g of liver extract, 5 g of yeast extract, 4 g of glucose, 9 g of NaCl, 0.4 g of KCl, 7.5 g of Na2HPO4 and 0.02 g of haemin in 8 mL of 0.1 N NaOH, pH 7.5, which was diluted to a final volume of 1 L, autoclaved and supplemented with 10% FBS.\nEpimastigotes and promastigotes from the different culture conditions were processed by two methods, autoclaving and sonication. (i) for the autoclaved epimastigotes or promastigotes (AE), cultures of parasites in stationary phase were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min; the pellet was resuspended and washed three times in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.2. After the last wash, they were resuspended with PBS at 30 x 106 parasites/mL and autoclaved; (ii) for the nutrient stress autoclaved epimastigotes or promastigotes (ASE), parasites in stationary phase were harvested as in (i), resuspended at 30 x 106 parasites/mL with DMEM supplemented with gentamicin (50 ?g/mL), incubated at 25ºC for 24 h and autoclaved as described for AE; (iii) for the sonicated epimastigotes or promastigotes, parasites were processed as described in (i) and (ii), but instead of being autoclaved, they were sonicated twice for 20 s at 4ºC and 50 watts (Branson 250, Branson Ultrasonic Corporation, USA). With this procedure, two crude antigens were obtained: sonicated antigen of stationary phase (SE) and of nutrient stress (SSE) parasites. Both were aliquoted and stored at -20ºC; (iv) the subcellular fractions were obtained by subjecting sonicated parasites to differential centrifugation.\nLeishmania sp. antigens were identified as autoclaved or sonicated. Protein concentrations were assessed by a colourimetric assay (Micro BCA protein assay, PIERCE, USA).\nThe antigenic preparations of T. cruzi or Leishmania sp. were evaluated by an indirect ELISA. Optimisation of antigen, serum and conjugate concentrations was performed by checkerboard titration. Briefly, ELISA plates (Maxisorp, Nunc International Corporation) were coated with 100 ?L (2 ?g/well) of antigen and 100 ?L of carbonate buffer (0.016 M Na2CO3, 0.034 M NaHCO3, pH 9.6). After overnight incubation at 4°C, the plates were washed three times for 10 min with TBS-T 150 (0.150 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris Base, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8), blocked for 1 h at 37°C with TBS-T 150 supplemented with 5% low-fat dry milk and 1% FBS and washed again. Serum samples, diluted 1:500 with TBS-T, were added (two wells for each serum sample) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were washed three times and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L; GIBCO BRL, USA) for 1 h. After washing the wells three times, PNPP substrate (PIERCE) in diethanolamine buffer was added to each well and incubated for 30 min for colour development. Optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm in a Multiskan TX microplate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation). The lower limit of detection (cut-off) was determined as the mean OD of the negative control serum plus two standard deviations. Sensitivity, specificity, confidence limits, significance and graphics were calculated using the GraphPad InStat 3.02 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) and Epitable software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA).\nAs shown in Table I, no significant difference could be established among the sonicated and autoclaved antigens and ASE had the best combination of sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) (Table I). All subcellular fractions had good sensitivity, but, independent of the processing method used, their specificity was lower than ASE. Consequently, it seems that a complex antigenic mixture is required to obtain the best specificity and sensitivity.\nInterestingly, when the parasites were sonicated, nutrient stress did not improve antigen performance, as shown by a high number of false positives. This suggests that the antigens that react non-specifically with antibodies are preferentially denatured when nutrient-stressed epimastigotes are autoclaved. Our data show that ASE has a high sensitivity and specificity and the cost to produce it is low. Furthermore, the agreement of the data obtained with unfractionated antigens with the expected values (ASE 100; SE 97.5; AE 92.5; SSE 84.09) indicates that ASE could potentially be used for routine diagnosis of Chagas disease.\nThe fact that autoclaving an antigen improves its specificity without affecting its sensitivity was unexpected. To evaluate the validity of this observation for other species, we assessed the effect of autoclaving Leishmania sp. promastigotes. The data obtained (sensitivity = 0%) show that, in spite of the close phylogenetic relationship between T. cruzi and Leishmania, the antigenicity of promastigotes was severely affected by autoclaving.\nCross reactivity with cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis frequently limits the specificity of serological tests for the diagnosis of Chagas disease. When analysing the data summarised in Table II, it is evident that the percentage of patients with confirmed leishmaniasis and positive serology for Chagas using ASE was low (less than 10%). In Venezuela, there is significant overlap of the areas where leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are endemic and it is difficult to exclude a previous infection with Leishmania; however, when sera from patients with leishmaniasis that tested positive with ASE were evaluated with a commercial kit (BIOSChile), all were positive for Chagas disease. Consequently, we can conclude that the specificity of our antigen preparation is as good as the specificity of commercial antigens.\nContrary to what was expected, autoclaving epimastigotes of T. cruzi did not affect antigen sensitivity and specificity and decreased the cross reactivity observed with sera from other parasitic diseases.\nTo more precisely evaluate the consequences of autoclaving T. cruzi epimastigotes, we performed Western blots (Towbin et al. 1979) on the SE and ASE epimastigotes using sera from patients with Chagas disease (n = 10) and visceral leishmaniasis (n = 5) and pooled sera from patients with Chagas disease. Sera from patients with Chagas disease revealed more peptides of low and high molecular weights in ASE (Fig. 1). As expected, due to the denaturing effect of autoclaving, most bands identified by Western blot of ASE were of low molecular weight. However, when we compared the bands that reacted with sera from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (Fig. 1, Lanes 11-15), it was evident that bands observed in the Western blot of AE (26, 37 and 49 kDa) are not present in the Western blot of ASE. The principal source of the false positive serological diagnosis of Chagas disease is cross reactivity with sera from patients with Leishmaniasis. Our findings suggest that cross-reactive antigens of T. cruzi are more susceptible to autoclaving than specific antigens. Although the reactivity with a band of 26 kDa was lost after autoclaving with sera of visceral leishmaniasis patients, reactivity persisted with sera of Chagasic patients. This suggests the presence of at least two 26-kDa polypeptides, one that is responsible for the cross reactivity with visceral leishmaniasis sera and one that is specific for Chagas disease. Morgado et al. (1989) described two bands (46 and 25 kDa) specific to Chagas disease and both bands are present in SE. After autoclaving, the 46-kDa band disappeared, but the 25-kDa band persisted and seemed to be important for the specificity and sensitivity of ASE.\nTo document the effect of nutrient stress in living parasites, 1 x 106 epimastigotes from cultures in stationary phase with and without nutrient stress for 24 h were fixed overnight at 4°C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in glycine PBS (50 mM Na2PO4, 50 mM glycine, pH 7.2) for 15 min. Antiserum of an infected mouse was diluted, according to previous standardisation, 1:50 in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and cells were incubated with antiserum for 1 h at 4°C. The primary antibody was removed by washing three times with 1% BSA in PBS followed by incubation with FITC rabbit anti mouse IgG (H + L; DAKO) at 1:500 in 1% BSA for 1 h. Finally, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.1 mg mL-1 final concentration; Fluka) for 5 min, followed by washing three times with 1% BSA and once with sterile water. Parasites were transferred to slides, mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern-Biotech) and examined with a 100X oil immersion objective lens in a C1 Confocal Microscope (Nikon). Images were obtained using the EZ-C1 software (Nikon). When we compared the control fluorescence pattern to the nutrient-stressed epimastigotes pattern, the patterns differed in intensity as well as in distribution (Fig. 2). Control parasites had few small discrete spots in the posterior end, the cell body and the tip of the flagellum. This labelling was clearly different from the larger and more abundant fluorescent spots observed in the nutrient-stressed epimastigotes. This suggests that nutrient stress increased the density of antigens recognised by the antiserum and/or induced the expression of different antigenic molecules in the parasite. The change in the pattern of labelling is associated with improvements in sensitivity and specificity of the antigens obtained from epimastigotes subjected to nutrient stress and autoclaving. As reported by other investigators, modifications in culture conditions, like those evaluated here, induce biochemical and molecular changes in the antigens produced (Contreras et al. 1994, 1998). The expression of these changes is evident in the immunofluorescence of epimastigotes subjected to different culture conditions.\nOur data suggest that somehow nutrient stress and autoclaving, in a manner that seems to be specific to epimastigotes, induce preferential loss of cross-reactive antigens while maintaining enough specific antigens for Chagas disease.\nIn conclusion, the low cross reactivity, high sensitivity and specificity of ASE makes it suitable for the immunodiagnosis of Chagas disease.\nTo Dr. Oscar Noya, from Instituto de Medicina Tropical, Universidad Central de Venezuela, and Dra.

{"question":"Hola, soy estudiante de microbiología. How do bacteriophages work to control bacteria in food, and do they keep working over time to prevent recontamination?","answer":"The ongoing effectiveness of bacteriophages is still under investigation. It's unclear if they provide just a one-off 'kill' of bacteria or have an ongoing protective effect against recontamination. This distinction is important because if they only provide a one-off kill, the food could be susceptible to recontamination by bacteria later. Additionally, a single bacteriophage is unlikely to be effective against all strains of a particular bacterial species, so a 'cocktail' of bacteriophages may be necessary. The effectiveness also varies significantly depending on treatment conditions like contact time and temperature.","context":["Bacteriophages are viruses (naturally present in the environment) that can kill specific host bacteria. There has been some reported interest in using these in a targeted fashion to reduce microbiological contamination of foods i.e. reduce the level of food pathogens such as Salmonella. Alternatively a bacteriophage could reduce spoilage bacteria on food thereby extending its shelf-life. Our previous research considered the use of bacteriophages on live animals and as such this project focussed on use on/in food.\nThere are currently no approved bacteriophages at European-wide level, although some European countries allow the use of bacteriophages under national rules. Additionally bacteriophages are authorised for use in other countries across the world and there is a growing interest in this area.\nWhen bacteriophages are used to reduce surface contamination on products of animal origin (e.g. meat, fish) they may require approval under EU food hygiene legislation before they are permitted for use. If they act as preservatives with an ongoing effect in the food, then they may require approval under EU food additives legislation.\nThis project critically reviewed information on the use of bacteriophages on food to determine where and how bacteriophages could potentially be used in food production. The work focussed on efficacy, specificity, safety and any potential issues associated with their use.\nThe project focused on five key pathogens responsible for the microbiological contamination of foods which can lead to food poisoning i.e. Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, shiga toxin producing E. coli(STEC) and Staphylococcus aureus.\nFor food spoilage bacteria, two representative species were selected from the following groups: Gram negative rods, the Enterics, Gram positive spore formers, Gram positive non-spore formers and lactic acid bacteria.\nThe first stage of the project assessed the current applications of bacteriophages in the food industry, including information on where and how they are used, controls/guidelines and any existing risk assessments on their use.\nThe second stage involved a systematic and critical review of the data available from a literature search on the ability of bacteriophages to reduce food pathogens or spoilage bacteria to determine the potential use of bacteriophages in food production.\nCertain bacteriophages are approved as food additives or have ‘GRAS’ status in the USA and can be used to reduce the amount of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica or E. coli O157:H7 on a wide range of food types including poultry, red meat, ready to eat foods, fish, shellfish and processed fruits and vegetables. Specific bacteriophages used to reduce Listeria are also permitted in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\nRegarding the potential use of bacteriophages to reduce microbiological contamination of foods, there was a lack of published work on the use of bacteriophage against Campylobacter spp. on/in food as the current literature mainly related to their use on live animals, which was outside the scope of this review. There was also a lack of relevant studies on the use of bacteriophage against food spoilage bacteria.\nKey conclusions from the review:\n- Some bacteriophages are already approved outside the EU for use on foods to reduce microbiological contamination by food pathogens such as Listeria, Salmonella and E Coli O157.\n- Additional work is required to establish the effectiveness of using bacteriophages against food spoilage bacteria as there is a lack of published studies in this area.\n- Further work is needed to confirm if bacteriophages provide a one off ‘kill’ or whether they have an ongoing effect and so could protect against recontamination of food by the bacteria. This is important as the mechanism of action of a bacteriophage will determine whether they should be regulated as food additives or as processing aids. Additionally, if they only act as a one off ‘kill’ then food could be susceptible to being re-contaminated by the bacteria and so there could be an increase in the level of the food pathogen following the use of the bacteriophage.\n- If bacteriophages have an ongoing effect and continue to reduce the level of bacterial contamination of food (i.e. protect against recontamination) they would be regarded as food additives, which require approval prior to use under EU food additives legislation. If they act as a one off ‘kill’ they may be considered to be processing aids and so would only require approval under EU food hygiene legislation if used to decontaminate the surfaces of meat or fish.\n- Optimisation of the treatment process (i.e. contact time and temperature) is required to obtain the optimum results as the effectiveness of the treatment varies significantly with the type of food.\n- It was considered unlikely that a single bacteriophage would be effective against all strains of a particular bacterial species. Therefore the use of a ‘cocktail’ of bacteriophages may be necessary to reduce bacteria levels. The use of a bacteriophage with other antimicrobial treatments (e.g. nisin) often resulted in an improved ‘kill’ of the target bacteria.\nThe impact of bacteriophages on toxin-producing bacteria and on how they may influence the human gut microflora should be investigated further."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f560ebb2-e104-4468-95c8-d02e9b9a2bbd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the American pika and the rosy boa adapt differently to environmental challenges in their habitats?","answer":"The American pika and rosy boa have evolved distinct strategies to cope with environmental challenges. Pikas are sensitive to climate conditions, with evidence showing climate-mediated loss and fragmentation of their core habitat in the northern Sierra Nevada. They rely on specific temperature conditions for survival. In contrast, rosy boas have adapted to survive in extremely dry habitats by remaining deep underground to stay hydrated during dry periods and becoming active primarily after rainfall. They are also able to shift their activity patterns seasonally, being active during afternoons and early evenings in spring, then switching to dusk and nighttime activity during late spring and summer to cope with hot weather.","context":["- Forest Regeneration and Restoration – Severe fires and a changing climate are contributing to poor postfire conifer regeneration in California.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe rosy boa (Lichanura trivirgata) is a species of snake of the family Boidae. The rosy boa is one of only two members of that family native to the United States, the other being the rubber boa (Charina bottae). The rosy boa is native to the American Southwest, and adjacent Baja California and Sonora, Mexico.\nThese small, attractive snakes normally attain a length of 17–34 in (43–86 cm), although some coastal specimens from California reach 36–44 in (91–112 cm). A large adult has a body width about the diameter of a golf ball. Coloration in rosy boas is highly variable, and usually locale-specific. The common name is derived from the rosy or salmon coloration that is common on the belly of rosy boas originating from coastal southern California and Baja Mexico. Most rosy boas do not have this ventral coloration, but instead have a series of dark to orange spots on a light-colored background.\nAlmost all rosy boas have at least some trace of three longitudinal stripes, one down the center of the back, and two on the lower sides. The appearance of these stripes varies widely, from extremely straight and having high contrast with the interspaces, to extremely broken with almost no contrast with the interspaces. Stripe colors can be orange, maroon, rust, brown, or black. Interspace colors can be shades of light to dark gray, yellow, or tan.\nThe rosy boa is found in the southwestern United States in the states of California and Arizona, and northwestern Mexico in the states of Baja California and Sonora. In California, the rosy boa ranges throughout the Colorado and Mojave Deserts and also occupies the coastal areas of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. In Arizona, the rosy boa occupies the Mojave Desert and the western areas of the Sonoran Desert. It is absent from the eastern and northern halves of the state. In Sonora, the rosy boa ranges from the border with the United States south throughout the Sonoran Desert to at least as far south as Ortiz. In Baja California, the rosy boa is almost ubiquitous ranging throughout the entire peninsula except in areas of extremely dry or rockless desert.\nRosy boas spend most of their lives concealed beneath rocks and in crevices to escape the elements and natural predators. Granite outcroppings are the most common geologic association inhabited by the rosy boa. Less often, they are found in association with volcanic or other rock types. Only in rare places do rosy boas inhabit rockless environments. In areas with few rocks, rosy boas use rodent burrows for concealment.\nRosy boas' activity season follows local weather patterns; however, they are generally dormant during the winter, and active during the spring, summer, and fall. Like all snakes, they are dependent on external temperatures to promote such normal bodily functions as digestion and gestation. Throughout most of their range, the winter is too cold for these functions and the rosy boas go into a dormant state called brumation. The spring is breeding season, resulting in their highest rate of activity. Most rosy boas are encountered in spring as they leave the security of their rock piles and crevices to seek mates. Another reason rosy boas may be active on the surface of the ground is to find prey or new territory.\nThe surface activity of rosy boas can take place during any hour of the day, but during hot weather, they are primarily nocturnal. In the spring, they are often out in the afternoon and early evening. In the late spring and summer, this activity period switches from dusk to late into the night. Because most populations of rosy boas live in exceedingly dry habitats, their activity is often highly moisture-dependent. During dry periods they remain deep underground to assist in remaining hydrated. Recent rainfall often results in a flurry of surface activity.\nThese snakes forage mainly for small mammals, but have occasionally been known to take other prey items, such as birds and lizards. Pack rats, baby rabbits, deer mice, and kangaroo rats make up a large portion of their diet. Rosy boas are one of the slowest-moving species of snakes in the world. They are unable to pursue prey and must either wait in ambush or stalk their meals. When a meal is within reach, usually a few inches, a rosy boa strikes with surprising speed and accuracy. Prey is secured with tiny rows of needle-sharp teeth, then suffocated through constriction.\nRosy boas are extremely docile when encountered by humans. When disturbed, they usually roll into a compact ball with the head in the center. The species is not prone to bite in defense, but rather will release a foul-smelling musk from the base of the tail when threatened. When human bites have occurred, they have usually been the result of a feeding response with a captive animal. All rosy boas are nonvenomous. Their extreme docility, few needs, and attractive coloration have made rosy boas popular with herpetoculturists.\nRosy boas bear live young, about six in a brood, with newborns about 30 cm (12 in.) in length.\nThe specific epithet trivirgata refers to the distinct three stripes characteristic of the species. The rosy boa is considered to be the only species within the genus Lichanura, but one researcher has placed it in the genus Charina with the rubber boa. Newer phylogenetic research supports the original arrangement, but herpetologists are still not unified on rosy boa taxonomy. The subspecific designations are just as uncertain, with many sources not accepting L. t. arizonae or L. t. saslowi.\n- Arizona rosy boa, L. t. arizonae Spiteri, 1991\n- Desert rosy boa, L. t. gracia Klauber, 1931 – ground color laced with well-defined pink, orange, or tan longitudinal stripes\n- Coastal rosy boa, L. t. roseofusca Cope, 1868 – ground color laced with blotchy reddish-brown longitudinal stripes\n- Baja rosy boa, L. t. saslowi Spiteri, 1987\n- Mexican rosy boa, L. t. trivirgata Cope, 1861 – ground color laced with pale, creamy broad longitudinal stripes\nTheir generally docile temperament and small size make rosy boas an ideal choice for pet snakes due to their easy care and small enclosure size. They are frequently captive bred, and readily feed on commercially available mice. Many color variations are available, including albinos, as well as the different subspecies. With other species, such as corn snakes, milk snakes, and ball pythons, dominating the majority of the market, the popularity of rosy boas has not been as high as other species.\n- Hammerson GA, Frost DR, Gadsden H (2007). \"Lichanura trivirgata\".

{"question":"As a food scientist interested in functional foods and coffee processing, I'm curious about how fermentation affects both coffee quality and health benefits. What role do microorganisms play in coffee processing, and how can fermentation enhance the nutritional qualities of functional foods?","answer":"Microorganisms play crucial roles in coffee processing and functional food enhancement through fermentation. In coffee processing, microorganisms naturally present on coffee cherry surfaces thrive on nutrient-rich plant material like pulp and mucilage, producing metabolites during fermentation. These metabolites can remain on the surface of beans as a microbial signature and survive the entire process. The fermentation can occur in processing water during wet processing or in drying outer layers during dry processing. For functional foods, biotransformation through fermentation can improve human health-relevant nutritional qualities. Lactic acid bacteria are particularly important in biotransformation of food ingredients, enhancing health benefits and improving functional properties of various foods like tuber crops and berries.","context":["A two volume set that kick off the Food Biotechnology series, Functional Foods and Biotechnology combines the work of experts around that world to advance knowledge on bio-based innovations to improve wider health-focused applications of functional food and food ingredients.

Not surprisingly, each of these stages is interlinked and can be optimized to deliver coffee of ever-increasing quality. Coffee quality is commonly evaluated at the level of the green coffee beans and the brewed cup. As the green coffee beans have all the flavor precursors locked inside them, their quality bears a close relationship to the final cup quality.\nBut the role of post-harvest processing cannot be ignored when one thinks about improving coffee quality. The main goal of post-harvest processing is to remove the outer layers of the coffee cherries and transform their seeds into a dried and stable carrier of flavor precursors, i.e., green coffee. The common methods to achieve this are wet and dry processing, whose history can be traced back to the very birth of the coffee industry. Meanwhile, many hybrid or novel methods also have gained popularity in the coffee production regions, such as the well-known pulped honey process or the trendy anaerobic fermentation (i.e., with limiting or absence of oxygen during fermentation). In recent years, many producers have taken the lead in innovating coffee processing and have experimented with different methods across production regions. This provides a huge amount of empirical evidence regarding the influence of processing methods and specific processing parameters on coffee quality. However, rigorous scientific proof to back them up remains veiled, yet longs to be discovered.\nFor the past four years, we have been working with coffee through a bilateral industry-academia research collaboration between the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Brussels, Belgium) and Nestlé Research (Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland), endeavoring to understand coffee post-harvest processing. Here, we’ll highlight some of our research findings with different coffee varieties in various geographical locations – we hope you’ll find it as insightful and thrilling as we did during our journey.\nMicrobes and Metabolism\nTwo main phenomena happen during coffee post-harvest processing, namely the microbial activities in the processing environment and the internal seed metabolism of the coffee beans. The dynamic character of the processing is highlighted in the continuous consumption of nutrients and production of substances by the microorganisms, as well as an ongoing re-shuffling of the seed’s own metabolomic profile (i.e., a concentration profile of many different substances in the beans). The complexity lies in the multiple steps within a single processing method and its dependency on various external factors, such as temperature, coffee variety, and processing equipment.\nMicroorganisms are present in virtually any environment and, therefore, also in the coffee processing ecosystem. As they play a crucial role in other fermented food productions (see “Fermenting Flavor”), it is perhaps not surprising that microorganisms also perform important functional roles during coffee processing. Microorganisms are already present on the coffee cherry’s surface before the processing even begins: as processing progresses, these microorganisms (especially the lactic acid bacteria) thrive on nutrient-rich plant material, such as pulp and/ or mucilage, that is released into the fermentation environment. While they grow, microorganisms produce metabolites from these plant nutrients and accumulate in the processing environment – this is called a fermentation by microbiologists. To our excitement, we found that fermentation happens in different parts of the coffee ecosystem during wet and dry processing. During wet processing, fermentation happens in the processing water, while during dry processing, fermentation happens in the drying outer layers of the cherries. Interestingly, some of the metabolites produced during fermentation remain on the surface of the beans, and can even survive the entire process. As such, they linger on the green coffee beans as a microbial signature. We called this phenomenon the fermentation effect.\nConcurrently, the coffee bean is also a living entity that interacts with and reacts to its environment. As any living organism, it will thus be metabolically active throughout processing. The coffee beans are considered intermediate seeds, which allows them to react to different external environmental stress factors even under low moisture content and change their metabolite composition accordingly (made up of the dynamic sum of all carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids inside the seed). The two dominant stress factors along the processing chain are hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, during the underwater submersion and “drought stress” (lack of water) during drying. During wet processing, the beans experience both hypoxia and drought stress, while during dry processing, the beans are under prolonged drought stress. These are also the differences that contribute to the distinction between a washed and a natural coffee. Therefore, when we talk about the impact of coffee processing on flavor, we’re not just talking about the creation of “fermented flavors” that exist on the outside of the processed beans – we’re also talking about fundamental changes to the metabolic composition of the coffee bean itself.\nDifferent Processes Accumulate Different Concentrations of Metabolites\nUnder different processing conditions, both microbiology and seed metabolism affect the metabolomic profiles of the coffee beans and thus ultimately the cup quality. Here, we briefly consider the impact of three specific wet processing parameters that we studied extensively: how long fermentation took place, if the cherries were mechanically demucilaged, and whether or not the beans were soaked after fermentation and washing. However, before we start, it’s helpful to clearly define some terms used around processing.\nDuring basic wet processing, fresh coffee cherries have their pulp removed (depulping) and submerged under water (fermentation). Afterwards, the fermentation tank is drained, and the fermented beans are cleaned with water to remove any remnant mucilage (washing). Sometimes, these washed beans are then soaked in the tank or separate buckets with clean water again (soaking). After washing or soaking, the beans are dried during a drying step. One variation on classical fermentation is to remove the mucilage mechanically through the demucilager (where two rotating drums squeeze the beans to scrape off a large portion of the mucilage mechanically), which is what we’ll define here as the demucilaging process.\nThe length of fermentation exhibits a significant impact on the coffee quality. We found that whereas a long fermentation is commonly believed to downgrade coffee quality, leading to stinkers or acid beans, it can also have positive and even desirable effects, provided carefully controlled farm practices are maintained. Under hygienic processing conditions (in particular for the fermentation tank and washing channel), a longer fermentation allowed more time for the desirable microbial activities to deploy and resulted in a greater fermentation effect on the fermenting beans. This fermentation effect lingered on the green coffee beans, as reflected in the higher concentrations of microbial metabolites (e.g., lactic acid and mannitol) and the higher intensities of the floral or fruity volatile organic compounds. On the flip side of microbiology, a long fermentation duration reinforced the role of hypoxia through endogenous bean metabolism, affecting concentrations of simple carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and fructose), amino acids (e.g., aspartic acid and alanine), and organic acids (e.g., succinic acid). These compounds listed can act as main precursors in a series of chemical reactions during roasting, especially the Maillard Reaction, and generating signature coffee flavor. With the modification of the abundance of these flavor precursors on the green beans, longer fermentation resulted in an enhancement of the fruity notes in-cup.\nThe use of demucilaged rather than depulped beans as the starting material for fermentation during wet coffee processing has been controversial. As a more ecological alternative to classical fermentation, the use of a demucilager can save on the fresh water used during fermentation and reduces processing time, yet its impact on the sensory quality remains elusive. Our work showed that the presence of mucilage on depulped beans increased the nutrient density in the fermentation water for the microbes to work on. That’s why the fermentation effect in the water and on the beans was more intensive compared to a demucilaged fermentation process. This resulted in the green coffee beans from the depulped process retaining more microbial metabolites and differing in amino acid and phenolic profiles compared to the demucilaged process. As a result, the cup quality derived from these two processes showed subtle differences in their floral and fruity intensities.\nIn contrast to the factors mentioned above, the application of washing and soaking reduced the fermentation effect. With the absence of soaking or even a reduced amount of washing, the precious metabolites accumulated during fermentation were retained on the green coffee beans to a higher degree and improved the cupping score. However, if for whatever reason fermentation does not turn out well, soaking could help to get rid of some of the undesirable metabolites built up during fermentation and provide a means of controlling off-flavors in coffee.\nCoffee Variety as a Fermentation Variable\nDifferent coffee varieties will show variability in metabolite composition of the mucilage and pulp of their fresh coffee cherries. As the main provider of nutrients for the microorganisms, the compositional differences in mucilage across different coffee varieties also impacts the extent of the fermentation effect. For example, we found that the Typica coffee cherries we used in Latin America had a juicy mesocarp layer that was richer in nutrients than that of Catimor ones in Asia. In combination with external factors, like the local ambient temperature, we found that this affected the pH profiles, the microbial community dynamics, and the metabolite compositions during fermentation. Therefore, it is important to take the coffee variety into account when evaluating the potential impacts of the processing practices.\nWe believe that this diversity is coffee’s strength, because it means that there is a vast amount of permutations of the factors above that remain to be explored and that this diversity in the coffee value chain interweaves craft and science. We remain convinced that some of the outcomes are bound to result in a damn fine cup of coffee.\nSOPHIA JIYUAN ZHANG, a chemist and coffee enthusiast, has worked on multiple coffee plantations around the world to understand the links between processing and coffee quality.

{"question":"What different approaches did Princen and Takahachi take regarding recognition for their support of East Timor?","answer":"Princen and Takahachi had contrasting approaches to recognition. Princen accepted formal honors for his support, including receiving Indonesia's highest honor, the Guerilla Star, from President Sukarno for fighting alongside Indonesian nationalists. In contrast, Takahachi explicitly rejected recognition for his contributions to East Timor's independence, stating he did not want any medals or honors. He explained that his support was meant to compensate for the wrongs committed by his father's and grandfather's generations during World War II, saying 'I don't want anything. I am one Japanese citizen who has warm heart to all Asian countries, especially to East Timorese grassroots people.'","context":["|Subject: SMH: Jill Jolliffe on Princen\nSydney Morning Herald\nMarch 14, 2002 Thursday\nDutch 'traitor' Became A Pro-Timorese Indonesian\nJill Jolliffe,Jill Jolliffe Is The Herald's Correspondent\nBODY: Johannes Cornelis Princen, Human rights activist, 1925 - 2002\nJohannes Princen, who has died in Jakarta, was an extraordinary figure who played a fearless role in upholding human rights in Indonesia. Born in The Hague, he was raised by free-thinking parents and influenced by anarchist ideals in his youth.\nDuring World War II \"Poncke\" Princen was captured by the Germans and spent time in a Nazi concentration camp. He later enlisted in the Dutch army and was sent to Indonesia to fight in the so-called \"police action\" to restore Dutch colonial rule against Indonesian nationalists.\nHe quickly sympathised with the Indonesian nationalists, and in 1948 deserted to fight with them against his compatriots. Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, decorated him with the Guerilla Star, Indonesia's highest honour, as a result. He took out Indonesian citizenship, converted to Islam and was elected to the Indonesian Parliament in 1956.\nHis stand caused great bitterness in Holland, where he was branded as a traitor and banned from returning to his homeland until the closing years of his life.\nIn death, however, Dutch cabinet minister Jan Pronk paid a cautious tribute to him. \"Poncke Princen was no hero, martyr or saint, but first and foremost a human rights activist,\" he told Radio Netherlands.\nUnlike many opponents of the Soeharto regime who had never criticised the populist Sukarno, his record on political freedom was thoroughgoing. He was imprisoned by both Sukarno and Soeharto for his defence of human rights, serving a total of 81/2 years in prison.\nIn the early 1970s he was a founder of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute. Despite his critical role, his prestige in Indonesia always remained high because of his role in the independence struggle, and in the early 1990s he was a founding member of the Group of Fifty, a movement for democratic reform which included conservative military figures who had fallen out with Soeharto.\nBut he stood out from others because of his early stand in support of East Timorese self-determination, a cause which was taboo even in the most progressive circles, where nationalism reigned supreme.\nIn later years he suffered mutilating surgery for skin cancer and then a series of near-fatal strokes. Yet his luminous spirit shone through his crippled wreck of a body, and he continued his work as before.\nAfter the imprisonment of East Timor's resistance hero Xanana Gusmao in 1992, the two formed a friendship, although Princen was only able to visit him personally after the reformasi movement gained force in 1998.\nAfter the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre in Dili he gave sanctuary in his house to five young East Timorese who had fled their homeland. A stand-off with the Indonesian military followed, but he successfully negotiated with the Jakarta military commander, General Hendro-priono then perceived as a liberal harbinger of reformasi for their safe passage to Jakarta airport, from whence they travelled to freedom in Portugal.\nGusmao, who is likely to be East Timor's first president after elections next month, said in Dili that he was deeply saddened by Princen's death. He said his first contact with him had been when he was still leading the guerilla struggle in East Timor's mountains.\nThey corresponded from that time, a link which continued during the Timorese leader's imprisonment in Jakarta.\n\"After the reformasi movement began, he visited me at the first opportunity,\" Gusmao recalled. \"It was a very emotional meeting, and I thanked him for the support he had given to our people. He then came frequently and we usually discussed the evolution of the democratic struggle in Indonesia. He encouraged us in our struggle. East Timor owes a lot to him.\"\nThe Timorese leader's Australian wife, Kirsty Sword, also knew Princen from her work with the Timorese underground after 1990. \"I can still remember him telling me the story of how he came to be in Indonesia. He told how the Indonesians proudly refused to hand him over to the Dutch during the early years of Sukarno,\" she recalled.\n\"He said 'Soeharto would be glad to hand me over today'. He was almost alone in taking up the cause of East Timor in Indonesia. Despite being a vocal critic, he had enormous respect in Indonesia, and was considered almost untouchable.\"\nNote: For those who would like to fax \"the powers that be\" - CallCenter is a Native 32-bit Voice Telephony software application integrated with fax and data communications... and it's free of charge!

Usually he works from Monday to Friday in his office for educational foundation in Japan, Miyagy prefecture.\nBut in 1986, he started to support East Timor Independence struggle through two projects. One was the mountain project, to support Falintil fighters in the jungle. In this regard Pe. Sato Group helped the resistance Army by providing some logistics and money as well as communication equipment.\nSecond was to support East Timorese national identity. It’s Tetun language, as well as to support local languages. During that time The Michio Takahachi Group also supported the Tetun Schools in Darwin,\nAustralia and Portugal.\n“My main philosophy or my main concept is same as the Falintil fighter’s spirit, namely ‘Patria e Povu.’ ”\nMichio explained the history of how his nom de guerre of “Pe. Sato” came to be. At the time he started supporting the independence struggle in 1986, Japanese citizens could not enter East Timor. This was especially so if the purpose was to support the independence struggle, then the solidarity movement member could not enter East Timor and make contact with either the freedom fighters in the jungle or in the clandestine resistance front. So he changed his name and chose “Sato”, which is a very common family name in Japan. Despite not being Christian he also chose to use “Padre” (which means Priest) and so began to call “myself Padre Sato.”\nThis was done to confuse the Indonesian Intelligence as he went about supporting the Mountain Project and school projects. His main effort with the mountain project was to send assistance into East Timor for leaders like Konis Santana, Taur Matan Ruak, David Alex and Lere Anan Timur. Pe. Sato was one of the main and biggest donors for Falintil during the 1990’s. He helped Falintil with satellite phones, medicines and logistics, including some financial support under the guise of being for “toys and forestry.”\nAfter East Timor voted against the Indonesian Pro Autonomy package he came to East Timor on December 1999 and stayed till January 2000.\n“So our NGO set up here in January 1st, 2000. We set up TNCC (Timor\nLoro Sa’e Nippon Culture Centre). Our NGO has the same concept of\n“Patria e Povu,” as did FALINTIL. So we want to support the grassroots people especially in the countryside.”\n“It is my pleasure to continue our contact and communication with East\nTimorese grassroots people and keep working on our small projects such as local languages and national language of tetun.\n“Second to continue to support educational aspects by providing a small TNCC scholarship fund, as well as set up TNCC’s Bibliotheca (Library) in Iliomar, which provides books for the children.”\nOn the other side TNCC start up the agriculture projects and natural energy projects. “Now we are starting from biogas and in the future we want to change into solar power, because East Timor has so much sunshine. So bio gas system and solar power system is very good for east Timor. So we continue supporting the grassroots people especially to keep alive and strengthen the spirit of ‘Patria e Povo’.”\nDespite the very large contribution that Padre Sato has made to many people in this country; he has not had any recognition by the country’s new millennium leaders. Nor does or will Michio claim any favoritism from Timorese leaders.\nPe. Sato has not even thought about anything in any return from the\nTimorese, not even any medal or other honor for his contribution to\nhe country’s independence.\nAs he explains, “I started to support your country’s struggle for independence and continued to help the grassroots people, for one important reason. I think of the Second World War, when our father and grandfather’s generations invaded Asian countries including the island of Timor. So as a Japanese citizen I want to compensate for the wrongs committed by my father and grandfather’s generations. For me, I don’t want any thing. I am one Japanese citizen who has warm heart to all Asian countries, especially to East Timorese grassroots people. This is very important for me. So I want to continue my small work.”\nIn a free East Timor Michio Takahachi has dedicated his support to developing East Timorese national identity. Timor Nippon Cultures\nCentre is to perpetuate and develop East Timorese Languages.\nTheir activities are not only to develop Tetun Terik and Tetun Praca but TNCC also helps other local languages. TNCC have produced several dictionaries on the Fataluku language, Makasa’e Language, Makalero Language, Naueti language, Makua language, Tokodede language, Wai Maa and others.\nThere are more than eight or nine languages for which dictionaries have been produced. “We have published the Fataluku and Fataluku dictionary. We also have another type dictionary of Fataluku, tetun and English dictionary. The third we published the traditional four line poems like Fataluku poems, Makasa’e poems and Makalero poems. Since independence we have published many books. There are about 50 books on the national and local languages” he explained.\nMichio Takahachi has helped to set up different community groups and he travels to Timor-Leste twice a year. “We go to the countryside looking for those who can write the local language dictionaries, to make contact periodically, every six months.”\n“I have been visiting East Timor since December 1999. So every year I come here in January and stay until February and then return in July staying until August. Periodically I visit the local people for continuation of Fataluku Project, Makasa’e Projects and so on,” he added.\nMichio Takahachi has spent his youth struggling for East Timor struggle but he is still not tired, and has much he can yet help the independent Republic Democratic East Timor with.\n“I am very happy to come to your country East Timor and the contact I have with the people in the countryside. And also in your countryside there is very beautiful landscape, and I have contact with the beautiful sea, beautiful countryside landscape and my periodical meetings with my friends, which strengthens me personally.”\nThe 71 year old was best friends with Falintil commanders David Alex\nand Konis Santana, who have been forgotten by some of the this country’s post independence leaders, still looks very strong physically and determined to continue to support the East Timorese people.\n“Now I am already 71 years old but I do not feel like it, I feel like I am a 17 year old man. I want to continue to support your country especially to those in the countryside or grassroots people. “\nApart from the community projects Pe. Sato also set up small solidarity loans to groups of Timorese agricultural workers. “We say there are two types of agriculture. The USA’s style, which uses the big tractors and uses chemical fertilizers. For us we choose the traditional system, recycle, natural and organic agriculture. It’s very good for natural organic food and its safe to consume by humans.”\nPadre Sato acknowledges the rapid movement in this country towards the use of modern technological equipment and fertilizers to increase the agriculture’s production. “But we must think about food safety problems. If we use the big tractors and use chemical fertilizers to grow our food, it’s very dangerous to human health.”\nHe continues explain that, “now in the world, including in Japan they say that natural farming or use organic farming to produce safety organic foods. Of course there is dramatic changes occurring in East Timor with the arrival of new agriculture methods. But if we go to the countryside many East Timorese farmers are now doing the work with very simple and traditional farming still exist. So I think to keep alive this traditional agriculture farming and to keep environment as well as to maintain and develop the recycle system of agriculture is very important.”\nPe. Sato expects that the biogas projects they are funding will help\nto strengthen the traditional agriculture system.\nAfter accomplishing the first task of getting the country freedom from\nIndonesia, Pe. Sato still wants to keep helping the Timorese community by delivering some small solidarity loans to Timorese farmer groups in the countryside.\n“We started this agriculture and natural energy projects after the 2006 crisis. Because TNCC began to think of why East Timor repeated the cycle of violence after Timor’s Independence.”\n“I think the basic problem is that 80% of East Timor’s population work as farmers. So it’s very important to develop the country’s grassroots living conditions. In my point of view there are two types of agriculture.”\n“First is towards USA which uses chemical fertilizer and working with big tractor machine, also using genetically modified crops. But in my point of view East Timor’s countryside is made up of very small family gatherings. We want to support this present family based system to keep the traditional, organic and recycle agriculture system.”\nDuring his 34th visit in January-February 2011, Padre Sato to East Timor for TNCC’s work since 2000, Michio Takahachi went to Fatu Besi together with his vice president, accompanied by Mrs. Ular and set up the TNCC Ermera Agriculture Pilot Farm to commemorate Kiijima Machamichi and commandant Ular’s lives.\n“This time I go to Fatu Besi in Ermera district with TNCC vice President to set up one TNCC agriculture project in Fatubesi. This is special one because TNCC Agriculture Ermera pilot farm is to commemorate the lives of the late commandant Ular and Machamichi Kiijima.”\n“So we name this project with TAEPF-KU. K means Kiijima Machamichi the teacher of the current Prime Minister of Japan Mr. Naoto Khan.”\n“Mr.Kiijima is the one who is attributed with educating Mr. Naoto Khan to be a good politician.”\n“Another reason is Mr. Kiijima came to East Timor during World War II. He used to be an accountant for the Japanese Military. During his time in East Timor the Japanese military general sent him to Fatubesi village. But Kiijima didn’t bring any weapons with him to Fatu Besi. When he arrived in Fatu Besi, Kiijima held parties and would dance and sing with the people from Fatu Besi village, sleeping under the coconut tree. The chief of Fatu Besi at the time gained great respect towards Mr.Kiijima, so name him TUAN BOOT. The head of the village wanted Mr. Kiijima to marry his daughter but Kiijima refused.”\n“After World War II Machamichi Kiijima became a leader of the Japanese Socialist Party. Machamichi Kiijima initiated the solidarity movement to support Independence struggle of East Timor. So Pe Sato joined this nation wide movement.”\nMachamichi Kiijima’s dream was to return to East Timor especially to visit Fatu Besi village, because of the strong impression that was left with him of the kindness of the Fatu Besi people. But unfortunately Machamichi Kiijima passed away two years ago.\nPadre Sato said, “Last year I met with Commandant Ular to arrange to go together to Fatu Besi to set up the TNCC Agriculture pilot farm to honor Machamichi Kiijima. But again, two days before we went to Ermera Commandant Ular passed away after a heart attack. So TNCC went to talk with Mrs. Ular to ask her to go with us to Fatu Besi to set up TNCC agriculture pilot farm to commemorate the lives of the late Commandant Ular and Machamichi Kiijima.”\nTNCC always give solidarity loan to these Timorese groups to fund their activities.\n“We gave them (the farmers) what we call our solidarity loan. We started by giving them only US$500. We will continue every six months to keep adding to the solidarity loan. So the group will get a total of US$5,000.00 in the end.”\nPe Sato’s solidarity loan has three principles. “We never ask for a mortgage, second we never ask for interest and third we never ask for refunds. We would like to see these agricultural workers to succeed so five years later they can transfer the money to the second group to set up.”\nPe. Sato has set up another Agriculture project in Betano. In 2007 his group invited two farmers from Same and Betano to go to Japan for training. In 2008 they gave the same training for two others from Lautem districts and in 2009 they did the same for other two farmers from Viqueque.\n“We want to support this area so we have started set up TNCC pilot funds in about ten points. We started this agriculture project and on the other hand also started natural energy project. When I come to East Timor and look at the mountains I notice that many trees were cut down. I am worried that East Timor is starting to lose its very important tropical forests. This is a very big problem because we will lose the water and it may cost a lot to the global warming.”\nBy having good relations with the people from Same, Viqueque, Lautem and other districts TNCC dream to protect and preserve East Timor environment.\n“We want to protect the tropical forest of this country and that means that it is better not to cut the trees. But after the independence the\nEast Timorese population is increasing and now over one million people. These people need cooking firewood. So we just started one biogas project. Now we have started in Watulari a pilot project.”\n“In Watulari there is one TNCC agriculture Watulari pilot fund so namely TAUP and in June last years we set up a bio gas pilot project which we are cooperate with an NGO in East Timor name BEACOM and Avelino Coelho, the Secretary State for Energy Policy who is in charge this area.”\n“Through these types of cooperation we could use the waste from the cows, which mixes with 50% water to in a case, which produce the gas.\nThis black gas is use for cooking purposes. In Watulari case we use two cows’ output which every day produce the gas for cooking duration of six hours per day.”\n“This is enough to cook for breakfast, lunch and cooked dinner. And of course we can use for snack time to boil waters for coffee or tea and so on. Other good side is the farmers can produce the liquid organic fertilizer. These are very good for rapidly growing the vegetable.”\n“If we set up this type of Bio Gas System all around East Timor’s farmers house will help the East Timorese people not to cut the trees for cooking purposes so we are protecting the tropical forest means its good for the environment and we also help keep the original water spring.”\nHe Explain, “TNCC jointly with Timorese Government has set up a biogas pilot project in Watulari and TNCC wants to set up the bio gas system at all their TNCC pilot farmer’s points. TNCC have helped ten agriculture project points around the country. “For these ten we may do it with the support financially from us. But for the future we need more places to set up biogas all over East Timor.”\n“These days we in Japan have three step plans. The first step we want to make a one pilot biogas case in japan. We are using the Japanese very high plastics and technics. In this case TNCC wants to ask the Japanese government to support $30 million Japanese yen as budget for this first step. If the Japanese Government supports this first step project then we will move to the second step. In this step we will bring this Japanese pilot case to East Timor and to help mainly to reproduce it in East Timor factory so we can set up the biogas system for many farmers all over East Timor.”\n“Of course this is need very big funding. If we start the second step we would like to ask the Japanese government as a national project for support the East Timor biogas national project. If this projects successful which support by the Japanese government and cooperate with East Timor Government means we step into the third step means East Timor become one of the top ranking of make recycle system to produce natural energy and organic liquid fertilizer.”\n“East Timor may become a pioneer in this area and could get support from other countries in the world including Japanese government to establish this project in the tropical areas such as African countries, Asian and Latin America. This is very good change to keep the global environment and to protect the tropical areas in the world. This dream. Of course in this process we will face many difficulties but TNCC and I want to appeal to the world to support this very important project.”\nPadre Sato appealed to all Timorese leaders, most of whom he knows personally saying; “I hope all East Timorese top leaders not to forget the hard time during their struggle for the independence. They all know that many grassroots people supported the independence struggle.\nSo I appeal to them to keep the alive the ‘Patria e Povo’ spirit so all top leaders of East Timor to continue dedicate and concentrate their efforts on improving the living conditions of our grassroots people. And of course TNCC do our best corporate with them.” (TS)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f9a0b695-cb3a-4fbd-af94-3237eff14a39>","<urn:uuid:c00d580f-9bf3-4853-90aa-346f328b0da7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do impound/escrow accounts work in mortgages?","answer":"An impound/escrow account is set up by a lender to hold funds for property taxes and insurance payments. In addition to your principal and interest payment, you may choose or be required to put extra funds monthly into this account. The lender holds these funds and makes payments for property taxes and mortgage and hazard insurance when they are due.","context":["- What are the various closing costs involved in a mortgage transaction?\nClosing costs can be divided into 3 main categories:\nYou will be provided with an estimate of your closing costs soon after your application has been received. These estimates may change if your loan program or loan amount changes.\n- Lender fees. Fees paid to the lender for the processing of your loan, such as discount points and origination and application fees.\n- Third-party fees. Fees paid for services rendered by parties other than the lender, such as title insurance, flood determination and recording fees.\n- Prepaid costs. Costs that are collected at the time of closing for items such as prepaid or per diem interest, property taxes and hazard insurance.\n- How much home can I comfortably afford?\nThe amount of home you can afford is based on the amount of mortgage loan you can comfortably support. Generally, the amount of mortgage you qualify for is based on 3 factors:\n- Your monthly payments as a percentage of income.\n- How much cash you have for the down payment and closing costs.\n- Your credit history.\n- What types of mortgages are available?\nThere are many types of mortgages available, including mortgages that could be a good fit for first time homebuyers, homebuyers who need a low down payment and buyers who need very large loan amounts.\nThe most general concepts for types of loans are as follows:\nFixed-rate mortgage. You pay the same interest rate and same monthly payment of principal and interest for the duration of the mortgage. The most common terms are 30, 20 and 15 years. Fixed-rate mortgages are best if you plan on being in your home for many years.\nAdjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). The interest rate stays fixed for an initial interest rate period, which typically ranges from 3 to 10 years. After that, the rate and monthly payment will adjust up or down annually for the life of the loan based on a specified index. An ARM is a good option if you believe interest rates will go down over the next few years or if you plan on staying in your home for just a few years. Due to the potential for significant monthly payment increases, borrowers should carefully consider their ability to comfortably handle increases due if interest rates rise.\nCombination loan. “Combination loans” refer to taking out two loans at the same time; a 'first lien' mortgage and a ‘second lien’ home equity loan or home equity line of credit. Taking out two loans may help you avoid the higher rates of a jumbo first mortgage when paired with a conforming first mortgage. Combination loans may allow you to build equity faster and/or lower your total monthly payment.\nAffordable housing programs. I can assist in offering you information about affordable housing assistance programs in which we participate that can help with down payment and/or closing costs for qualified low-to moderate -income home buyers.\n- What are the benefits of a 15-year mortgage?\nA 15-year mortgage allows you to own your home in half the time of a conventional 30-year mortgage. Although payments are higher with a 15-year mortgage, you'll save a considerable amount of money in interest over the life of your loan and build equity faster.\n- What are the tax advantages of owning a home?\nIn most cases, the mortgage interest (and property tax) may be itemized and deducted from your taxable income, lowering your overall tax bill. This can make your after-tax cost of homeownership lower than renting. Please consult your tax advisor regarding interest deductibility.\n- Should I get prequalified for a mortgage before I shop for a home?\nGetting prequalified for your mortgage is an important step before you shop for a home. It tells you how much home you can buy and makes applying for your mortgage easier.Footnote 1\nAfter completing your online Mortgage Prequalification Request, you simply follow up by phone with a mortgage loan officer to complete the prequalification process.\nPre-qualification is neither pre-approval nor a commitment to lend; you must submit additional information for review and approval.\n- Can I complete a prequalification form I've already started?\nNo. You won't be able to return to an incomplete prequalification form.\n- What’s an impound/escrow account?\nAn impound/escrow account is an account set up by a lender to hold funds that are set aside for the payment of property taxes and insurance. In addition to the principal and interest payment on your mortgage loan, you may elect—or be required—to put aside additional funds each month in an impound/escrow account to pay for property taxes and mortgage and hazard insurance. The lender holds the money in an impound/escrow account and makes the payments from the account when they are due.\n- After I get a new mortgage, can I access my account information online?\nYes, it's easy with Bank of America Online Banking. You can review your current principal balance and interest rate, payment amount and due date, 24 months of loan activity and more.\n- Can I pay my mortgage online?\nIf you are a current Bank of America customer who uses Online Banking, you can make your mortgage payment through Bill Pay. With Bill Pay, you can set up recurring payments so your regular payments are automatically paid when you want. You can also make immediate transfers between your Bank of America mortgage account and other Bank of America accounts that are linked to it.\n- When will I receive my year-end statement of interest paid for tax purposes?\nYear-end interest-paid statements (IRS Form 1098) are mailed out by the end of January. Contact us if you do not receive it by February 15. You may also be able to access a copy of your IRS Form 1098 by going to the Account Details tab for your mortgage account in Online Banking.\n- What is Bank of America's Clarity Commitment® Document?\nWe believe getting your home loan from a lender you trust is important. That's why you'll appreciate how clearly the Clarity Commitment® document is written.\n- It serves as a simple, one page summary of key terms of your mortgage.\n- Details are in easy-to-understand language, so you know what you're getting.\nThe Clarity Commitment® summary is provided as a convenience, does not serve as a substitute for a borrower's actual loan documents, and is not a commitment to lend.

{"question":"What are the primary differences between smooth and textured tennis strings in terms of their construction and purpose?","answer":"Smooth strings have little or no surface texture, bumps, or ridges, with uniformly sized filaments and a round cross section. In contrast, textured strings are designed with purposely stippled, grooved, or striated coatings, or with outer filaments of slightly different sizes to give more bite to the ball for developing more spin.

The strings are designed to meet different requirements and playing properties. All strings exhibit power, control, comfort and durability properties, but each individual string has a different mix of these properties - our string details pages give you an indication of these relative properties. The way strings behave when hit by a tennis ball is very scientific - see the USRSA web site for more information.\nThere are several characteristics of all strings and a restring:\nMonofilament strings are made of a single, solid extrusion of material. Originally this was nylon but, these days, the material used is one of the fastest developing sectors in the string industry.\nMaterials now consist of polyester or polyether or a mixture of different materials. The advantage of monofilaments is their enhanced durability. Originally, this came with the price of a very unforgiving string, but there are now more and more 'soft' monofilaments coming onto the market which give the strings more playability.\nA further recent development is to make the extrusion non-circular to give so-called 'corners' on the string with the aim of helping with spin, such as Babolat's Pro Hurricane Tour.\nMonofilaments are often part of a hybrid string set-up with the monofilament used in the main strings and a softer non-monofilament string used in the cross strings. This gives a good compromise between durability and playability. Chronic string breakers often resort to monofilaments in both mains and crosses.\nIf any arm problems develop, the use of monofilaments should be stopped until the problems are sorted out. Monofilaments generally transfer more shock down the racket into the handle than a softer, multifilament string.\nMultifilament strings have no centre core, but are made up of hundreds or thousands of strands of material twisted together, usually with an outer coat for added protection. Typically, aging of multifilament strings exhibit a 'furry' nature to the strings as the outer coat wears and the individual fibres break.\nMultifilaments are the closest to natural gut and offer the best comfort to people suffering from tennis elbow or other arm problems. They offer great playability and shock absorption and many of the premium multifilament strings are getting closer and closer to natural gut. One drawback is their tendency to lose tension faster than a string with a solid centre core. Pre-stretching the string before stringing can help reduce this tension loss.\nMultifilaments often tend to be more expensive, but a cheaper alternative to natural gut.\nSolid Core with Single Wrap\nAs its title suggests, this string construction consists of a thin monofilament core with a single layer of fibres twisted around the outside. This, in turn, is usually coated on the outside for protection. This construction is used in many of the budget nylon strings.\nThe centre, solid core, gives the string durability, whilst the single wrap outer gives the string more playability than a standard monofilament.\nSolid Core with Double Wrap\nAs its title suggests, this string construction consists of a monofilament core with a two layers of fibres twisted around the outside, usually wound in different directions. This is also usually coated on the outside for protection.\nThe centre, solid core, gives the string durability although this is usually thinner than the single wrapped version. The two wraps give the string more playability than either a monofilament or a single wrapped string.\nMulticore with Wrap\nMany of the latest strings on the market are making use of complex multicores using a variety of different fibres in each core. The millions of small fibres give enhanced playability and elasticity.\nSome of the fibres used in the multicore bundles are made of stronger polyester to enhance durability.\nHybrid strings consist of two different types of string - one for the main strings and one for the cross strings. Whilst any two different strings can be used, there are a growing number of string 'half sets' being sold as hybrids.\nThe most common set up is to use a monofilament string in the mains and a softer, often multifilament string in the crosses. This gives durability in the mains - the strings which take the greatest pounding when using top spin, whilst still giving some playability. The notable exception to this set up is Roger Federer who uses gut in the mains and a monofilament in the crosses - but that won't last long if you have heavy top spin!\nHybrid stringing is good for performance juniors as they start to break strings. The enhanced durability gives longer between string breakages, but the softer crosses reduce the amount of shock and helps protect young muscles!\nIf any arm problems start to develop, the use of monofilament strings should be stopped until the problem is sorted out.\nBefore the advent of nylons and man-made fibres, natural gut was the only string available. Today, it has still not been matched for its playability and particular power and feel qualities - although many of the premium multifilament's are getting closer.\nGut strings are made from cows or sheep (and not cats as some people believe!). There are only a few factories left in the world - the only UK factory is Bow Brand in King's Lynn.\nThe price for natural gut is prohibitive for many and although they tend to have a weatherproof coating these days, poor weather conditions reduce the life of a gut string.\nTextured strings are designed to give more bite to the ball to help develop more spin. The strings tend to have a solid core with a number of uniform wraps. On top of this is added another wrap wound around the outside to give a rough feel to the string.\nTextured strings are often used in a hybrid set up to compensate for the smooth surface of the monofilament\nStrings are measured by their diameter when under tension - usually in millimetres. Two systems of gauge labelling are used - the US system and the International system. The table below gives an indication of the relationship between these systems - however, be aware that some manufacturers will label their strings slightly outside these guidelines! All references to gauge on this site refer to manufacturer's specifications.\nWhilst everyone talks about string tension, the important measure is string bed stiffness. This is a measure of how tight (or loose) the strings feel in the racket. Stringing two different rackets at the same tension with the same string will result in two different string bed stiffness measures - and will play differently. There are a number of factors which influence string bed stiffness:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f6534ffd-1c6d-47f3-b6f9-0e7540540ffc>","<urn:uuid:3c9f170a-1392-4a28-9cc3-d109762f36b6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a paleontology student studying bone damage patterns. How can you distinguish between bite marks and other types of marks on fossils?","answer":"While bite marks are common on fossils, not all traces on bones are feeding marks. For example, trample marks can occur when bones are pressed into the ground, with sand and gravel scoring the bone surface in ways that mimic bite marks or human tool marks. Other types of marks can come from combat injuries, such as horn damage in Triceratops or head-butting damage in pachycephalosaur dinosaurs. Even claw marks are possible - contrary to expectations, experiments have shown that animal claws can leave prominent marks on bones, despite being covered in relatively soft keratin.","context":["After a long journey through the millennia, fossils inevitably arrive in the present as damaged goods. Bacteria, scavengers, erosion, wind, rain, and even sunlight conspire to destroy the remains of previously living organisms. Although this loss of information is a bad thing for understanding many aspects of a long-gone organism, some post mortem adventures actually add data to the fossil record. A whole subfield of paleontology–taphonomy–focuses on this very topic.\nSome of my favorite taphonomic artifacts are feeding traces–particularly the bite marks left behind by carnivorous animals. These traces tell us who fed on whom, and how they did so. Spend some time with fossil bones, and you are quite likely to run across these bite marks. For instance, a recent study in PLOS ONE documented croc bite marks on juvenile dinosaur bones, with one croc even leaving a tooth embedded in the bone. These kinds of fossils help paleontologists reconstruct the long-vanished food webs of prehistoric ecosystems.\nBecause bite marks are so common, it’s easy to get in a rut and assume that all traces on bone result from bite marks. One great counterexample is trample marks–if a bone is pressed into the ground, sand and gravel can score the bone surface, mimicking bite marks or even human tool marks. Several colleagues and I also hypothesized that Triceratops may have injured each other with their horns, and Joe Peterson and colleagues inferred head-butting damage in the skulls of pachycephalosaur dinosaurs. A new study in PLOS ONE comes up with an even more interesting possibility–claw marks.\nClaws–whether they are in birds, tyrannosaurs, or tigers–are covered by a keratinous sheath, pretty much equivalent to our fingernails. We all know that this keratin is fairly soft, particularly relative to bone. (If you’re a meat-eater, try to scratch the bony surface of that t-bone or pork chop next time you throw one on the grill) So, you really wouldn’t expect to see claw marks in the fossil record. To investigate this assumption, Bruce Rothschild and colleagues set up a nifty experiment.\nRather than try to simulate claw damage in the laboratory, Rothschild and colleagues went straight to the source–a real, live tiger. Conveniently, zoos strive to give their animals a variety of boredom-alleviating enrichment activities. These can be a simple puzzle with a piece of food inside, or a ball to bat around, or in this case, a scientific experiment. The researchers devised a simple but effective contraption–a beef bone bolted into a piece of wood, inset so that sharp tiger teeth couldn’t get to it. If anything was going to mark the bone, it had to be the claws. Add the contraption to the tiger enclosure at a local zoo, and see what happens.\nContrary to expectations, the bone was quite prominently marked by tiger claws. These marks showed up at all levels of magnification (see image below).\nSo, this means that paleontologists should probably be on the look-out for claw marks in the fossil record. As noted by Rothschild and colleagues, potential claw damage was previously spotted in monkey carcasses that had been feasted upon by eagles. The next step, of course, will be to see if the signatures of teeth and claws can be adequately distinguished by their traces. It would also be great to repeat the experiment with other kinds of bones and other animals.\nAll in all, this paper presents some pretty cool results. My only “major” quibble concerns part of the abstract, which seemingly refers to the marks as “pathology” (this came up in a recent discussion about the paper with some friends on Facebook). Pathology generally refers to disease processes in living organisms, and “taphonomy” is far more appropriate terminology here. I think the authors may be angling towards distinguishing claw- and tooth-induced injuries that occurred within the lifetime of the animal, but that topic isn’t covered by the paper. That too, presents an interesting question, and is definitely one for future research.\nBoyd CA, Drumheller SK, Gates TA (2013) Crocodyliform Feeding Traces on Juvenile Ornithischian Dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Kaiparowits Formation, Utah.

{"question":"As someone new to both cultures, what's the difference between seating customs at Chinese versus Moroccan dinner tables?","answer":"In Moroccan dining, guests are seated at a knee-high table surrounded by pillows or traditional sofas along the walls, with the honored guest placed directly next to the host. In Chinese dining, seating arrangement is considered the most important part of etiquette - the guest of honor or most senior member must be seated first, and others cannot be seated or begin eating before them. Toasts also follow this hierarchical order, starting from the seat of honor.","context":["As you may already have assumed from previous posts, Moroccan people are extremely hospitable and always ready to lend a hand. It is not uncommon for a new friend to invite you into their home and proudly share a meal with you. While Moroccans are very accepting and eager to welcome foreigners it is very important for that visitor, in this case you, to be familiar with Moroccan social and table etiquette and to respect the customs and traditions that encompass the family dinner table. Social etiquette and table manners are taken quite seriously in Morocco and people are judged on their behavior in public.\nTraditional Moroccan table etiquette has its roots in Islam and these traditions and customs are still adhered to today, even among the youth. If you receive an invitation to a Moroccan home there are a few key behaviors and traditions that should be followed to ensure the proper respect and gratitude is shown to your host.\nWhen invited for dinner at a Moroccan household it is seen as a sign of respect and gratitude to your host to present a small gift of nuts, dates, or flowers with you. Dressing well and taking off your shoes at the door is also a sign of respect and should be followed.\nOnce invited inside, the host will show you to the dinner table, most likely a knee-high table surrounded by pillows or the traditional Moroccan sofas that line the walls of the room. As the honored guest, you will be sat directly next to your host.\nLooking at the table you will notice that there is no silverware, don’t panic! Silverware is not used at Moroccan dinner tables because it is the same material that is used in currencies and is a non-Islamic practice. Instead, Moroccans eat with their right (not left) hands using only their thumb and first two fingers. They also use the famous Moroccan bread as a means to scoop up food and sop up any sauce. As hands are used and cleanliness is very important to Moroccans, a bowl is presented to each guest to wash his/her hands. The host, or member of the household, will pour water over your hands for you; don’t pour the water your self!\nAfter all hands have been washed the food will be presented. Saffron and orange scented couscous, a bubbling tajine full of succulent lamb and roasted vegetables, a large loaf of fresh crusty Moroccan bread – don’t let your stomach get the best of you! It is extremely important to wait until the host has blessed the food and started eating before you dig in!\nAll of the food is presented in communal bowls and each member of the table takes a portion and places it on their plate. Make sure you take food from the part of the bowl nearest to you; don’t reach all the way over the food for that one really yummy looking piece of lamb. As the guest of the meal all of the best cuts of meat will be presented to you anyway, so you won’t have to reach far to get a good piece.\nIt is important to accept and try everything that is offered to you by your host. Even if you just take a nibble. Insisting food upon a guest is a sign of hospitality so don’t feel overwhelmed if they keep telling you to eat more. If you feel you have eaten your weight in food and simply can’t eat another bite take a very small amount from the bowl and take very small bites chewing slowly. It will tell the host that you appreciate their hospitality and respect their food.\nGuests may also be offered souak, or swak, to wash and clean their teeth after the meal. Souak is black walnut dried bark that is whittled into a stick and due to its whitening and antiseptic qualities is used as a natural toothpaste after Moroccan meals.\nAfter all is said and done you can leave your host’s house knowing that you showed the upmost respect and gratitude for the wonderful company and delicious meal.","As a guest at a meal, one should be particular about one’s appearance and determine whether to bring small gifts or good wine, according the degree of relationship with the master of the banquet. It is important to attend and be punctual.\nOn arrival one should first introduce oneself, or let the master of the banquet do the introduction if unknown to others, and then take a seat in accordance with the master of the banquet’s arrangement.\nThe seating arrangement is probably the most important part of Chinese dining etiquette.\nIf the guest of honor or most senior member is not seated, other people are not allowed to be seated. If he hasn’t eaten, others should not begin to eat. When making toasts, the first toast is made from the seat of honor and continuing down the order of prominence.\nWhen eating a meal in China, people are expected to (according to Chinese customs) behave in a civilized manner, pay attention to table manners and practice good dining habits. In order to avoid offense diners should pay attention to the following points:\nLet older people eat first, or if you hear an elder say \"let's eat\", you can start to eat. You should not steal a march on the elders.\nYou should pick up your bowl with your thumb on the mouth of the bowl, first finger, middle finger the third finger supporting the bottom of the bowl and palm empty. If you don’t pick up your bowl, bend over the table, and eat facing your bowl, it will be regarded as bad table manners. Moreover, it will have the consequence of compressing the stomach and restricting digestion.\nMost table manners in China are similar to in the West. Don't be deceived by what you might see in a local restaurant on the streets. Chinese manners don't consist of slurping food down as quickly as possible, and shouting loudly!\nWhen helping yourself to the dishes, you should take food first from the plates in front of you rather than those in the middle of the table or in front of others. It's bad manners to use your chopsticks to burrow through the food and \"dig for treasure\" and keep your eyes glued to the plates.\nWhen finding your favorite dish, you should not gobble it up as quickly as possible or put the plate in front of yourself and proceed to eat like a horse. You should consider others at the table. If there is not much left on a plate and you want to finish it, you should consult others. If they say they don’t want any more, then you can eat proceed.\nYou should try to refill your bowl with rice yourself and take the initiative to fill the bowls of elders with rice and food from the dishes. If elders fill your bowl or add food to your bowl, you should express your thanks.\nConcentrate on the meal and your companions. Watching television, using your phone, or carrying on some other activity while having a meal is considered a bad habit.\nIt is not good manners to pick up too much food at a time. You should behave elegantly. When taking food, don’t nudge or push against your neighbor. Don’t let the food splash or let soup or sauce drip onto the table.\nWhen eating, you should close your mouth to chew food well before you swallow it, which is not only a requirement of etiquette, but also better for digestion. You should by no means open your mouth wide, fill it with large pieces of food and eat up greedily. Don’t put too much food into your mouth at a time to avoid leaving a gluttonous impression. Neither should you stretch your neck, open your mouth wide and extend your tongue to catch food you are lifting to your mouth.\nWhen removing bones or other inedible parts of the meal from your mouth, use chopsticks or a hand to take them and put them on a side plate (or the table) in front of you, instead of spitting them directly onto the table or the ground.\nIf there is food around your mouth, use a tissue or a napkin to wipe it, instead of licking it with your tongue. When chewing food, don’t make noises.\nIt is best not to talk with others with your mouth full. Be temperate in laughing lest you spew your food or the food goes down your windpipe and causes choking. If you need to talk, you should speak little and quietly.\nIf you want to cough or sneeze, use your hand or a handkerchief to cover your mouth and turn away. If you find something unpleasant in your mouth when chewing or phlegm in the throat, you should leave the dinner table to spit it out.\nSome restaurants in China have forks available and all will have spoons. If you are not used to chopsticks, you can ask the restaurant staff to provide you with a fork or spoon."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4379f45-061b-40a8-8258-929e0f66e7c7>","<urn:uuid:0c707193-444d-402d-aaa9-b22e712267a8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was the size of the ECB interest rate hike in October 2022 and what does it mean for the neutral rate range?","answer":"The ECB raised its interest rate by 75 basis points to 1.5% at the October meeting, which brought the policy rate within the estimated neutral rate range for the euro area of 1.25% to 2.0%.","context":["The central bank noted that substantial progress has been made in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation, and expressed concerns around growth and policy transmission lags.\nBy Konstantin Veit, Portfolio Manager at PIMCO\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) raised its interest rate by another 75 basis points (bps) to 1.5% at the October meeting, bringing its policy rate now within the band of most estimates for a neutral configuration for the euro area, namely 1.25% to 2.0%.\nWith an expected 50-bp rise to follow in December, we believe the ECB will likely transition towards moving in more conventional 25-bp increments next year, as the hiking cycle pivots from policy normalisation to policy tightening and with inflationary pressures expected to gradually subside.\nA peak policy rate of 2.7% now priced in by the market looks reasonable given current information, the large uncertainty around inflation dynamics, and relative to other major developed market jurisdictions such as the U.K. or U.S.\nAny measure taken by the ECB to better control money market rates and preserve the monetary policy transmission mechanism will likely result in easing core government bond richness, and help restore a more balanced relationship between European interest rate swaps and core government bond market pricing.\nQuantitative tightening will come into sharper relief towards the end of the year. This will require careful calibration, as the ECB will want to avoid a situation such as that recently experienced in the U.K., where the Bank of England intended to reduce bond holdings for monetary policy purposes but acquired bonds on financial stability grounds instead.\nWhat about interest rates?\nECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated at the press conference following the meeting that there are more rate hikes to come, and that the ECB currently doesn’t have a strong view about the end point of the interest rate journey. It remains firmly in meeting-by-meeting mode.\nOn the “dovish” side, the ECB noted that “substantial progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation” has now been made, and expressed more concerns around growth and policy transmission lags than at previous monetary policy meetings.\nThe market took note, immediately pricing out one expected 25-bp rate hike as a result of the somewhat softer language – bringing peak policy rate expectations down from the pre-meeting level of around 2.95%.\nWhat about the balance sheet?\nWe believe the ECB will make a decision on reinvesting the proceeds from its asset purchase program (APP) as soon as the December monetary policy meeting (President Lagarde mentioned that APP reinvestments were discussed at a meeting on 5 October). She also said that the ECB plans to share balance sheet reduction principles at its upcoming December meeting.\nAPP redemptions of public sector holdings are estimated to average around €22 billion per month from September 2022 until September 2023. We expect some form of passive APP run-off starting in the first quarter of next year, implying an annual reduction of around €250 billion of public sector securities in case of a hard stop to APP reinvestments. For reference, the ECB balance sheet currently stands at around €8.8 trillion. Relatedly, a run-off of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) would see the ECB balance sheet shrink by around 24% by the end of 2024.\nThe ECB continued to indicate that its focus remains on normalising interest rates and less on reducing the sizeable stock of bond holdings accumulated during the seven years of quantitative easing since 2015.\nWhat about policy transmission?\nThe ECB decided to change the TLTRO terms to create incentives for banks to repay part of their TLTRO borrowings early, particularly money taken purely for arbitrage. Repayments of money taken for arbitrage should have little implication for markets, as these funds have been sitting idle at national central banks and have never circulated in money markets.\nIn addition, the ECB didn’t change the excess reserve remunerations for banks, and will continue to remunerate all excess reserves at the deposit facility rate. This should help alleviate fears of banks chasing already scarce high quality short-term paper or passing through ECB policy rate changes to an insufficient extent.\nMinimum reserves will be remunerated at the deposit facility rate instead of the main refinancing (MRO) rate, but we don’t see any implications for short-duration assets off the back of that decision – it simply aligns ECB practice with the Fed.\nNevertheless, normalizing policy rates in the context of large excess liquidity and collateral scarcity risks impairing monetary policy transmission further. Hence we expect the ECB to continue to explore options to better control money market rates, potentially along the lines of the Fed’s reverse repo facility.\nMedium-term options include a new secured or unsecured vehicle available to market participants without access to the ECB’s deposit facility, or large-scale issuance of very short-term ECB debt certificates. President Lagarde referred to collateral scarcity today as “a sensitive issue” and conceded that early TLTRO repayments will not be the panacea to fix all problems on the collateral scarcity front."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:82007226-6470-4a6e-8a50-c00de29ed995>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What does proper boating maintenance involve, and what essential safety equipment is required by law?","answer":"Proper boating maintenance involves regularly running all equipment including engines, generators, pumps, systems, and appliances. Vessels need regular maintenance from an annual basis down to every few weeks, even during winter. Just running the equipment is some of the best maintenance possible. As for legal safety requirements, all boats must have U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets for everyone aboard, a sounding device (horn, whistle, or bell), a white navigation light for low visibility, and nighttime visual distress signals on federal waterways. Depending on boat length and type, additional requirements may include boat registration, registration decals, Boater Education Card for motors 15+ horsepower, throwable flotation device, fire extinguisher, and carbon monoxide warning sticker.","context":["How much is your boating experience worth to you? When it comes to boating, it’s not just how much money you paid for your boat or how much you spend in maintenance. It’s also the time you take to plan and prepare your vessel and the time and effort you put into the decisions you make. As a motoryacht delivery captain, I have a big stake in the investment you make as well. Mostly, in how well you keep your vessel maintained. Before each delivery, I also invest large amounts of time into planning, watching for, and picking the right weather.\nThe preparation and decisions I make directly affect the quality of my delivery experience and yours as the client as well. Whether your journey takes you up the inside passage to Alaska or to Roche Harbor in the San Juans, across the Pacific to Hawaii or down the West Coast to Mexico, or to Gig Harbor for the weekend or to downtown Kirkland in Lake Washington for dinner, there are four fundamentals that will affect the quality of your boating experience.\nMaintenance. How many of you have come down to your boats for the weekend only to spend most of that time fixing things that are not working? One of the best examples of this was a story I heard from a good friend, fellow captain, boat owner, and the owner of a yacht maintenance business. He told me of a gentleman a few years ago who kept his boat at his dock behind his home. This motoryacht had sat for several months over the winter with little to no attention. One late spring weekend, he plans a short family trip over a long weekend. They provision and load the boat for their departure. He goes to start the engines and there is nothing but silence. All the batteries were dead.\nWhat kind of boating experience did this gentleman and his family just have? How many of you have experienced something similar? Had he at the very least gone down to his boat every two weeks or so, started the engines, gensets, run the systems, checked to ensure that the chargers were on, etc., he would have known of any issues that would have precluded his plans. Just the act of running your equipment is some of the best maintenance you can perform. Not to mention the regular maintenance that needs to be performed and kept up to date to ensure a safe and reliable vessel.\nEvery engine, generator, pump, system, appliance, and piece of equipment needs to be turned on and run on a regular basis. There is regular maintenance that needs to be performed from an annual basis down to every few weeks. The maintenance of your vessel does not stop with the last trip of the season. The maintenance of your vessel continues through the winter right up to the start of the next season.\nMany boat owners know very little about how the systems and equipment on their vessel actually works. Take an active role in the maintenance and repair of your vessel. Take the time to learn its systems and operation. Proper maintenance of your vessel is the foundation upon which you build your boating experience.\nTrip Planning. Planning your trip is much more than just deciding where you will go and what you will bring for groceries. A good trip plan starts with ensuring your vessel is properly maintained and ready to make the trip. But that is merely the foundation upon which you build the rest.\nA good trip plan is a checklist of anything and everything that has to do with your boat, where you are going, the route you are taking. It covers everything you need to bring, everyone onboard, and everything they will need to bring with them. It includes everything: distances, vessel documents, food, fuel, spare parts, weather forecasts, and flotation devices.\nDecision Making. Long ago, I lost track of how many horror stories I had heard from boaters about their experiences. Out of all those stories, most have to do with the weather. Not that the weather and or sea conditions were necessarily bad, but the bad decisions that were made surrounding those conditions.\nEverything we do is a decision. Does this feel right? Listening to that inner feeling is how we make good decisions. As a pilot and as a delivery captain, I make difficult decisions all the time that relate directly to the vessel and the people on board that I am responsible for, especially when it comes to the weather. There have been countless times that even though the forecast may look ok on paper, my inner feeling told me otherwise. Despite being criticized by boat owners and captains alike, my inner intuition has never steered me wrong.\nYour job as the master of your vessel is to be safe and prudent. There is nothing more important to the quality of your boating experience than making good decisions. Do not be afraid to say no.\nTrip Execution. When it comes time to leave the dock and start your trip, what is the very first decision you make? The first decision you make is whether to go in the first place. It is called the go/no-go decision. In aviation, every pilot before committing his or her aircraft to the sky makes this decision. It is based on the departure, en route, and arrival weather conditions. In practice, this should be no different for any mariner preparing to leave the dock.\nFor several days and each day before your anticipated departure, the marine weather forecast should be checked. The forecast for your departure, route to be taken, and destination needs to be watched. You are looking for a set of consistent wind and sea conditions for your anticipated time of departure and route for your trip. What are your weather limits? What kind of wind and sea conditions do you consider safe for your vessel and for the people on board?\nWhen that time of departure arrives, you must make that decision to go or not to go. Is it safe and prudent to leave the dock and start my trip? Your boating experiences starts with this decision. Make it a good one.\nTrip execution is where the pieces come together. The foundation of a properly maintained vessel. The building blocks of proper trip planning, good weather and safe, prudent decision making. All these factors help to create that positive boating experience—the very reason why you bought your boat in the first place. Protect that investment with proper maintenance, thorough trip planning, prudent decision making, and safe trip execution.\nNow for me, I need to learn to relax and enjoy more of the destination. Perhaps having fun is a fifth fundamental to an excellent boating trip.","Washington state's diverse waterways of rivers, lakes, bays, inlets and coastal areas require different skills, preparation and safety equipment.\nYou're required by law to carry specific safety equipment. Requirements vary according to size and type of boat or paddlecraft. The legal requirements are minimal and do not maximize your chances of being rescued in a timely manner when an accident happens. You'll need additional equipment to be rescue ready, increase survival time and keep everyone safe.\nPlan accordingly, be prepared and enjoy a lifetime of boating and paddling adventures!\nFederal and Washington state law requires the following on every boat, no matter what size, including kayaks, canoes and stand up paddle boards.\n- Life jackets - U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets, of the right size and type, for everyone on board\n- A sounding device - horn, whistle or bell\n- A white navigation light -during low visibility such as fog, heavy rain, dawn or dusk\n- Nighttime visual distress signal—such as flares (required on federal waterways only)\nDepending on boat length and engine type, state law requires the following:\n- Boat/Vessel registration on board\n- Registration decals and numbers (PDF)—displayed correctly on each side of the boat\n- Washington Boater Education Card—mandatory for boats with motors 15 (or more) horsepower\n- Throwable flotation device\n- Type B-1 fire extinguisher\n- Visual distress signals—day and night time\n- Navigation lights\n- Carbon monoxide warning sticker on boats with motors\nFor a specific list of requirements by boat length and type, review the Washington State required equipment checklist (PDF).\nRemember, these items are basic and won't maximize your chance of survival in an accident. There's additional gear necessary to be rescue ready.\nPRO TIP: The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and U.S. Power Squadron (America's Boating Club) offer free vessel safety checks (VSC). There is no charge, and no consequences if you don't pass. Some will even meet you at your home. Schedule your VSC today! Local city and county marine law enforcement also provide a VSCs, contact them directly.\nThe legal requirements are minimal and do not maximize safety or chances of survival if an accident happens. Be prepared. We recommend the following equipment as essential to safety and survival.\n- Carry two forms of communication (VHF radio, cellphone, flares or distress locator beacon). Keep them on you in\ncase you are separated from your vessel.\n- Bailing system—a bucket, bailer or bilge pump\n- Anchor & rope—appropriate to the size of your vessel and the waterway you're on.\n- First aid kit\n- Sun protection\n- Navigation charts/GPS\n- Tide book\n- Rescue throw bag—to assist rescuing someone overboard.\n- Lifting tackle—equipment to assist hoisting someone back into a boat.\n- Strobe lights—a bright flashing light that floats so you don't lose sight of a person overboard.\n- Extra clothes in a dry bag. Choose synthetic fabrics or wool. Avoid cotton clothes.\n- Ditch bag—in an accident it may be impossible to collect many of these items, so keep them centralized and\naccessible in case you need to abandon ship.\n- Water and snacks—a safe vessel operator is alert at all times. Prevent dehydration and fatigue.\nRemember—you need to know how to use your safety equipment! The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadron, local clubs and outfitters offer boating safety classes. We encourage you to educate yourself and practice safety drills so you are prepared to survive if an accident happens. And they do happen.\nThe following actions are known to be the top reasons for fatalities and accidents on the water.\n- Failure to wear life jackets, especially in small boats\n- Boating under the influence of alcohol and drugs\n- Failure to follow navigation rules\n- Operator inexperience, inattention, unsafe speeds and improper lookout\n- No ability to call for rescue when an accident happens\nMany recreational boaters in Washington are required to complete an approved boating safety education course and carry a Washington State Boater Education Card. All boaters are responsible for knowing the laws and keeping themselves and others safe. Even if carrying a card is not required, you should take a boating safety course to increase your knowledge of boating safety, emergency procedures and navigational rules. Passengers on a boat are encouraged to ask the captain about safety protocols, such as how to turn the boat off or make a Mayday call and where rescue equipment is located and how to use it. Learn more about boater education.\nSchedule a vessel safety check\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and the United States Power Squadrons have certified vessel examiners who will perform a free \"vessel safety check\". The purpose is to ensure a boat meets legal standards and has the necessary equipment for emergencies. These checks are conducted at a boat ramp, dockside or at other pre-determined locations. There is no charge and no consequences for not passing. Rather, you are provided with a written report on how to correct any discrepancies. Boats passing the safety check receive a decal (good for the current calendar year) indicating the boat is in full compliance with federal and state boating laws. Learn more and schedule a vessel safety check by visiting the Coast Guard Auxiliary.\nAlways wear a life jacket\nState law requires all vessels, including canoes, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards, to have at least one properly fitted Coast Guard-approved life jacket for each person onboard. And all children, age 12 and younger are required to wear one at all times. You are encouraged to wear your life jackets every time you go out on the water. Life jackets are now much more sophisticated and comfortable and tailored for specific water activities (PDF). Read more about life jackets.\nBring communication devices\nYou should carry two forms of communication that will work when wet, such as a whistle, waterproof cell phone or VHF marine radio. These devices greatly increase your chances of being located in the event of an emergency. Day and night visible flares, a signal mirror and a whistle or air horn can also aid emergency responders in search efforts. A personal locator beacon (PLB) will instantly notify responders of your location when activated during a distress situation. It is recommended that you research the many options (PDF) and choose appropriately for the type of boating activity.\nAvoid alcohol and marijuana\nDesignate a sober skipper! Boat owners/operators are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of everyone on board. Operating a boat while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is not only unsafe—it's illegal. Washington state's Boating Under the Influence (BUI) law applies to all boats including kayaks, canoes, rowboats and inflatable fishing rafts. Learn more about boating sober.\nUnderstand weather, tides and currents\nCertain conditions can make boating extremely hazardous and weather can change fast. It is a critical smart boating practice for you to check the correct weather forecast and understand what it means for your boating activity. You also need to be prepared if it changes. For example, high wind speeds usually mean choppy waves. The smaller the boat the higher the risk of capsizing. There are five vital checks you need to understand before you head out. Read our Read our weather fact (PDF) to learn more. Checking weather apps on a smartphone doesn't count! Unless it's specifically a marine weather app.\nProject against cold water immersion\nDon't be fooled by warm air temperatures because in Washington many waterways are below 60 degrees all year. Even lakes and rivers. Water under 60 degrees is dangerous if you fall in unexpectedly. It's not hypothermia you need to worry about, there are four stages of cold water immersion. If you survive long enough to get hypothermia, you've done well; most drown at the first stage and in the first few minutes from cold water shock. Take caution and be prepared. Protect yourself by always wearing your life jacket and dress for water immersion. Especially if you're in a boat under 21 feet, like a kayak, rowboat or small fishing boat, which has a higher risk of capsizing. Learn more about cold water shock.\nThe State Parks Boating Program encourages you to have fun as you head out on the water and be smart. There's a lot to learn and we're here to help you!
