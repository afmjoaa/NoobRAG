{"question":"How do the Mediterranean ecosystems of Isola del Giglio and Pianosa differ in terms of vegetation coverage?","answer":"Isola del Giglio is covered 90% by Mediterranean vegetation alternating with large pine forests and numerous vineyards. In contrast, Pianosa's vegetation is more diverse, with three main ecosystem types: macchia (37% of island surface), pasture/cultivated fields (53%), and woodlands. The macchia vegetation forms the largest portion of Pianosa's dry biomass (61%), while pasture/cultivated fields represent 26% and woodlands 13%.","context":["Isola del Giglio\nIsola del Giglio\n|Comune di Isola del Giglio|\nOld Lighthouse on the north of the island\n|Frazioni||Isola di Giannutri, Giglio Castello, Giglio Porto, Giglio Campese|\n|• Mayor||Sergio Ortelli|\n|• Total||23.80 km2 (9.19 sq mi)|\n|Elevation||496 m (1,627 ft)|\n(31 August 2017)\n|• Density||60/km2 (160/sq mi)|\n|Time zone||UTC+1 (CET)|\n|• Summer (DST)||UTC+2 (CEST)|\n58010, 58012, 58013\n|Patron saint||San Mamiliano|\n|Saint day||September 15|\nIsola del Giglio (Italian pronunciation: [ˈiːzola del ˈdʒiʎːo]; English: Giglio Island) is an Italian island and comune situated in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the coast of Tuscany, and is part of the Province of Grosseto. The island is one of seven that form the Tuscan Archipelago, lying within the Arcipelago Toscano National Park. Giglio means \"lily\" in Italian, and though the name would appear consistent with the insignia of Medici Florence, it derives from Aegilium, \"Goat Island\", a Latin transliteration of the Greek word for \"little goat\" (Ancient Greek: Aigýllion, Αιγύλλιον).\nThe island is separated by a 16-kilometre (10 mi) stretch of sea from the nearest point of the mainland, the promontory of Monte Argentario. Mainly mountainous, it consists almost entirely of granite, culminating in the Poggio della Pagana, which rises to 496 metres (1,627 ft). Ninety percent of its surface is covered by Mediterranean vegetation, alternating with large pine forests and numerous vineyards which allow the production of the local \"Ansonaco\" wine. The coast is 27 kilometres (17 mi) long, made up of rocks, smooth cliffs and several bays: Arenella, Cannelle, Caldane and Campese, the biggest one with its small village of the same name.\nThe municipality is composed of the islands of Giglio and Giannutri. Three principal settlements are located on the main island:\n- Giglio Porto (G. Harbour), located on the eastern coastal side and hosts the port. It is divided into the quarters of Chiesa, Moletto and Saraceno.\n- Giglio Castello (G. Castle), located upon a hill between the two other localities and characterized by the majestic walls of a fortress. It is divided into the quarters of Casamatta, Centro, Cisterna and Rocca.\n- Giglio Campese, it is located on the north-western coastal side and is a modern sea resort.\nThe modern island was formed probably 4.5 to 5 million years ago, and has been inhabited since the Stone Age. Later, it was probably an Etruscan military stronghold. Under the Roman dominion, Aegilium Insula or Igillia Insula it was an important base in the Tyrrhenian Sea, and was cited briefly by Julius Caesar in his De Bello Civili, by Pliny, by Pomponius Mela, and by the fifth-century AD poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, who celebrated Igilium's successful repulse of the Getae and safe harbor for Romans, in a time when Igilium's slopes were still wooded.\nIn 805, the island was donated by Charlemagne to the abbey of the Tre Fontane in Rome, and was later successively a possession of the Aldobrandeschi, Pannocchieschi, Caetani, and Orsini families, and of the municipality of Perugia. In 1241, the Sicilian and Pisan fleet of Emperor Frederick II destroyed a Genoese fleet in the Battle of Giglio. From 1264, Isola del Giglio was a Pisan dominion, from which it passed to the Medici family. It suffered several Saracen attacks, which ended only in 1799.\nAlongside its history, the island was always renowned for its mineral ore: many columns and buildings in Rome were built with the Gigliese granite.\nThe island houses the remains of a Roman villa of Domitius Ahenobarbus (1st-2nd century AD), in the area of Giglio Porto (Giglio port). No traces of the once existing Temple of Diana can be seen now. The church of San Pietro Apostolo in Giglio Castello (Giglio castle) has an ivory crucifix attributed to the sculptor Giambologna.\nThe island is also the site of an Etruscan shipwreck dating back to the early Iron age, c. 600 BC. The cargo of the ship included copper and lead ingots, iron spits, amphorae and a Corinthian helmet. Even a wooden writing tablet with stylus was preserved. The finds are almost completely lost now.\nCosta Concordia grounding incident\nIn 2012, the island received prolonged international media attention, following the 13 January 2012 running aground of the cruise liner Costa Concordia, just off the island's shore. Most of the more than 4,200 passengers and crew were rescued and taken to the island, as well as to the mainland. At least 30 people died and 64 were injured, with 2 missing (as of 20 December 2012). The people of the island rushed to help, providing hot drinks and blankets, and many opened their homes to the victims. The arrival of 2,000 salvage workers invigorated life on the island, and many of the workers fraternised with the islanders. Some local girls left the island with their new partners.\nThe ship removal work was started in 2013 and was completed towards the end of July 2014. Flotation devices were attached to right the ship and then raise it. It was subsequently towed to its final destination port of Genoa to be scrapped.\nIn popular fiction\n- San Quirico d'Orcia, Italy, since 2013\n- \"Giglio Castello\".

D’Acqui\nMajor efforts have been made over the last decade to investigate and quantify gas exchange between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. Such exchange is, in fact, of special relevance as it is known to exert a major control on the global carbon (C) cycle. The Pianosa_LAB is a research project started in the 2000 in collaboration with the National Research Council, several Universities and the authorities of the National Tuscan Archipelago Park, to understand and quantify the C cycle in a confined ecosystem such as that of the island of Pianosa, by conventional and innovative research approaches. The island of Pianosa is especially suited for this type of investigation due to its special topography. The island is completely flat emerging only approximately of 15 m out of the sea surface. In addition, there are no anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases on the island that may interfere with the proposed measurements, that provide useful information to quantify interactions and feedbacks between climate and local terrestrial ecosystem. The island of Pianosa is an excellent good analogue for a typical Mediterranean ecosystem where the natural vegetation is currently colonising the abandoned agricultural land and undergoing a process of re-naturalization. Furthermore, the Pianosa_LAB is attempting to integrate other activities, beside C cycle research, within the local context of a protected area thus creating synergies between science, environmental protection and the society. Here we present the main characteristic in terms of climate, geology, soil, vegetation and land-use of the island as well as its history, and describe the structure and objectives of the Pianosa_LAB project.\nKeywords: carbon cycle, carbon fluxes, mediterranean ecosystem.\nC.A. Santi, L.P. D’Acqui, A. Dodero, B. Pezzarossa, R. Pini, F. Petacco, M. Scatena, R. Risaliti\nThe soils of Pianosa, substantially homogeneous with regard to their parent material and pedological evolution, have different agronomic histories. However, the effects of agricultural activities on soil and vegetation are still very recognizable, even if there has been no human activity for seven years. Representative areas characterized by different land use were selected to give an overview of the soil of the mains ecosystems. Soil ecosystems were characterized on the basis of their chemical, physical and biological properties. The total organic and inorganic C content of the island soils was calculated and a map of distribution of soil organic carbon was drawn up. This was done in order to obtain a basis for the assessment of the dynamics of organic C as influenced by human activities, and the relationships between ecosystems and C sequestration. Physical and chemical analysis showed the impact of human activity on soil fertility. Modifications of soil structure were observed and a noteworthy reduction of soil organic C and N contents was found both in the abandoned arable areas and in the permanent pasture land compared to the macchia ecosystem, considered as the natural starting condition. However, the microbial properties showed a good biochemical recovery of the soil previously subjected to cultivation, providing interesting information both on CO2 exchanges and on resilience of the island soil ecosystems.\nKeywords: Carbon fluxes, Climate changes, Soil organic matter.\nM. F. Cotrufo, G. Delle Vedove, J.A. Subke, I. Inglima, G. Alberti and A. Peressotti\nMediterranean ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to changes in climate and land use forecasted for the near future, with likely perturba-tions of the carbon cycle. The aim of our study was to quantify particular aspects of the carbon cycle in typical Mediterranean ecosystems, in particular (1) the decay rates of litter from common tree and shrub species, (2) the efflux of CO2 from the soil and its relation to soil and litter moisture, and (3) the dynamics of the stable isotope 13C during litter decomposition. Filed work was conducted on the island Pianosa, which comprises a range of common Mediterranean ecosystem types. Litter decay rates of three selected species (Cistus monspenliensis, Pistacia lentiscus and Juniperus phoenicia) were found to be low with an average of 70 % of initial mass remaining after 2 years of field incubation. Over the same period, all litter types showed only a slight (<10 %) net loss of N. Despite relatively high initial N contents, litter decay rates were comparable to those reported in the literature, suggesting that C and N dynamics are decoupled during litter decomposition. Over the two years of incubation, 13C dynamics were not unanimous between the three litter types, with only a slight enrichment in one species. Continuation of this ongoing experiment is likely to resolve the long term effects of decomposition on 13C enrichment on litter. Soil CO2 efflux was found to be unusually high (peak rates of over 9 µmol m-2 s-1), owing to both high soil water content and soil temperature during an intensive measuring campaign in October 2003. Mean daily fluxes in woodland ecosystems were significantly higher than in either macchia or ex agricultural ecosystems, exceeding the latter about twofold. However, when scaled to the relative surface representation on Pianosa, the highest contribution of daily soil CO2 efflux stems from Macchia type vegetation, followed by abandoned agricultural sites and woodland ecosystems (around 20, 22, and 8.5 t C d-1, respectively). With the exception of one site, soil CO2 efflux correlated positi-vely with litter content at different sites across the island. Rather than causing the higher fluxes directly, higher litter contents are likely to indicate higher site productivity rates, resulting in higher CO2 turnover dynamics and hence higher overall soil CO2 efflux rates. Owing to the only small range of soil moisture conditions during the measuring campaign, no dependence of soil CO2 efflux on soil moisture could be detected. However, a range of moisture conditions between sites was noted, indicating the significance of site specific conditions also within the same ecosystem types.\nKeywords: Soil respiration; Litter mass loss; Stable C isotopes; Land use\nColom M.R., F.P. Vaccari, A. Scartazza, E. Brugnoli, G. Zerbi, S. Sforzi, R. Baraldi, Cotrufo M.F.\nStructure, ecophysiology and productivity of the main island ecosystems were studied. The studied ecosystems showed a different species composition, with different dominant plant species. All ecosystems showed a high plant species richness (between 21 to 30), with a higher proportion of perennials (60 %) and a lower percentage of annuals (40 %). Herbaceous plants (85-98 %) were dominant with respect to woody species. Woody plants are the 14 % of the total number of species found in macchia and woodland ecosystems. In each type of ecosystems plant communities were dominated by few species, as for example, Avena barbata in pasture/cultivated fields, or Juniperus phoenicia in macchia ecosystems. On pasture/cultivated fields a progressive invasion of pioneer shrub species is actually undergoing. Species association of macchia vegetation is very similar to so called “Ginepreto Rupestre”, while some macchia areas showed a canopy height typical of Meso-Mediterranean Macchia. The pasture/cultivated fields and the macchia areas cover around the 53 and 37 % of island surface. On the other hand, a great fraction of island dry biomass was formed by macchia vegetation (61 %), while pasture/cultivated fields vegetation represent around the 26 % and woodlands only the 13 % of island biomass. In woodlands, species richness was associated to a higher Simpson index (0.502) with respect to macchia and pasture/cultivated fields. However the Shannon diversity index was found higher in macchia sites (0.415). Woodlands were also characterized by a higher diversity between families, as indicated by the Shannon index values, that were around 2.6, with respect to macchia (1,17) and pasture/cultivated fields (1.29). Carbon isotope composition (d13C) on leaf dry matter was used to assess differences in photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination (?) and water-use efficiency (WUE) of the dominant species colonizing the main island ecosystems. This analysis indicated lower ? and, hence, higher WUE in macchia and woodland ecosystem species than those of abandoned agricultural fields. During the warm summer Rosmarinus officinalis showed the highest photosynthetic rates (around 10 µmol m-2s-1), within macchia vegetation. Carbon density for macchia vegetation was around 0.99 Kg of C m-2 , while nitrogen was 0.013 Kg of N m-2. Data colleted suggested that a re-naturalization processes it is actually occurring on Pianosa island, particularly on pasture/cultivated fields. Plant communities within each type of ecosystem studied, showed a similar species composition. Therefore, Pianosa island represents an important spot for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean sea, however data collected are not exhaus-tive to know the entire functioning and structure of the island, but indicate that those species that are more abundant in the three ecosystems probably will be the driving forces of ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions.\nKeywords: carbon, carbon isotope composition, photosynthesis, species, vegetation\nP.

Brancaleoni E. & M.\nFor the first time, the emission of individual BVOC released from a Mediterranean ecosystem has been assessed and the results obtained have been directly compared with fluxes measured with the mixed box (MB) approach. The study was conducted in Pianosa, a very small and flat island located in the Tyrrhenian sea, between the coasts of Central Italy and the Corsica Island. Due to the substantial lack of man-made emission and the restricted access, terrestrial vegetation represents in this island the main source of hydrocarbons. This allows to use simple methodologies to estimate and measure the emission of individual BVOC in the atmosphere. Due to the limited number of emitting species, the total emission was estimated by up-scaling to ecosystem level the information obtained with branch enclosures. Data obtained suggested that the basal emission of total isoprenoids generated from the island was one order of magnitude smaller than that estimated in the pine-oak forest ecosystem of Castelporziano (ca. 0.2 mg C m-2h-1). a-Pinene was the major component emitted and accounted, by itself, for more than 40% of the total isoprenoid emission. Daily profiles of emission were calculated for the two days when the air masses were depleted in anthropogenic compounds, after traveling for two days over the open sea. Results obtained in these days indicated that a-pinene was the only component displaying an emission (ca. 0.1 mg C m-2 h-1) sufficiently high to generate detectable concentrations (0.01-0.03 µg C Nm-3) in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Fluxes determined using the MB approach substantially confirmed the estimates made by up-scaling to ecosystem level the emission from terrestrial vegetation, although a difference of a factor of two was observed between the calculated emission and the measured fluxes. Reasons explaining these differences will be analyzed and critically discussed.\nKeywords: branch enclosure, Mediterranean ecosystem, mixed box technique, isoprenoids, tethered balloon.\nF. P. Vaccari, B. Gioli, A. Zaldei, F. Sabatini, T. Georgiadis, F. Rossi, A. Peressotti, V. Magliulo\nThe overall gas exchange occurring between Mediterranean ecosystems and the atmosphere has been rarely quantified experimentally, but due to the occurrence of prolonged summer drought that limits gas exchange, the potential carbon (C) sink of Mediterranean ecosystems is generally considered low. Net Ecosystem C Exchange (NEE) was measured for a period of 12 months in the Island of Pianosa (Central Italy) using the eddy covariance technique. The Island is partly covered by macchia vegetation and by abandoned agricultural land and it is ideal for flux measurements due to its flat topography and for the absence of anthropogenic C sources. C-flux measurements made between April 2002 and March 2003 showed that the Island of Pianosa was a net sink of C during a 12 months period accumulating 2.64 t C ha-1 per year. Such a sink was less than what has been reported for evergreen forest in the region, but it is larger than what is generally estimated for drought limited ecosystems. The analysis of seasonal changes in the C-flux revealed that phenology and temperature were likely limiting C uptake during the winter months, while drought was limiting during the summer months. The potential C sink that could be provided by the entire island was finally calculated as the difference between the C stock contained at present in the Island’s ecosystems and that contained in the areas covered by the Mediterranean macchia.\nKeywords: Eddy covariance, Mediterranean ecosystem, Net Ecosystem Exchange, Pianosa island\nMarianna Nardino, Osvaldo Facini, Teodoro Georgiadis, Federica Rossi and Alessandro Zaldei\nIn the present work a simplified model, based on the parameterisation of a growing boundary layer over a coastal discontinuity , has been used to estimate the temporal evolution of the mixed layer height during the PianosaLab experimental campaigns.

{"question":"How do experts classify the different materials used in ancient coin production through abbreviations?","answer":"Experts use three main abbreviations to classify ancient coin materials: AE refers to coins made of base metals or alloys like copper or bronze, and when followed by a number, it indicates the coin's size category (e.g., AE1 for coins over 25mm). AR indicates silver coins, derived from the Latin 'argentum' meaning silver. AU indicates gold coins, derived from the Latin 'aurum' meaning gold.","context":["Numismatics the study of coinage, and is a wonderfully useful tool in the archaeologist’s and historian’s toolbox. One of the best things for an archaeologist to find while digging is a coin. The reason is simple; it can instantly provide some date for the layer they are digging. Additionally, coins provide information for trade, economy, social organisation, mythology, ideologies, personages, leadership, military, important events, and the list goes on.\nParts of coins\nTo analyse ancient coinage there are some terms that one must first understand:\nThe Obverse: The obverse is the heads side or the front of the coin. Roman Imperial coins usually display the head of the Emperor or a significant relative. It can be difficult to identify the obverse on a Greek coins because of the images depicted.\nThe Reverse: The reverse is the opposite side of the coin to the obverse. It is the tails side or back of the coin. Roman Imperial coins usually display some sort of propaganda on the reverse, while Republican coins depict a theme glorifying a certain ancestor. Again with Greek coins it can be more difficult to identify.\nLegend: This refers to the inscription on the coin excluding mint characters. It typically runs round the exterior edge of the coin but there are exceptions.\nThe legend can contain abbreviations, particularly on Roman coins, which are significant to the analysis of the coins. Some of the most common are:\nAVG = Augustus\nC or CAES = Caesar\nCOS = Consul\nIMP = Imperator/Commander\nPERP or PP = Perpetuus/Continuous\nP F = Pius Felix/dutiful to the gods, the state or one’s family\nP M = Ponifex Maximus\nP P = Pater Patriae/Father of his country\nS C = Senatus Consulto/by degree of the state\nS P Q R = Senatus Populusque Romus/The Roman Senate and People\nField: The field is a flat undecorated area which sometimes contains mint or control marks, which are a sequence of letters or symbols indicating who produced the coins.\nExergue: The exergue is a space at the bottom of the reverse which often separated from the image by a line. Sometimes this space houses part of the legend or a mint mark.\nType: The central design on the reverse which is generally surrounded by the legend and on top of the exergue.\nImportant Terms to Remember when Researching and Analysing:\nAE: AE is often found in the description of coins and is an abbreviation meaning that the coin is of a base metal or alloy (eg. Copper or bronze). When used alongside a number it refers to the size of the coin. This measurement is done in millimetres of the diameter of the coin but does not represent the millimetres themselves but a certain category which they belong to. For instance, with Roman coins, AE1 are alloy coins over 25mm and AE2 are 21-25mm etc.\nAR: Is an abbreviation indicating that the coin is made of silver derived from the Latin ‘argentum’ meaning silver.\nAU: Is an abbreviation indicating that the coin is made from gold derived from the Latin ‘aurum’ meaning gold.\nBrockage: Refers to a coin which has been mis-struck and the reverse image appears incuse on the obverse of the coin.\nRestoration: Refers to an issue of a coin which replicates a previous coin with few minor changes. Often this is to keep the reverence of previously depicted persons by keeping coins in circulation.\nSerrated/Serratus: Refers to a coin with a notched edge.\nTransverse: Something held at an angle in the image.\n- Forum Ancient Coins\n- Sear D.

After assessing the strengths and needs of each client, the qualified music therapist provides the indicated treatment including creating, singing, moving to, and/or listening to music. Through musical involvement in the therapeutic context, clients' abilities are strengthened and transferred to other areas of their lives. Music therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express themselves in words. Research in music therapy supports its effectiveness in many areas such as: overall physical rehabilitation and facilitating movement, increasing people's motivation to become engaged in their treatment, providing emotional support for clients and their families, and providing an outlet for expression of feelings.\nWhat Music Therapy Is... and Is Not\nThe American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) supports music for all and applauds the efforts of individuals who share their music-making and time; we say the more music the better! But clinical music therapy is the only professional, research-based discipline that actively applies supportive science to the creative, emotional, and energizing experiences of music for health treatment and educational goals. Below are a few important facts about music therapy and the credentialed music therapists who practice it:\n- Music therapists must have a bachelor’s degree or higher in music therapy from one of AMTA’s 72 approved colleges and universities, including 1200 hours of clinical training.\n- Music therapists must hold the MT-BC credential, issued through the Certification Board for Music Therapists, which protects the public by ensuring competent practice and requiring continuing education. Some states also require licensure for board-certified music therapists.\n- Music Therapy is an evidence-based health profession with a strong research foundation.\n- Music Therapy degrees require knowledge in psychology, medicine, and music.\nThese examples of therapeutic music are noteworthy, but are not clinical music therapy:\n- A person with Alzheimer’s listening to an iPod with headphones of his/her favorite songs\n- Groups such as Bedside Musicians, Musicians on Call, Music Practitioners, Sound Healers, and Music Thanatologists\n- Celebrities performing at hospitals and/or schools\n- A piano player in the lobby of a hospital\n- Nurses playing background music for patients\n- Artists in residence\n- Arts educators\n- A high school student playing guitar in a nursing home\n- A choir singing on the pediatric floor of a hospital\nFinally, here are examples what credentialed music therapists do:\n- Work with Congresswoman Giffords to regain her speech after surviving a bullet wound to her brain.\n- Work with older adults to lessen the effects of dementia.\n- Work with children and adults to reduce asthma episodes.\n- Work with hospitalized patients to reduce pain.\n- Work with children who have autism to improve communication capabilities.\n- Work with premature infants to improve sleep patterns and increase weight gain.\n- Work with people who have Parkinson’s disease to improve motor function.\nAMTA’s mission is to advance public awareness of the benefits of music therapy and increase access to quality music therapy services in a rapidly changing world. In consideration of the diversity of music used in healthcare, special education, and other settings, AMTA unequivocally recommends the unique knowledge and skill of board certified music therapists.\nBradt, J., Magee, W.L., Dileo, C., Wheeler, B.L., & McGilloway, E.

{"question":"Which has a stronger influence on human behavior - the drive for homeostasis or the likelihood of future events?","answer":"Based on the evidence presented, the likelihood of future events appears to have a stronger influence on human behavior than the drive for homeostasis. While drive reduction theory suggests humans seek a state where all needs are met (homeostasis), this is contradicted by people's tendency to seek excitement and challenges. In contrast, research shows that future likelihood consistently influences behavior and perception - for example, people perceive past events as more distant when unlikely to recur, and this affects their decision-making and actions. Additionally, this future-oriented influence has been demonstrated across multiple studies involving over 1,300 participants.","context":["How Our Perceived Future Influences Our Past\nVivid memories and emotions about things affect our perceptions of when they took place, but can the chance of them happening again also influence how we regard the past?\nBy Si Kao, PhD Candidate, Department of Marketing, CUHK Business School\nThose of us who watched the Hollywood hit movie, La La Land, which focuses on a bitter-sweet love affair between a musician and an aspiring actress, may have been reminded of experiences we had with a former boyfriend or girlfriend.\nWhen talking to colleagues and friends, they all agreed that their past experiences with their former partners – whether taking a vacation in Bali, for example, or going out for dinner, having a fight, or just a conversation – feel particularly remote now. Why is this?\nResearch has shown that the vividness of a past trip and the emotions associated with it can influence people’s perceptions of when it took place. But can our perceived future also influence our past memories?\nThe findings of my published paper, “Looking Forward and Looking Back: The Likelihood of an Event’s Future Reoccurrence Affects Perceptions of the Time It Occurred in the Past”, in collaboration with Visiting Professor Robert Wyer and Associate Professor Dai Xianchi from the Department of Marketing at CUHK Business School, may provide some useful answers to these questions.\nLooking at a past trip and its possible reoccurrence\nIn our research, we considered another determinant – the likelihood of the event occurring again. Specifically, we suggested that people consider past events to be more distant if the chance of their reoccurrence is low.\nA past vacation in Bali, for example, seems more remote to people if they will never go there again, rather than if they are likely to return next year.\nWe based such a hypothesis on two assumptions: First, that people believe a future event to be more imminent if there is high – rather than low – likelihood of it occurring. Second, people’s perceptions of when a former event will reoccur have a positive influence on their judgments about when it previously took place.\nMore than 1,300 people took part in six studies. In one of the studies, we asked participants to recall the most recent New Year’s Eve they spent in a location other than their hometown or place of residence and write down where they went, the people they were with and what they did.\nWe also asked them to rate how long ago it felt since the event occurred, using a scale from 1 (feels like yesterday/feels very close) to 9 (feels very far away/feels very distant); the likelihood of them returning there and meeting the same people, also on a scale from 1 (not at all feasible) to 9 (very feasible); and things such as how vivid and emotional their memories were.\nAs a result, we found evidence that participants regarded a past event that was unlikely to reoccur as being more distant.\nIn another study, participants were questioned about a past vacation and how distant it felt to them today; they were also asked to estimate the number of years before they would take another trip to the same place.\nWe found that participants who were made to think that the future holiday was unlikely ended up estimating a longer period till when they would make a return trip. They also estimated the time since their past vacation to be longer when they felt it was very unlikely that the future holiday would reoccur.\nIn the final study, involving fixed events in the future, took place about 12 months before the 2016 Rio Olympics. We manipulated participants’ judgments about how long it was until the start of the next Summer Games by first focusing their attention on either a near or a distant sports event.\nHalf of the participants were asked to think first about the coming NBA finals – only three weeks away at the time – which led them to regard the approaching Olympics as relatively distant.\nThe other half was asked to think first about the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia – then three years away – which led them to view that the forthcoming Olympics as closer.\nParticipants were then asked to indicate how long it seemed since the last Olympics had taken place.\nLogic might suggest that the more imminent the next Olympics are then the more time that has elapsed since the previous Games. But people’s answers contradicted this: The farther away participants felt the next Olympics to be, the farther away they also felt the last Olympics to be.\n“People may want to distance themselves from a past event that was desirable, but was nevertheless unlikely to occur again, to reduce feelings of wistfulness.”\nSo What Did We Discover?\nResearch has shown that people’s memories and appraisal of the past can be influenced by their current goals, motivations, and beliefs.\nHowever, to our knowledge few studies have investigated whether people’s perceptions of the future can affect their judgments of the time an event occurred in the past.\nOur studies found that a past event is perceived to have occurred more recently if it is likely – rather than unlikely – to reoccur.\nThe results suggest an event’s likelihood of reoccurring influences the perception of the time it will occur in future and that this perception, in turn, affects judgments about when the event took place in the past.\nIt should be noted that we focused our studies almost exclusively on positive events, not things that could stir up negative feelings, such as a trip to the dentist or a car accident.\nAlso special or extraordinary personal events, such as a wedding, were not examined. Based on the current findings, we speculate that the observed effect may be reduced, for both negative and special events, because people rarely anticipate or consider they will reoccur in the future.\nOther explanations may also explain our current findings. One interesting idea is that people may want to distance themselves from a past event that was desirable, but was nevertheless unlikely to occur again, to reduce feelings of wistfulness. Such an alternative suggestion is not incompatible with the findings of our research.\nPractical Implications of Our Findings\nOur research could prove useful to marketers and retailers in future advertising campaigns because of the crucial role that memory and time perception play in shaping consumers’ decisions.\nOne study showed that under some circumstances a person’s desire to do something – perhaps take an exotic holiday – becomes stronger if they feel it is a long time since they last indulged.\nYet our research highlighted a previously ignored subtlety of marketing. Often great efforts have been taken to emphasize just how easy it is to do something, but the studies suggested that doing so could also backfire: when people perceive they are highly likely to indulge in something again they may feel more closely connected to these past events and are not so drawn to try them again in future.\nOur studies also indicated that some form of vicious cycle may negatively affect the effectiveness of consumers who try to self-regulate their behavior – specifically those who choose to set their own rules or constraints. Such consumers may want to manage their finances, for example, by limiting the frequency and amount they spend on holidays, or deliberately buy fewer cigarettes each time they run out as part of efforts to stop smoking.\nSuch self-imposed limits could be effective, but our studies suggest that they may also backfire. As the constraints on consumers imply a reduced likelihood of the event – such as taking holidays or smoking cigarettes – in the future, people may feel the last time they indulged in the activity to be more distant, and therefore finding it more alluring. So the restrictions these people give themselves may actually make it easier for them to justify their indulgent behaviors – and encourage them to do it again.\nCoordinator, MPhil and PhD in Marketing Programme","Motivation: The Why’s of Behavior\nFrom instincts to self-actualization: What’s motivates us?\nPosted Oct 29, 2011\nWhy #1: Instinct Theory. According to the oldest motivational theory on the books, organisms behave as they do because they are following a set of biologically pre-programmed instinctual urges. Like the birds and the bees, humans are enacting a set of behaviors hardwired into our neural circuitry. This theory is undoubtedly too simple to apply to humans, much less birds and bees. However, inner needs must certainly be part of the equation in understanding our behavior.\nWhy #2: Drive Reduction Theory. This next approach to motivation proposes that organisms large and small, simple to complex, prefer the state of homeostasis in which all of their needs are fulfilled. Their \"drives,\" in other words (the need states that propel behavior) must be \"reduced.\" Everyone might have a different definition of homeostasis-perhaps yours is sleeping late on a weekend morning, or just enjoying a relaxing drink in a cozy chair. Drive reduction theory's critics agree that it's great to have your needs met at least some of the time. However, if the theory were true, no one would ever seek out excitement. No one would go bungee jumping or seek comparable mental challenges.\nWhy #4: Incentive Theory. Our behavior may also be determined by forces that propel us to do something we otherwise would not. Incentive theory is the basic principle behind marketing. A good marketing strategy will cause you to want something you neither have nor think you need. You expect that by having this \"thing,\" you will be better off than you are without it (Beckmann & Heckhausen, 2008). It's like those catalogs that fall out of your mailbox during the holiday season and the emails that clutter up your inbox offering unbelievable \"deals.\" Retailers are hoping that you will go after the products that they put out in front of you. Similarly, grocery, convenience, and large-scale retail clothing stores place their little but often expensive temptations where they are bound to have the most impact-- namely, while you're waiting to check out. An item that you would have given no thought to now becomes a handy little impulse purchase that you toss into your bag or cart. Adding to the draw of the impulse purchase is the fact that you may feel you deserve a treat, having practiced extreme self-restraint throughout the rest of your shopping expedition (a phenomenon called \"ego depletion\").\nWhy #5: Cognitive Theory. Moving from simple conditioning to the realm of behavior controlled by thoughts, the cognitive theory of motivation proposes that our expectations guide our behavior. You'll behave in ways that you think will produce a desirable outcome. Cognitive theory, the creation of University of Rochester psychologists Ed Deci and Richard Ryan, proposed that we have two types of motivation: Intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is what drives us to fulfill our inner potential and interests. Your intrinsic motivation is your desire to express your true self in your behavior, whether it's work or leisure. What's more, when you are driven by intrinsic motivation, you feel that you are determining the outcomes of your efforts. Extrinsic motivation, by contrast, is your desire to achieve tangible rewards such as money or the glory that come with status and recognition. Deci and Ryan developed the counter-intuitive proposal that people who receive extrinsic rewards for behaviors that they find intrinsically satisfying become less creative and productive. This has the picturesque name of \"motivational crowding out.\" The extrinsic rewards of money, fame, and recognition crowd out the intrinsic satisfaction that you experience from doing something because you really like to do it. The motivational crowding out idea has some obvious flaws. Managers could use this theory to pay workers less or deny them promotions. \"Why should we pay you more (or at all)?\" You'll be less creative and productive! This problem led to a revision in the theory which is called ...\nWhy #6: Self-Determination Theory. With the obvious flaw in cognitive theory, it became clear that work motivation needs to incorporate both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of motivation. Deci and Ryan therefore revised their theory. Self-determination theory proposes that you can have a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation driving your work-related and other behavior. The most satisfying activities you can engage in, the ones that will motivate you the most, are those that allow you to feel most in control of your behavior. You can be motivated by the mundane satisfaction provided by extrinsic rewards. However, the more autonomy you feel, the more self-directed you'll be, and the most satisfied you'll be in your work, as suggested by research on college alums who felt they were fulfilling their intrinsic needs (Niemiec et al, 2009). Being able to express your inner motives and get paid at the same time is a hard combination to beat. The problem for many people is that they feel that their work behavior is controlled by factors outside of their own inner self-determination. It's that feeling of external control that leads to job discontent and stagnation. The remedy to this problem is to find ways to express your autonomy, even if it's only in a few minor ways.\nNow that you've seen the range of motivation theories, you've probably been able to pick out parts of each that apply to you either now or at some point in your past. By recognizing that your behavior reflects these many complex pieces, you can move on to developing your own unique path to change. Whether it's arousal, incentive, self-determination, or self-actualization, understanding the motivation behind your behavior can give you the insights you need to develop your own unique pathway to fulfillment.\nFollow me on Twitter @swhitbo for daily updates on psychology, health, and aging and please check out my website, www.searchforfulfillment.com where you can get additional information, self-tests, and links.\nCopyright 2011 Susan Krauss Whitbourne Ph.D.\nFeldman, R.S.

{"question":"How does tourism affect both the French Alps region and Asian UNESCO sites, and what are the challenges faced by both destinations?","answer":"In the French Alps, tourism is relatively well-managed, with the region being described as uncrowded even during peak seasons - July and August are the busiest months but still comparable to a quiet day in the Lake District. However, in Asian UNESCO sites, tourism management presents significant challenges. According to UNESCO specialists, sites like Angkor Wat face threats from excessive tourism, requiring careful management of visitor numbers. Similarly, in Luang Prabang, tourism is affecting local traditions, with foreigners buying guesthouses causing locals to move outside the core area. UNESCO emphasizes that while tourism is beneficial for heritage sites, it needs to be properly managed with measures like advance booking systems and visitor education about minimizing negative impacts.","context":["Multi-activity holidays in the French Alps\nThe stunning, varied landscapes and fantastic climate of the Southern French Alps provide the perfect setting for the activity holiday of a lifetime.

After an afternoon in the leafy canopy of the trees, you can opt to spend the night there in special tree hammocks and tents. Sleeping out in alpine forests with an array of fabulous wildlife going about their business is a truly wild adventure.\nClimbing on warm rocks with the scent of lavender stimulating your senses is a rare pleasure that is possible in the Southern French Alps. If you have participated in and enjoyed the explosion in popularity of indoor climbing walls, putting those skills to use outside in a beautiful natural environment is the icing on the cake. A perfect family activity that can be adapted for all levels.\nBack to those white-water rapids, but this time on a specially adapted surfboard. Wearing flippers and hanging on to your foam board you’ll surf down the river for an exhilarating ride! You can’t get much closer to the water, and every bump will feel enormous. Only for the adventurous!\nBest time to go: June, July and August are best for optimum water levels.\nTOP 5 EXPERIENCES\n1. The Serre Ponçon Lake\nOne of the largest artificial lakes in Western Europe and truly magnificent. Its turquoise blue waters stretch for miles against a backdrop of spectacular mountains. At the dam, a major engineering feat in the 1960s and of significant interest to any historian, engineer or scientist, there is a visitor’s centre with a film in several languages about its construction: the actual building of the dam, flooding of the valley and displacement of villages which was very controversial at the time.\n2. A market visit\nMost of the villages and the town of Gap have a regular weekly market with local produce and arts and crafts on offer. The hustle and bustle and the colourful displays of fresh produce, cheeses and charcuterie, the array of souvenirs, pottery, jewellery and other arts and crafts make a market visit an exceptional experience and, beware, a temptation to spend! The best local markets in the summer months are in Chorges and Gap, with Chorges also having a night market once a week.\n3. Fromagerie restaurant\nCheese is the staple of French food, particularly in the mountains, and it all happens in local fromageries. This is a restaurant attached to the local Col Bayard Fromagerie in the village of Laye. It is more than just a restaurant with a full range of cheeses, made by them and other local produce available to browse and buy as well as your lunch or dinner. With absolutely everything on this menu involving cheese, this is a cheese lover’s heaven!\n4. Prapic village\nPrapic is the last village of the Champsaur valley before the road is blocked by mountains. It is in effect the end of the road! The village is classically alpine, which has preserved its original architecture and layout to this day. All the houses have the traditional steep roofs, to help snow fall off, with hay lofts (insulation) on the top level, the living area on the mid level and the stables on the ground floor where the heat generated from the animals heated the living area above.\n5. The Valgaudemar valley\nThis is often referred to as the Himalayas of the Alps. It is a 22km long thin valley with 3,000m+ peaks lining each side. You can drive all the way to the end where there is a large hotel / refuge and restaurant called the Gioberney, a great place for lunch or walk from. As you eat your ice cream on the terrace you can admire the famous Bride’s Veil waterfall and the mountains and glaciers surrounding you – it is really pretty spectacular. The walk up to the Lac du Lauzon is a must too.\nWHEN TO VISIT\nBest times to go:\nMay to July is the big winter snow melt and the arrival of spring and summer. This is a beautiful time of year for nature lovers as the hibernating animals emerge, and the flowers and butterflies blanket the mountain pastures with a magnificent array of colours against a snow-covered mountain backdrop.\nIt is also the best time of year for water sports such as rafting and kayaking as the roller coaster river rapids are in full flow!\nIn July the Tour de France often visits the region and is either an event to definitely add to your bucket list or avoid completely depending on your passions!\nTo participate in sports such as cycling, biking and walking, May to June and also September to October are perfect as it is not too hot for exercise and you are just outside the main school holiday periods for quieter roads and paths.\nJuly and August are the busiest time with European school holidays spanning the two months. However, busy here is like a very quiet day in the Lake District so don’t worry too much about this. July and August are great times of year for access to all the activities and some activities like canyoning, which is often too dangerous in spring due to high water levels, is fantastic.\nSummer is also the time of year when the majority of festivals and events take place, and it boasts the best markets!\nAutumn is not to be forgotten either. Autumn has the most beautiful light for photography, and as the trees change colour, the mountainsides are a spectacle to get excited about. Climbers, cyclists, walkers and mountain bikers will love autumn in the Southern French Alps.\nWe've brought together a selection of relevant trips chosen from our partners - select a trip for further details...","Asia's unseen UNESCO World Heritage sites\nAsia’s long history and rich cultures have produced nearly 150 UNESCO World Heritage sites, with a long list of monuments waiting to join them in the application pipeline. “Once a site is on the list, it's important. 172 out of 192 countries have signed an international treaty to protect these sites. Individual countries are obliged to answer to the international community on how its sights are managed. These sites are the responsibility of everybody; they are important to the whole of humanity,” says Timothy Curtis, program specialist for culture in UNESCO’s Bangkok office.\nEverybody knows the Great Wall or the Taj Mahal. Here are 10 of Asia’s sites less traveled.\n1. Lushan National ParkLocation: Jiujiang City, Jiangxi Province, China\nAs Beatrice Kaldun, program officer at UNESCO’s Beijing office, explains, “Lushan tells the history of China”. Its captivating scenery has inspired much Chinese culture, its Western villas speak to the presence of international colonial powers, and Chiang Kai-Shek and Mao Zedong both had houses here. It is also an important site for Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. Mercedes-Benz is a major donor to the site. Kaldun stresses the importance of private sector involvement in heritage conservation.\n2. Ancient city of Ping YaoLocation: Ping Yao County, Shanxi Province, China\nPing Yao was China’s banking center in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since the Ming Dynasty, Ping Yao had been a trade hub, but in 1823, the first remittance shop, Rishengchang Exchange House, was set-up to take deposits, and to loan and remit money. At one point, more than 50 percent of China’s remittance shops were headquartered within Ping Yao’s ancient city walls. Rishengchang collapsed in 1932, but its former headquarters have been restored as a museum.\n3. Mount Qingcheng and the Dujiangyan Irrigation SystemLocation: Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province, China\nMount Qingcheng was the birthplace of Taoism, and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System is a technological and engineering feat dating back to the second century that still takes the waters from Minjiang River to irrigate the Chengdu plains. These sites were at the epicenter of the 2008 earthquake, and sustained substantial damage. Since then, the UNESCO World Heritage Center has mobilized international resources for the sites’ restoration.\n4. Orkhon Valley Cultural LandscapeLocation: Orkhon-Kharkorin Region, Mongolia\nA relatively easy six-hour drive from Ulaan Baatar, Orkhon Valley encompasses nearly 122,000 hectares of land on both sides of the Orkhon River. Within the site are the ruins of Kharkhorum, the capital of Genghis Khan’s empire. Other archaeological sites date back to the sixth century. Visitors can also experience the nomadic existence of Mongolians.\n5. Mountain Railways of IndiaLocation: India\nFive railways constructed from the late 19th to early 20th centuries are included in this listing. Three of these railways -- Darjeeling Himalayan, Kalka-Shimla, and Kangra Valley -- run through North India’s rugged Himalayas. The other two, Nilgiri Mountain and Matheran Hill, are in the south. Today, these classic railways, relics of British colonial rule, are still operated by India Railways, and offer exhilarating rides over India’s most scenic mountain trails.\n6. Ellora CavesLocation: Verul Village, Maharashtra State, India\nThese 34 cave monasteries and temples are stunning architectural marvels. Carved out of the Charanandri hill walls, these monuments to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism date back to the 7th to 11th centuries, and are a testament to India’s history of religious tolerance.\n7. Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife SanctuariesLocation: Kanchanaburi, Tak and Uthai Thani provinces, Thailand\nThis wildlife sanctuary is home to some of the most diverse wildlife in Southeast Asia, containing 77 percent of large mammal species. Here, you’ll spot tiger, leopard, Asiatic elephant, Sumatran rhinoceros and hog deer among the 120 mammal species represented in this natural sanctuary along the Myanmar border.\n8. Complex of Koguryo TombsLocation: Pyongyang, South Phyongan Province, Nampho, South Hwangghae Province, North Korea\nNorth Korea’s only UNESCO World Heritage Site, these 30 odd tombs contain fascinating wall paintings that document everyday life from Korea’s Koguryo kingdom dating back to the fifth century, and spanning from the Korean Peninsula into China’s Jilin province. Only 90 of the 10,000 or so Koguryo tombs found to date contain wall paintings, and nearly half of these, believed to be the tombs of royalty, are located at this site. These tombs and wall paintings are all that remain of this once powerful culture.\n9. Hwaseong FortressLocation: Kyonggi-do Province, South Korea\nThe story behind this fortress wall around Suwon, located 30km south of Seoul, is a palace drama of tragic proportions. It was built by King Jeongjo in the 18th century in preparation to move the capital city from Seoul to Suwon. But it was also built in honor of his father Prince Sado, who was murdered by his own father. Prince Sado was locked inside a rice chest and left to die when he refused his father’s orders to commit suicide.\n10. Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes of Kii Mountain RangeLocation: Mie, Nara and Wakayama Prefectures, Japan\nSet within the beautiful forests of the Kii Mountain range are three sacred sites linked by pilgrimage routes to Nara and Kyoto. The sites reflect the prevalence of Shinto and Buddhism traditions in Japan for more than 1,200 years. The three sites -- Yoshino and Omine, Kumano Sanzan, and Koyasan -- contain intriguing shrines and temples that date back to the ninth century.\nUNESCO works hard to ensure that our heritage does not disappear into oblivion so that future generations can learn from and appreciate the leaps and bounds that human civilizations have made. In Asia, Curtis sites two main threats to heritage preservation -- extreme poverty and rapid economic growth.\nIronically, if not properly managed, being a world heritage site also brings risks. Angkor Wat is a big success story illustrating how its world heritage status mobilized the international community to restore sites that were severely threatened by war, neglect and pillaging, transforming them into revenue-generating tourist destinations for the local community. “Now the threat is too much tourism. Now it's a question of managing its success,” Curtis says. He sites Luang Prabang as another site that needs to pay attention to how tourism is managed, where the monks’ way of life is being threatened as more and more foreigners, who don’t follow the tradition of feeding the monks, buy guest houses within Luang Prabang town leading locals to move outside the core area.\n“We really need to work with the tourism industry. Tourism is good. Heritage should be viewed and shared by people, but people need to understand their responsibilities. Officials need to understand the carrying capacity of a site, and put in place crowd control measures such as advance booking. Tourists need to understand how they can minimize the negative effect on the site and the community.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b078a85-ea3f-407b-af60-93829f4f3810>","<urn:uuid:54bce76a-8292-4345-8c29-2486db209a3f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the therapeutic effects of yoga poses on digestive health, and how do different styles of yoga approach the practice of restorative poses?","answer":"Several yoga poses offer therapeutic benefits for digestive health, including Wind-Relieving Pose which releases trapped gases in the large intestine, improves blood circulation to internal organs, and relieves constipation. Bridge Pose specifically helps improve digestion through abdominal organ massage. When looking at different yoga approaches, Yin yoga offers a distinct style focused on holding poses for extended periods (5-10 minutes) in a relaxed state, contrasting with faster-paced styles like Vinyasa or Hatha. The Yin approach emphasizes three key principles: playing with your edge, maintaining stillness, and holding poses for time. This gentle, cooling practice allows for deep tissue release and promotes healing, while never forcing the body beyond its natural limitations.","context":["Reclining bound angle pose, known as supta baddha konasana in Sanskrit, is a restorative hip opener that increases flexibility in the hips and range of motion in the legs. While the relaxing pose stretches the abdominal and gluteal muscles as well, its benefits are mostly concentrated in the hip flexor and rotator muscles, where the pose builds the most flexibility.\nThis reclining posture is also a deeply restorative pose that releases tension from, particularly, the hips. Women, especially, tend to store the body’s stress and muscle tension in the hips. Hip openers like supta baddha konasana combat this tendency by externally rotating the hip joint and building long, lean flexor and rotator muscles.\n- Begin lying supine on the mat. Rest your arms by your sides, palms facing up.\n- Inhale. Scoop your tailbone toward your navel to close the space between your lower back and the mat. This spinal extension will protect your lower back and engage the oblique muscles on either side of your abdomen.\n- Exhale. Press the bottom corners of your shoulder blades up toward your heart center to bring your shoulders down onto the mat.\n- Inhale. Bend your knees straight up and draw your heels toward your body. When your feet are one or two feet from your buttocks, stop.\n- Exhale. Gently drop your knees to the sides of your body (right knee to the right, left knee to the left). As your legs open outwards, bring the soles of your feet together. Nestle your heels as close to your hips as is comfortable and relax into supta konasana.\n- Keep your arms by your sides, palms facing up, or place your hands, palms down, on your belly. Close your eyes.\n- Inhale. Gently press your lower back and shoulders down into the mat.\n- Exhale. To drop your thighs lower to the mat and to, ultimately, stretch the hip rotators further, imagine you are drawing your inner groins into your hip joints. Use this motion, concentrated in the inner hips, to press your legs closer to the mat. Forcing the knees to the mat (the natural tendency in this pose) gives a less comprehensive stretch that is actually dangerous for your knee joints.\n- Breath and hold the pose. Extend the spine and press the shoulder blades up with every inhale. Draw the groins into the hip joints with every exhale.\n- Inhale. Lift your legs and bring your knees together. Exhale. Straighten your legs and come back into a supine position.\nTips, Photos and Videos for Beginners\nWhat are the benefits of konasana? Reclining bound angle pose lengthens the external hip rotators and the hip flexors for all around flexible, open hips. Along with other intense hip openers like pigeon pose (eka pada rajakapotasana), supta baddha konasana is one of the most comprehensive and effective cures for tight hips. If practiced consistently, the pose improves pelvic alignment and prevents pulled groin muscles.\nBaddha konasana benefits go beyond muscles and tendons. Because it focuses on the hip muscles, bound angle pose is traditionally thought to improve urinary, digestive, and reproductive health by stimulating circulation to those systems. At the same time, the seated pose mimics meditative asanas thought to facilitate meditation, scholarship, and enlightenment.\nThe reclining version of bound angle pose reverses the relationship between the lower back and abdominal muscles. The pose stretches the abdominal muscles and, as the muscles lengthen, massages the abdominal organs. The pose also gently strengthens the erector spinae and gluteal muscles, relieving lower back and sciatica pain.\nSupta baddha konasana is also a powerful restorative pose that releases muscle tension, relaxes the mind, and relieves stress. The posture includes an intense, simultaneous external rotation of the hips, which effectively releases the muscle tension built up in the hips.\nWhile there are many benefits of konasana, do not attempt reclining bound angle pose if you:\n- have a lower back injury or have serious, persistent lower back problems.\n- have a hernia.\n- have a groin injury.\n- have a knee injury.\n- have iliosacral instability.\nFlexible, open hips are key to accessing the benefits of reclining bound angle pose, but this restorative posture could just as likely be an introduction to stretching the hip flexors and rotators as the pose you relax in to reap the benefits of open hips. This pose doesn’t need much preparation, which is why it’s a great pose to practice while you wait for your yoga teacher to start class.\nBecause reclining bound angle pose is an intense external rotation of the hips, it makes sense to balance the pose with an internal rotation (although it is by no means essential to do so). Consider pairing supta konasana with lion pose (simhasana). Lion pose is a double internal rotation of the hips, so the exact opposite of bound angle pose. Pairing these two stretches the hip rotators more comprehensively.\nBound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana). Reclining bound angle pose is a variation of this original, seated posture. Begin seated on the mat with both legs extended out in front of you (in staff pose; dandasana). Extend your spine and press your shoulder blades forward. Arrange your legs as in step four and five (above). Take hold of your feet with your hands. Exhale and draw your groins into your hip joints as in step eight. Use your hands to gently pry the soles of your feet apart, as if you were reading a book, to intensify the hip opener. Breath and hold the pose. Exhale and release your legs.\nHip rotator muscles. The hip rotator, or lateral rotator, muscle group includes six small muscles in the hip that control external rotation of the legs. Short hip rotator muscles contribute to poor pelvic alignment. In reclining bound angle pose, both legs are externally rotated. This rotation, and the stretch to the hip rotators it provides, contributes to good pelvic alignment and improved range of motion for kicks, jumps, and splits.\nHip flexor muscles. The hip flexors are a large group of muscles located deep in the thighs, hips, and buttocks. They connect the leg, pelvis, and abdomen and allow you to lift your upper leg towards your body or bend your body over your upper leg. Sitting for long periods of time weakens the hip flexors, making it difficult to lift the upper legs and to bend over. In reclining bound angle pose, the hip flexors lengthen.\nGluteal muscles. The gluteal muscle group includes the three buttocks muscles: the gluteus maximus, the gluteus medius, and the gluteus minimus. The gluteal muscles are some of the body’s strongest and are the primary movers of the hips and thighs. Reclining bound angle pose stretches the lesser gluteal muscles in the sides of the buttocks.\nErector spinae muscles. The erector spinae is a bundle of muscles and tendons in the back that control extension and rotation. Because they are responsible for straightening the back, the strength of the erector spinae muscles is closely linked with posture. Reclining bound angle pose gently strengthens the erector spinae muscles in the lower back for better posture and a back less prone to pain and injury.\nAbdominal muscles. The abdominals are located in the lower belly, between the ribs and the pelvis. They control the tilt of the pelvis and the curve of the lower spine. Reclining bound angle pose stretches the abdominal muscles. For best results, tilt your pelvis upward to engage both your rectus abdominus (your “six pack”) and the obliques on either side of your stomach, drawing your entire belly in.","Yin Yoga Poses\nThis article is an exploration of 10 Yin yoga poses. Yin is a style that is practiced by holding poses for a long time in a relaxed state. Yin stands in contrast to other contemporary styles of yoga, such as Vinyasa or Hatha, which generally move the practitioner from pose to pose quickly. Yin yoga ‘asana’, the Sanskrit word for poses, are practiced by following the three principles that Bernie Clark explains in Yin Yoga with Bernie Clark.\nThree Principles of Yin Yoga\n- Principal 1: Play with your edge\n- Principal 2: Stillness\n- Principal 3: Hold for Time\nPlay With Your Edge\nYin is a lunar practice, which tends to be healing and cooling. Unlike solar practices such as sun salutations, yin does not call for heating postures, breathing styles, or sequencing. Therefore the muscles are typically not warm throughout a Yin practice. Entering into poses with cool muscles requires special attention to the first edge.\nThe first edge is found by gently getting into the shape of a pose and noticing where the body naturally wants to stop. Yielding the natural limitations of the body prevents injury. There should be no pain at the first or any other edge, yet there may be some discomfort. Discomfort without radiating pain is a sign that the connective tissue around the joints is stretching. Reasonable discomfort is a gateway to more flexibility and greater range of motion. Props can add additional comfort and accessibility to yin yoga poses.\nYou may experience strong physical sensations during a Yin practice such as heat or discomfort. Finding the first edge is a method of exploring the strong sensations and sitting with them. When yoga asana is briefly mentioned in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, they are prescribed to be Sthira sukham asanam, or done with steadiness and ease. Steadiness points to the second principal, stillness, which is explored later in the article.\nAbout 30-60 seconds into a pose, or if and when the body shows signs of being able to go deeper, it is safe to move to the second edge (or third or forth). It is important that the body, not the ego, give the signal to deepen. This humble practice never asks the yogi to prove or force anything. There is no need to try to “achieve” or to look a certain way. Gentleness, acceptance and honesty are critical in a yin practice. If the body starts to tighten, it’s a sign to slowly come out of the pose.\nClassical yoga was practiced as a means to still the mind for meditation. Sitting still in yin yoga poses lets the contemporary yogi dip their toes into the waters of deep meditation. One exception to stillness is when the body opens to a new edge. With the awareness that the body is ready to deepen, Yin yogis consciously move deeper and return again to stillness and breath. Another exception to stillness is the awareness of pain. In response to pain, it’s time to come out of the pose slowly.\nHold for Time\nThe third principal is to hold the poses for time. Poses can last anywhere from one minute to longer than 15 and in general are done for 5-10 minutes. Using a timer tells you how long you are staying still, which can be a way to gauge stillness from practice to practice. A timer can also ensure that both sides of the body get the same amount of time, which results in feeling delightfully balanced. The breath can continue to deepen the longer a pose is held. The lungs can expand seemingly forever. Counting breath is an interesting way to observe the expansive nature of the breath, which becomes possible during long holds. Profound experiences become accessible only when conscious and deepening pranayama is practiced.\nBreathing expansively while remaining still presents the practitioner with what is rarely otherwise observed: the quiet inner dance of consciousness, an inner world so rich and mysterious, it is invisible most of the time. Holding (still) for time never seemed so tempting.\nWhat Do You Need to Practice Yin Yoga?\n- Yoga mat or as an alternative, a thick blanket or carpet.\n- Yoga blankets and bolsters or as an alternative, towels and pillows nearby\n- Blocks or (or books if you have none)\n- Sand timer\n- Soft music\n10 Yin Yoga Poses\n1. Chest and Shoulder Expansion\nSit cross-legged, your right side adjacent to the wall, reach your right hand back so the palm is flat against the wall at about shoulder height. Scoot your right hip in closer to the wall if you feel you can safely tolerate more stretch. Once the shoulder feels settled, bend the arm so you have the palm directly above the elbow at the height of your gaze. Sit and breathe for several moments. If you feel you can safely deepen, allow the left hand to come beside and slightly behind your left hip and press fingertips into the floor. Lift and open your chest. Slowly drop the left shoulder down and perhaps the chin and gaze point follow. Stay for 1-5 minutes breathing gently.\n2. Lower Back Pose\nSit on a cushion if you have tight hamstrings or flat on the mat for more open hamstrings. Let the legs extend and relax so that the feet flop out gently to their respective sides. Knees can be slightly bent. Pressing the fingertips downward into the ground beside the hips, lengthen the heart higher in contrast. Then tuck the chin into the chest. Let the upturned palms fall to the outside of the thighs near the knees. Allow the upper spine to round. For your second edge, the hands may move down the legs closer to the ankles. Remember not to strive or do too much. Stay and breathe 1-5 minutes.\n3. West-Facing Pose\nThis pose just like the lower back pose, sitting up legs relaxed and extended. Place one bolster over your thighs. Lift though the chest as you inhale and as you exhale fold forward and down, hinging from the hips so as to keep length in the low back. If you are not able to lay upon the cushion, add more props until you can easily lay your chest and face on them. Find your first edge. At this time you may determine to remove or reduce the props so that you can go deeper. Stay in the pose for 1-5 minutes. Note, this pose is called “west-facing” because it is cooling, like the setting sun, which sets in the west.\n4. Wide Leg Child Pose\nOn your mat, add cushion beneath the knees using a blanket or towel. Bring the knees as wide or wider than the mat and big toes to touch or towards one another. Press your hips back toward the heels and walk your hands forward as you fold from the hips. Imagine a gentle anchor keeps the hips downward and the low back spreading wide. From there, stretch the arms, chest and head forward and down. If the head cannot touch the floor, put a block or folded blanket beneath it so it can rest. You may prefer to rest upon the forehead or to turn the head to one side and then the other. Let your arms and hands relax into the floor. Notice your edge and deepen if and when it feels right. Come out if the knees start to bother you, moving slowly. Practice for 1-5 minutes.\n5. Wide Leg Child Pose, Thread the Needle Variation\nFrom wide leg child pose, slightly raise the head and walk the right hand back. Thread the right hand under the left until the right shoulder is on the ground and put the right temple on the floor. Repeat on the left side. Practice 1-5 minutes on each side.\nCome to your hands and knees with a folded blanket under the knees for padding. Bring your right foot forward so it is just to the right on the right hand, make sure your shoulders are over the wrists. The right knee stacks over the right ankle so your shin may feel as though it is moving forward in space. If the right knee pops out to the right, redirect it over the ankle, pressing down into the right foot and imagine pressing the shin forward.\nIf needed, bring your hands up on blocks, lift through the chest, curl the left toes under and squeeze the left leg so the thigh lifts off the ground. This will cause the thigh to rotate internally, which means the alignment is now safe for deepening. Now , bringing the left knee down onto the blanket and then flatten the top of left foot into the mat. You may stay like that or bring your elbows onto the blocks to deepen. You may end up with no blocks, elbows on the mat beneath the shoulders or you may end up staying high on blocks. Honor where the body needs to go and remain for 1-5 minutes before repeating on the other side.\nPlace a flat bolster horizontally across the mat or a folded blanket about halfway down the length of the mat. Place both knees on the bolster. Bring the right knee forward of the cushion in front of the right hip and the foot toward on left side of the mat. Place the palms on blocks beneath the shoulders and bring the left leg back so that the thigh and top of left foot are pressing into or towards the floor. Let the pelvis be supported by the cushion. You may stay upright, opening the chest, or choose to ease yourself down, perhaps deepening to the point where your head rests on blocks or on the floor. Remain in the pose 1-5 minutes and repeat on the other side.\n8. Supported Reclined Butterfly\nThe use of props to recline makes this supportive and relaxing. To do so, place a block the tall way and another the short way so they make an L. Lay a bolster or supportive cushion over the blocks so that it a slanted toward the floor. Place yourself with your back against the lower part of the cushion with the souls of your feet touching. To keep the feet together and to allow the hips to relax, use a strap or a long rolled blanket to wrap the feet.\n9. Supported Gentle Fish\nPlace a block at medium height near the top of the mat. Sit so the block is behind you with the legs extended and relaxed. Lay your back over the blocks so they land between your shoulder blades boosted your heart up. Let your head relax back onto a block, making sure the neck is supported. Allow the arms to pour open and drip into the floor on either side. Breathe into the heart and let the body seep down onto the props. As your edge moves, notice the chest may boost higher. Remain 1-5 minutes.\n10. Corpse Pose/ Savasana\nLay on the mat on your back.

{"question":"How do community forest management programs empower local farmers, and what tools are available to assess workplace well-being in such initiatives?","answer":"Community forest management programs empower local farmers through initiatives like Indonesia's HTR program, which grants management rights and allows communities to harvest trees while maintaining conservation. For example, the Bulu Dewata cooperative secured 313 hectares and can cut trees in half the area while protecting the rest. They've implemented profitable white teak cultivation alongside traditional crops. As for workplace assessment tools, the Healthy Work Survey (HWS) is a free online tool that measures work stressors and conditions, taking 20 minutes to complete. It evaluates factors like job demands, workplace support, and safety priorities, providing confidential individual reports and aggregate data for organizations to improve working conditions.","context":["- Fourteen cooperatives in Indoneisa’s Pinrang regency have petitioned the government for greater management rights to their land.\n- One of the cooperatives secured 313 hectares under the community plantation forest, or HTR, scheme.\n- White teak has become one of the Bulu Dewata cooperative’s main crops.\nEvery day at noon Bahar and Nasirah set out on foot into the South Sulawesi backcountry. The couple moves instinctively through single-stem plants, gathering chilies and pumpkin, knowing as each day passes their subsistence livelihood is on the verge of transformation.\nThe harvest has set the pace of life for centuries here in Massewae. But generations of farmers like Bahar and Nasirah have seen only modest progress in income as they gather crops near where the Sadang River runs into the Makassar Strait. Now the community around Massewae has banded together to form a legal cooperative and petitioned the Pinrang regency government to take management rights over the land.\nBahar is one of 40 farmers in the Bulu Dewata cooperative. Thirteen other cooperatives have applied to the Pinrang government for a similar community forest permit. Nawir Abidin, chairman of the Bulu Dewata cooperative, said it initially applied to manage 600 hectares, but after thumbing through their application the government signed off on 313.\nThe deal is straightforward: tree cutting is permitted in half of the community concession, but they are responsible for the conservation of the remainder.\n“We can use the buffer zone for production but we can’t cut down the trees,” Nawir told Mongabay.\nThe collective has employed standard agricultural practice in such arrangements, arranging chili, cocoa, palm and squash in a productive permaculture. But the promise of change comes from the white teak.\n“Actually we have a lot of local teak here; it’s red teak, but it grows slowly and can take up to 20 years,” Nawir said. “White teak takes only six to eight years.”\nBulu Dewata has planted around a 1,000 white teak seedlings around three meters apart. The seedlings sit cheek by jowl with other the plants dug in by the community.\n“The rule is that other plants cannot be taken down before the teak,” Nawir said.\nBahar, Nasirah and the 39 other farmers keep the land in order by removing unwanted vines and ensuring overgrowth does not deprive the white teak of sunlight.\n“If you compare the plants that have not been in the shade, they are bigger and taller,” he said. “But they were planted at the same time.\n“We have to attend to it regularly because vines will inhibit the growth of the teak.”\nWhite teak, green shoots\nIndonesia’s community plantation forest (HTR) program has seen hundreds of licenses handed out since the government enacted the scheme in 2007.\nThe aim of community forest management, which has seen success in countries as divergent as Brazil and South Korea, is to boost livelihoods and empower communities while protecting forest cover. People are less likely to destroy their environment if they have a direct stake in it, the theory goes.\nIn 2010, a civil society group called the Sulawesi Community Foundation examined the potential for community forest leases and gathered local communities with other stakeholders at the regency government offices in Pinrang. Nawir, who at the time was the Massewae village leader, joined the meeting. The promise of greater empowerment immediately interested him.\n“Another reason was that people were looking at joining other businesses at the time,” he said. “Like oil.”\nNawir moved quickly after the meeting. He went to village farmers, selling the idea to them before their gathering signatures and refining the proposal. They settled on the name Bulu Dewata for the cooperative and expedited the paperwork, presenting a map of the proposed concession and data on the land to the government.\nPinrang regency approved their application after cutting their 600-hectare proposal down to 313. Nawir and colleagues then applied to the forestry ministry’s public service office for loans to cover the cost of white teak seedlings.\nThe ministry approved credit to cover an eight-year work plan, and put in place a system for training.\nAwaluddin, a member of the Sulawesi Community Foundation, praised Nawir. Four similar cooperatives in the area had not proved as successful because of poor leadership, he said.\n“Some think that you can just take down trees as soon as you get the permit, but it’s not like that,” he told Mongabay. “They even sink a lot of money into getting the license.”\nTraining in plantation techniques promises productivity boost\nAfter the cooperative was up and running, the Sulawesi Community Foundation worked on bringing in expertise to boost skill levels. They brought an expert from Gajah Madah University in Yogyakarta to train one farmer, Ismail, to induct teak.\nThe technique demands that the root is cut, then inducted with an enzyme and left in a vacuum, in this case a plastic bag. This advanced method can create stronger, more fibrous roots. Roots inducted in this way typically contain around 100 strands – the norm is only 15 – and will result in taller, more lucrative hardwood trees.\n“Many have tried, but they always failed,” Ismail told Mongabay. “I always get good results.”\nIn just a few years, the community here will be able to cut down these white teak trees to sell before replanting and repeating the cycle. It’s a more orderly development after the untrammeled destruction of Indonesia’s forests over the last half century, but it requires patience and a long-term approach by the community.\n“Some people are still reluctant because they haven’t yet seen the results,” Ismail said.\nIsmail has distributed 50 inducted seedlings among other farmers in the cooperative. For now, Bahar and Nasirah continue their journey through the shoulder-high plants, picking chili and pumpkin while clearing vines from the cooperative’s teak trees. They return in late afternoon, before selling the chillies for around 7,000 rupiah (50 cents) at market. It’s not much, but in no more than a few years the community will have hundreds of millions of rupiah in hardwood to sell from the land they now manage.\n“The whole thing was self-funded and quite a lot of my own money went into it,” Nawir said.","Healthy Work Survey\nFor Unions & Worker Advocates\nWhat is the Healthy Work Survey (HWS)?\n- A free, online tool developed by the Healthy Work Campaign – identifies work- related causes of common mental and physical health problems.\n- Measures work stressors (sources of stress at work, also called psychosocial hazards) for individuals, organizations, groups of workers in specific workplaces, union members and others.\n- A Google Form, which takes about 20 minutes to complete, and is anonymous, secure and confidential.\n- Scientifically accurate and developed in collaboration with a team of university researchers and occupational health and safety experts.\n- The majority of questions come from the NIOSH Quality of Worklife questionnaire, used every 4 years as part of a nationally representative survey of US working people.\n- After completion of the survey by participants, a free, confidential report of personal results can be emailed directly to each participant (if they choose) and an aggregate/group-level report can be generated for the organization.\nHow can organizations use the HWS?\nIf you are a representative of a labor organization or a worker health and safety group, or other worker advocacy organization and you are interested in using the survey with a group of workers/members, please complete this short form.\nWe will then email you a unique and confidential link to the HWS with guidance about how to administer the online survey. After your group completes the survey, we will email you an anonymous, automatically generated, aggregate/group-level report. You can see how the results for your group or organization compare to scores on major work stressors from the NIOSH QWL national U.S. population survey.\nWhy use the HWS?\nAn essential step any union/worker advocate organization can take to protect the health & safety of members is to identify stressful and health-harming working conditions, based on the first-hand experiences of workers. This tool will allow you to start that process. The Healthy Work Campaign also provides additional tools and resources to guide you in working with workers/members to develop ideas for reducing work stressors and making workplace improvements.\nWhat has stress got to do with health & safety?\nUnions and other worker advocates have always organized to protect the health and lives of workers. While we need to continue to address the physical hazards in the work environment to prevent accidents, injuries, and exposures to toxins and infectious diseases, we now also know how important it is that we address work-related psychosocial stressors (sources of stress at work or “psychosocial hazards”), such as high job demands/workload, long work hours, low job control, low supervisor support, work-family conflict, bullying, harassment, discrimination and low rewards.\nResearch studies document that when we experience stressors like these at work, over a long period of time, the chronic stress that results takes a toll on our bodies and minds. The stress we experience is not just in our heads but in our bodies as well and it is caused by the policies, practices and demands in the workplace. Eventually, chronic exposure to work stressors can lead to burnout and depression, as well as high blood pressure and heart disease.\nWhat can you do with this survey data?\nThe HWS is just one tool in a toolbox for learning about work, communicating with workers/members and creating conditions for changes in the workplace. Membership meetings, workshops, interviews or focus groups can also be used to collect important information about issues at the workplace. The HWS can be used along with all these other tools.\nAfter a group completes the HWS, an automated report of the results is generated and sent to a designated representative. This report identifies harmful working conditions (psychosocial hazards) and can serve as a basis for discussion with workers/members about problems in the workplace. It can be presented during a membership meeting or a workshop, in an Executive Board meeting, or as part of a health and safety or labor-management committee meeting.\nThe Healthy Work Campaign (HWC) provides tools and various strategies and resources showing examples of organizations (including labor unions and worker centers) that have successfully organized to change and reduce work stressors. These interventions aim to improve workload/staffing and reduce bullying, work-family conflict, poor job security, and low supervisor support.\nThe HWC has also identified existing evidence-based guidelines (e.g., see the Healthy Workplace Participatory Program) for how to establish work groups/committees to address healthy work that include workers/members and other representatives. The intent of these work groups is to come up with ideas, or to design programs or policies that can address issues related to reducing work stressors. Workers have front-line knowledge of these issues and are often situated in the best location in an organization to problem solve. True worker participation in decision-making is also an important tool to enhance health and well-being.\nWhat kinds of questions are in the HWS?\n- Conflicting demands at work\n- Adequate resources (staffing, equipment)\n- Given freedom to decide how to do my job\n- Take part in making decisions\n- Do a number of different things\n- Use skills and abilities\nWorkplace social support\n- Supervisor is concerned with the welfare of those under him or her\n- The people I work with can be relied on when I need help\n- Demands of job interfere with family life\n- Demands of family interfere with job\n- At the place where I work, I am treated with respect\n- The job security is good\n- Promotions are handled fairly\n- The safety of workers is a high priority with management where I work\nWork Status/ Arrangements\n- Full-time, Part-time, Self-Employed\n- Type of Pay (Hourly, Salaried, Self-Employed\n- Second job\n- Supervise others?\n- Type of shift (day, afternoon, evening, night, rotating etc.)\n- Mandatory overtime\n- Work that is emotionally demanding\n- Work requires that you hide your feelings (surface acting)\n- Physical effort\n- Dangerous machinery/equipment\n- Exposures to vapors/gas/dust, extreme temps, excessive noise, heavy lifting (>50lbs)\n- Electronic monitoring\nPrecarious employment characteristics\n- Employment arrangements (Ex.

{"question":"Looking to improve my home's drainage system. What's the recommended installation depth for underground drainage pipes compared to above-ground rain chain anchoring?","answer":"For underground drainage pipes, it's recommended to dig a trench about 12 to 14 inches deep, with an additional 1/8 inch of fall for every foot the pipes run on flat lots. In contrast, rain chains require above-ground installation and must be anchored at ground-level to prevent swaying. The anchoring point needs to lead to a collection point, such as a gravel-filled pit, barrel, or diversion device that channels water away from the foundation. The underground pipes should be installed in undisturbed soil, avoiding non-compacted fill dirt near the foundation, while rain chains simply hang vertically from the gutter to their ground anchor point.","context":["Downspouts and gutters, when clean and maintained, perform an amazing service for you at a relatively low cost. Rainwater cascades down the roof, hits the gutters, gets whisked to the nearest downspout, then courses to the ground. This saves your foundation and siding from ruin.\nOne problem: they tend to be fairly unattractive. Little thought is given to aesthetics when manufacturing these powder-coated steel tubes; function is the only thing in mind. Are there alternatives that look better and maybe even work better?\nDownspout alternatives such as rain chains, inverted bells, and cups direct water in a more or less straight line to the ground or collection container. Some are literally chains. Others are a series of linked vertical cups, performing the same function as the chain-style ones.\n- All alternatives replace downspouts entirely.\n- They must be anchored at ground-level to prevent swaying.\n- They lead to a collection point, whether a gravel-filled pit, barrel, or diversion device that channels water away from foundation.\n- It often helps to have multiple chains that allow for better water direction.\n- Done right, downspout alternatives rise beyond mere functionality and become an artistic touch that graces your home.\n- Rain chains place style over function. Nothing can be more effective for directing water than the fully enclosed tube of a conventional downspout.\n- Alternative downspouts are often touted as green and eco-friendly. Yet they are no more green than conventional downspouts. In fact, since they divert less water into rainwater tanks for the purpose of water harvesting, they may be considered slightly less green.\n- At the ground-level end point, downspouts can lead directly into a diversion tube, effectively moving water as far away from the house as you wish. Alternatively, downspouts can run into concrete, plastic, or recycled rubber splash blocks, moving water more than three feet away. While rain chains can move water into tanks, it is difficult to accurately aim the water into diversion devices.\n01 of 04\nSingle Rain Chain\nThis type of rain chain is about as simple as it gets. All items are available at your local hardware or home improvement stores, such as Home Depot, Lowe's, Ace, or Menards.\nBegin with a minimum of 1/4 inch sized chain and cut to length so that it reaches from the gutter to the ground, with about one foot of chain draping on the ground.\nIf you want the modern look or just don't like rust, use a zinc-plated chain. It will remain shiny through the ages, as long as the plating is undisturbed.\nSingle chains are the worst for effectively directing water downward, but they are the least obtrusive.\n02 of 04\nHammered Copper Rain Cups\nShining and dancing with light, these copper \"inverted umbrella\" cups are hand-hammered to lend rich texture to the surface. Beyond the visual appeal, these wider types of \"chains\" do a better job of keeping falling water on the vertical.\nRain cups can be rather expensive, especially when multiplied several times over to accommodate all downspout areas. But they are most likely to elicit murmurs of admiration from your guests.\n03 of 04\nRain Chain Cups and Barrel\nThis is a solution to two problems. Rain cups descend from the gutter to direct rainwater into a barrel. The barrel prevents water from pooling around the foundation or, worse, blasting between the foundation and earth like a fire hose—a major cause of crawlspace flooding.\nAdding the rain barrel to the chains will certainly make this set-up green and eco-friendly. Water that normally would have been wasted can be collected in barrels and sent to garden beds by tubes. Rainwater collection and usage is a major cornerstone for developing a net-zero water use home.\n04 of 04\nMultiple Rain Chains Mean Better Flow\nGrouping rain chains is another quick and simple way to replace your downspouts. Keep the existing gutters and run the chains through the hole at the end of the gutter.\nThis owner formed a circle out of stiff wire (not visible) to keep the chains separated within the rain gutter.\nBecause gutters are formed from thin sheet metal and often not secured attached to the home's fascia, you should be cautious about loading them up with too much weight when you add multiple chains.","Installing Downspout Drain Lines\nInstall Downspout Drain Line TIPS\n- Use solid SDR-35 PVC pipe\n- Use only 45 or 22.5-degree bends underground\n- Call 811 to locate underground utilities\n- Don't put pipes in un-compacted fill dirt\n- CLICK HERE to Get Tim's FREE & FUNNY Newsletter\nDEAR TIM: I need to bury downspout drainage pipes in my yard before the yard is seeded. Where is the best place to put them and how deep should they be buried? What type of pipe do you like? How far away from the house should the pipes extend? A friend suggested using pop-up valves to help water the lawn and plants. Are those a good idea? Rich T., Jackson, MS\nDEAR RICH: Stormwater drainage from roofs is a topic sometimes ignored by builders and homeowners alike. I can't tell you how many houses I see where the downspouts empty onto a splash block at the base of the foundation.\nOften these homeowners are plagued with water seepage into basements or crawlspaces and it's no wonder. A heavy rainfall on an average sized roof can produce hundreds and thousands of gallons of water that spew from the different downspouts located around the house.\nCLICK HERE to read another column of mine that shows you how much water can come off a roof in as moderate rainfall. You'll be AMAZED!\nI regularly visit the Southwestern part of our great nation and am somewhat astonished that stormwater is not collected and stored by homeowners that live in this arid area. Laws passed decades ago often prevent homeowners from harvesting and storing water that falls on their land. River systems that feed into the Colorado River are affected by this because the water in this drainage basin eventually flows to and through the Hoover Dam.\nThe water held back by this dam is used to irrigate crops grown for many people in the USA. The water also makes electricity that's sent to tens of millions in southern California and other parts of the Southwest. It's a complex situation.\nIf you're permitted to collect and store rainwater, this water can be easily collected and piped to above or below ground plastic barrels or tanks. If the storage is above-ground and placed at the highest part of the lot, drip irrigation piping can be extended from the water storage.\nThe stored rainwater can then be used to help irrigate plants that otherwise would have enjoyed the drink before the house was built.\nA simple phone call to your local town office will allow you to discover if you're permitted to harvest rain water.\nWhy No Harvesting\nThe issue with harvesting rainwater is that it lowers the cubic-feet-per-minute of flow in the major rivers. If you collect the rainwater and then use it to water plants, drink and then put back into the earth via your septic system, that water never makes it into the river and then down to the large dams.\nContracts negotiated decades ago count on the water making it to the dams. The entire water-rights issue on private land in the Western USA is very complex. It's far beyond the scope of this column.\nUrban Storm Sewers\nBefore you proceed with any work, you should check with your local government to see if they have special stormwater rules and regulations. Sometimes you have to pipe this water to special underground storm sewers or above ground channels. Some local governments or agencies have no rules or regulations.\nI usually dig a trench about 12 to 14 inches deep for downspout drain lines. The fastest way is to rent a trenching machine from a local tool rental.\nIf you have hard clay soil, or rocky soil, you can use an electric hand-held demolition hammer tool to dig a trench.\nThese electric demolition tools can be outfitted with chisel tips to crack larger rocks or clay spade shovel tips to carve through dry or damp clay soil.\nIf the lot is fairly flat, the pipes will get deeper the farther they extend as you should create 1/8 inch of fall for every foot the pipes run. The pipes should never be buried running parallel in the non-compacted fill dirt that is placed against the foundation.\nOver time this dirt or soil settles and it can cause piping to break, kink or develop reverse, or backwards, slope.\nDownspout piping can cross the un-compacted fill at a 90 degree angle so that it is placed in undisturbed soil. But as the soil adjacent to the house settles over time, this small length of piping needs to be checked and lifted to ensure it drains.\nSDR-35 Pipe And Fittings\nSmooth 4-inch-diameter plastic SDR-35 sewer pipe is the material I prefer to use. This pipe has a smooth interior and closely resembles the thick-walled plastic piping used for interior house drain and vent piping.\nFittings can be permanently welded to the pipe with PVC cement. These fittings come in all types including the all-important Wye fitting where one pipe connects to another.\nIf you don't want to use glue, you can buy rubber-gasketed fittings. These fittings have a rubber o-ring incorporated into each end of the fitting.\nYou need to keep the pipe clean of all sand and dirt when you work with gasketed fittings. You also need to use a coarse file to taper the cut ends of any pipe. If you don't file the ends, you'll never slide the pipe into the rubber gasket. You also lubricate the pipe and gasket with liquid dish soap.\nIf you install either type as directed, tree roots that create clog nightmares will never be able to enter the piping system. I am not a huge fan of the corrugated flexible black piping for downspouts. It can crush easily and it is nearly impossible to clean with professional drain cleaning equipment.\nAll underground bends in downspout piping should be made with 45 degree or smaller angle fittings. Ninety degree angles underground become obstacles in the event the piping has to be cleared by a professional drain-cleaning company.\nYou can use a 90 degree angle at the base of the downspout where the underground piping begins, as a drain cleaner can usually insert his metal snake here with no difficulty.\nPipe Away From House\nIf you are allowed to drain your stormwater on your own lot, do so as far away from your home as possible. Try to pipe all water to a low point away from your home.\nDon't drain more water to a point on your lot than would have ended up there naturally before your home was built. Simply keep in mind where the water is falling on the roof and where that water would drain if your house had never been built. If you pipe the water where it used to go, you should not harm any of your surrounding neighbors.\nPile Up Rocks\nWhere the downspout drain line terminates above ground, it's going to cause erosion because you're concentrating lots of water from your roof at this point. Create a large area of softball-sized rocks that the water will flow onto. This absorbs some of the energy and spreads out the water.\nInline popup valves do a good job of allowing rainwater to discharge onto your property, so long as you are allowed to drain the stormwater on your property. Try to strategically place them where they will do the most good for your vegetation.\nPhotographs & Videos\nAn invaluable tool that will come in handy in future years is a collection of photos and videos that are shot as the downspout piping is being installed. Videos are best because you can talk and describe what the camera is seeing. Upload these to cloud storage and pass them onto the future buyer of your home.\nIf you stand back and include parts of the house in the photos and place shovels or other objects in the photos for scale, these prints will help you locate the pipes in the future. Over time it is very easy to forget where hidden pipes pass in the ground.\nMy own photos saved me lots of work in the past. I had to install a small field drain in a side yard. The photos I had taken years before allowed me to locate within five minutes the drain pipe to which the new drain was to be connected. I could have dug for an hour and missed the pipe by inches without the aid of the photographs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b68ff8c2-9a96-4f7a-ab0e-56aa7144a0d6>","<urn:uuid:fdcd8af7-86c4-41e9-95f9-7079af791a0c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do traditional tagine and feijoada meals differ in their preparation times and cooking methods?","answer":"Tagine and feijoada have notably different preparation and cooking approaches. A tagine requires about 30 minutes of marination time for the chicken in lemon juice, followed by approximately one hour of cooking time where the meat is first browned and then simmered with spices and vegetables. In contrast, feijoada demands significantly more preparation time, requiring overnight soaking of multiple ingredients (pig parts, cesina, and beans) separately, followed by multiple cooking stages the next day including boiling meats twice, cooking beans for 45 minutes, adding meats for another 20-30 minutes, and additional simmering time with mashed beans for 20-30 more minutes.","context":["What’s the first word that comes to mind when I think about the food of Northern Africa and the Middle East? Colorful! The array of fragrant, exotic spices found in their open-air markets are used in abundance in native dishes and have become a trademark of their cuisines. Warming spices of turmeric, saffron, paprika, cinnamon, coriander and cumin are widely used in the aforementioned regions, and they create a harmonious experience for the eyes, nose and palate. Poultry, lamb, beef and goat are also staple proteins to the Arab diet and are often accompanied by rice and sometimes couscous. Replicating the cuisine from this part of the globe isn’t difficult at all and doesn’t require a trip to an exotic grocer — most ingredients can be easily found in the spice and World Flavors aisles at your local grocery store.\nNow I’m sure a “tagine” (or “tajin”) may sound fancy and complicated to some, but it is simply a type of dish from North Africa. It gets its name from the cone-shaped clay pot with detachable base in which it is traditionally cooked and served in. For this recipe, a proper tagine pot isn’t required — a cast iron or heavy-bottomed pot with a lid will do just fine.\nThe following recipe for chicken tagine hails from Morocco, but the ingredients are commonly found in most cuisines from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. It gets its bright yellow color from the addition of turmeric. Substituting beef or lamb for the chicken will work just fine, and feel free to play with different spices if you so choose — add a dash of cumin or coriander to the braising liquid, or even a pinch of saffron.\nTraditionally, tagines are served with couscous: tiny pellets made from semolina flour (the same ingredient in traditional pasta) that are cooked by pouring boiling water over them and then allowed to steam for about 15 minutes. The couscous soaks up the lemony olive sauce, making it an ideal base for serving.\nLemony Chicken Tagine with Olives\nServes 4 (2 pieces per person)\n1/4 cup lemon juice\n8 bone-in chicken thighs and legs, skin removed (4 of each)\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne\n2 tablespoons canola, vegetable or grapeseed oil\n2 cups roughly chopped onion (about 2 medium)\n2 teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n3 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n1/2 cup pitted green olives, halved (about 12)\nZest of one lemon (sub chopped preserved lemon if you can find it)\n1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro\nCombine lemon juice and chicken in a large zip-top plastic bag. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator 30 minutes. Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.\nPat chicken dry with paper towels. Mix together the salt, black pepper, turmeric, and cayenne, and dredge each piece in flour until evenly coated. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet with high sides or a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Shake off excess flour from chicken and brown it in batches, cooking for 3 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Promptly remove the chicken from the pan and repeat procedure with remaining the chicken.\nAdd onion to pan and sauté until it just begins to soften. Add ginger and garlic, stir to keep it from burning it, and cook for a minute. Return the chicken to the pan. Add the broth, olives, zest, and cinnamon stick. Bring mixture to a heavy simmer (not boiling), reduce heat to low, cover with a lid, and simmer for about an hour or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Halfway through cooking, remove the lid and let it simmer uncovered as this will allow the liquid to reduce and thicken up a bit.\nTo serve, discard the cinnamon stick and spoon some of the sauce over each portion. Sprinkle paprika and chopped cilantro on top. Serve over cooked couscous or rice.","Bolivia also celebrates Carnaval, and kids are off school, for a grand total of 5 days… (!). Work will also be off, for Monday and Fat Tuesday – the best thing to do? Get together with friends, and plan fantastic meals! Let’s see if I’ll be able to come up with a fairly decent Brazilian feijoada, using my Bolivian ingredients… More to come on this post, but for now, let’s just get our appetites ready for what could be in-store for us! 😮\nWhenever I meet someone from Brazil, I ask them what their favorite food is. After steak (picanha), it is almost always feijoada. It’s an old bean, pork and beef recipe, brought to South America, like many foods in many places, by those intrepid, globetrotting spice traders, the Portuguese, and then enhanced, like many other foods in many other places, by African slaves and their descendants.\n1 1/2 cups dried black beans (turtle is preferred, for texture)\n1/8 lb. carne seca/cesina (about the size of your flat hand)\n1/8 lb. pork ribs (about 2 thick ribs)\n1 pig foot, split\n1-2 pig ears\n1 pig tail (smoked, if possible)\n4 strips smoked bacon, finely chopped\n1 paio sausage, cut into thick slices\n1/2 lb. of linguiça calabresa (Portuguese-style smoked pork sausage), cut into thick slices\n1 white onion, diced\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tbsp olive oil\n2 bay leaves\n1 orange, peeled (remove all of the white pith!)\n8 cups water\nThe night before, soak the pig foot, tail and ear in cold water to draw out blood/impurities. Separately, soak the cesina in cold water overnight. In yet another bowl, soak the beans in cold water.\nThe next day, put the foot, tail, ear and cesina in a pot with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, boilf for 10 minutes and then drain. Refill the pot with cold water, bring to a boil again and cook until the meats are tender and beginning to fall apart. Drain well.\nIn a large pot or dutch oven (preferred), place the beans and 8 cups water, bay leaves, and peeled orange. Bring to a boil, then lower to simmering. Cook for 45 minutes. Add all meats, and cook for 20-30 more minutes.\nIn a saute pan, fry the onion and garlic on olive oil. Add about 1 cup of beans from the pan, cook briefly and mash well with the back of a spoon. Return the whole mess to the dutch oven and adjust for salt. Let simmer for about 20-30 more minutes, until beans are tender and meats are falling apart willingly. Remove from heat and let cool about 10 minutes.\nServe with boiled, medium-grain white rice, orange slices, farofa and (chiffonaded) collard greens (that have been quickly fried in canola oil and drained on paper towels.\n2 tbsp canola oil\n1 small onion, minced\n4 slices smoked bacon, minced\n1 cup toasted manioc flour (farinha de mandioca torrada)\n1 bunch scallions – only the dark green tops! – thinly sliced\nsalt and black pepper to taste\nSaute the onion and bacon in the oil over low heat until the bacon is fully rendered and crisp. Add the flour a little at a time, stirring to coat. Add the scallions when the flour has just begun to brown.

{"question":"Looking at musical icons Ziggy Stardust and Chuck Berry, what similarities and differences can be found in their influence on rock and roll's evolution?","answer":"Both Ziggy Stardust and Chuck Berry were influential figures in rock and roll, but in different ways. Chuck Berry was one of rock's greatest architects who established the genre's fundamental elements - he created a distinct aesthetic approach by turbocharged blues forms with syncopated swing rhythms, and developed iconic guitar riffs like in 'Johnny B. Goode' that defined rock's core structure. The themes he introduced - anti-establishment ethos, youth culture, and cars - became part of rock's DNA. Meanwhile, Ziggy Stardust represented rock's evolution into more theatrical and conceptual territory. Through Ziggy, rock music became more than just songs - it had to be 'three-dimensional' and affect people as a lifestyle. While Berry laid rock's foundation through pioneering guitar work and songwriting, Ziggy pushed the boundaries by incorporating science fiction themes and elaborate stage performances.","context":["Bowie & Burroughs: Ziggy Explained\nBurroughs: Could you explain this Ziggy Stardust image of yours? From what I can see it has to do with the world being on the eve of destruction within five years.\nBowie: The time is five years to go before the end of the earth. It has been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things that they thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock-and-roll band and the kids no longer want rock-and-roll. There’s no electricity to play it. Ziggy’s adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, ‘cause there is no news. So Ziggy does this and there is terrible news. ‘All the young dudes’ is a song about this news. It is no hymn to the youth as people thought. It is completely the opposite.\nBurroughs: Where did this Ziggy idea come from, and this five-year idea? Of course, exhaustion of natural resources will not develop the end of the world. It will result in the collapse of civilization. And it will cut down the population by about three-quarters.\nBowie: Exactly. This does not cause the end of the world for Ziggy. The end comes when the infinites arrive. They really are a black hole, but I’ve made them people because it would be very hard to explain a black hole on stage.\nBurroughs: Yes, a black hole on stage would be an incredible expense. And it would be a continuing performance, first eating up Shaftesbury Avenue.\nBowie: Ziggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a starman, so he writes ‘Starman’, which is the first news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch on to it immediately. The starmen that he is talking about are called the infinites, and they are black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in Greenwich Village. They don’t have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black-hole jumping. Their whole life is travelling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles Brando, another one is a Black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie the Infinite Fox.\nNow Ziggy starts to believe in all this himself and thinks himself a prophet of the future starman. He takes himself up to incredible spiritual heights and is kept alive by his disciples. When the infinites arrive, they take bits of Ziggy to make themselves real because in their original state they are anti-matter and cannot exist in our world. And they tear him to pieces on stage during the song ‘Rock ‘n’ roll suicide’. As soon as Ziggy dies on stage the infinites take his elements and make themselves visible. It is a science fiction fantasy of today and this is what literally blew my head off when I read Nova Express, which was written in 1961. Maybe we are the Rodgers and Hammerstein of the seventies, Bill!\nBurroughs: Yes, I can believe that. The parallels are definitely there, and it sounds good.\nBowie: I must have the total image of a stage show. It has to be total with me. I’m just not content writing songs, I want to make it three-dimensional. Songwriting as an art is a bit archaic now. Just writing a song is not good enough.\nBurroughs: It’s the whole performance. It’s not like somebody sitting down at the piano and just playing a piece.\nBowie: A song has to take on character, shape, body and influence people to an extent that they use it for their own devices. It must affect them not just as a song, but as a lifestyle. The rock stars have assimilated all kinds of philosophies, styles, histories, writings, and they throw out what they have gleaned from that.\nBurroughs: The revolution will come from ignoring the others out of existence.","The world of rock ‘n’ roll has lost its most distinguished elder, with the passing of Chuck Berry at the age of 90 in his home state of Missouri on Saturday. Berry was not just the genre’s greatest architect, but also its archetypal great-grandfather – cranky, irreducible, immutable and utterly inimitable. Fittingly, he outlasted nearly all of his peers, still thrilling audiences onstage until late 2014. Those pioneers still standing cannot match Berry’s staggering, monumental influence on the genre which came to define the second half of the 20th century.\nIt might have been The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys who introduced the world to rock ‘n’ roll, but each of them cut their teeth covering – and shamelessly imitating – Berry’s pioneering work, on tracks like Roll Over Beethoven and Rock and Roll Music (both covered by The Beatles), and Carol and Little Queenie (both covered by The Stones).\nInevitably, Stones guitarist Keith Richards led the tributes, tweeting “one of my big lights has gone out” in the early hours of Sunday morning, shortly after the news broke.\nSuch high sentiment sounds almost an understatement – to this day, Richards’s use of slow, arching bent notes and blocked, two-string solos often sounds like something Berry might have played 50 years ago.\nThe master-pupil relationship was laid bare during a classic scene in Hail! Hail! Rock ‘n’ Roll, a documentary about an all-star concert Richards arranged to mark Berry’s 60th birthday.\nOn camera, Berry rips into the bewildered Stone for not playing a lick quite to the elder’s liking – although it sounds fine to most ears. On another occasion, he punched Richards for touching his guitar. “Chuck’s biggest hit,” Richards later quipped.\nOne theory for this rivalry is that whatever praise Richards heaped on him over the years, Berry never quite forgave The Stones for becoming multimillionaires by so clearly assimilating his sound and selling it to White America.\nAnd it was such a marketable sound — primal, youthful, cheeky, irreverent, anti-authoritarian, the voice of intergenerational revolt.\nBerry’s gifts were three-fold – not just as the first rock ‘n’ roll guitar hero or even the genre’s quintessential songwriter, but foremostly, as a rock ‘n’ roll stylist. In a way that perhaps can only be compared to Louis Armstrong’s role in the evolution of jazz or James Brown in the world of soul, Berry wrote a distinct aesthetic approach that was to have tectonic consequences on contemporary culture.\nThe way Berry turbocharged blues forms and progressions with syncopated swing rhythms was as polarisingly potent as it was unprecedented. Yes, Elvis’s earth-shattering debut That’s All Right, from 1954, predated Berry’s first single by 12 months – but Presley’s rockabilly swagger sounds positively tame next to the distorted, fuzzy, percussive attack of Berry’s guitarwork in his own debut, Maybellene.\nThat track announced a singular artistic vision already formed, and was followed in less than a year by both Thirty Days (To Come Back Home) and Roll Over Beethoven — a pitch-perfect teenage put-down of their parents’ stuffy classical music.\nThis trio alone would have been enough to solidify Berry’s reputation in the annals of rock folklore, but the sense of generational angst was refined further in School Day (Ring! Ring! Goes the Bell) and Rock and Roll Music, both from 1957. The following year brought Sweet Little Sixteen and the future rock ‘n’ roll standard Johnny B Goode.\nThat song’s unforgettable guitar intro – built around a canny, bebop-inspired chromaticism which broke and rewrote all the rules – has appeared with subtle differences in numerous songs by Berry and others, but that iconic, stop-start riff never sounds cleaner, crisper or better stated than here. Put simply, the 12 bars that open Johnny B Goode could be stated as the very definition of rock ‘n’ roll.\nThe lyrical themes and imagery Berry tapped into – an anti-establishment ethos, youth culture, cars, a celebration of the mundane and of the moment – would come to define the very DNA pumping throughout rock ‘n’ roll’s bloodstream. Meanwhile, the muscular guitar riffs and hot-rodding of the blues he wrote make up the genre’s core bone structure to this day.\nWhether or not Berry received his dues while alive might be a matter of debate. While he never enjoyed the kind globetrotting, stadium-filling success of his greatest imitators, he was already established as a legend in his fifties, and enjoyed reverential critical and audience applause until his final days onstage.\nWhat however is clear, on the most sad occasion of his death, is that without the birth of Chuck Berry, the world of popular music would look nothing like it does today."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38fe914a-08bc-498b-ad40-e33d545fa210>","<urn:uuid:6369b234-acee-4642-bc82-0cb831c10d81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities exist between Martha Marlene Nielsen's and Bobby Lynn Itta's efforts to preserve traditional Native Alaskan crafts?","answer":"Both artists are working to preserve dying traditional arts - Nielsen is self-taught in making items from sockeye salmon skin, a rare technique she teaches to reintroduce this lost skill, while Itta has been sewing traditional parkas for 18 years and teaches skin sewing because it is a dying art with very few practitioners remaining.","context":["Four self-directed, six-month-long mentorship opportunities pair Alaska Native artists with mentees in traditional, physically tangible art forms. Artists were selected by Bunnell from the pool of artists participating in and working on projects for Bunnell’s national touring exhibition, Protection: Adaptation and Resistance. The mentorships explore construction of traditional regalia and garments with support from The CIRI Foundation.\nTCF Mentorship Descriptions:\nMentor artist Bobby Lynn Itta is teaching skin sewing and regalia to Bonnie Scheele. Bonnie lives in Anchorage and owns a small business named Twenty Mile Trading Company where she creates jewelry out of reindeer antler. Bonnie is a reindeer herder and is Inupiaq from Nome. She wil learn to make a parka. Bobby Itta is Inupiaq from Utqiagvik and has been sewing parkas for 18 years. She is the designer and owner of Arctic Luxe and Alaska Fur Cache. Arctic Luxe is a brand that promotes and sells handmade indigenous clothing and accessories. Bobby believes it is very important to teach these skills because traditional skin sewing is a dying art. There are very few that know how to make parkas, and it is important to teach and share this knowledge.\nJennifer Younger is a Lingit artist and designer who is learning the skills of Lingit regalia construction from Carol Hughey, an apparel designer with extensive textile skills who was adopted into the Kiks.ádi Clan. Hughey has worked in collaboration with Lingit tribal citizens to create contemporary at.óow (ceremonial sacred objects). Younger and Hughey will create a protest robe in the Lingit tradition of the shaming totem pole. The robe will express outrage over the destructive commercial Sacro Herring fishery that violates the Sovereign rights of the tribal citizens. They will unveil this robe at the Alaska Board of Fisheries hearings in Ketchikan Alaska in January 2022. The robe will be dedicated and danced at herring celebrations for many generations to come. The early years of the robe will protes extracted fishing practices. The artists hope the robe’s later years will celebrate their respect for all things over commercial exploitation\nMarlene Nielson, a Yup’ik artist from from Kokhanok, on the south shore of Lake Iliamna, is self-taught in the art of making baskets, wallets, and jewelry with sockeye salmon skin. Salmon skin art was seen as a lost skill in her area which inspired her to reintroduce the rare technique by teaching students. Nielsen has been creating art with fish skin since 2002 and has completed a 2017 IAIA Artist-in-Residence. Nielson mentors Yup’ik artist Peter Williams, a Yup’ik culture bearer, artist, designer, filmmaker, and educator originally from Akiak currently based in Sheet’ká (Sitka, Alaska). His hand-sewn works repurpose skin from self-harvested traditional foods, bridging worlds of Indigenous art, fashion, and subsistence. The mentorship focuses on researching and documenting traditional Yup’ik fish skin tanning and sewing techniques using natural materials, stitches and methodologies in the creation of a fish skin hood. Through collaborating with Elders, other artists and museums where there are information gaps, the project aims to disseminate traditional knowledge to future generations of Alaska Natives through video, photography, audio recording, written text, experimentation, process-oriented research, bark tanning and hand-sewing object creation.\nMentor artist Lily Hope leads her apprentice Sydney Akagi through weaving a child-sized Chilkat dancing blanket, inspired by one in the Alaska State Museum. The time together will focus on technical mastery of ﬁber spinning and dyeing, warping up the ﬁrst rows, weaving black and yellow borders, inserting drawstrings, negotiating design adaptations, interlocking colors, braid insertion, dropping warps, properly curving the bottom border, and weaving side braids. The skills learned by the apprentice ensure she retains all skills needed to weave a full-size Chilkat dancing blanket. In addition to techniques, Hope and Akagi will focus on spiritual aspects including gratitude prayers, daily family and home care practices, and energetic surrender to the work. In this way, the apprentice can teach her daughter(s) and nieces to weave with the Chilkat teachings fully intact.\nThank you to The CIRI Foundation for funding these mentorships.\nSydney Akagi (Tlingit/Japanese)\nIrene Lampe (Tlingit)\nPhotographs courtesy of\nSydney Akagi and Lily Hope","Since August 2015, the Institute of American Indian Arts has hosted month-long artist residencies, and recently the school announced its lineup for the Fall 2017 Artist-in-Residence program. Native American and First Nations artists visit the school in Santa Fe, New Mexico to make art and interact with both the campus community and the Santa Fe arts community. The program also includes public receptions and artist talks with each of the artists.\n“We often think art is created in solitude. But that’s not necessarily true. The artists participating in the residency program are coming to make art as part of a community,” said Dr. Lara M. Evans (Cherokee Nation), the Artist-in-Residence program director, in a press release. “It’s a chance to come together, to share creative processes and the meanings behind their materials and techniques. It’s chance to experiment, too. Each artist brings something new to the community, and we all become part of the history of the new work artists create during their residencies. It’s very exciting!”\nSeptember 1-30, 2017\nThree female Native American artists will converge on the Institute of American Indian Arts in September for the Artist in Residence Program. Janice George (Chepximiya Siyam), from Squamish Nation, Canada, is a master weaver and textile artist who learned to weave from Coast Salish weaver Susan Pavel and Subiyay-t Bruce Miller of Skokomish in 2003. George integrates Squamish teachings into her work from her late grandmother Kwitelut-t Lena Jacobs and other Squamish ancestors.\n“In this short time of my weaving life, a few of my mentors have left this earth. Their breath is carried on in the teachings I pass on. I feel and see the pride that comes from reclaiming our inheritance from our elders and ancestors when we weave and when we wear our beloved weavings,” George said in an Institute of American Indian Arts press release. “We are taught spiritual protection is part of what we are wearing and feel the love that is put in each hand movement it takes to make a robe.”\nGeorge co-authored “Salish Blankets, Robes of Protection and Transformation, Symbols of Wealth” with Willard Joseph and Leslie H. Tepper. For the last 12 years, she has been teaching her textile skills across Salish speaking territory.\nLeanne Campbell, an enrolled member of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe or Schitsu’umsh—meaning “Those who were found here” or “The Discovered People”—also counts the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation located in central Washington and the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho among her lineage. Campbell embraces her history and culture, and speaks the Schitsu’umsh language. She is most known for her unique skills in traditional and cultural arts with beadwork and basketry.\nHer beadwork is a mix of pictorial, geometric designs and old style floral designs of the Northwest Columbia Plateau. Campbell gained valuable experience and knowledge by working over the past 24 years with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe. She’s currently the Historic Preservation Program Manager/Curator for the tribe.\nMartha Marlene Ann Nielsen is Yupik from Kokhanok, Alaska, located on the south shore of Lake Iliamna, which is the largest lake in Alaska that is home to several species of fish. Since she was young, Nielsen has helped to preserve sockeye salmon for the winter. She is self-taught in the art of making baskets, wallets and jewelry with sockeye salmon skin. Salmon skin art was seen as a lost skill in her area, which inspired her to reintroduce the rare technique by teaching students of all ages.\nOctober 4-November 4, 2017\nThe Institute of American Indian Arts will welcome four Native American artists during October including Erica Lord, who draws on her mixed race cultural identity—she is of Athabaskan, Iñupiat, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese, and English descent—to explore concepts that exist within a contemporary indigenous experience and how culture and identity are affected in a quickly changing world. Lord uses a variety of mediums to construct new and challenging representations of race.\nBorn and based in Alaska, Peter Williams strives to express and celebrate oneness in all things, with an emphasis on the human spiritual relationship with nature. He sees this connection in his art as imperative for healing the human soul and the well-being of the planet. Meat is a large part of Williams diet; before a hunt, he smudges and prays for a safe and clean hunt. He asks the animals for their lives before shooting them. Williams sees these acts to honor the animals as a way to enable their spirits to visit again. He has demonstrated skin sewing seal and sea otter fur by hand, and says that each stitch binds the human world closer to the animal world.\nThrough his label Shaman Furs, Williams carries on the historic art of elegant and simple textile construction built to endure Alaska’s elements. He presented at New York Fashion Week in 2015 and his first runway show as at Brooklyn Fashion Week in 2016. That same year, he was profiled in the New York Times.\nSeattle-based artist Ryan Fedderson (Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation/Okanogan/Arrow Lakes) creates multi-layered environments and interactive sculptures alongside intimate studio work. Her tongue-in-cheek work has a pointed message and provides an opportunity for a re-examination of shared histories through humor and fun, and hands-on engagement. She often addresses hypocrisies and injustices in contemporary American culture in regard to race, class and gender in her work.\nNovember 6- December 6th, 2017\nThe final four Native American artists visiting the Institute of American Indian Arts include Athena LaTocha, Frank Buffalo Hyde, Jason Reed Brown, and Wanesia Misquadace.\n“Born in Anchorage, Alaska, Athena LaTocha is an artist whose monumental works on paper explore the tenuous relationship between man-made and natural landscapes. She’s had her work shown across the country including a solo exhibition at the Institute of American Indian Arts Museum of Contemporary Native Arts this year. LaTocha lives and works in New York City and Peekskill, NY.”\nFrank Buffalo Hyde (Nez Perce/Onondaga Nation, Beaver Clan) was born and currently lives in Santa Fe. He uses American icons to explore the miscommunication of cultures. He often turns the stereotypical imagery of the “Indian” on its ear with his own brand of satire. He has shown internationally and in 2013, a suite of 13 paintings titled “SKNDNS-Native Americans on Film” was purchased by the National Museum of the American Indian.\nRaised between the urban and rural landscapes of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, Jason Reed Brownis a blacksmith artist. His designs stem from a desire to combine his lifetime of exposure to Northwest Coastal art and a city lifestyle. He “translates” Northwest Coastal Native art into the medium of metal. Before attending the Institute of American Indian Arts, he worked as a tattoo artist and muralist. While at IAIA, he discovered a passion for sculpture, specifically working with metal.\nWanesia Misquadace is a master of birch-bark biting, a traditional art that she puts into a contemporary context by using the patterns as jewelry templates and combining the birch bark panels with metals and stones. World-renowned master metalsmith artists like Lane Coulter and Fritz Casuse have been her mentors and teachers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a7eaebcd-3fd1-4d18-a74e-f2430cd4139a>","<urn:uuid:8d2b7657-6d5c-4d99-ace8-205e131f8438>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which building project is larger - the Cyrus Tang Foundation complex in Suzhou or the Zymé winery in Italy?","answer":"The Cyrus Tang Foundation complex in Suzhou is larger, with an area of 15,000 square meters, while the Zymé winery has an area of 3,000 square meters spread over three levels.","context":["As the headquarters of Cyrus Tang Foundation (CTF) in mainland China, the project is a complex which integrates multiple functional spaces, including the foundation's offices, a museum for displaying various gifts that the foundation has received, and spaces for holding exchange activities with its college members, including exhibitions, conferences, and training, etc.\nArchitect: The Architectural Design and Research Institute of Zhejiang University Co., Ltd. (UAD)\nLocation: East Tai Lake Ecological Park, Wujiang District, Suzhou, China\nArea: 15,000 sqm\nTeam: Dong Danshen, Yang Yidong, Teng Meifang, Lin Zaiguo\nInterior design: Woods Bagot, Hangzhou Dianshang Building Decoration Design\nLandscape design: The Design Institute of Landscape & Architecture China Academy of Art (Zheng Jie Studio)\nStructural engineers: Zhang Mingshan, Xu Chen, Li Benyue\nMEP engineers: Li Haojun, Gong Zengrong, Dong Shaobing, Huang Zhengjie, Liu Haifeng\nPhotography: Zhao Qiang\nFrom the architect: Situated at the central area of East Tai Lake Ecological Park in Wujiang District, Suzhou, China, it enjoys favorable site conditions and beautiful landscape. The design focuses on the integration with the surrounding environment, inherits CTF's mission of serving disadvantaged communities with love and passing on the spirit of giving, and produces a \"dissolved\" and green building.\n1. Organic Layout\nWith the continuous development and growth of the foundation, its demands for functional spaces will continue to increase. The design fully considers the necessity of leaving space for future development and therefore applies an organic layout on the irregular site, to allow flexible expansion and adjustment of the building's outline. Future extensions can be constructed naturally alongside the existing layout, without destroying the overall unification and harmony. Additionally, the curvilinear contours break through the building’s monotonous interfaces, and the layout strategy of interpenetration enables the architecture to coexist with the natural landscape in the most environmentally friendly manner.\n2. \"Dissolved\" Volumes\nMain functions are designed on 1F (storey height: 7.0 meters) in order to minimize the architecture’s intrusion to the park where it is located. Meanwhile, the rooftop garden functions as elevated vegetation, which not only increases the park's green area, but also provides a beautiful open viewing platform and activity venue for visitors. The protruding building volumes (museum, exhibition area, and multi-function hall, etc.) hide behind the rooftop garden, like a few sculptures, highlighting the “solidness” of the architecture while also strengthening the hierarchy of spaces.\n3. \"Dissolved\" Facades\n1F is mainly enclosed by glazed curtain walls. Featuring a rhythmic arrangement of green glass with different transparency, its erected facade echoes the nearby bamboo and dissolves into the surroundings. Besides, facades of the protruding volumes also present bamboo-like vertical patterns, which blend together as an integrated whole. Those refined facades partly result from the elaborate arrangement of the building's equipment: all the tube wells and outlets are all integrated orderly in the roof design.\n1. Efficient Layout\nSince only the office area is used perennially while the exhibition area and the multi-function conference hall are utilized occasionally, the design employs a centralized layout, where the office area, exhibition area, multi-function hall and museum are incorporated in one complex. Each functional space can be utilized independently, and at the same time enables efficient integrated operation with others. When utilized independently, each area is set up with its own entrance and exit.\nBased on site conditions, the office area and the museum are respectively located on the west and the southwest side, resulting in a tranquil ambience on the west part of the site. To connect with the northern outdoor activity venue, the multi-function conference hall is arranged on the north of the site. And the exhibition area is on the east side, next to the secondary entrance. All of those functional spaces are joined by the central hall, which ensures the proper distance among each section as well as the unity of the building.\n2. Green Technologies\nThis project won the Chinese Certificate of Green Building Design Label (Two Star) in 2014, for its application of many fully developed green technologies in China, such as geothermal heat pumps, building-integrated photovoltaics, tubular daylight devices, green roof, automated shading system, green lighting and intelligence operation management that saves land, energy, water and building materials.\nDuring the initial design process, simulation software was used for the optimized analysis of the building’s natural ventilation and lighting. On the other hand, this is not only an efficient and eco-friendly architecture, but also an exemplary platform for display and exchanges of green technologies, which gathers high-tech resources that universities have brought in.\nThe architecture is the outcome of effective multi-disciplinary integration and collaboration. Green designs, functional optimization and fusion with the site were fully considered throughout the design process, thereby an architecture that blends and coexists with the ambient natural environment was created.\n[ VIEW MORE ARCHITECTURE IN CHINA ]\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Yangtze Village: Ecological Tourism in Badong by Latitude Architectural Group\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Suzhou MEICAN ZONE Innovative Office Cafeteria by Sanshangshan Decoration Design Co., Ltd.","Harpo verdepensile green roofing system in the architectural design of the new Winery Zymé by ACME\n4 May 2017\nOak barrels of the Zymé winery’s pure organic wine ages in the karstic caverns found in an ancient sandstone quarry in San Pietro in Cariano, in the historic Valpolicella growing area. Here, living rock – geological layers marking the history of the earth’s movements – freezing water rising from an underground spring – are folded into architect Moreno Zurlo’s design.\nTop quality wine is produced with sustainable production methods and careful attention to detail, by a winery with a warm welcome visitors, maturing in underground areas of fragrant oakwood and Corten stell.\nThe guiding concept of the project is the fashioning of a material sign that will actually enhance the wine, a sign that embodies a synthesis between the earth and its resources, the sun’s energy, and man and his work. The architecture of the winecellar eloquently expresses this culture, which is the continuous striving for a state of balance between man and his environment.\nThe project has its roots in a dynamic interrelationship, particularly intense, with the pre-existing site, a 15th-century ex-quarry of sedimentary stone, known as La Mattonara. What emerges, then, is an energy-filled relationship with the surrounding environment and its history, one that, far from being negatively impacted by the structural complex, is rather nourished by what the cellar offers.\nThe ground-level component is cladded with limestone that emerged from the initial excavation, while deliberately-placed interstices, along with Cor-ten steel inserts, conjure up the ex-quarry, a space now dedicated to the maturation and ageing of wines in oak barrels.\nThe progression of the external envelope, taken together with the plantings in the hanging gardens, create a certain irregularity along the summit of the structure, mitigating the visual impact of the lower level and dialoguing harmoniously with the facing hillslope of the natural amphitheatre.\nThe spatial envelope is further characterised by a second skin, in Cor-ten steel, that “de-materialises” the bulk looming above it; the motif is based on the veining of the grape leaf, with the objective of achieving a more aesthetic-functional rapport with the surrounding environment.\nWith regard to its layout, Zýmē’s new cellar develops over three levels and comprises some 3,000 square metres. A system of ramps and stairway lifts keeps visitor and production activities in separate spheres. Other aspects fundamental to the project are keyed to specific production requirements.\nThe natural process of ageing, for example, is ensured by the constant temperatures characteristic of the underground facility. Placing spaces underground is doubly efficient, with respect to both energy savings and creation of bio-climate conditions.\nThe high quality of the architecture for Zýmē is the fruit of shared affinities, values, and breadth of vision. These mutually-held qualities and efforts have given solidity and meaning not only to the architecture, but to the position as well that Zýmē enjoys in the world of wine.Source and images Courtesy of AcMe studio associato.\nLocation: San Pietro in Cariano, Italy Architects:AcMe Studio Associato di Architettura Principal: Moreno Zurlo, Raffaela Braggio, Giovanni Castiglioni, Filippo Legnaghi Engineering: Marco Montresor engineer Collaborators: Daniele Salvador, Andrea Malesani (security) Construction: PROGRESS spa – Construction Valpolicella Structures: Delta Engineering – Marco Montresor engineer Acoustic: Ivan Travaglini engineer Lighting: Dario Bettiol – Zumtobel group Facades: Premetal spa Hydro / thermal and sanitary: From Plants Ventilation equipment: Sordato plants Electrical system: Electro 2R PV system: Solarworld Supplying companies: Auroport-Eleva Fantoni Group, Fats Stones, Green Park, Harpo Group, ICM, Intergeo, Iscom Riverclack, Technosystem, Lavarini Stones, Malin, Pavaresine, Quintarelli, Sicurfer, Morini, Timby, Pescini glassware, AGC glass, Sun guardian glass, Zumtobel Group Client: Celestino Gaspari-azienda agricola Zymè Cost: 6 million euro Year: 2015 Photographs:Jurgen Eheim, Stefano Gasparato, Courtesy of AcMe studio associato"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f49c0887-63f3-4f56-91df-ca162820d76a>","<urn:uuid:76777d1a-19f9-497f-a642-07c42b4ae8f2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hola amigos! I want to start poultry business - what was initial investment for Mary and Rolex when they started their farms?","answer":"Mary Wairimu started with an initial investment of about Sh50,000, with over half going to construction of pens, and began with 60 chicks. Rolex Wasonga started more modestly with just 30 indigenous birds bought from neighbors, then expanded by buying 430 two-week-old Kuroiler birds using money from a chama (group savings) where members contributed Sh3,600 monthly.","context":["Umoja 1 estate in Nakuru County is a few metres from Lanet Army Barracks. The proximity to the barracks has made residents scramble to live in the estate as they consider it one of the most secure.\nIt is mid-morning when this writer arrives in the middle-income suburb. The residential area is so quiet one can hear their own footsteps. The children who ran around playing in the evening or at the weekend are off to school, and so are many of their parents who have gone to work.\nMy knock on the gate of Mary Wairimu is greeted by sounds of chickens squawking and trilling, an indication that I had disturbed their peace.\nSoon, Wairimu lets me into her 60 by 110ft plot where her poultry farm is located. “This is my office,” she says as she bends to arrange a carton box full of eggs in trays that she will deliver to a supermarket in Nakuru town as soon as we finish the interview.\n“I have 300 kienyeji hens, 50 cockerels and about 100 chicks. They were all about 1,000 in December, but I have since sold many.” She keeps the birds in a wooden pen behind her three bedroom bungalow. “These birds have offered me a nice job that I just do from the house. It has been two years and so far, so good,” says Wairimu who started up with about 60 chicks.\nWairimu quit her job as a sales manager at a flour milling company after working for 10 years to concentrate on poultry farming. She had reared the birds as a side hustle for two years.\n“I noticed that I was earning more from my chickens than from my job. I, therefore, thought that I should quit and put all my energy on poultry,” says Wairimu, whose initial investment was about Sh50,000, with over half of the money going to construction of the pens.\nPrior to quitting, she had approached Naivas Supermarket, which offered her ready market for her eggs.\n“I talked to the management of the outlet and they agreed to consider me as a supplier on condition that my products are of good quality.” When she delivered her first supply in early 2013, the management was happy with the quality of the eggs and gave her the go ahead.\n“The quality control manager picked one of my eggs, broke it and liked the pale yellow yolk and the smooth shell. He did that on three others and allowed me to supply.” Her supply at the supermarket is capped at 100 trays per month.\n“I am able to meet the target because I collect five trays of the fertilised eggs every day. I further sell 30 trays to a brooder in Pipeline, about 3km from my home and the rest to residents. Prices of a tray of 30 eggs range from between Sh450 and Sh600 or between Sh15 and Sh20 per egg.”\nSo what is her secret to getting quality eggs that have made her maintain two corporate clients?\n“For the strong and smooth shells, I ensure the chickens get plenty of calcium by feeding them on omena (fish meal) and enough greens for the yellow yolks.” She has planted kikuyu grass, spinach and sukuma wiki (collard green) in her compound which her chickens feed on. They feed on the grass every day as they strut the compound.\nWairimu also feeds her chickens on kienyeji mash, maize germ and wheat bran. “I feed the birds on kienyeji mash in the morning and supplement with either pounded maize, wheat grains or omena in the afternoon.”\nBesides eggs, Wairimu sells an average of 15 cocks a month at between Sh800 and Sh1,500 depending on their sizes. A day-old chick sells for Sh100, Sh200 for a month-old and Sh350 for a two months old. She sells up to 100 chicks a month.\n“I do not use an incubator to hatch the eggs but let the hens hatch them naturally. I have made carton brooders where selected hens brood them. At any given time I have 10 to 15 hens sitting on eggs. Each hen sits on between 10 to 12 eggs. I spread old gunny bags in the cartons to increase the warmth,” says Wairimu, noting that 90 per cent of her eggs hatch successfully.\nBack in 1999, Wairimu had tried her hand in keeping exotic layers, but this only lasted for about year due to high production costs and low income. Apart from selling eggs, chicks and cockerels, she also produces manure and cow feeds from chicken waste comprising of droppings and used poultry mash.\n“I separate the waste from the manure using a sieve and sell part of it as cow feeds at Sh400 per bag while manure goes for Sh300,” says Wairimu, who gets two 90kg gunny bags of the cow feeds and three of manure every week, which she sells to a dairy farmer and vegetable farmer in the estate. She gets most of her clients through referrals.\nDr Ann Ambula, a livestock expert from Egerton University, says green matter helps to supply carotene to chickens, which is used in the formation of the yellow pigmentation in yolks. “Besides the yellow colour, eggs from hens fed with greens have more Vitamin A as the greens are rich in the nutrient,” says Dr Ambula.\nShe advises that poultry farmers should allow their chickens to walk in the compound to eat plants and collect insects and worms, which boosts their health and thus quality of eggs. Molo Livestock Officer Simon Mburu says chicken waste is rich in proteins that cows need.\nHe noted chickens do not exhaustively consume their feeds and thus, some of the nutrients are wasted after digestion. Nakuru County Poultry Farmers chairman Benson Anjimbi advises farmers to study market needs before poultry farming.","How I cushion my poultry venture from virus effects\n- Wasonga, 30, started poultry farming in May 2019 with just 30 indigenous birds that he bought from his neighbours.\n- It is from the chama earnings that Wasonga expanded his chicken business, buying a batch of 430 two-week-old Kuroiler birds.\n- A radio programme on poultry making feeds opened his eyes and he enrolled for a short-course on poultry production at the nearby Elego Poultry farm.\n- He currently makes his own feeds using maize germ, fish meal, wheat bran and rice straw. This has helped him cut costs in half.\nDressed in a navy-blue overcoat, brown trousers and matching gumboots, Rolex Otieno Wasonga walks with a bucket full of poultry feeds from one feeder to another, refilling them.\nHis birds, 1,600 of them, flap their wings with excitement as they receive their first portion of the daily share.\n“The coronavirus pandemic has messed up business. Buyers are no longer placing requests,” says Rolex as he holds one of the birds to feel its weight.\nWasonga, 30, started poultry farming in May 2019 with just 30 indigenous birds that he bought from his neighbours.\nAt the time, the farmer was working at a road construction firm not far from his home in Kwoyo-Kadera village, some 30 kilometres from Awendo in Migori County.\nBut the work was intermittent, prompting him to start the agribusiness for more income.\n“While working at the firm, we formed a chama called Door-to-door Youth Group comprising 12 members. Every month we contributed Sh3,600 and gave it to one person,” explains the farmer.\nIt is from the chama earnings that Wasonga expanded his chicken business, buying a batch of 430 two-week-old Kuroiler birds.\nHe, thereafter, fitted the poultry house with a water tank where he stores the water he harvests. He also expanded the coop to host new stock.\nBut as the flock grew bigger both in size and age, more challenges arose for the Row Poultry Farm proprietor.\n“Feeding such a large number of birds isn’t easy, especially as they became older,” he observes.\nIn a day, a mature bird eats between 70-90 grammes, thus he ended up spending up to Sh9,000 weekly.\nA radio programme on poultry making feeds opened his eyes and he enrolled for a short-course on poultry production at the nearby Elego Poultry farm.\n“The training helped me a lot on basic poultry management, housing, vaccination and feed formulation,” he says.\nSTRICT VACCINATION REGIME\nHe currently makes his own feeds using maize germ, fish meal, wheat bran and rice straw. This has helped him cut costs in half.\n“I buy the materials from a miller in Kisumu, fish meal from local fishermen and sunflower from farmers in Migori and Homa Bay counties,” he says, but the Covid-19 crisis and floods have made the materials scarcer and expensive. To cushion himself, Wasonga free-ranges the birds for some hours.\n“Normally, I feed the birds on commercial products for the first two months then afterwards I introduce the home-made feeds,” Wasonga, who has set aside the first generation of his birds as a breeding stock, points out.\nAccording to him, using chick mash as a starter makes the birds respond to the feeds much faster. However, as they grow, their feed consumption rate rises remarkably, making commercial feeds unsustainable.\nHe also grows greens for the birds by soaking several tins of yellow maize for three days in water and then allows them to germinate.\n“After three days, I place the sprouting seeds on a heap of soil for them to germinate. In seven days, they develop shoots and leaves, which the chickens feed on,” explains Wasonga, who sells the birds at between Sh800 and Sh1,000 each, with Christmas and Easter holidays being his peak seasons.\nHe also sells unfertilised eggs at Sh350 a crate, mostly to his neighbours while fertilised ones go for Sh750 a crate. He, however, mainly keeps the eggs for his hatchery.\nBesides the coronavirus outbreak, heavy rains being experienced in many parts of the country, especially in western Kenya, have affected the farmer’s chicks due to the cold weather.\nDennis Kigiri, a poultry production expert from Egerton University, says proper poultry management is crucial for the success of a farming venture and entails adherence to a strict vaccination regime and disease prevention.\n“Manufacturing own feeds works well when you have a source of high quality feed ingredients, equipment and the animal nutrients requirements,\" Kagiri says.\n****Get it fast\nChallenges in poultry business\n- Main challenges include high cost of feed ingredients, with a bag of maize currently going for an average of Sh3,600 locally.\n- Quality feeds must have maize, sunflower, wheat pollard and soya as well as amino acids and many other ingredients.\n- The high cost of these raw materials is one of the reasons poultry feeds are expensive."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4180f2ad-fea4-47c5-add1-fd4957417342>","<urn:uuid:1b228354-7106-408d-a6b3-af99c8eb56f5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do natural fermented foods contribute to gut health as probiotics, and what daily water intake recommendations can help manage constipation?","answer":"Fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, and kefir naturally contain probiotics that help restore healthy balance to the gut. These foods contain live microorganisms that can provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. Regarding water intake, experts recommend approximately 2 liters per day for women and 3 liters for men to manage constipation. A practical method to calculate individual water needs is to take your body weight, divide it by two, and drink that many ounces daily. Research has shown that lower fluid intake is linked to intestinal constipation. Interestingly, studies have found that sparkling water may be more effective than tap water in relieving constipation, with one study showing that 1 liter of mineral water daily for three weeks improved bowel movement frequency compared to regular tap water.","context":["Alternative Therapies for Constipation\nThere’s nothing fun about constipation. Even the word is isn’t fun! But if you deal with constipation on a regular basis, know that you’re not alone. Although it’s a topic not many of us like to talk about, about 16 out of every 100 adults in the United States suffer from constipation, and some believe that number is much higher. This condition is not only uncomfortable, but if untreated it can lead to serious conditions like hemorrhoids or fecal impaction.\nNot only that, but some people who are constipated find that they also develop nausea or lose their appetites, which can in turn lead to nutritional deficiencies. That is why it’s not surprising that some people with chronic constipation may experience unexplained weight loss and fatigue.\nKeep reading to learn some creative ways to treat constipation and prevent it from becoming a long-term problem.\nCommon constipation treatment\nCommon constipation treatment involves certain medications designed to stimulate the bowels, as well as fiber supplements that work to bulk the stool. However, sometimes these medicines are not enough to help resolve constipation. Some cases of constipation may be caused by conditions like:\n- Blockages in the colon or rectum\n- Nerve health issues of the colon or rectum\n- Motility issues with the muscles involved in elimination\n- Hormonal issues like diabetes, pregnancy, or thyroid health conditions that can upset the balance of hormones, and in turn cause constipation\nNo matter what the cause of your constipation, one thing is for sure—it’s uncomfortable and unpleasant. The following treatment options can help relieve constipation, and in turn, improve your quality of life.\nDrink more water\nSometimes the simplest actions can have the greatest impact. Although drinking water can seem like a simple thing to do, most of us don’t drink enough water for optimal health. Some experts recommend that most women should drink about 2 liters of water per day, while most men should drink about 3 liters a day. One good way to determine how much water you should drink is to calculate your body weight and divide it in two. The resulting number is the number of ounces you should drink per day.\nWater is vital to staying hydrated, and hydration is necessary to prevent constipation. Research shows that lower fluid intake is linked to intestinal constipation. Additionally, research shows that sparkling water may be more effective than tap water in relieving and resolving functional indigestion and constipation issues. A more recent study published in 2016 confirmed these study findings when they found that 1 liter of mineral water a day for three weeks improved the frequency in bowel movements as compared with tap water.\nPrebiotics and Probiotics\nYou may have heard of probiotics in the context of gut health. If so, it is probably no surprise that research shows potential for probiotics and prebiotics as a treatment for constipation. Probiotics are living microorganisms that can provide health benefits to the host when consumed in adequate amounts. However, probiotics cannot flourish without their fuel, otherwise known as prebiotics.\nMost prebiotics are classified as dietary fiber, but not all fiber-containing foods are prebiotics. Examples of prebiotic foods include chicory, garlic, leeks, onions, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, bananas, whole wheat, yams, and sweet potatoes.\nThe combination of prebiotics and probiotics, also known as synbiotics, can help restore balance to gut bacteria in the body, in turn improving digestion. Research shows that an imbalance in the gut bacteria may be a leading contributor to functional constipation as well as constipation-related irritable bowel syndrome. Synbiotics may be the key to treating such conditions.\nIn fact, a 2017 study looked at the impact of the prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides, along with synbiotics made up of the prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides with various probiotic combinations on gut health symptoms. Study results show that these prebiotics and probiotics helped improve stool frequency, consistency, and some other symptoms related to constipation. Another study looked at the impact of probiotic treatments in older adults. Study results show that compared to a placebo, probiotics improved constipation in elderly individuals by 10-40%.\nBe sure to also include fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, kefir, and other probiotic foods that help restore healthy balance to the gut.\nExercises and biofeedback therapy\nExercise is not only good for heart health but can help treat constipation. Research shows that constipation is associated with sedentary behavior, so promotion of physical activity, and especially certain yoga poses and stretches, could help resolve this. However, if your constipation is caused by a motility issue in the rectum, then exercise may not be enough. That is where biofeedback therapy comes in.\nBiofeedback therapy involves electrical stimulation of the anus to help restore rectal sensation in people that have impaired rectal muscle stimulation. A 2017 study found that this type of therapy can also help those with functional constipation related to a condition known as dyssynergic defecation in which contraction or inadequate relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles occurs during attempted defecation. Study results show that biofeedback therapy is a safe and effective therapy for individuals with this condition to help relieve their constipation.\nJust like a shoulder or back massage can relieve pain or stress in those muscles, abdominal massage can help relax the intestinal tract, which can help relieve constipation. It does this by helping to release gas and waste products as well as stimulate muscle contractions in the intestines.\nA 2016 study looked at the impact of abdominal massage on relieving post-operative constipation. Study results show that abdominal massage that was applied to patients diagnosed with postoperative constipation not only helped reduce symptoms of constipation, but it also helped to reduce the time intervals between episodes of defecation, and increased quality of life. Similar results were seen in a study of abdominal massage applied to people with Parkinson’s who suffered from constipation.\nTo reap the benefits of abdominal massage, you should learn the appropriate techniques from a qualified healthcare or massage practitioner that specializes in such massage techniques.\nAs you can see, when you have constipation, the road to recovery doesn’t always have to end with a laxative or stool softener. If you find that these medicinal methods are either not effective or are not tolerated well, there are many other ways to help relieve your constipation.\nNot all methods will work for everyone, however, so you must be patient and willing to try unique methods like those listed above. If your constipation starts to cause symptoms that affect your quality of life or induces unintentional weight loss, be sure to see your healthcare provider for assessment and treatment.","What are they?\nProbiotics are live microorganisms that are intended to have health benefits when consumed or applied to the body. Probiotics may contain a variety of microorganisms. The most common are bacteria that belong to groups called Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Other bacteria may also be used as probiotics, and so may yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate probiotics as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, or a drug.\nWhy are they needed?\nPeople often think of bacteria and other microorganisms as harmful “germs,” however many are actually helpful. Probiotics might:\n- Help digest food, destroy disease-causing cells, or produce vitamins.\n- Help your body maintain a healthy community of microorganisms or help your body’s community of microorganisms return to a healthy condition after being disturbed\n- Produce substances that have desirable effects\n- Influence your body’s immune response.\nProbiotics have shown promise for a variety of health purposes, including prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile), prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in premature infants, treatment of infant colic, treatment of periodontal disease, and induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.\nWhere do you find it naturally?\nProbiotics are added to some foods like yogurt and cultured cottage cheese. They are naturally occurring in fermented foods like buttermilk, kefir, and sauerkraut. Raw cheese made from unpasteurized milk is another source.\nProbiotics for kids\nChildren develop their microbiome in the womb and through early childhood. It’s thought that an unhealthy microbiome is responsible for many diseases.\nA study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that giving infants probiotics in the first three months of life may help prevent colic, constipation, and acid reflux.\nSome decent brands for probiotics:\n- Nature’s Way:\n- Ultimate Flora:\n- Check the label to make sure the yogurt you choose has “live and active cultures.”\nProbiotics have an extensive history of apparently safe use.\n- Since long-term probiotic effects on kids are unknown, children shouldn’t use probiotic supplements as a preventive remedy, unless recommended by a doctor.\n- The risk of harmful effects from probiotics is greater in people with severe illnesses or compromised immune systems. When probiotics are being considered for high-risk individuals, such as premature infants or seriously ill hospital patients, the potential risks of probiotics should be carefully weighed against their benefits.\n- Possible harmful effects of probiotics include infections, production of harmful substances by the probiotic microorganisms, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from probiotic microorganisms to other microorganisms in the digestive tract.\n- Some probiotic products have been reported to contain microorganisms other than those listed on the label. In some instances, these contaminants may pose serious health risks.\n- Kids with compromised immune systems may experience infection. Others may have gas and bloating. Probiotics can cause serious side effects in very sick infants. Check with your pediatrician before giving probiotic supplements to your child.\nSource: Internet, CDC, NIH, FDA, Healthline, Medical News & Others\nThe views expressed in this article should not be considered as a substitute for a physician’s advice.

{"question":"What's the relationship between gut microbes and carbohydrates in affecting mood?","answer":"Gut microbes and carbohydrates affect mood through different but interconnected pathways. Gut microbes influence mood by affecting the stress response system, altering nerve cell sensitivity, and influencing serotonin activity as part of the gut-brain communication system. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, can directly boost serotonin levels to improve mood, which may explain why depressed people often crave them. However, carbohydrates can lead to weight gain, which may result in negative body image and worsen depression, potentially creating a cycle that could affect the gut microbiota balance.","context":["When your gut grumbles or growls, it’s speaking to your brain. And it’s a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Evolution favors guts that can tell a brain what they want.\nSo it’s not surprising that the brain and the gut should have a reliable communications connection. But suppose the gut’s messaging system was hacked by foreign invaders sending a different sort of message, messing with your mind. Guess what? It is. Unless you’re a special sort of experimental mouse, your gut already hosts something close to 100 trillion invaders. They’re members of perhaps a thousand different species from half a dozen or more phyla of microbes.\nActually, it would be more proper to call most of those invaders colonists. In the first few days after birth, a baby’s gut becomes home to diverse families of microbes that normally hang around for a lifetime. These colonist microbes outnumber your own cells. But they pose no threat of declaring themselves a ruling majority and taking over your body. They are allies, helping you digest your food and assisting in protecting you from disease. And they send important signals to your brain.\nThe precise mix of these colonist microbes is not the same in all individuals. It depends on your age, your genes, what you eat and where you live, among other things. And any one person’s mix can change over time.\n“We are only beginning to understand how the diversity and distribution of these prominent phyla contribute to health and disease,” write Jane Foster and Karen-Anne McVey Neufeld in the May Trends in Neurosciences.\nYour gut’s colonial microbes aid in the development of the immune system, which battles malicious bugs that aren’t normally part of your gut’s microbiota — its microbial repertoire. “Germ-free” mice raised without colonist microbes have a weaker immune system and show exaggerated responses to stress. Studies have also shown that gut microbes influence signaling in the HPA axis (for hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal glands, the key players in the body’s response to stress).\nEarly in development, gut microbes affect the wiring of nerves in the stress system, influencing how the body reacts to stress for the rest of its life. That suggests that the microbiota’s impact extends to some aspects of mental health, a function only recently appreciated.\n“We suggest that gut microbiota are an important player in how the body influences the brain … and influence risk of disease, including anxiety and mood disorders,” write Foster and Neufeld, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.\nDepression, for instance, might be related to snafus in stress-axis signaling that microbes can influence. But the bugs may also affect the brain more directly, adjusting the sensitivity of nerve cells in the gut that send signals to the brain to influence behavior. Gut bacteria also appear to alter the chemical activity of nervous system messenger molecules such as serotonin, an important player in mood disorders including depression.\nAlmost all the evidence establishing this new understanding of the gut’s germs comes from mouse studies. So the lessons for using this knowledge to help out humans are limited. Nevertheless, the mouse research suggests some possibly promising avenues to explore.\nFor one thing, treatment with “probiotics” — friendly microbes consumed not as medicine but as a nutritional supplement — may prove helpful in fighting anxiety and depression. Probiotics reduce anxiety and depressive behavior in mice, and similar effects have been seen in a few human studies. Those studies, though, merely showed lower scores on stress and anxiety questionnaires in healthy people after they took probiotics. It will take tests in actual psychiatric patients to see whether probiotics will really be useful treatments for people with serious mood disorders.\nIn any event, it’s not very likely that manipulating the mix of microbes in the gut will become a cure-all for mental illness. But it’s also not a good strategy to treat depression and other mood disorders by focusing only on the brain while neglecting the gut microbiota. That would be like blaming global warming on power plants while ignoring cars and cattle (not to mention the cattle’s own microbiota). Complex systems pose problems that can’t be solved by pretending that the issue is simpler than it is.\nAnd the gut microbiota’s impact on the body and brain may be even more complex than research to date has shown. Gut microbiota may affect learning and memory. Studies of gut microbiota might even offer new insights into such baffling medical problems as autism, obesity and, perhaps, personality disorders.\nSo far, the evidence is not conclusive on those points. But some scientists have a gut feeling about it.\nFollow Tom Siegfried on Twitter at @tom_siegfried.\nJ.A. Foster and K.-A.M. Neufeld.

But recent research on diet and mood has revealed that food may be a major factor.\nIs the Brain Connected to the Gut?\nScientific research demonstrates that about 95 percent of “serotonin, a chemical neurotransmitter responsible for your mood, is produced in your gastro-intestinal tract.” The gastro-intestinal tract, commonly referred to as your gut, is also responsible for about 80 percent of your body’s immunity. So it seems that a poor diet will damage the gut, resulting in reduced serotonin levels and increasing your chances of developing anxiety and depression.\nLast September, ABC News reported on the connection between anxiety and the gastro-intestinal tract saying, many “are beginning to recognize the power of healthy gut bacteria. The average adult carries up to five pounds of bacteria—trillions of microbes—in their digestive tract alone.” And if there is a connection between your gut and your brain, as more and more scientists believe there is, then all that “bacteria may play a role in disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia and autism.” Some patients have even demonstrated a link between strep bacterium and OCD.\nDr. James Greenblatt, a psychiatrist based around Boston, says that testing for chemical byproducts inside the body can reveal microbial imbalances that may be causing psychiatric conditions by building up too much dopamine in the body. Greenblatt says he doesn’t “know why this test isn’t done on every psychiatric patient” because it is a “more common scenario than we know.”\nThe Food behind the Issues\nSome of the foods that may contribute to anxiety and depression include your typical junk foods that are processed and high in artificial ingredients, refined sugars and fats. This type of food is often comforting but delivers a swift crash after ingestion.\nExcess intake of saturated fats and animal fatty acids can cause a fluid shortage in new cell membranes. This affects the brain, which is the richest source of fatty acids in the entire body. A lack of proper membrane fluid can affect moods, behavior and mental function.\nThough it is viewed as a mood improver, alcohol can also contribute to depression. This is because it creates vitamin deficiencies in the body. Caffeine is a stimulant that also gives a short high and can help with energy levels. But reliance on caffeine can easily backfire to result in sleeping problems, even insomnia.\nCarbohydrate rich diets are another example. Carbs can help boost serotonin levels which improves mood. Fascinatingly, many depressed people crave carbs, and this may be a physical response. However, a diet which is substantially comprised of carbohydrates can cause weight gain as a side affect. Often times, weight gain results in a negative body image which only creates a new source of depression.\nCan Better Food Solve the Problem?\nOf course, it is impossible to shift all the blame onto diets alone. In a chicken and egg scenario, depression often leads patients towards a poorer diet which, in turn, worsens brain chemistry. But the cycle can also begin with bad diet habits that result in poor mental function causing depression and perhaps reinforcing unhealthy eating.\nBut just as poor diets can be a major factor, healthy diets are being touted as an important piece of healing from depression. “Diet therapy” is a term which involves pumping the body and the brain with rich nutrients and vitamins in order to fight depression with proper diet and supplementation.\nSome important dietary supplements for mental functionality include:\n•Tryptophan—a natural relaxant to reduce anxiety and depression, it can increase serotonin levels.\n•Omega 3’s—essential to healthy mental functioning. Some studies show that omega 3 fatty acids powerfully impacted schizophrenic patients by working to correct membrane abnormalities.\n•Vitamin B1—needed for energy production and nerve cell health.\n•Vitamin B6—helps properly balance hormones.\n•Vitamin C—boosts immunity and can help cleanse the liver and aid digestion.\n•Magnesium—important to control the hypothalamic activity in the pituitary adrenocortical axis. This improves the stress response system and reduces anxiety.\nSo which types of foods should you eat and which should you avoid? One infographic by Hartmann Direct answers this question. It explains the importance of avoiding processed meat, especially with lots of salt.\nExercise Can Also Alleviate Depression\nJust like diet is an important aspect of general health as well as fighting depression, exercise is another factor that improves all around wellness and can be especially important in dealing with depression. Harvard Health explains that exercise may relieve depression because it “enhances the action of endorphins, chemicals that circulate throughout the body. Endorphins improve natural immunity and reduce the perception of pain. They may also serve to improve mood.” And yet “another theory is that exercise stimulates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which may directly improve mood.”\nExercise works by directly targeting brain chemicals to help your mood. But it also helps your total body recover by lowering blood pressure, fending off heart disease and cancer, increasing self-esteem and making your feel happy. When depressed, many people want to sleep and avoid physical activity. But exercise is needed to help the body and the brain.\nBoth diet and exercise can play an important role in relieving depression. Some cases may still require medication but can still be helped by general healthy habits and key foods supplements.\n(depression / shutterstock)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:179ff646-b881-40db-a09b-f5c2e5fa263d>","<urn:uuid:97bc0faa-a6bf-4816-88bb-ac2338b9a98d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do hybrid mattresses compare to Navy rack sleeping arrangements in terms of space efficiency and cooling features?","answer":"Hybrid mattresses and Navy rack sleeping arrangements have different approaches to space efficiency and cooling. Navy racks are designed to be extremely space-efficient, measuring approximately 77 inches in length and 27 inches in width, and featuring a hinged design that allows them to be folded up when not in use. Their cooling capabilities primarily depend on additional accessories like sheets and ventilation. In contrast, hybrid mattresses combine a pocketed coil support core with several inches of foam or latex comfort layers, allowing for natural airflow through the coil system while maintaining comfort. Their cooling effectiveness depends largely on the materials used in their comfort layers, with latex or gel-infused memory foams sleeping cooler than traditional memory foam. However, hybrids don't offer the space-saving features of Navy racks, as they cannot be folded or stacked.","context":["A Navy rack is a unique and essential piece of furniture found on naval vessels that serve as sleeping quarters for the enlisted personnel. These racks are often a subject of curiosity for those who have never served in the Navy, as they differ significantly from the typical beds one would find on land.\nIn this article, we will explore what a Navy rack is, its dimensions, and how to make it more comfortable for the sailors who rely on it for rest during their demanding duties. We will also delve into the importance of Navy rack curtains and sheets, offering tips on how to choose the best bedding. By the end of this article, you'll have a better understanding of Navy racks and how to improve their comfort and functionality.\nWhat is a Navy Rack?\nA Navy rack, also known as a berthing or bunk, is the primary sleeping accommodation for enlisted sailors aboard naval vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, submarines, and other ships. These racks are designed to maximize the use of limited space on naval vessels while providing sailors with a place to rest and sleep during their often long and demanding deployments at sea.\nNavy racks come in various sizes and configurations, depending on the type of ship and its specific layout. The most common rack sizes are \"single racks\" and \"double racks.\" Single racks are designed for individual use and measure approximately 6.5 feet in length, 30 inches in width, and 5.5 feet in height. On the other hand, double racks are designed to accommodate two sailors and are slightly larger, measuring around 6.5 feet in length, 42 inches in width, and 5.5 feet in height.\nThe design and construction of Navy racks prioritize space efficiency. They are typically stacked in multiple tiers, with narrow passageways between them for access. This arrangement allows naval vessels to maximize the use of available space, as ships must accommodate a large crew and various equipment.\nWhile Navy racks are functional and space-saving, they can be quite Spartan and uncomfortable, making it essential for sailors to find ways to improve their sleeping conditions.\nTips to Help Make Your Navy Rack More Comfortable And Efficient\nHere are some tips to help you to optimize the comfort and efficiency of your navy rack.\n- Personalizing Your Space: To make your Navy rack more comfortable, consider adding personal touches. While space is limited, you can bring small items like family photos, a favorite book, or a soft pillow to make your rack feel more like home.\n- Mattress Toppers: Navy rack mattresses are usually thin and firm to save space. Consider investing in a comfortable mattress topper or memory foam pad to add cushioning and make your sleeping surface more inviting.\n- Organizational Accessories: Navy racks have storage compartments for personal belongings, and using dividers and organizers can help keep your space tidy. This not only makes your area more comfortable but also more functional.\n- Earplugs and Eye Masks: Life aboard a naval vessel can be noisy and well-lit at all hours. Earplugs and eye masks can help you sleep better by blocking out unwanted noise and light.\n- Stay Hydrated and Well-Nourished: Proper nutrition and hydration are essential for restful sleep. Avoid consuming caffeine or heavy meals close to bedtime, and be mindful of your dietary choices.\nNavy Rack Curtains and Why They Are Important\nCustom navy rack curtains play a vital role in ensuring the privacy, comfort, and functionality of the sleeping quarters on a naval vessel. Here's why they are essential:\n- Privacy: Navy racks are often stacked in tight quarters, and maintaining privacy is challenging. Curtains offer sailors a degree of personal space and a sense of privacy during their off-duty hours. This privacy is crucial for unwinding, changing clothes, and personal grooming.\n- Light Control: Naval vessels operate around the clock, which means that sleeping quarters can be well-lit at any time. Navy rack curtains help block out ambient light, allowing sailors to sleep during daylight hours or when overhead lights are on.\n- Noise Dampening: Navy ships can be noisy places, with machinery, engines, and crew members working around the clock. Curtains can help dampen noise, creating a more conducive environment for rest.\n- Division of Space: On ships with open berthing areas, curtains can help separate sleeping spaces and provide a sense of individuality for each sailor.\n- Added Comfort: Beyond privacy and practicality, curtains also contribute to the overall comfort of the Navy rack. They add a personal touch to the otherwise spartan environment and help create a cozy sleeping nook.\nOrganizing your Navy Rack Using Custom Navy Rack Curtains\nCustom curtains not only add a touch of individuality but also serve a functional purpose in terms of privacy, light control, and organization. Here's how you can organize your rack space using custom Navy rack curtains:\n1. Measure Your Rack\nStart by measuring the dimensions of your Navy rack. Ensure you take accurate measurements of the width, height, and length of the space where you plan to hang the curtains. This will help you order or make curtains that fit perfectly.\n2. Choose the Right Fabric\nSelect a fabric that suits your personal style and preferences. Ideally, choose a fabric that is durable, easy to clean, and offers some degree of privacy. Cotton, polyester, or a blend of these materials can work well. Avoid fabrics that are too sheer, as they may not provide the desired privacy.\n3. Select a Color or Pattern\nDecide on the color or pattern for your custom curtains. This is where you can add a personal touch to your sleeping space. You can choose a color that matches your bedding or go with a pattern that reflects your personality or interests. Darker colors may help block out light more effectively.\n4. Hanging Mechanism\nThere are various ways to hang custom curtains in your Navy rack. You can use curtain rods, tension rods, or hooks. Make sure to choose a method that is secure and doesn't damage the ship's infrastructure. Check with your ship's regulations or guidelines to ensure you're using an approved hanging method.\n5. Curtain Length\nWhen measuring the length of your curtains, make sure they reach from the ceiling to the floor. This provides maximum privacy and light control. You can also choose to have the curtains reach only to the height of the mattress for a cozier feel.\n6. Securing the Curtains\nEnsure that your curtains are secured in a way that prevents them from swaying or falling during rough seas or sudden ship movements. You might need to use clips, ties, or Velcro straps to keep the curtains in place.\n7. Maintenance and Cleaning\nNavy ships can be dusty and exposed to various elements. Make sure your curtains are easy to remove for washing or cleaning. Choose a fabric that can be machine-washed or wiped down if necessary.\n8. Personal Touch\nConsider adding personal touches to your curtains. You can sew or attach pockets for storage, such as small shelves for books or personal items. This will help you keep your space organized and functional.\n9. Privacy Panels\nIf you're sharing a berthing space with other sailors, you can add separate privacy panels that can be pulled closed when you need personal space or opened when you want to interact with your neighbors.\n10. Safety and Compliance\nAlways ensure that your custom Navy rack curtains comply with safety regulations and guidelines on your ship. They should not obstruct emergency access, ventilation, or any safety equipment.\nBy customizing your Navy rack with curtains, you not only create a more comfortable and personalized sleeping space but also a more organized and functional one. Your custom curtains can offer privacy, block out light and noise, and serve as storage solutions, helping you make the most of your limited living space aboard a naval vessel. Remember to check with your ship's regulations and guidelines to ensure that your curtain setup is in compliance with safety and operational requirements.\nNavy Rack Sheets: Why You Need Them and How to Choose the Best\nSheets are an integral part of creating a comfortable and hygienic sleeping environment in a Navy rack. Here's why you need them and how to select the best ones:\n- Hygiene and Cleanliness: Navy rack mattresses are often made of vinyl or other easy-to-clean materials. However, to maintain a high level of hygiene, it's essential to use fitted sheets. These sheets can be easily removed, laundered, and replaced, ensuring a clean and fresh sleeping surface.\n- Comfort: Navy rack mattresses are not known for their plushness. Adding quality sheets can significantly improve the comfort of the sleeping surface. Look for sheets made from soft and breathable materials, such as cotton, that will provide a more comfortable night's sleep.\n- Size and Fit: Navy rack mattresses come in standard sizes, and it's crucial to choose sheets that fit snugly. Fitted sheets designed for Navy racks are widely available and ensure a proper fit without excess fabric.\n- Durability: Navy racks endure a fair amount of wear and tear. Choose sheets that are durable and can withstand frequent washing. Look for high thread count sheets for a more robust and long-lasting option.\n- Breathability: Given the limited ventilation in Navy racks, it's important to choose sheets that allow for adequate airflow to prevent moisture buildup and promote a more comfortable sleeping environment.\nNavy Rack - What Size Bed Is It?\nThe term \"Navy rack\" is a colloquial expression commonly used to describe the sleeping accommodations on board a ship in the United States Navy. Navy racks are essentially the equivalent of beds on land, but they are designed to optimize space and efficiency on a ship, where space is at a premium. To understand the size of a Navy rack, one must consider the dimensions and features that make it unique.\nNavy racks come in various sizes, and the specific size of a rack can vary from one class of ship to another. However, there are some standard dimensions and characteristics that are commonly associated with Navy racks. These beds are designed to accommodate the unique needs and constraints of life at sea, providing sailors with a place to rest and sleep during their time on the ship.\nTypically, a Navy rack is designed to be compact and space-efficient. The standard size of a Navy rack is about 77 inches in length, which is slightly shorter than a twin-sized bed commonly found on land. This reduced length allows for more racks to fit within the confined spaces of a ship's berthing compartments. The width of a Navy rack is typically around 27 inches, making it narrower than a standard twin bed. This width is just wide enough to comfortably accommodate one person.\nOne of the defining features of Navy racks is that they are stackable or \"hinged.\" Each rack is hinged at the head and foot, allowing it to be folded up during the day to create more open floor space in the berthing area. This foldable design is essential for maximizing space on a ship, as it enables sailors to move around more freely when they are not sleeping. When it's time to sleep, the rack can be folded down to create a secure and private sleeping space.\nThe height of a Navy rack can vary depending on the ship's class and the specific design of the berthing compartment. In some cases, the upper rack may be positioned relatively close to the ceiling of the compartment, while the lower rack is closer to the deck. This arrangement allows for a tiered sleeping configuration that further optimizes space. The upper rack is accessed using a small ladder or built-in steps.\nAdditionally, Navy racks are equipped with various features to enhance the comfort and privacy of the sailor using them. These features may include a privacy curtain that can be drawn closed, a reading light, and a small storage area for personal items. The privacy curtain is particularly important as it provides a sense of personal space and helps block out ambient light and noise, making it easier for sailors to rest and sleep.\nThe Navy pays careful attention to the design and maintenance of racks to ensure the well-being of its personnel. The mattresses used in Navy racks are specially designed to provide comfort and support. In addition, bedding and linens are provided to sailors, and these are regularly cleaned and replaced to maintain hygiene and comfort.\nWhile Navy racks are space-efficient and functional, they are not known for their luxurious comfort. Sailors often have to adapt to the unique challenges of sleeping at sea, where the ship's motion can lead to unpredictable and uneven sleeping conditions. Despite these challenges, the Navy rack serves its purpose, allowing sailors to get the rest they need while on duty, and it exemplifies the Navy's commitment to maximizing space and resources on its vessels.\nIn conclusion, the size of a Navy rack is typically about 77 inches in length and 27 inches in width, making it slightly shorter and narrower than a standard twin bed. These racks are designed to be space-efficient and are equipped with features to enhance the comfort and privacy of sailors. Their foldable design, combined with other space-saving measures, allows multiple racks to fit within the confined spaces of a ship's berthing compartment. While Navy racks may not offer the same level of comfort as a land-based bed, they are an essential part of life at sea in the United States Navy, providing sailors with a place to rest and sleep during their deployments.","Which Types of Mattresses Sleep Hot vs. Cool?\nVarious components in the comfort layer and support core of a mattress will affect how hot or cool the bed sleeps. Below we review the most popular types of mattresses available today, and how well (or not) they regulate temperature for hot sleepers.\nTop Cooling Innerspring Mattresses for Hot Sleepers\nSaatva Mattress Review\nInnersprings are generally regarded as the coolest mattress options because they absorb a small amount of body heat and usually do not sleep warm. This is largely due to their support cores, which are constructed with steel springs and coils that are evenly spaced to provide sleeper support and equal weight distribution. Air circulates in the spaces between these metal parts, which helps the mattress stay cool. Exceptions to this rule are hybrids and innersprings with thick foam comfort layers, which may sleep hotter than those with thin comfort layers.\nTop Cooling Foam Mattresses for Hot Sleepers\nEight Sleep Pod Mattress Review\nMuse Mattress Review\nGiven that they’re made entirely of foam, all-foam mattresses conform closely to the body and tend to fall on the softer side, firmness-wise, both of which can result in trapped body heat and an uncomfortably warm sleep experience. However, these mattresses can sleep sufficiently cool for hot sleepers, allowing them to enjoy conforming pressure-relief without the heat. It all depends on the types of foams used in the mattress.\nGel-infused Foam: Many mattress manufacturers tout models with ‘gel-infused memory foam‘ as sleeping much cooler than mattresses made from standard memory foam. This is a reasonable argument, since gel must absorb a certain amount of body heat before its temperature will change. However, owner experiences with gel-infused foam mattresses are fairly mixed, and some say they retain as much body heat as standard foams. The key distinction here is how much gel is infused into the foam; foams with a high gel concentration tend to sleep cooler than those with lower concentrations. Other foams may feature beads or other trace gel components, but these materials have little — if any — effect on the foam’s body heat retention.\nOther Specialty Foams: In addition to gel foams, specialty foams may be infused with other materials like copper or graphite. And similarly, the cooling properties of these foams will depend on the concentration of copper, graphite, or other specialty materials.\nRegular Memory Foam: Memory foam can be quite problematic for people who sleep hot. Memory foam responds to temperature changes by conforming to the sleeper’s body, which can create a heat trap. Additionally, many memory foam mattresses feature support cores made from high-density polyfoam, another material known to sleep hot.\nAdvanced Polyfoam: Some advanced polyfoams are designed to regulate temperature more effectively than regular polyfoam, but owner experiences have been somewhat mixed and advanced polyfoam is generally not recommended for people who usually sleep hot.\nOpen-cell Memory Foam: While memory foam is regarded as the hottest mattress material available, open-cell memory foam may sleep somewhat cooler because of improved air circulation.\nRegular Polyfoam: Polyfoam is generally cooler than memory foam due to its open-cell structure and relatively low density, but it tends to sleep warmer than materials like latex. One contributing factor to the above-average warmth is the support core, which is often made from high-density polyfoam. Mattresses that feature convoluted polyfoam in the comfort layer may sleep cooler due to air channels that form between the grooves in individual layers.\nTop Cooling Hybrid Mattresses for Hot Sleepers\nDreamCloud Mattress Review\nBrooklyn Bedding Aurora Mattress Review\nWinkBeds Mattress Reviews\nHybrid mattresses are, appropriately, a hybrid of innerspring and foam mattresses. These mattresses combine a coil-based support core with several inches of foam or latex in the comfort layers. Hybrid mattresses use pocketed coils in their support core, enhancing the overall contouring capability of the mattress while still allowing ample airflow.\nThe suitability of a hybrid mattress for hot sleepers depends largely on the materials used in their comfort layers and cover. Hybrid mattresses that feature latex or gel-infused memory foams, like The DreamCloud and WinkBed Plus, will sleep cooler than those with memory foam. Covers made of breathable cotton — or better yet, infused with cooling copper, like the Aurora — are also ideal.\nLatex mattresses feature at least one layer of latex in the comfort layer, and may also have latex-based support cores. Unlike polyfoam or memory foam, latex does not absorb much body heat or respond to temperature changes. Latex layers are often perforated, which can promote better air circulation. However, latex that is blended or entirely synthetic may not sleep as cool as natural latex.\nAirbeds feature air chambers in the support core that can be adjusted to change the firmness of the mattress. The comfort layer is typically made from polyfoam or memory foam, and how hot or cool they sleep often depends on comfort layer thickness. Generally speaking, comfort layers that are more than 3? to 4? thick sleep significantly hotter than thinner comfort layers.\nMany mattresses will feature several of these materials. For example, an innerspring mattress may include memory foam in the comfort layers, while a hybrid mattress may have layers of both latex and memory foam. The table below rates each of these mattress materials and their ability to help you sleep cool.\nHow Does the Mattress Cover Affect the Mattress Temperature?\nIn addition to materials found in the comfort layer and support core, the mattress cover can also affect body heat retention and temperature regulation. Let’s look at four common cover materials and how they rate in terms of sleeping hot or cool.\nNon-quilted covers tend to be the thinnest. The thinner the cover, the better the air circulation. As a result, non-quilted covers often sleep cooler than other cover options.\nQuilted covers are thicker than non-quilted covers, which means the air circulation may not be as good. Additionally, many quilted covers feature thin layers of polyfoam or memory foam that can affect the sleep surface temperature.\n‘Phase-change materials’, or PCMs, refers to materials that are designed to retain body heat until the sleeper’s body reaches a certain temperature, at which point it will stop absorbing heat. This allows phase-change covers, like those found in the Muse Mattress and Aurora, to maintain a steady, moderately cool temperature regardless of how much body heat the sleeper is emitting. Phase-change material may not sleep as cool as a non-quilted cover, but many mattress owners claim these materials effectively keep the heat down throughout the night.\nSome mattresses are advertised with covers made from ‘cooling fabrics’, such as:\n- Celliant® Fibers: Celliant® fibers are produced using thermoreactive minerals that help improve circulation in sleepers and regulate their body temperature throughout the night. These covers tend to sleep fairly cool, but some mattress owners still report sleeping hot.\n- Lyocell: Lyocell is a type of rayon made of cellulose, a material from wood pulp. It is relatively thin and lightweight, and may provide a suitably cool surface for hot sleepers. The WinkBed Plus, our favorite mattress for heavier hot sleepers, features a lyocell cover.\n- Lycra® Spandex: This material is highly elastic and often found in athletic clothing, as well as bras and underwear. It also wicks away moisture, which can be beneficial for people who sweat due to sleeping hot.\nCooling Pillows, Bedding, & Sleep Accessories for Hot Sleepers\nNow that we’ve discussed the best cooling mattresses, let’s look at a few bedding options and bedroom accessories that can help you stay even cooler while you sleep.\nAs many people have seen firsthand, the options for bedsheets are seemingly endless. Sheet options fall into one of two general categories: natural fibers or synthetic materials. Natural fibers used in sheets include:\nNatural fibers tend to be softer and more breathable than other cover fabrics, which can help regulate temperature and maintain a cool sleep surface. Long-staple cotton and linen are considered exceptionally cool. Additionally, wool naturally wicks away moisture; it also sleeps warmer or cooler depending on the room temperature, making wool sheets a good choice for year-round temperature regulation.\nThe most common synthetic fabrics used in sheets are polyester and rayon. These are not as breathable as natural fibers and will sleep warm by comparison, although certain synthetics — such as polyester microfibers — are able to wick away moisture, which can help lower the sleeper’s body temperature.\nSome sheet fabrics may be all-natural or blended natural-and-synthetic. For example, bamboo viscose is made from cellulose and bamboo fabric, and may or may not contain chemical ingredients. These fabrics often sleep cool, but in most cases natural-fiber sheets will sleep somewhat cooler.\nA mattress topper is used to provide an extra inch or two of cushioning to the comfort layer, and is usually purchased separately from the mattress itself. These are different from mattress pads, which are primarily used to protect the mattress.\nNot surprisingly, memory foam toppers tend to sleep the hottest. Toppers made from fabric/fibers or latex also absorb body heat to a fair extent. The coolest topper options include feather toppers (also known as featherbeds) and toppers made from wool.\nPillows sold today are crafted from a wide range of materials, including natural fibers like buckwheat, down or feathers, cotton, wool, and silk. These sleep significantly cooler than synthetic materials like down alternative, memory foam, and polyester.\nThe table below compares eight common pillow materials based on how cool they sleep.\nLike all the other things your body comes into contact with throughout the night, sleepwear is an important factor in how cool you’ll be. Like bedding products, how temperature neutral your sleepwear is mostly depends on the material it’s made out of. Linen and bamboo sleepwear are among the coolest materials, with cotton being fairly cool as well. If you sleep hot, make sure to avoid flannel or polyester pajamas. Additionally, you can always sleep naked.\nFans improve airflow throughout the bedroom and can help sleepers stay cool, particularly during hotter times of the year. Some louder models may cause sleep disruption, although some sleepers find the background noise is conducive to sleep. Ceiling fans may also be suitable, although some mattresses may be too low to the ground to have a noticeable effect.\nMattress Climate Control Systems\nIn addition to fans, some products can be used to regulate mattress temperature by releasing cool or warm air into the bed. These systems can be useful for individuals who sleep excessively hot or those who tend to get too cold during the night.\nOne example is the BedJet, an accessory that releases currents of convective air onto both sides of the mattress using a hose attachment. Owners can adjust the air settings to find the right temperature, and the BedJet is capable of releasing warm and cool to opposite sides of the bed for couples who have different sleep preferences.\nIn addition to accessories, some mattress bases also provide climate control. Take the WinkBeds coolControl™, a base equipped with four air tubes that fit into the bottom of the mattress and supply currents of air that rise to the top surface. Using a smart app, owners can adjust the settings until they reach a suitable temperature.\nCooling Mattress Buying Tips for Hot Sleepers\nIf you and/or your sleep partner tend to sleep hot, be sure to keep the following points in mind when shopping for a new cooling mattress or bedding accessories."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b50d545d-479c-425e-b6a7-57edccd4a6a9>","<urn:uuid:8605b848-b36b-406f-ac33-0a0fad3398ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a cattle farmer worried about summer heat. 🥵 What is the physiological impact of heat on cattle's water intake, and what management strategies can help prevent heat stress?","answer":"Heat significantly impacts cattle's water consumption and physiology. When temperatures exceed 27°C, cattle markedly increase their water intake to dissipate body heat and compensate for reduced feed intake under heat stress. Since cattle only sweat about 10% as much as humans, they rely heavily on respiration and panting to cool themselves. Furthermore, their rumen fermentation generates additional heat, making temperature regulation more challenging. To manage heat stress, several strategies are essential: ensuring abundant fresh water access (adding extra tanks to prevent overcrowding), installing shade structures 8-14 feet tall providing 20-40 square feet per animal, and using proper droplet-sized water systems (avoiding fine mist that increases humidity). These measures are critical since heat stress causes significant economic losses, estimated at over $370 million annually in the U.S. cattle industry.","context":["Water is essential for life and should be regarded as a major factor in livestock rearing and management. Here we present 7 factors that determine the water requirement of farm animals.\nWater is a key factor in the digestion and absorption of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Water also helps in exhaling the body waste after digestion and helps in the discharge of some toxic metabolic products such as urea. A lack of water will, therefore, have more immediate and drastic effects on body physiology than the lack of other nutrients. Water is also a key factor in increasing the rate of production. It accounts for about 80% of the total milk produced. In pregnancy, water constitutes a high proportion of total placenta and has an important role in the prevention of abortions and other reproductive problems. Water also helps regulate the temperature of the body through saliva, sweat, breathing, and other vital means used by the animal to reduce the heat burden. Furthermore, in terms of health management and disease control, it is preferable to add medication to drinking water than to mix them with feed. This helps ensure fast and easy medication and also ensures an adequate consumption of the drug. Sick animals usually have a tendency to stop eating while in most cases they continue to drink water.\nA lack of water will have more immediate and drastic effects on body physiology than the lack of other nutrients. Photo: Frank Uijlenbroek\nWhat determines how much water is needed?\nWater requirements vary according to several factors, including:\nThe average daily water requirements are about 30kg for all types of cattle and about 4kg for sheep and goats. These differences between species are due to different body size as well as other factors related to metabolic activity and level of production in each case. Sheep are better able than cows to survive in environments where the amount of water available is less than the daily amounts mentioned above, due to the low moisture content in the faeces of sheep and the presence of large salivary glands secreting a daily amount of 15kg saliva, which is greater than the amount secreted by cattle when measured on the basis of body weight.\nThe tail area in sheep contains large amounts of fat, which is chemically composed of fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol itself is a carbohydrate material that provides the animal’s metabolic water when hydrogen contained in this material is combined with oxygen circulating in the bloodstream. Thus, the animal may not feel thirsty even with limited amounts of water from external sources or when this water is cut off for limited periods. Some sheep tend to change the grazing system when exposed to high temperatures as an alternative way to alleviate the problem of scarcity of drinking water needed to reduce the heat load, especially in the case of the low moisture content of the pastoral plants. In this case, sheep tend to graze in the direction of the sun and not vertically on this direction, thereby reducing the heat burden on sheep, which is only 183 watts compared to a heat load of 374 watts when grazing vertically on the direction of sunlight. There is no reference to the existence of such a natural mechanism in cattle. They can control the heat load during grazing only if they have shelters or other artificial equipment.\nAge of the animal\nFor the same type of animal, the requirements for water may vary according to age, mainly due to the percentage of water in the animal’s body. For example, the newborn’s body contains 75-80% water, gradually decreasing to about 50% with age due to the changes in metabolic processes and the increased deposition of fat in the body, which naturally follows the low rate of water consumption during that period for the reasons mentioned earlier.\nCattle tend to increase water intake as temperature rise, with 27°C being the temperature where marked changes in water intake are noted (Table 1). This may be attributed to the animal’s need to dissipate body heat and/or the reduced feed intake (by 30% or more) under heat stress and the animal’s need to maintain the sensation of gut fill by drinking a larger amount of water.\nThe daily needs of water increase depending on the level of production. For example, a cow that produces 10kg of milk per day needs about twice as much water as another cow produces 5kg, assuming that the other factors affecting water consumption remain unchanged.\nMoisture content of feed\nThe amount of water required per day is increased if the animal is fed a diet containing a low percentage of moisture such as hay or straw (10% moisture) compared to the state of feeding on another diet based primarily on silage, which contains about 70% moisture.\nWith the same type of feed, the moisture level may vary from time to time on the same day. For example, it is found that in some types of pastoral shrubs such as Acacia, the moisture level is about 1% during the day, and then increases to 30% after 4 hours of sunset, then to 40% after 8 hours, which affects the rate of water consumption during these different periods of grazing. The percentage of moisture in the feed material also varies according to the method of manufacture of the feed material. For example, if concentrates are produced in the form of pellets, their moisture content is reduced due to high temperatures during the manufacturing process. This, in turn, increases the water consumption rate compared with non-processed concentrate feeds. The difference here is more evident in beef cattle reared for fattening, where the percentage of concentrate feeds amount to about 50% or more of the total animal feed consumed daily.\nFeed energy sources\nThe daily needs of drinking water vary according to the different energy source in the feed. In the diets where starch constitutes an essential source of energy, water consumption increases in comparison with the diets to which fats are added in large amounts to provide energy. This is mainly due to the difference in the quantity of body water produced in each case (0.56g/g for starch oxidation versus 1.70g/g for body fat oxidation).\nProtein level in the feed\nThe amount of water needed by the animal increases daily depending on the increase in the proportion of protein in the food. In this case, the animal needs extra water to dispose of the excess nitrogen from the body through the urine in the form of urea dissolved in water. This phenomenon is more evident in mammals, but in other species such as birds, the primary product of protein breakdown is uric acid, which is disposed from the body in a solid state without the need for additional water for the purpose of dissolution. The source of protein in the diet also affects the amount of water consumed by the animal daily. It has been observed that there is an increase in water consumption if the concentrate portion of the diet contains soybeans as the main source of protein due to its effect on the softness of animal faeces. The addition of fishmeal to the concentrates also leads to increased water consumption because it contains large amounts of sodium salts. In this case, the animal will need additional amounts of water to dissolve the salts and thus reduce its thirst.","High temperatures and humidity are tough on cattle and productivity. In addition, stress starts to compound in animals, as pink eye, summer pneumonia and flies can also threaten cattle performance.\nAccording to Iowa State University, once temperatures reach above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, beef cattle endure physiological stress dealing with their heat load.\nHeat abatement, or the reduction of heat stress, along with managing other summer stressors, is critical for beef producers to minimize production losses and keep cattle healthy all summer long.\nPreparing for Heat Stress in Cattle\nCattle sweat very little - about 10% of the human rate. To cool themselves, cattle will dissipate heat through respiration or panting, radiating heat from their bodies with vasodilation (pushing blood to the body's surface for heat removal) and reducing feed and forage intake.\nCattle generate heat in their rumen during fermentation, which causes core temperatures to rise even more. They also typically congregate at water troughs or under trees during the summer months, making it hard for heat to escape, escalating the impact of heat stress.\nCattle’s ability to dissipate heat depends on:\nAir temperature and relative humidity\nEnergy level in the feed ration\nAccording to the Journal of Dairy Science, economic losses from heat stress to the United States cattle industry are estimated at more than $370 million a year. The dairy industry experiences more than double that loss at $897 million.\nWhat Are the Signs of Heat Stress in Cattle?\nCattle experience visible and internal signs of heat stress as they attempt to dissipate heat.\nVisible Signs of Heat Stress\nInternal Signs of Heat Stress\nOpen mouth breathing and panting\nProductivity stops as energy is diverting to returning the body to homeostasis, decreasing performance\nInflammation and immune activation\nDecreased feed intake and increased water intake\nLower reproduction rates\nDecreased activity, lying down\nReduced average daily gain (ADG)\nIncreased insulin levels\nAgitation and restlessness\nThe USDA states that production losses have already begun once cattle start experiencing visible signs of heat stress.\nHow to Manage Heat Stress in Cattle\nCattle producers can prepare for and combat heat events with a combination of management practices and tools such as:\nEnsuring cattle have access to plenty of fresh water. Add more tanks before a heat event to help alleviate congregation around main water tanks.\nUsing droplets, not mist. Make sure the droplets of misters are large, not small. If the droplets are too small, they can create added humidity, worsening heat stress.\nProviding shade. Shade structures should be open and 8 to 14-feet tall to allow for proper ventilation. They should provide between 20 and 40 square feet per animal, depending on animal size.\nFresh feed. Heat also impacts feed quality and increases the growth of bacteria, mold and yeast, making feed less appetizing to cattle. Ensure cattle have fresh feed in a feedyard setting.\nSupporting their immune system. Heat stress equals gut stress. More than 70% of the immune system is contained in the gut. As heat stress erodes immunity and gut health of cattle, which can lead to disease challenges and performance losses, it is essential to support their immunity. Research shows that feed additives using essential oils and capsicum can help boost immunity, provide antioxidant support and help cattle reduce the impact of heat stress.\nRelated: Why Heat Stress Equals Gut Stress in Cattle\nControlling Summer Pink Eye\nBeef producers know the threat of pink eye is more prevalent in the summer.\nAlso known as infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), pink eye is a highly contagious disease that severely impacts productivity and is incredibly painful to cattle.\nAccording to the University of Wisconsin, pink eye is primarily caused by the bacteria Moraxella bovis, which produces a toxin that attacks the eye. It is commonly understood that Moraxella bovis is the cause of traditional IBK or summer pink eye.\nWhat Causes Pink Eye in Cattle?\nSeveral things can predispose cattle to pink eye. The eyes have natural defense mechanisms to thwart infection and damage. However, eye irritants or trauma allow pathogens to pass through the eyes’ defenses and get to the cornea.\nPredisposing factors associated with pink eye include:\nDust and sand\nWeeds, tall grass and stalks\nOther animals, overcrowding from heat stress and tails swishing from flies\nPhysical hazards like barbed wire or trauma during handling and transport\nPink eye occurs in stages as the eye tries to repair itself. Stage two occurs when blood vessels spread throughout the cornea to help with healing. The eye becomes bright pink, explaining how the term ‘pink eye’ was derived.\nWhat’s the Impact of Pink Eye?\nThe University of Illinois estimates the cost of pink eye to the U.S. cattle industry at more than $150 million per year due to decreased weight gain, milk production, treatment costs and permanent scarring to the eye that reduces sale price. Recent studies show a 17 – 65 lb. weight loss from pink eye, with treatment costs exceeding $100 per incident.\nHow to Manage Pink Eye in Cattle\nMany beef producers use pink eye vaccines with varying levels of success\nin the summer months. Yet, the best way to reduce the incidences of pink eye is to manage the associated predisposing factors. Face flies can carry pink eye from animal to animal, so fly control methods are critical. Additionally, ensuring animals are not overcrowded or near hazards, reducing heat stress and handling them as little as possible can help. If pink eye cases are discovered, immediately isolate cattle away from the herd and treat until the infection is gone.\nRelated: How Garlic Can Help Minimize Pink Eye in Cattle\nPreventing Summer Pneumonia in Calves\nSummer pneumonia in nursing calves is another challenge for beef producers to watch out for. This problem can come on quickly and be unpredictable, with the first sign often being sick or dead calves.\nThe University of Nebraska identifies summer pneumonia as a respiratory disease in pre-weaned calves on pasture. While the direct cause of summer pneumonia is unknown, researchers and veterinarians have found a few direct correlations between outbreaks and these varying factors:\nPoor colostrum quality from cows lacking in nutrition"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f6f438c9-d8de-49cf-9dde-5640f4dac82f>","<urn:uuid:be8dc216-779b-4023-9d3f-d6d8d37d6787>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What environmental benefits does using fly ash in concrete provide?","answer":"Using fly ash as a partial replacement for portland cement in concrete reduces the overall carbon footprint and diverts an industrial by-product from the solid waste stream. Currently, about 40 percent of fly ash is reclaimed for beneficial reuse while 60 percent is disposed of in landfills.","context":["Editor: Professor M C Forde, PhD, FREng, FRSE, FACI, CEng\nCarillion Chair, University of Edinburgh\nKeynote Papers (K)\nEVALUATING SERVICE LIFE OF LONGSPAN BRIDGE CABLES\nDr K Mahmoud, Bridge Technology Consulting Inc, New York, NY, USA\nBridge cables are subject to different degradation processes such as corrosion pitting, stress corrosion cracking, corrosion-fatigue and hydrogen embrittlement. In the last three decades, many suspension bridge cables have demonstrated signs of degradation with different degrees of severity resulting in reduced load carrying capacity. This necessitates a quantitative rationale for the assessment of remaining strength and safe service life of bridge cables. The quantitative methodology must utilize inspection findings and laboratory test results for condition assessment and reliability criteria, similar to LRFD approach. With that in mind, random sampling and reliability-based analytical techniques are required for the assessment of remaining cable service life. The wire mechanical properties and findings of broken and cracked wires must be defined as probabilistic quantities. If an evaluation is conducted using these criteria, the results can be used to establish the tempo of bridge cable inspection and further evaluations in the future. Once probability distributions for wire mechanical properties, such as strength and strain, and loads are established, it’s possible to develop a cable failure mechanism and assess the serviceability of the cable. Use of probabilistic analysis in this approach is similar to the LRFD probabilistic analysis employed in the current AASHTO standards. This paper presents the BTC method, a probability-based methodology for the evaluation of remaining strength and service life of bridge cables. The BTC method is patented and has been published in two reports sponsored by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Currently, the BTC method is being applied at the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland, and has been applied at the Bronx-Whitestone and Mid-Hudson Bridges in the United States.\nSUSPENSION BRIDGES – DESIGN, MAINTENANCE & INSPECTION OF MAIN CABLES\nB Colford, Forth Road Bridge, Edinburgh, UK\nThis paper reviews issues with long span suspension bridges. Two well known and publicised closures of suspension bridges due to cable deterioration, the US Grant Bridge and the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, are salutary lessons for all those involved in long span bridges. They highlight the absolute need for properly funded and well organised maintenance of these assets and that a programme of regular investigations, including internal inspections, of the main cables must be carried over the full service life of the bridges. These investigations cost time and resources but the engineering profession has a duty to ensure they are carried out.\nMANAGEMENT OF M4 ELEVATED SECTION SUBSTRUCTURES\nCR Hendy & CT Brock, Atkins & ADJ Nicholls, Connect Plus (M25) Ltd Epsom, S El-Belbol, Highways AgencyUK\nThe M4 Elevated Section in West London is a 1.9 km concrete viaduct structure providing a major arterial route into London. An intervention model bringing together structural assessment and forecast deterioration, corrosion modelling and cracking has been developed to prioritise structural rehabilitation of the substructure crosshead beams. To evaluate residual strength an initial assessment of crossheads was undertaken, which identified a deficiency in tensile capacity at the ends of the crosshead cantilevers compared to current demands. Further assessment has been undertaken, including three dimensional strut and tie, non-linear finite element analysis and plastic analysis, to confirm public safety with continued trafficking of the structure, and to determine the need for strengthening.\nAdditionally extensive monitoring of the crossheads has been implemented including mapping of all cracks, and remote crack monitoring to safeguard the substructures and allow early interventions. The long term maintenance strategy brings together strengthening and cathodic protection concrete preservation methods with removal and repair of concrete delamination.\nThis paper discusses the development of the prioritisation process including deterioration modelling, together with the extended structural analysis to formulate a strengthening programme for these substructures.\nFLEXIARCH’ – A VERSATILE & SUSTAINABLE BRIDGE SYSTEM\nProf AE Long, Dr S Nanukuttan, Queen's Univ Belfast, A Gupta & D Courtenay, Macrete Ireland, Toomebridge, UK\nConcrete bridges built during the 1960s/1970s were largely based on precast girders with an in situ deck slab, as these bridges could be installed rapidly. However, many have deteriorated as a result of corrosion of reinforcement and have had to be replaced. The resulting traffic congestion has cost £ billions. A range of approaches have been adopted to counter the\ndeterioration caused by the ingress of chlorides including increased cover, surface coatings, cathodic protection but with limited success. One solution is to avoid the use of corrodible reinforcement for elements exposed to aggressive environments.\nIn this context it has been found that highly sustainable bridges can be developed from the arch concept. Conventional arch bridges have the benefit of being aesthetic, strong and durable as steel reinforcement is not necessary. However, cost and time to prepare the centring and accurate voussoirs render them non competitive against precast girder and slab systems. A\npatented system, which uses precast concrete voussoirs and does not require centring, has overcome these problems and over 40 ‘FlexiArches’ have been constructed in the UK/Ireland. These can be installed rapidly, days rather than months, are cost competitive and have all the attributes of masonry arches. They have been extensively tested at full scale, used for short\nspan bridges and for the rehabilitation/strengthening of deteriorated bridges. Comparative studies have demonstrated that they are significantly more sustainable than alternative systems.\n3R’S APPROACH TO BRIDGE MANAGEMENT: RETAIN, REPAIR & REPLACE\nD Dunne, AECOM, P McKenna, D Barnett & A White, CH2M HILL, Glasgow & Worcester, UK\nDeterioration of reinforced concrete structures, such as bridges, is over time a normal and to a certain degree an expected process. When these processes become abnormally advanced before a structures design life is attained, this poses challenges both economically and technically. As a result, the condition of such structures and the cause of any deterioration must be accurately determined by visual assessment, monitoring and testing, for safety and operational requirements are to be achieved. Ombersley Bridge carries the A449 over the A4133 approximately 6 miles north of Worcester in the UK. The bridge was originally constructed in 1974. A regular inspection programme established that the bridge abutments were cracking and that the bridge was moving. This paper, from a consultant’s perspective, outlines aspects of the investigation and subsequent retention, repair and replacement intervention works. Findings of the experimental investigations are presented. Thereafter, overviews of the works which were undertaken are discussed. The paper ends with conclusions taken after the works concluded.\nBALANCING EXTENDED SERVICE LIFE AND SUSTAINABLE CONCRETE MATERIAL USAGE IN MISSOURI BRIDGE A7957\nE.S. Hernandez, A. Griffin and Prof J.J. Myers, Missouri Univ of Science & Technology, Rolla MO, USA\nBecause of its unique nature, self-consolidating concrete (SCC) has the potential to significantly reduce costs associated with transportation-related infrastructure, benefiting both MoDOT and the residents of Missouri. SCC is a highly flowable, non-segregating concrete that can be placed without any mechanical consolidation, and thus has the following advantages over conventional concrete:\ndecreased labor and equipment costs during concrete placement,\ndecreased potential for and costs to repair honeycombing and voids,\nincreased production rates of precast and cast-in-place (CIP) elements, and\nimproved finish and appearance of cast and free concrete surfaces.\nIn addition to SCC, innovative materials such as High Volume Fly Ash Concrete (HVFAC) also provide a significant potential to produce more cost effective mix designs for CIP concrete. Since the 1930’s, fly ash – a pozzolanic material – has been used as a partial replacement of portland cement in concrete to improve the material’s strength and durability, while also limiting the amount of early heat generation. From an environmental perspective, replacing cement with fly ash reduces concrete’s overall carbon footprint and diverts an industrial by-product from the solid waste stream (currently, about 40 percent of fly ash is reclaimed for beneficial reuse and 60 percent is disposed of in landfills). The objective of this research is to provide an implementation test bed and showcase for the use of sustainable and extended service life concrete. In this implementation study for Missouri Bridge A7957, a level of 50% fly ash to cement proportions was utilized as well as SCC and high-strength self-consolidating concrete (HS-SCC) in the load carrying elements to showcase the use of these innovative materials.\nOPTIMIZING A BRIDGE RESPONSE MODIFICATION APPARATUS\nA Schultz, Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, A Gastineau, KPFF Engineers, Seattle & SF Wojtkiewicz, Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY, USA\nGiven the plurality of bridges in the United States that are classified as deficient and in need of replacement or repair, methodologies to help avoid the substantial costs of replacing these bridges simultaneously are important. This paper presents a synthesis of work conducted to develop a structural response modification approach employing a mechanical amplifier and supplemental stiffener and damper to extend the fatigue life of existing steel bridge structures. The optimal cross-sectional area for apparatus members and response modification device stiffness and damping characteristics for these apparatuses are investigated to reduce local stresses as a means to increase bridge life. A reduced order numerical model of an existing finite element bridge model is developed for the purpose of optimizing the apparatus. The study indicates that for the apparatus employing the mechanical amplifier, small dampers are optimal for maximal safe life extension. The study also suggests that improvements in performance can be obtained from the apparatus using semi-active control.\nANALYSIS & FATIGUE TESTING OF FULL SIZE BRIDGE HANGER CONNECTION TO DEVELOP INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM & DETECTION CRITERIA FOR IN SERVICE MONITORING\nP Plemic & R E Lindenberg, Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc, Northbrook, IL, USA\nTo address the complex in-service behavior of a bridge platform welded hanger connection, modeling and laboratory studies were conducted to develop an instrumentation plan for monitoring and detecting of crack initiation and propagation. The purpose of the work was to understand the anticipated test behavior and to robustly measure the accelerated 400,000 lbf (1700kN) cyclic fatigue test to failure.\nThe primary objective of the laboratory testing was to develop the detection criteria, to demonstrate the effectiveness of Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors for potential crack detection and to optimize the number of required sensors and AE system for the detection and monitoring of the crack growth. The secondary objective of the experimental testing was to estimate the fatigue resistance life cycle of the fillet weld between the hanger connection and kicker gusset plate. Testing was conducted on four samples, two simple plate connections models and two full-scale hanger connection using Universal Test Machine with a 400,000 lbf (1700kN) capacity equipped with a controller that allows cyclic or fatigue testing of samples. During testing a visual examination as well as Magnetic Particle Testing of the test specimen was conducted. At the conclusion of the cycling, Ultrasonic Testing was performed on each test specimen. The testing was performed at the structural laboratory of the Jack R. Janney Technical Center at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. (WJE) in Northbrook, Illinois\nPrior to testing a finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to identify high stress locations for each test sample, and to allow for visualization and animation of the sample response to the applied loads.\nREVIEW OF \"ADA BRIDGE\" LOAD TEST PROJECT\nD Kovacevic, V Radonjanin, M Malešev & D Lađinović, Univ of Novi Sad, & S Ranković, Univ of Niš, Serbia\nThis is brief presentation of \"Ada Bridge\" load test project. Things that stand out this project are scale, status and importance of the structure. In this sense, this load testing is, if not the biggest, probably until now, the most complex structure testing in this (ex-YU) region. This fact emphasizes the amount and type of load used for testing, number and type of load configurations, number and type of performed measurements and assortment of used measuring equipment.\nLoad test of \"Ada Bridge\" was done according to our SRPS U.M1.046 regulation respecting the special demands set by investor, contractor and manager in corresponding parts of the technical documentation.\nThe goal of testing was to get experimental proof of bridge's capacity for taking and transferring design loads and actions, namely the proofs that bridge structure satisfies the criteria of bearing capacity, stability and serviceability.\nPRACTICAL STRUCTURAL MONITORING OF LONG-SPAN BRIDGES - THE STRAINSTALL 2014 UPDATE\nJ St Leger, S Babin, M Anderson, A Scullion, Strainstall Monitoring, Royston, UK\nThis paper considers the following from a practical perspective:\n1. Bridge management - how appropriate structural health monitoring systems help the bridge owner.\n2. Current effective monitoring systems and how new sensor technology and future developments will help.\n3. The fast moving world of web based applications for the delivery of structure information – the changing picture.\n4. Derivation of meaningful and timely information from structural health monitoring systems to enable effective bridge management and informed decision making.\n5. An overview of state-of-the-art structural health monitoring systems for bridges.\nNEW TEST METHODS FOR STAY CABLE SYSTEMS\nAW Gutsch, M Laube, T Nolte, TU Braunschweig, Germany\nIn cable bridges the cables are subjected to different kind of loading scenarios during their lifetime. Before the installation of stay cables the systems have to proof their sustainability in tests. The different types of tests are mentioned in several national and international accepted recommendations [1 – 5]. Up to now the most common loading tests for stay cable systems are the axial fatigue loading test and subsequently a static loading test to determine the ultimate breaking load (UBL).\nExperience showed that bending effects due to installation tolerances of the anchorages and other sources of bending like sag, wind-rain induced vibration or flexural deformation of the bridge deck are fatigue relevant in practice, too. For the investigation of these effects in tests the anchorages are usually installed with a specific angle in the axial test set-up or recently specific bending fatigue tests were performed. Here different test set-ups for bending fatigue tests with constant axial forces and with synchronized axial dynamic forces will be shown.\nSaddles must be designed such as to ensure a safe transfer of vertical forces and of differential forces of stay cables from opposite sides of the pylon. The simulation of a saddle in a stay cable test results in a complex test set-up. Here a modified test set-up for a saddle test with fatigue load will be presented.\nFinally the test set-up for fire resistance tests for qualification test of stay cables with fire resistance characteristics will be shown here.\nACCESS SOLUTIONS FOR SUSPENSION BRIDGE CABLE MAINTENANCE\nR Burgess & J Mawson, C Spencer Ltd, Hull, UK\nAccess provision to undertake construction and remedial works to structures is an increasingly demanding consideration for the execution of bridge projects worldwide. Both temporary and permanent access solutions provide engineers with opportunities to undertake projects in challenging locations whilst satisfying the concerns of multiple stakeholders, not least the bridge users. With many structures operating above capacity and subsequently demanding regular maintenance and enhancement, options to limit or mitigate disruption to the infrastructure whilst utilising cutting edge construction and maintenance techniques frequently demand extensive innovation in access provision alone, just to allow staff and equipment safe and adequate passage to the final work site.\nRegardless of the structure type, age, usage and location, access provision to undertake construction, remedial, maintenance and enhancement projects is a constant consideration for Bridge Engineering globally. With ongoing changes to intended maintenance plans, design life and asset management technologies, few structures were designed and built with adequate access to facilitate the types of projects typically seen around the world today, as such facilitating access alone can occupy a disproportionate amount of the design and construction approach to any bridge project.\nThe paper will discuss current issues in today’s industry and how new-build bridge projects can be designed with future-proof access in mind, whilst of course considering the capital expenditure implications of such provisions. The paper will focus upon the project-specific requirements for some typical and specialist remedial & maintenance projects and why access alone frequently becomes the pinnacle consideration in today’s market. Finally the paper will consider variations in the working cultures and legislation of international markets and how this can impact upon the chosen access methodology for a given scheme."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:09e85674-b2bc-4758-bdcb-291512ea3163>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How far in advance should a school auction fundraiser be planned?","answer":"A school auction fundraiser should be planned six months in advance, even for a small auction. This advanced planning is necessary because national companies often require several months' notice for donations, and more time allows for collecting more auction items. Additionally, early planning helps secure the venue, especially if the event is off-campus.","context":["Your PTO needs to earn some money. Your group has strong community support. You’re not intimidated by planning a large event. You can pull together a committed group of volunteers, maybe even 15 or 20 people. You can afford to wait several months for the payoff. You want to try something more interactive and engaging than a traditional sales fundraiser. Are you nodding your head? Then an auction might be just the fundraising project for your PTO.\nAuctions are fun, exhausting, profitable, complicated, and exciting. Unlike a fundraiser supported by a professional fundraising company, an auction requires your PTO to do most of the work on its own. But for the right group, the benefits of an auction fundraiser can outweigh the challenges of going it alone. Done well, a good auction can be quite rewarding for your group, often more so than other fundraising activities. An auction is also a social event that brings together families, friends, staff, and the community at large in mutual support of the PTO and the school. For some parent groups, the annual auction gala has become an important tradition, with the event growing in popularity and profit each year.\nThe planning for the basic auction gala follows a fairly consistent work plan. First you must assemble a strong team of dedicated volunteers. Your group then solicits donations, which will become your auction items. Fairly early on, you’ll need to make some important decisions about the format of your event. For example, will your auction be the only activity at the event, or will you incorporate the auction into a carnival, game night, or something else? Will it be held at the school or off-site? Will you offer food? Will this be an adults-only event? Will you charge for tickets? Will you offer both silent auction and live auction items?\nRegardless of format, you’ll need to publicize your event and generate enthusiasm within the school and community at large. There are some administrative tasks that must be handled, such as tracking your auction inventory, managing ticket sales, and developing bid sheets and a catalog for your guests. Creative tasks include designing decorations and preparing appealing displays for the auction items. There’s plenty of up-front work to keep your team busy.\nDuring the event itself, guests place written bids for silent auction items during a specified time period. When bidding closes, the highest bidder “wins” the item. If you include a live auction in your event, the auctioneer entices verbal bidding from the guests as a group, with the excitement growing until the final “Sold!” Typically winners pay for their items before they leave and take the items home so that by the end of the evening, all that’s left is a room full of exhausted, but happy, volunteers.\nKeys for Auction Success\nStart early. It’s not overkill to start planning six months in advance, even for a small auction. Often, national companies require several months’ advance notice for a donation. Plus, the more time you allow for donation solicitation, the more items you’ll have. You’ll also want to lock in your venue early, especially if the event is off-campus.\nRecruit strong volunteers. Your core planning team will be working together for several months and dealing with issues and challenges, so recruit wisely. This is the time to personally reach out to your most dedicated and talented members. There are plenty of jobs for less experienced helpers, too, so everyone can be involved at some point.\nMake major decisions early. You’ll need to decide right from the start the basic format of your event. Planning a family-oriented auction in your school gym differs significantly from the planning you’ll do for an adults-only dinner gala at a social club.\nConsider your community and design your event accordingly. Some communities are comfortable with an event at a fancy country club. Others might be more inclined to support a less formal venue. Location and format also affect ticket price, which could have a ripple effect on the bid amounts. The local economy also matters when designing an event like this; yes, this is a fundraiser, but you want people to be able to afford to bid.\nAsk parents to help collect auction items. Challenge each family to obtain at least one item for auction.\nCollect a range of items at different price points. Solicit big-ticket items like professional sports tickets or a mini-vacation package, but also seek out small- and medium-value items like restaurant gift certificates and jewelry. Several very low-value items can even be bundled into an appealing basket.\nDelegate the work. There’s too much for one or two people to handle. The chairperson will have a lot on her plate. Redistributing even small tasks will help.\nEngage teachers and students by encouraging each classroom to develop a special auction donation. Some of the most profitable items are student art projects. You can also assign a theme to each class and ask them to collect a basket of items related to that theme.\nConsider using auction software. There are many tasks that go into a successful auction event, some of which are computer-dependent. You can certainly do the computer work on your own, but some groups prefer to purchase professional software.\nPay attention to presentation and bundling. You want your auction items to look appealing and valuable so guests are eager to bid. Signage, décor, and lighting can all enhance the display.\nIncorporate the purpose of the auction into your marketing and decorations so bidders remember why you’re asking for their money.\nTrain on-site volunteers, including runners, cashiers, and spotters.\nSet up early in the day so you have time to make adjustments if necessary. You might be surprised by how much table length you need to display all your auction items. Lighting can also pose a problem; you may need to bring in extra lamps so your guests can read the bid sheets easily.\nKeep things moving throughout the evening. A DJ, an enthusiastic emcee, and especially a professional auctioneer can help keep the crowd energized and actively bidding.\nTake lots of photographs. You’ll never remember how things were set up, so a stack of pictures will be valuable to next year’s planning committee.\nTop 7 Ways To Increase School Auction Profits\nMake the auction the focal point of your event. It can be enticing to fit a silent auction into another event such as a carnival or family game night. However, you’ll make more money when your bidders aren’t distracted by cotton candy or “Simon Says.” Also, young children tend to lose patience when moms and dads are trying to monitor bids. It’s just about the same amount of work to manage a small “add-on” auction vs. a large exclusive auction, so focus on an auction-only event for maximum profit.\nUse a professional auctioneer if you’re having a live auction. A properly trained auctioneer comes at a price, but his fee can easily be offset by the increase in bidding during your live auction. A pro knows how to read the crowd, how to pick out the most generous bidders, when to end bidding, and how to keep the anticipation high so folks stay engaged. Invite a local celebrity to be the master of ceremonies, but hire the auctioneer.\nClose bidding on your silent auction items in groups, not all at once. By staggering the closing times, bidders can gauge their current financial commitment and then continue bidding if they feel they want to invest more for your group’s benefit. Most people come to an auction with a dollar amount in mind that they are willing to spend at your event. If all of the silent auction bidding closes simultaneously, it’s possible a bidder could be outbid on all her items, leaving her with a feeling of disappointment and her wallet still in her purse.\nAdvertise the big items as well as those with restrictions so people can plan their bidding ahead of time. Catered dinners or a group boat trip will attract higher bidding from your guests if they have their bidding groups organized in advance. High-value items like fine jewelry or professional sports tickets should also be promoted before the auction. And remember that no one can digest fine print restrictions on a bid sheet on the spot. Your guests will be more likely to bid on the airline ticket voucher or weekend getaway if they’ve had a chance to check their calendars and the details of the item before the auction.\nAccept credit cards. Make this a priority item for your planning committee. You will need to establish a merchant account with a credit card processing company ahead of time. Also, be certain to test the actual processing of the cards at your venue. You’ll have a crowd of unhappy bidders waiting in line if your one data-transfer line goes down during cash-out. You might be better off accepting credit card payments manually and paying the slightly higher processing fee for peace of mind.\nStimulate bidding wars over sentimental items. It might sound crass, but you are trying to maximize bidding. A handmade item from a class of students, such as a hand-painted chair, will attract competing bids from that classroom’s group of parents.\nReach out to corporate sponsors. Offer special recognition such as table signs, prominent ad placement in your auction catalog, and “callouts” during the evening. If you can get a local florist to donate table decorations, that’s one less expense to cut into your net profit.\nHow does the silent auction work?\nAll of the silent auction items are set out in an attractive display at the auction venue. Each auction item is identified with a unique number, and each item is accompanied by its own silent auction bid sheet. Bidders walk around the displays and write down their bids on the bid sheets, using their name or a bidder number as identification. If someone wants to bid higher, they write down a new bid on the next line of the bid sheet. Typically, guests are provided with an auction catalog that includes a complete description for each item, its value, and its item number. Guests use the catalog to help them plan their bidding. At the appropriate time, bidding is closed and the high bidders are announced.\nAt a very small auction, winners could be announced verbally, but usually the winners’ names are simply written on the bid sheet. Winners pay for their purchases at the cash-out area and take their items home at the end of the event.\nHow much can we expect to earn from our auction?\nUnfortunately, net profit is hard to predict, especially for your first auction. The changing economy also affects profit levels. In general, profit depends on the number of auction items you secure, the value of the items, the number of guests at your event, their willingness to bid on your items, and your overhead costs such as publicity, facility rental, food, and auctioneer. If you charge enough for tickets to cover your overhead costs, then all the auction funds are profit. A rough rule of thumb is that a silent auction can raise 60 percent to 75 percent of the value of the items. If you keep meticulous records, it will be easier to estimate your profit year to year.\nHow do we solicit auction donations?\nAsk, ask, ask. Use many different avenues for donations. Mail out letters to large corporations, go door-to-door in your local business community, involve students in developing themed baskets or artwork, challenge families to secure at least one donation each. The St. Theodore Holy Family Catholic School PTC in Lake Charles, La., sends smart shoppers to watch for closeout sales; smaller items are grouped together into a gift basket. The group also sends volunteers door-to-door to solicit donations. And donation forms are distributed to families in May so they can be on the lookout for action items throughout the summer, says auction chairwoman Denise Savoie.\nShould we charge for tickets?\nThat depends on the format of your event and your community’s experience. Tickets are usually sold for a sophisticated, “adults only,” off-campus auction gala in a community familiar with such fundraisers. However, if this is a completely new concept to your families, you might want to keep admission low or even free. When you’re setting your ticket price, however, consider costs and psychology. If you intend to serve food and beverages (highly recommended), then charge at least enough to cover those costs. Also, consider that people tend to believe there’s value if there’s a cost. So if admission is free, you might be sending the wrong message about the quality and importance of the event. Look around at similar events in your area to gauge what would be agreeable to your community.\nAuction Dos and Don’ts\nDon’t underestimate the amount of work.\nDo ask your families to help solicit donations.\nDo be creative with your auction items. One-of-a-kind experiences and “priceless” items usually bring high bids.\nDon’t overprice your opening bids. You want people to feel comfortable making that first bid, which will get things going.\nDo offer items at a variety of price points. Not everyone can afford to bid on the trip to Las Vegas.\nDo advertise the highly valuable items or those with important restrictions well in advance of the event. Encourage your guests to preplan group bidding and check their calendars for items that are date-dependent.\nDon’t forget to send a proper thank-you to all your donors and volunteers.\nNew and Trendy\nThe most significant change in the world of auction fundraising is the emergence of online fundraising auctions. The popularity of eBay for personal auctions has proved that people are comfortable bidding over the Internet. Now that technology has been adapted for fundraising, and many PTOs are expanding the reach of their auction beyond their local community. Typically, an online auction, run by a company like BiddingForGood, complements the live auction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff1446a9-a694-4e2c-8c22-783639c29a75>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can one simultaneously achieve spiritual growth while actively contributing to society's welfare according to Islamic teachings?","answer":"According to Islamic teachings, spiritual growth and civic engagement are intrinsically linked and mutually reinforcing. The process involves purifying one's soul through constant remembrance of God while actively engaging with society. This includes ridding oneself of vices like arrogance, anger, and greed, while developing virtues such as compassion, mercy, and humility. One must interact with fellow humans and contribute to social welfare, as these interactions are essential for spiritual progress. The model demonstrates that serving others, fighting societal injustices, and working for the community's welfare are integral parts of spiritual development, rather than separate from it. This approach is exemplified by historical Muslim figures who combined profound spiritual status with active societal engagement.","context":["It would not be an exaggeration to claim that today Islamic spirituality has become the monopoly of the Sufis and faith-based civic engagement is more or less the exclusive domain of the Islamists. They are perceived to be diametrically opposite strands of thought and mutually exclusive. Co-existence between the two is a misnomer and to some an oxymoron. The discourse on Islam at all levels from policy-making bodies to grass-root organizations is permeated with this atomistic and fragmented interpretation of the Islamic faith. The Quran describes Prophet Muhammad as the best of examples and we are in dire need of examining the prophetic model of spiritual development and civic engagement. Can one simultaneously tread the spiritual path and strive to build a better society for all?\nIslam – like all monotheistic traditions – calls towards submission to one God who created human beings with a dual existence – the spiritual and the physical. The nafkha (divine blowing) by God into our soul upon our creation symbolises our spiritual existence and our human body is a manifestation of the physical. There is a part of us that moves according to laws of gravity, biological drives and instincts but at the same time our soul yearns for the word of ideals and the spirit. Prophet Muhammad even before his prophethood at the age of forty was one who was yearning for the Divine and striving for a better society for the welfare of his fellow human beings. The regular visit to the cave of Hira for extended periods of seclusion contemplating about human soul, God's creation the universe and the plight of mankind laid the foundations for what the Sufis term khalwa (isolation and seclusion with the One) and muhasba (self–evaluation). This period of seclusion was a pre-requisite for the Prophet’s soul to come into close communion with the Unseen Power that lies behind all aspects of existence in this infinite universe. The very first few verses revealed to the Prophet contained spiritual lessons of acknowledging the limitation of human knowledge and to humble oneself before the Creator. “He taught man that which he was ignorant of.”(96:5)\nProphet Muhammad was the perfect human being - al-insan al kamil – who reached the peak of spiritual success such that the Divine left his legacy for those who came after him as the main source and best of examples for reaching spiritual heights. This is a spirituality that connects the soul to its Eternal and ever-lasting Owner and purifies the human soul of its inherent vices of arrogance, anger, hatred, self-infatuation, greed, envy, love-, of wealth and power, miserliness and replaces it with compassion, mercy, love, humility, patience, gratitude, dependence upon God , and generosity. It is through the constant remembrance of God that the heart reaches a state of spiritual tranquility. When Aisha asked the Prophet why he sought forgiveness from God more than seventy times daily – despite his infallibility – the reply was “Should I not be a grateful servant of God?”\nThe prophetic model of spirituality was also one led by example. He was the ‘walking Quran’. Surely the virtuous qualities of the human soul that each and every one of us would like to be identified with cannot be achieved in isolation. Interacting with fellow human beings and contributing to the advancement of human welfare is a pre-requisite for spiritual progress. At one level, both are intrinsically linked. For how can one rid oneself of arrogance and control anger if one is not ‘engaged’ with others? Do we not see the Prophet sitting on the street of Medina next to an old woman to listen to her story and concerns? Do we not hear Anas Ibn Malik – who served the Prophet for over ten years saying that his beloved never once reprimanded him or said a word of contempt? Do we not feel the compassion with which the Prophet treated the Bedouin who urinated in his mosque? Do we not heed the words of Ibn al-Abbas who said that there was none more generous in giving than the Prophet? The life of the Prophet is only but an everlasting testimony to the spiritual and ethical values of Islam.\nThe Prophet’s spiritual journey was intertwined with civic engagement – the concern and quest for the social, economic, political, educational, and cultural welfare of human societies. The struggle for societal change was predicated on solid spiritual foundations. Just as one is to rid oneself of the vices of the soul, combating societal vices of injustice, oppression, inequality and racism is equally a moral as well as an Islamic obligation and responsibility. The Prophet was engaged with the welfare of his society even before prophethood. He participated in a pact known as Hilf al-Fudul, which aimed to help the needy, the oppressed and poor and later stated that were he invited to such a treaty again – he would not hesitate to partake once more.\nThe Prophet earned the title of ‘al-Amin’ – the trustworthy, such that even his enemies who were persecuting the Muslims of Mecca would entrust their belongings with him. In the dispute between the Meccan tribes when re-building the Ka'bah it was decided that whosoever enters the sanctuary first would judge between him. Imagine their delight when this person happened to be Prophet Muhammad. They had confidence in his fairness and administration of justice.\nThe Sahifa of Medina is considered to be the first written constitution of the world where in the rights and responsibilities of the citizens of Medina were enshrined. It is under the Sahifa that the Jews of Madina were regarded as part of the ‘ummah’ or community with the believers of Medina – tolerance, co-existence and mutual co-operation at its best. The Prophet said that a Muslim who interacts with others and is patient in facing all the hardship - that comes through this engagement – is a better Muslim than one who isolates himself from people and is not patient.(Tirmidhi)\nThe prophetic model of craving for the Divine is thus actualized through sincere faith and practice and service for His creation. God is at the service of His creation as long as they are in the service of each other. A good Muslim is not the one who merely observes religious rituals. The Quran states: “Righteousness is not whether you turn your faces to the East or the West but righteous is he who believes in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets; and gives of his wealth for the love (of God) to relatives, orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and those who ask for (the liberation) of slaves; and establishes the ritual prayer and pays the zakat; and those who keep their pledges when they make them, and show patience in hardship and adversity, and in times of distress. Such are the truthful, and such are God-fearing.(2:177)\nThis Quranic vision of a righteous and committed Muslim is beautifully described by one of America’s leading Muslim scholars and intellectuals. Dr Umar Faruq Abdallah in his paper Living Islam with Purpose: “Stressing societal obligations shows that Islam is much more than a religion of personal pieties and that it cannot be narrowly restricted to the activities of mosques or Islamic centers. The performance of individual obligations like prayer and fasting never removes a Muslim’s moral duty to meet societal ones. The one seemingly upright of Muslims are liable for divine retribution if they ignore societal obligation and content themselves with personal piety alone. At the same time, there must be no confusion; personal dedication to the community's needs does not remove a Muslim’s individual obligation to perform acts of personal piety.”\nIt is this synthesized legacy which is embodied in the not so distant past – in the lives and struggles of inspirational Muslim personalities – the likes of Shah Waliullah in India (1703-1762), Uthman Dan Fodio in Nigeria (1754-817), Abdul Qadir al-Jazairi in Algeria (1807-1883), Alexander Russell Webb in America (1846-1916), Abdullah Quilliam in Britain (1856-1932), Bediuzzaman Said Nursi in Turkey (1877-1960). All were men of profound spiritual maqam (status) – many even aligned to Sufi tariqas – but they also strove to extend their inner peace and tranquility to the societies they lived in. Theirs was an integrated approach to faith – one that was deeply rooted in God-consciousness and yearning for the Divine while exerting all efforts to make their faith relevant to the time and space they occupied.\nCivic engagement is not be limited to political participation only. The prophetic model is one that calls for engaging with all spheres of civic life. Our challenge as Muslims and citizens – wherever we may live – is to articulate a vision transcending identity–politics and move towards what may be termed – 'Islamic humanism'. Our Prophet was sent as a mercy to all of mankind. His was a message rooted in ethics and human dignity. In our quest to impart the radiance of this prophetic mercy on a societal level, particular focus needs to be paid to areas such as good governance, environmental issues, social justice and combating materialism, poverty and illiteracy.\nIt is imperative for the contemporary Islamic discourse to revive this prophetic legacy of an authentic, dynamic and creative synthesis of the esoteric and exoteric dimensions of the Islamic faith. This entails that the interpretation and practice of our faith is holistic, integrated and relevant. We need to distance ourselves from the pseudo-spirituality on offer in the global cultural supermarket which is more concerned with ritual formalities and a folkloric attachment to our faith. At the same time we need to shun the excesses of the politicization of our faith and the self-interest based civic engagement driven by identity – politics and the pursuit of worldly power and material gains. In short, spirituality needs to extend beyond the Sufis and faith - based civic engagement out of the dominance of the Islamists. The question is: Could this give birth to sufislamism?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f093dbe4-41d8-4ee6-9277-f24a236a57ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a cybersecurity researcher studying authentication methods, could you explain how modern 2FA solutions function in practice, and what are the privacy implications of biometric data storage?","answer":"Modern 2FA solutions primarily operate through smartphone applications using either PIN codes or push notifications. Push notifications are considered more advanced as they work over data connections and don't require cell service like SMS. The most common implementations are through services like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or paid solutions like Duo. Regarding privacy implications of biometric storage, there are significant concerns. Companies can legally collect and store biometric data with user consent in most US states (except Texas and Illinois for commercial use). Large biometric databases, like Facebook's face database with 350 million images, raise privacy concerns as this data can be used for identification without consent and, if compromised, cannot be changed like passwords can.","context":["Two Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is the most common preventative measure that companies and organizations implement as an additional layer of security to the standard username and password login credentials on a website or application. Taking a half-step back, 2FA/MFA can be described as something you know and something you have. 2FA/MFA is currently used on almost every application, from banking websites to SaaS services to video games\nThe most common question I get is ‘what should I use for Two Factor Authentication?’.\nYears ago, the answer was rather simple, as there was only one player in this space. It was RSA tokens or nothing. That market has changed dramatically. There are many options available for 2FA, and the choices seem almost daunting. In this blog post, I will be walking you through your options and hopefully provide some guidance on this path.\nI've broken this down into three options. 2FA solutions that you would buy; for example, RSA or Duo authentication. 2FA solutions that you would borrow; such as Microsoft's Authenticator for Office 365. And lastly, 2FA solutions that you would loot (get for free), like Google Authenticator.\nI'll start with the free options because everyone likes free, don't they? Google has a free application for most smartphones that can integrate into a lot of websites and current services available. It's rather simple to set up on the client side, generally scanning a QR code on a website or from an email to make it work successfully. Free is good, right? The challenge with free is that if you are looking to deploy this for an internal application or developed SaaS application, it would require your developers to integrate Google's code into your website and to depend on the application. This might be the more considerable challenge that it would seem on the surface.\nThere are many services available now that have a 2FA solution build into them. I say ‘borrow’ because more often than not, you are already paying for them as part of another service you are getting. Microsoft’s Office 365 suite (including Exchange online and Sharepoint) have various options already built in for 2FA. The Microsoft Authenticator is my personal preference, once again, another smartphone application that will send you a push notification to authorize a login to one of their services. They also offer everything from a callback option (yes, they call your phone, and you need to hit the pound key to log in), to SMS messages with a pin included, to even an email verification. The Authenticator application is the least disruptive, in my opinion, and doesn't always require cell service because it will use a data connection as well. (Besides, we get enough text messages and phone calls as it is, don't we?)\nCapital expense! (Say it with me, ewww…) Most companies will often look for the one ring to rule them all. They want a solution that is going to accommodate all their options so that users only have one application they need to load on their smartphone that will work for everything. As I previously mentioned, RSA was the key player in this space for a long time. Dating back to using credit card style tokens with a pin code on them, now offering a smartphone application that can even support multiple users. They are not the only option in this space anymore. They still probably have the most extensive adoption of the off the shelf style solution, but there are others in this space as well. Duo has become a personal favorite as an alternative. Lower initial cost and a lower overall cost of ownership. Also, offering integrations beyond a smartphone application, including smart cards and certificates which can integrate into their solution. These can give you the option to authenticate the user and the machine, most often used if you only want a corporate asset to connect to a remote access VPN for example.\nOptions, options, options\nThere are many options available. As you have probably seen, I said smartphone about a half dozen times. Every solution has a smartphone application. My recommendation, just get over it. Yes, people can lose their phones, but every solution provides a relatively simple option to reset a device one the app is loaded again. Moreover, most people guard their smartphones as if it were one of their most sacred possessions. The cost of ‘soft tokens' is often far less, or free!\nAlso, abandon the idea of using a single 2FA for everything. Currently, I have a tab on my phone that is just MFA soft tokens. One for AWS, one for Azure and Office 354, one for remote access VPN, and the list goes on. Of course, the more that you can use a single 2FA solution for, the better. However, at the end of the day, nothing is going to work seamlessly with every application. Standardizing as much as possible helps, but with the development of many SaaS applications, you are most likely going to be tied to whatever solution they support. Don't fight it, roll with it. The best way to look at it is to accept, like for every website, you have a different login (username/email address/password), you are most likely going to have a different 2FA solution for it. The real recommendation here would be to deploy one 2FA for internal resources (Like Duo) and use it for as much as you possibly can, then use the integrated solution for SaaS/PaaS/IaaS solutions.\nPin, push or call\nAs each of these solutions offers multiple ways to validate that you are indeed you, there are some that are better than others. The traditional callback option should go the way of the Dodo and stay in the 1980s like monochrome monitors. The real options now should be a pin code or a push notification. Google, Microsoft, and RSA all provide options for a pin code, and this is the most common type of 2FA on the market. You can log in, then type in a pin that appears on your smartphone, or one that is sent to you via an SMS message. The new wave is done via push notification to an application on your phone. Microsoft and Duo (at least) provide this feature. When you log in to a site, server or service, a notification is sent to your smartphone for you to accept the login then. No pin required. Just hit ‘yes' or ‘accept' on your phone to process the login. There are some tremendous benefits to this. For one, it doesn't require you to have cell services (like an SMS) because it can use data. Second, there is little to no chance of the pin expiring on your phone in the middle of your login, resulting in a failed login and having to start over.\nThere are many options available for Two Factor and Multifactor authentication on the market. Now it’s a matter of choosing what’s right for your specific business needs. With these options laid you in front of you, I hope that this provided some guidance on where you can go with the solution. If you have further questions, feel free to reach out to us. We will be able to guide you down the right path for your organization.","In part 1, we covered the brilliance of biometrics including increased security and convenience. There’s a lot of biometric data out there already and loads of research in this area making it more of a daily reality.\nGenerally speaking, it’s all very good news, but this post is a word of caution highlighting some of the risks of this technology.\nBiometric data for authentication\nHow many fingers do you have? Easy – eight fingers, and two thumbs. What about your other biometrics? One face, two ears, two eyes and one set of DNA.\nYou don’t have that many really. So what happens if you start losing them? Not physically losing a finger in some Tarantino-style act of violence. But rather what happens when someone else steals your biometric data?\nYou can’t change your fingerprint. Once it’s stolen, you can never trust it. In fact, you need to mark it globally as unusable.\nSome biometric data is easily captured without you knowing it. For example, analyzing a photo of your face, lifting your fingerprint from a glass or picking a strand of loose hair from your coat.\nWhen compared to a password that should only really be stored in the depths of your mind, biometric data is actually more vulnerable than you may think.\nStoring your measurements\nTo match the convenience of a password used with a cloud software service, your biometric data would need to be moved off a device so that you can log in from anywhere. Now, all of a sudden, some of your most unique and personal data is stored somewhere that you don’t know about. Does that make you feel comfortable?\nLosing this sort of data has already happened. In September 2015, the Office of Personnel Management had 5.6 million fingerprints stolen. That’s a lot of people who potentially can never use a fingerprint scanner system ever again.\nIndia has a hugely successful biometrics program with a database of over a billion fingerprints and iris scans. Imagine the impact of having all that data stolen.\nThe legal implications\nIt seems the industry is yet to work out the legal implications of storing and using this highly personal identification information.\nFacebook has the largest ‘face database’ in the world with over 350 million images stored. Many of those images have been dutifully tagged by us with location information, names of people featured, relevant event information and date. Some of this information is automatically tagged.\nEarlier this year, there was a lengthy court case against a video game publisher and its right to collect and store players’ biometric data. The publisher won the case. This result demonstrates that as long as you’ve agreed to its T&C’s, a company has the right to store and use your data.\nIn 48 states across the US, it’s totally legal to use an image of you to recognize you without consent (only Texas and Illinois do not allow it for commercial use). So your image captured by Company X could be reused to identify you by Company Y and Z.\nImagine walking into a new car dealership and having your image automatically recognized without your knowledge. After being warmly greeted by a sales advisor who seemingly remembers everything about your last encounter, you would feel pretty special. Equally, what kind of treatment would you get if your reputation isn’t so good?\nWhat about privacy?\nSome people argue that the promise of absolute authorization via biometrics has a negative implication – privacy. For example, an ambiguous name and password combination could be used by someone to buy something online, masking the identity of the actual purchaser.\nOn the other hand, a purchase made using a fingerprint unmistakenly pins the owner to the purchase or activity. The privacy argument in such a case is that sometimes, for some reason, you might like to make a purchase or use a service with a degree of anonymity. Using a biometric marker erodes that right. It’s a cash vs credit card argument and it boils down to trust or the lack of it.\nSo herein lies the kinks – who collects, stores, and uses your ultra-unique biometric data? Who do you trust to do that? Also, what are your legal rights to sharing and selling that information?\nPasswords still relevant\nPasswords have problems too, but having thought about them next to biometrics, they are still powerful. You can have tonnes of them and hopefully, if you’re following best practice, they are all different and all complex.\nIf you forget a password or have it stolen, it’s no real problem. Generate a new one and off you go.\nWant to create a new account on that forum and stay anonymous? Go ahead and use a random username with a brand new password.\n2017 and beyond\nSo perhaps the short-term answer here is to continue to develop biometrics, work out the kinks in the technology and address the legal questions.\nI would be genuinely cautious about companies and institutions building huge biometric databases and how they use that information. History supports this concern where we’ve seen such rich resources falling into the wrong hands or being used without care.\nBiometrics is an innovative tool for security but don’t forget your password just yet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3d1178ae-1f77-4ab7-ad25-255931095d42>","<urn:uuid:2fa1134b-cb44-446a-8cd7-4fe6f00b9c6c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which specific regulation requires foreign banks to report US nationals' assets exceeding $50,000?","answer":"The Foreign Accounting Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign banks to report all assets of US nationals or companies that exceed $50,000. This regulation was implemented to prevent the use of offshore assets as a means of hiding income from the IRS.","context":["No matter what your business does, it is likely that you are affected in some way by regulation. For some industries, proving compliance may be as simple as a health inspection from time to time.\nFor others, compliance is an ongoing process that demands significant resources and planning. One thing is for sure, whatever your industry, proving compliance will involve some level of documentation.\nDespite its ubiquity, regulatory compliance continues to be a point of confusion and frustration for many organizations. This is partly due to the constantly evolving nature of regulation for many industries, but it is also to do with confusion over what exactly constitutes compliance documentation, and how that documentation should be managed. So, what is documentation management and how can it help your business achieve compliance?\nWhat is Document Management?\nDocument management is any system or set of processes that are put in place to manage documentation. At one end of the spectrum, this could simply be a series of unlabeled filing cabinets or loose hard drives. However, as anyone who has experienced a “document management” system like this could attest (and they do exist), that is a quick way to cause yourself a lot of headaches.\nMost businesses will have some organized form of document management in place, as it is very difficult to run an effective business without one. This will involve the storage, labeling, and indexing of all documents that are pertinent to the operation of the business, both physical and digital/electronic. Essentially, anything that may need to be referred back to or referenced at a later date. For most enterprise-level businesses, or any operating in a heavily-regulated industry, this will be an electronic Document Management System (DMS).\nDocuments vs. Records\nJust as not all rectangles are squares, not all documents are records. Every email on that chain that you really didn’t need to be on is a document. Every word document and every slide deck. Naturally, not all of those are stored and managed actively, nor should they be. So, at what point does a document cross the line and become a record?\nWhat is a Document?\nDocuments are pieces of recorded information (both digital and physical) that are produced and utilized by the day to day operations of your business or organization. They are active, often still in the process of being created. Some of them may become records, but not necessarily.\nAs it deals with living documents that are in active use, document management is primarily concerned with improving the day-to-day efficiency of an organization by streamlining how documents are created and moved around.\nDocument management aims to:\n- Optimize document retrieval speed\n- Improve organizational efficiency\n- Reduce document loss\n- Use storage space for effectively\nWhat is a Record?\nRecords always begin their life as documents of some type or another. The key difference is that records are generally fixed, or are at least not revised regularly. This is because records serve as evidence of the activity of a business or organization, rather than being part of day-to-day operations.\nRecords are documents that provide a record of the activity of a business, whether they be evidence of training or the academic records of students. When it comes to compliance or legal challenges, it is primarily the records of a business that will be looked at. For this reason, records management involves many of the same aims as document management, with a greater focus on controls and disposition schedules.\nRecords management aims to:\n- Determine a clear chain of custody and audit trail\n- Maintain a consistent record lifecycle\n- Clearly identify the owner of records\n- Implement a consistent retention and disposition schedule\n- Bring an organization in line with regulatory requirements\nDocument Management and the Importance of Compliance\nGenerally speaking, document management is not a requirement, per se, of compliance with most regulatory frameworks. As noted above, compliance generally requires a consistent system of record for audits. Some, like the FDA’s CFR Part 11 actually include very specific terminology about the level of records management that is in place. Others, like the CCPA, do not require that a specific system be put in place, but the requirements of access and disposition for records mean that it would be impossible to be in compliance without a proper records management system in place.\nHowever, a proper system of document management can be hugely beneficial for meeting regulatory compliance requirements. This is because every record begins its life as a document. So, putting an integrated system of document and records management means that you will have a seamless record lifecycle from creation to disposition. This will improve operational efficiency generally, but it will also ensure that as documents transition into becoming records, there is no risk of them being misfiled or lost. And that’s not the only benefit of good document management.\nCommon Regulatory Frameworks\nWhile most regulatory frameworks do not have specific document management requirements, some do. Or, if they don’t, they have particularly stringent and complex records management requirements. Either way, compliance with these frameworks is made much easier with a robust document management platform or system. Below are some examples of these types of frameworks.\nFDA 21 CFR Part 11\nGoverning all food and drug manufacturers, the FDA’s regulation is one of the best examples of complex compliance requirements. With a specific focus on pharmaceutical and medical instrumentation manufacturers, 21 CFR Part 11 has incredibly strict requirements regarding document access and electronic signatures, both of which can and do fall under document management.\nCreated as a response to the 2008-9 financial crisis, Dodd-Frank was one of the most sweeping overhauls of regulation in recent history. While the law touches almost every aspect of the US financial system, the document and records management aspect essentially stipulates that all information related to trades must be held for up to 30 years and be readily accessible to the SEC and CFTC. This makes for incredibly complex document and records management that makes both active and inactive documents/records constantly available for audit.\nOne of the few regulations that has specific recommendations regarding document management, the Foreign Accounting Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires that foreign banks report all assets of US nationals or companies in excess of $50k. The goal was to limit the use of offshore assets as a means for hiding income from the IRS. For companies with offshore assets, this means that all documentation regarding offshore assets must be tracked accurately and reported to the IRS.\nIn 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) brought huge changes to how patient information was handled by insurance and healthcare providers. With the much more active and frequently accessed records of the healthcare industry, HIPAA compliance absolutely requires a highly-effective and streamlined document management system to avoid hefty fines.\nDocument Management Solutions for Compliance\nThankfully, good document management doesn’t mean having a whole separate platform from your records management. It also doesn’t mean dealing with a digital document management system that won’t integrate with your physical documents and records. A modern document and records management software system will allow you to effectively manage your active documents and seamlessly transition them into your records retention and disposition lifecycle.\nIt will also allow for the digitization of your physical documents and records, bringing both digital and physical information management under one roof. With built-in compliance tools for specific frameworks that you need to meet, integrated document management solutions should turn compliance from a complicated headache into a regular part of your daily operations.\nWhatever level of compliance requirements you need to meet, if you are an enterprise organization then good document management should be a priority either way. It allows for a streamlined flow of information through your organization and protects against the unnecessary loss and misfiling of documents, improving operational efficiency across the board.\nHowever, if you are governed by one of the more complex or stringent regulations, then your system needs to go beyond managing active documents. By integrating your document management and records management into one coherent ecosystem, you can make compliance into an inherent part of your day-to-day operations, rather than some additional level of work to do. The right document and records management solution will do all that for you and more."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2e849193-67de-4d15-ba5f-8a88e9bda7df>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the recommended daily sugar intake for women and how does it compare to the sugar content in a can of coke?","answer":"Women are supposed to take about 25 grams of sugar in a day, while one can of coke contains 33 grams of sugar, which exceeds the recommended daily intake.","context":["When you eat junk and fast food, almost every kind of food in that category has processed sugar in it. Women are supposed to take about 25 grams of sugar in a day, and one can of coke accounts for 33 grams of sugar. Imagine the amounts of sugar your body receives. At a young age, our body is quite strong and enduring to all the extra amount of sugar we consume. As we get old, all of the processed sugar we consume is capable of causing a number of health issues.\nOur body needs sugar, but processed sugar is just too much for the body to take. When you know how harmful processed sugar can be for you, you wouldn’t want to put your body through so much trouble. Instead, substituting this with natural sugars from fruits is the best idea. That being said, have a peek here at a few points that signal why having too much sugar is bad for you.\nMore than half of the world’s population suffers from diabetes today. We can account this to high consumption of sugar. Most of the foods out there in the market contain a high amount of sugar. Having an excess amount of sugar increases our body’s resistance to insulin. As a result, the sugar does not get absorbed by the cells and remains in the bloodstream.\nIncreases chances of cardiovascular diseases\nHaving a lot of processed sugar causes obesity, and the body would also encounter triglyceride inflammation. Excess sugar is also capable of causing arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is the clogging of arteries, which causes high blood pressure. This, in turn, creates an increased susceptibility for many cardiovascular diseases.\nCauses weight gain\nHaving a lot of processed sugar directly causes a gain in body weight and obesity. Soda drinks and bottled juices contain fructose. Fructose is the kind of sugar that is capable of increasing your appetite. Thus, as a result, you would eat a lot on top of consuming a lot of processed sugar from the drink. Both the factors cause an increase in weight over time.\nIncreases risks of cancer\nThere are many reasons why you may have higher chances of developing cancer when you have high amounts of sugar. Obesity and inflammation from resistance against insulin are capable of causing cancer. However, you are susceptible to certain types of cancer more than others, for instance, esophageal cancer, pleural cancer, endometrial cancer, and cancer in small intestines.\nOur liver breaks down fructose and stores it in the form of glycogen. When there is an excess amount of fructose for the liver to break down into glycogen, the liver fails to convert all that sugar into glycogen, and instead, they turn into fats. This condition is called fatty liver. Having sugary drinks can significantly increase the risks of developing fatty liver.\nBesides these conditions, too much sugar also causes acne, quicker aging, draining of energy, increase in depression, and many other health problems. Keeping a check on your sugar intake is essential if you want to have a healthy body for a long time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fea5325a-0099-471c-a78c-9fe51ba43752>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do clinical psychologists' educational pathways compare to psychiatrists' training, and what implications does this have for families seeking mental health support while dealing with wait times?","answer":"Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have different educational pathways that affect how families can access their services. Clinical psychologists complete a PhD or PsyD program, focusing on psychological treatments and talk therapy, but cannot prescribe medications. Psychiatrists, on the other hand, are medical doctors with additional years of specialized training in psychiatry, allowing them to both prescribe medications and provide other treatments. In terms of access, psychiatrist services are covered by provincial health plans with no out-of-pocket costs, similar to other medical doctors. However, psychological services in private practice require either direct payment or coverage through work benefits. When dealing with wait times, families can access either type of professional, with private practice often having shorter wait times than public services, though cost may be a factor for psychological services.","context":["Waiting for Mental Health Services: What Parents and Caregivers Can Do\nAsk to be put on a cancellation list (if your provider has one). This gives you the possibility of being seen more quickly. If another family cancels an appointment, your service provider calls you to see if your child or teen can make the appointment time. If not, you can wait for the next availabale appointment. Make sure your provider has up to date contact information for you, including a number where you can be reached during the day.\nLet your mental health service provider (or family doctor) know if your child or teen is getting worse. Your child’s place on the wait list depends on many things, including your child’s needs. Let your service provider know if your child or teen:\n- Is feeling more depressed or anxious;\n- Has more trouble at home or school;\n- Expresses thoughts that life is no longer worth living.\nCheck out support services. Many organizations have ‘wait-list supports’, like:\n- Mental health information;\n- Information about support and advocacy groups.\nKeep your family doctor or pediatrician in the loop. If your child or teen gets worse, he or she may be able to advocate on your behalf. Your doctor may also know about other available services.\nKeep a journal. Write about events, situations, behaviours and worries that you want to share with your service provider. This is a good way to prepare for your first appointment.\nBe ready for the first appointment. Make notes of what you want to discuss with the service provider. If you have kept a journal, this will be much easier. It’s important that your service provider see a progression of how things have been going. It’s easy to forget things or only focus on what’s happened recently if you don’t write them down.\nEven though you might be waiting for services at one agency, you can still contact other services and ask to be placed on their wait-list as well. Let them know that you are doing this. Many agencies will encourage you to do this to make sure you aren’t ‘putting all your eggs in one basket’.\nSchool services. Many high schools have mental health resources available including psychologists, mental health nurses and addictions counsellors. Contact your child’s principal or vice-principal to access these services. Schools may also be able to help refer you to other services.\nEmployee Assistance Programs. Your employer may have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that can usually provide at least a few meetings with a mental health professional. These services are confidential, and your employer will not know if or why you contacted EAP.\nPrivate services. Wait lists are more common for public services like hospital clinics or a children’s mental health agency (this care is covered with your health card). You can make an appointment with a psychologist or social worker in private practice if you can pay the fee yourself (or if you have work benefits that will cover the cost). You may not have to wait at all to see a professional in private practice.\nProfessionals in private practice: (Please see the resource section at the end of this fact sheet to learn how to find a mental health professional)\nPsychologists and psychological associates. Clinical psychologists have earned a PhD at university. They are qualified to assess, diagnose and treat mental health conditions, and focus on talk therapy (psychological treatments), but do not prescribe medications. Some universities provide mental health services to their community at a reduced cost, often based on income. To find a psychologist anywhere in Canada, visit the Canadian Register of Health Service Psychologists at http://www.crhspp.ca\nSocial workers: Social workers have a university degree in social work. They do not diagnose mental health conditions, but they can provide counseling and therapy to help you and your family cope with mental health concerns.\nCertified counsellors. In many places, anyone can call themselves a therapist or counsellor without formal training. To make sure your counsellor or therapist is truly qualified, check out the Counselling and Psychotherapy Association (CACP). To find a certified counsellor/therapist in your area, visit the CACP website at http://www.ccacc.ca.\nPsychiatrists. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who have taken several years of extra training in psychiatry. They are able to assess, diagnosis and treat mental health conditions (with medications or without). Ask your family doctor or pediatrician if they can refer you to a psychiatrist in private practice. Psychiatrists are covered by your provincial health plan, and just like seeing any other medical doctor, you do not have to pay ‘out of pocket’ for their services.\nWarmth and support from parents makes all the difference in the world to children and youth, though they may not always show it. Strong family support leads to better outcomes for youth, whether they have a mental health problem or not.\nSpend quality, one-on-one time with your child or teen, at least a few times each week. Quality time can mean just talking or doing an activity together, for at least 15-30 minutes. Time with just the 2 of you will give your child or teen the chance to share experiences, feelings or worries. It will be easier for your teen to open up when it’s just the two of you. Focus on making this a positive experience for both of you. Increasing positive interactions may help to decrease negative things, like arguing.\nInteractive activities are best for creating a strong bond. Watching TV together can be a good place to start if you’re rebuilding your relationship with your child or teen. And it while it can be a positive experience, it doesn’t give many chances for talking and listening. You can work up to other activities that will give better chances for conversation.\nTry things like:\n- Cooking or baking together\n- Walking, hiking, going for a bike ride or throwing a ball around\n- Board or card games (video games don’t really offer good chances for talking)\n- Teaching your child or teen how to do something (knitting, a sport, car repairs, fishing or building)\n- Activities where you have more skill than your children, to help them appreciate that parents are capable, worth looking up to, and a source of help when needed.\nConnect before correcting. When your child or teen shares feelings, ‘validate’ these feelings by showing that you’ve heard and care. This helps to make children and youth feel loved and understood. Don’t criticize or minimize his feelings. And try not to jump in with advice-although this is sometimes hard, because we really want to help! Giving advice when your child is just sharing feelings can make her feel that you really don’t understand. If she thinks she’s going to get a lecture every time she shares her feelings, then she won’t confide in you.\n- Teen: “I’m freaking out-I’m so stressed about all the school work I have to do. I just can’t handle it!”\n- Parent: “Sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by everything you have to do right now... How can I help?”\nLess helpful responses:\n- Blame and advice: “Well, it’s your own fault. You should have done your homework instead of watching TV.”\n- Reassurance (without first connecting): “You’re worried for nothing! You don’t really have that much to do, you’ll be fine!”\nWhat teens usually want most is to be empathy, to be heard and listened to. Reassurance, or advice giving, even though well intentioned, is no substitute for what most people really want, which is empathy.\nIf you’re worried about something, state your concerns with a gentle observation. For example:\n- “I’ve noticed you seem a bit sad lately. I’m worried about you, how are things going?”\n- \"I'm here for you... How do you want me to support you?”\n- “Do you want me to just listen? Or do you want my advice too?”\nDon’t be discouraged if you feel that your child or teen is trying to detach from you. Many children and youth are very focused on their peers. It might even seem that they value their friends and peers more than parents. Children and youth struggling with mental health problems may also try to detach from parents. Try not to take this personally. Your child or teen still really needs you, even if he isn’t aware of it. While peers are very important, they just don’t have the same, long term commitment that a parent or caregiver has. Parents and caregivers, not peers, will always ‘be there’ in good times and bad, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is just not possible for peers. Only parents and caregivers can truthfully say, “It’s OK if you’re feeling this way. I’m here for you and always will be. We’ll get through this together”. Very rarely can peers offer this kind of support, because they’re still just growing up themselves.\nNo matter what mental health issue your child is struggling with, caring for the body and mind can really help. Taking care of the basics can go a long way to helping your child or teen to feel better.\nIf you have a good enough connection with your team, try to model and encourage your teen to:\n- Get enough sleep. Most of us, children and youth included, don’t get enough sleep, and a lack of sleep can lower mood and energy levels. Better sleep can improve behaviour, attention and outlook. Try to work out a regular bedtime, and a calming bedtime ritual. Keep computers, TVs, cell phones and video games out of the bedroom.\n- Eat healthy meals and snacks, with plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n- Be physically active. Children and youth need about an hour each day of physical activity, and if this happens outside, even better. Studies also show that exercise can have antidepressant effects.\n- Have limits on ‘screen time’. Too much screen time doesn’t leave enough time for physical activity or ‘face time’ with family and friends. And it can interfere with sleep. Try to set a limit on the amount of time each day your child or teen spends watching TV, using social media or playing video games. Please don’t try to ‘ban’ anything-this could start a small war. Have a discussion with your child or teen about setting reasonable limits that everyone can live with.\n- Take care of yourself too. Waiting for mental health services can be stressful. Make sure you’re eating well, getting enough sleep and exercise too. The best way to get your children to take care of themselves, is for you to model healthy behaviours.\nStress is part of our daily lives. Mental health problems like depression or anxiety can make it harder to handle these everyday stresses. Learning to cope with stress in a positive way is an important part of mental health.\nHelp your child or teen to:\nGet support (especially from you!). Remind your child or teen that you are always there for support during rough times. Listen and validate your child’s feelings. Ask your child or teen how she’d like to be supported.\nIdentify sources of stress. Children and youth often feel stressed by:\n- School (teachers, schoolwork);\n- Friends and peers (sometimes bullying);\nParents and siblings (family conflicts, financial troubles, separation, divorce, family illnesses).\nFind ways to cope with those stresses. There are many ways to handle stress in a positive way such as:\n- Distraction (moving attention away from the stress for a little while)\n- Taking a walk,\n- Listening to music\n- Doing something enjoyable\nRelaxation and Mindfulness\nConsciously relaxing muscles and focusing on breathing deeply. Calming the mind by trying to let go of thoughts and focusing on the moment.\nYoga practice-focusing on body postures and breathing.\nTry to deal with the problem that is causing the stress. This can mean facing the stress and making a plan to deal with it. If school work is a stress, this could mean getting tutoring, help to organize work or checking for learning disabilities. If the problem is conflict, listen carefully to your child or teen’s point of view. Your can then help your child develop a plan to resolve it. You can also help your child to communicate assertively. If the conflict is with you, set the example for listening and positive communication, and try to come up with a solution that works for everyone. If you’re having trouble with family conflict, family therapy may help.\nAs a parent, it’s hard to find time for yourself when you are busy looking after your children. But it’s also much harder to meet your child’s mental health needs, if your own mental or physical health needs are not met.\nTake care of yourself by:\n- Asking family and friends for help and support. It’s much easier to cope if you have support from others. Friends and family might be able to give you a break by helping with child care, errands or household tasks. Or they could just be there for you, listening when you need to talk.\n- Getting professional help. Speak with your family doctor, or see a mental health professional if you are having your own troubles with mood, anxiety, depression, or troubles coping.\n- Connecting with self-help and peer support groups. Support groups can help you learn about other community resources, as well as giving practical advice and support that professionals cannot provide.\nPlease see the ‘Support and advocacy’ section below for more information.\n- Anywhere in Canada: Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) (www.cmha.ca)\n- In British Columbia: BC FORCE (www.forcesociety.com)\n- In Ontario: Parents for Children’s Mental Health (www.pcmh.ca)\n- In Ottawa: PLEO, the Parents’ Lifeline of Eastern Ontario (www.pleo.on.ca)\nMindMasters and Mini-MindMasters, for children 4-10 years: Developed by the Child and Youth Health Network for Eastern Ontario, and tested at CHEO.

Psychologists study the human brain, cognitive functions, emotional and social behaviors through various techniques and interventions.\nIn the U.S.A., a doctoral degree such as the Ph.D., Psy.D., and Ed.D. earned from an APA-accredited program may be translate into eligibility to sit for the Examination for Professional Practice of Psychology examinations in one’s state.\nYou are searching for a terminal degree program in the field of psychology and see you have options including the PsyD (Doctor of Psychology), the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Psychology, and the Education Specialist degree.[iii] While academically similar, there are differences between these degrees – somewhat like different roads, that prospective doctoral students should clarify before embarking on a doctorate in psychology program.\nThe Doctor of Psychology, abbreviated ‘PsyD, Psy D, or Psy.D. is an applied, clinically-focused doctorate degree somewhat like an MD in medicine. Earning a PsyD degree typically prepares a graduate to fulfill the educational requirements for state licensure; licensure is a requirement for use of the title “psychologist” in most states.[iv]\nThe PhD in Psychology is a research doctoral degree in psychology. Earning a PhD Psychology typically prepares graduates to fulfill the educational requirements for state licensure. That said, those who pursue their PhD in psychology may favor academic research or teaching at the university level rather than clinical practice.\n|Clinical Psychology Ph.D.\n|Wisconsin School Of Professional Psychology\n|Doctor of Business Administration - Industrial Organizational Psychology\n|Ph.D. in General Psychology: Cognition and Instruction (Qualitative Research)\n|Grand Canyon University\nIn terms of potentially counseling clients and practicing in a clinical setting, both the Psy D and the PhD Psychology degrees have equal status and function about the same. Ultimately, your decision may boil down to whether you prefer to learn in a hands-on clinical setting or to conduct research.\nThe admission requirements for each psychology school and doctor of psychology program may differ. Some schools may choose candidates that they feel ‘fit’ their schools’ mission in terms of clinical and research experiences. You are always advised to check with the requirements of the specific schools on your list. Potential admission requirements may include:\nDID YOU KNOW?\n5,277 Research Doctorates and 1,444 Professional Doctorates in Psychology were awarded in 2014?[ii]\nHow long does it take to earn a Doctorate in Psychology?

If you are wondering how to manage your time – study, research, career, family – an online PsyD might be perfect for you!. There are many online PsyD programs available but it is worth a search to find out if these programs meet your needs.\nHow has earning a Psy.D. enhanced your career?\nWith my Psy.D. degree, I see patients, and have worked for groups, at treatment facilities, and now see them on my own. I teach online courses to up and coming masters and doctoral students in psychology. I review case files and write reports or testify on cases about patients' mental health history and issues. I also write for a number of publications, which brings me great joy in my ability to share useful information to help a broader audience.\nVery. Especially if you are aiming for an American Board of Professional Psychology. Why? To attain board certification by the ABPP one of the requirements is that an individual has earned “A doctoral degree from a program in professional psychology which at the time the degree was granted was accredited by the APA, CPA, or was listed in the publication Doctoral Psychology Programs Meeting Designation Criteria[vi].”\nWho is the APA? The APA Commission on Accreditation (APA-CoA) is recognized by both the secretary of the U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, as the national accrediting authority for professional education and training in psychology.\nWhat is the Scope of APA Accreditation?

{"question":"How do cruise ships currently impact air quality in port cities, and what future regulations or solutions are being developed to address these environmental concerns?","answer":"Cruise ships currently cause significant air quality issues in port cities, emitting high levels of fine particles and sulphur dioxide that can be harmful to human health. For instance, residents near Station Pier have complained about odors from berthing ships. In response to similar issues, Sydney Harbor now mandates low sulphur fuel (0.1% or less) for cruise ships. Looking ahead, the International Maritime Organisation has committed to reducing sulphur emissions from 3.5% to 0.5% by 2020. As for solutions, cruise lines are increasingly adopting technologies like exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) to reduce sulfur oxide and nitrogen levels. Some companies are also transitioning to cleaner alternatives like Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), while others like Hurtigruten are working toward zero-emissions ships by 2030. Additionally, hybrid ships using battery power and biofuels are being developed, with companies like Havila Voyages launching vessels that can travel for up to four hours without emissions.","context":["Air Pollution at Station Pier\nThe cruise ship season extends into May.

The kiosk is now home base for the Waterfront Welcomers who help cruise ship passengers on their way to enjoy their time in Melbourne.\nNear the restored Stothert and Pitt crane, as state of the art in 1950 as the cranes at Webb Dock are in 2017, there is an air quality monitoring station.\nPeople living nearby have been complaining for some time about odours from ships berthing at Station Pier. Many cruise ships emit high levels of fine particles and sulphur dioxide, both of which can be harmful to human health and detrimental to local air quality.\nIn response to ongoing complaints, air quality testing was undertaken for the 12 months between January 2016 and January 2017 by the Port of Melbourne Corporation (now Victorian Ports Corporation) in co-operation with the EPA. The data gathered from the monitoring stations has been complemented by air quality diaries kept by people experiencing the problem. The data is being analysed before further steps are taken.\nSimilar problems were experienced by residents in Sydney. Following a high profile campaign, legislation was passed which introduced regulations to limit the sulphur content of fuel of ships calling at Sydney Harbour. Since 1 July 2016, the use of low sulphur fuel (0.1% or less) by cruise ships while in Sydney Harbour has been mandated. Reducing sulphur is the key means of reducing both fine particle and sulfur dioxide pollution.\nSeveral countries operate Emissions Control Areas including the Baltic Sea area, the North Sea area, and designated coastal areas of the United States and Canada.\nIn response to pressure on this issue, the International Maritime Organisation has recently committed to new requirements which will see sulphur emissions fall from the current maximum of 3.5 percent of fuel content to 0.5 percent by 2020.\nThis image of the U.S. battleships of the Great White Fleet which visited Melbourne in 1908 on their round the world mission is a reminder of just how severe the pollution from coal fired ships was. The ships were painted white as you can see, and decorated with gilded scrollwork with a red, white, and blue banner on their bows. How did they keep them so gleaming?\nWill special requirements be put in place for ships berthing at Port Melbourne or will we have to wait for the IMO regulations to take effect in 2020?\nBeacon Cove Neighbourhood Association Air Quality Information for residents\nDr David Stephens The Great White Fleet’s 1908 Visit To Australia","Traveling on a cruise ship sounds like a great idea for a vacation. However, what seems like an exciting journey has a massive effect on our environment.\nCruise ships are some of the largest ships in the world, and studies have shown that one cruise ship releases a carbon footprint greater than 12000 cars3. Cruise ships are also a major source of pollution in the marine environment. But just how bad are they?\nRead on as we examine the environmental impacts of cruise ships on our environment.\nThe cruise industry comprises businesses in the travel and tourism sector that facilitate voyages on large passenger ships. It involves cruise lines, cruise operators, and companies manufacturing cruise ships. The cruise industry also covers businesses that specialize in cruise entertainment.\nA cruise line is a company that operates cruise ships and sells cruises to customers. This is distinct from passenger ships and passenger lines that link destinations. Cruise lines offer round trips primarily focusing on pleasure, while passenger ships focus on travel from one location to another.\nCruise lines provide various cruise packages, including accommodation, food, and entertainment. Some of the biggest cruise companies include Carnival Corporation (including brands like Princess Cruise lines, Costa Cruises, Holland America Line, etc.), Royal Caribbean International, MSC Cruises, and Disney Cruise lines.\nOver the years, the cruise industry has grown, generating billions of dollars in revenue. However, the sector dipped during the global COVID-19 pandemic affecting tourism and the international shipping industry.\nIn 2022, the global cruise ship industry market was $7.67 billion and is expected to be worth $15.1 billion by 20284.\nMillions of passengers every year board cruise liners all over the world. Although passenger numbers took a dip during the global pandemic, cruise lovers have come back on board.\nHowever, the activities of the cruise industry have raised eyebrows among travelers and tourists. Many eco-conscious travelers wonder just how much cruise liners impact the environment.\nEnvironmental groups have described cruise ships as “floating cities'' that contribute massively to pollution. Several cruise ships have been caught dumping trash, sewage, and fuel into the ocean.\nHere are some major environmental impacts of cruise ships:\nCruise ships contribute significantly to the pollution of our environment. This includes air pollution, water pollution, sewage pollution, solid waste pollution, etc.\nFindings reveal that on a seven-day trip, passengers on an Antarctic cruise can release as much carbon emissions per traveler as the average European in an entire year. These greenhouse gas emissions, predominately a product of burning fuel to keep the cruise ships moving and powered, get into the atmosphere, reducing air quality. High levels of air pollution can also affect human health.\nCruise liners accommodate thousands of passengers and crew members.\nAccording to Friends of the Earth, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a cruise ship of 3000 passengers and crew members generates about 21,000 gallons of sewage daily, an amount large enough to fill ten backyard swimming pools annually.\nWhereas cruise liners typically treat sewage on board, in some cases, they may be allowed to discharge treated sewage into the ocean, provided they comply with the regulations and the discharge occurs at a safe distance from shore.\nFurthermore, older ships may be equipped with lesser processing capability, with the Friends of the Earth's latest cruise ship report card scoring popular liners no higher than a “C.”\nSewage pollution can lead to infectious diseases and illnesses through contaminated water and seafood. Marine wildlife can also suffocate due to excess nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage entering the ocean.\nAccording to research, a 3000-passenger ship can generate up to around 50 tons of solid waste in a week1.\nThese solid waste materials include plastic, paper, aluminum, and other debris. These solid waste materials can choke and kill marine wildlife if they enter the oceans.\nGenerally, throwing solid waste into the ocean is illegal. However, some ships have been caught dumping trash into the ocean. Also, some ships gather recyclable materials, while others burn non-recyclable materials causing air pollution.\nAs these materials burn, they release harmful emissions like carbon dioxide, lead, and mercury, polluting the atmosphere and affecting human health.\nMore cruise ships on the sea mean more trouble for the animals underwater. Noises from moving ships travel as far as the ocean floors and reverberate back onto the surface. These vibrations affect the entire ecosystem of marine animals.\nResearch reveals that noise disturbances from ships affect how animals like whales and dolphins communicate.\nFindings suggest that cruise ship noises could affect the already endangered killer whales found near shipping lanes. Even a slight increase in sounds can make echolocation difficult for whales2.\nApart from a disruption in communication, noise pollution can also lead to a change in diving patterns, migrations, and panic responses.\nCruise ships also release chemicals from sewage and other channels, causing pollution. Toxic chemicals from daily operations, industrial products, and other substances find their way into the oceans, posing a threat to marine creatures.\nOils can also contribute to pollution. Cruise ships burn heavy fuel oils which contain harmful chemicals and substances like sulfur and heavy metals, which can leak into the oceans.\nIf a cruise ship has a faulty system or improper repair work, oils can leak from these areas and penetrate the oceans, causing pollution and threatening marine life.\nBallast water is essential for the safe operation of cruise liners. Ballast water helps to keep the ship floating in an upright and safe condition. It also gives the ship some stability as it maneuvers the oceans. However, while ballast water is crucial, it can also harm the environment.\nBallast water contains organisms like bacteria, eggs, microbes, small invertebrates, and other species.\nAs ships load and unload ballast water, these organisms get released into the local environment. The problem is that they can travel in the ship’s ballast to ecosystems where they might prove harmful. Under the right conditions, these organisms can flourish and threaten resident populations.\nOne example is the Zebra Mussels Invasion in the Great Lakes in Canada. These species are native to the Black and Caspian Seas in Europe but arrived in Canada due to a ship ballast water discharge. They proliferated, outnumbering local species like the native mussels. Feeding on the same food source, these introduced species disrupted the local food chain and hindered the growth and development of these local species.\nThe transfer of invasive species is one of the biggest threats to the ecological well-being of the planet. This is because it causes an imbalance in the coastal ecosystems.\nWater from showers, sinks, laundry, cleaning utensils, etc., are all classified under grey water. Cruise ships release large amounts of grey water from regular activities like bathing and laundry.\nSadly, the accumulation of grey water contains harsh chemicals, metals, and other particles that can pollute the oceans. Through grey water, detergents, pharmaceuticals, microbeads, oils, etc., can find their way into the sea. Not only does this cause pollution, but the waste produced can also poison marine life.\nMoreover, food waste from passengers, boats, and shipyard staff may also enter the ocean. Food waste contains chemicals unsuitable for the oceanic ecosystem and marine animals.\nIn 2018, a Holland America ship reportedly discharged 25,000 gallons of greywater into Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska and was hit with a fine of $17,000.\nCruise ships can be a significant threat to Coral reefs. Tourist vessels and anchoring of cruise ships on areas of coral reefs around the world have led to several destructive incidents.\nIn 2017, a British-owned cruise ship crashed into a coral reef, damaging approximately 13,500 square meters of coral reef in Indonesia.\nBesides pollution and damage to our ecosystem, these large cruise liners can also threaten aquatic life. These ships are responsible for injuring marine animals. Also, solid waste like glass, plastic, etc., ends up in the digestive systems of these marine animals, leading to their death.\nThe cruise industry negatively impacts our water, air, coastal communities, and fragile habitats. Although various environmental regulations exist for cruise lines worldwide, compliance is only sometimes achieved.\nFriends of the Earth, an environmental group, shared a Cruise Report Card, which took a controversial turn. The group gave each cruise line a grade from A-F based on these elements of sustainability:\nFriends of the Earth also goes ahead to provide more specific information about the environmental impact of some of the top cruise lines in the world:\nCarnival Corporation cruise line is one of the largest cruise companies with ten cruise lines.\nUnfortunately, Carnival Corporation is notorious for violating environmental regulations.\nAccording to Friends of the Earth, this cruise line was hit with a fine of $40 million for illegal waste disposal and put on federal criminal probation.\nCarnival Corporation was charged with dumping food and plastic waste in Bahamian Waters, illegally dumpling gallons of wastewater in the Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska, and releasing over 11,000 gallons of food waste and 500,000 gallons of sewage illegally, amongst other charges.\nRoyal Caribbean is also one of the world's largest cruise companies and is notorious for paying criminal fines.\nFindings from FOE state that this cruise company was forced to pay a fine of $18 million for 21 federal colonies in 1999. This was due to the dumping of waste oil and chemical waters in coastal waters.\nAlthough this cruise company has cruise ships with scrubbers that help reduce air pollution and get around harmful greenhouse gas emissions, it is only a case of converting air pollution into water pollution.\nDisney is one of the few cruise companies open about their environmental impact. The cruise line efficiently utilizes fuel with a 0.1% sulfur content, ultimately reducing its carbon footprint.\nUnfortunately, Disney isn't perfect, either. The cruise company plans to work on a massive cruise ship port at Lighthouse Point in the Bahamas. Community groups within the region oppose this port as it will cause harm to their marine ecosystems.\nThe Bahamian Island of Eleuthera has over 200 bird species, four endemic plant species, beautiful clear blue water, lemon sharks, sea turtles, etc. The introduction of Lighthouse Point could bring many tourists and travelers, ultimately adding water, air, and noise pollution to this unscathed region.\nMSC Cruises is part of the Hydrogen Council - a global initiative working toward the use of hydrogen fuel. The company has also launched the MSC World Europa ship, which LNG will power. The ship sails with less harmful emissions like carbon dioxide, sulfur oxide, etc.\nHowever, MSC Cruises still has much to do to reduce its environmental footprint.\nWith 19 ships in its fleet, 15 use scrubbers that turn air pollution into water pollution, only 12 have advanced sewage treatment systems installed, six travel to ports with shoreside power, and only 8 of their ships have shoreside plug-in capability.\nThe cruise industry has had a negative environmental impact for many decades, putting human health, coastal communities, and our environment at risk.\nToday, the cruise industry is making environmental efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and create a positive environmental change.\nThese include using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ships, exhaust gas cleaning systems, and other new technologies. Here are some ways the cruise industry is going green:\nCruise ships release large amounts of harmful gas emissions, contributing significantly to air pollution and global warming.\nAir pollutants like nitrogen oxide and sulfur from cruise ships pollute the air and contribute to respiratory problems. To reduce air pollution and improve air quality, cruise lines have turned to exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS).\nManufacturers designed the EGCS to reduce sulfur oxide and nitrogen levels. They remove these harmful gases from the ship's engine exhaust.\nAlso, The International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2020 established a regulation allowing only a sulfur content of only 0.5% in marine fuel to ships worldwide.\nCruise lines can meet this requirement by going for cleaner fuel alternatives like Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) or using EGCS (scrubbers).\nHowever, some environmental groups have raised concerns about scrubbers that discharge wastewater back into the sea, turning air pollution into water pollution.\nA large cruise ship can generate tons of waste, polluting our environment. Cruise liners have begun to reduce or ban the use of single-use plastics to reduce plastic waste.\nMost ships have recycling bins that store solid waste materials like plastic, glass, and cardboard until they get to the next port and offload.\nAs we already know, the cruise industry has had major negative environmental and human health impacts. But it's not all doomsday for the cruise world.\nMany shipping lines are now taking more significant steps toward more sustainable cruising. Some cruise operators now build ships that run on LNG. Also, some cruise shipping lines invest in greener fuels like hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels.\nWhile the cruise travel industry has a long way to go, some cruise lines are working hard to make cruise travel significantly sustainable. Here are some eco-friendly cruise shipping lines leading the pack:\nHurtigruten is a Norwegian travel company that incorporates sustainability at its core. The company aims to have the world's first zero-emissions cruise ship by 2030. The company has since ditched unsustainable fuel sources for greener alternatives like biofuels and marine gas oil.\nHurtigruten launched the world's first hybrid battery electric-powered cruise ship in 2019 and aims to convert the seven ships of the Norwegian Coastal Express fleet to hybrid battery power or biofuels (which partly comes from dead fish).\nThe company also excels in single-use plastic reduction, as it has been scrapped from its operations altogether. They select their suppliers based on the merits of their sustainability.\nOn board, the company only serves food locally and sustainably sourced. In addition, crew members have uniforms made from recycled fishing nets.\nPonant is a French cruise shipping line that carbon offsets 100% of all its emissions. The 245-passenger Le Commandant Charcot, Ponant’s hybrid expedition ship, is one of the most eco-friendly ships, running on LNG and electric battery power.\nThe company has also stopped the use of single-use plastics. They take sustainable cruise tourism seriously and carefully plan all itineraries with local communities.\nPonant is also the first cruise company to get a Green Marine certification which they award to companies that commit to minimizing their environmental impact.\nHavila Voyages, a Norwegian cruise ship, has launched two of four of its planned hybrid ships in 2022, which use some of the biggest batteries combined with LNG fuel.\nWith this, the ships can travel for up to four hours on the sea without emissions or noise before recharging at the next port cities.\nThe company also recharges its batteries sustainably using clean hydropower energy from local grids. They also aim to run emission-free with vessels designed to switch entirely to hydrogen power as technology improves.\nEver thought of a cruise that operates on wind power? Star Clippers, a Monaco-based company, takes sustainability to a unique level with tall cruise ships that usually operate on wind power. At other times, their ships use low-sulfur gas oil.\nStar Clippers is also one of the first cruise lines with a Pura Vida Pledge certification approved by the Costa Rican Tourism Board.\nA large part of reducing the cruise industry's environmental impact starts with cruise lines keeping specific environmental standards. However, you can do your part as you vacation on the high seas by making small changes.\nHere are some ways you can reduce your environmental impact while on a cruise:\nRelated: 15 Best Tips For Eco-Friendly Travel & Sustainable Adventures.\nLarge amounts of harmful gas emissions and environmental pollution can be attributed to cruise ships. This is not to mention the waste produced by passengers and the cruise industry. All these activities from the cruise industry hurt our environment.\nMany cruise lines claim to be taking steps towards more sustainable travel. However, not many of these cruise shipping lines are taking steps towards effecting any significant change.\nA few companies are leading the way to eco-friendly cruising thanks to technological advancements.\nButt, Nickie.

{"question":"Hey there! 👋 Are water governance strategies different for river basins vs agricultural districts in terms of planning and management?","answer":"Yes, water governance strategies differ significantly between river basins and agricultural districts. River basins, like the Cagayan River Basin, use a comprehensive water security index (WSI) that evaluates multiple dimensions including domestic water, economic water, environmental water, water-related disaster, and water governance. In contrast, agricultural water districts, such as California's Westlands Water District (the nation's largest), focus primarily on water supply planning for irrigation and competing with environmental uses and population demands. River basins take a more holistic approach considering multiple stakeholders and uses, while agricultural districts prioritize irrigation and crop production needs.","context":["Social Research Category\nProponent: Ma. Teressa S. Alvarez, Exequiel M. Perez, Elmer A. Rosete\nGoal 6 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the United Nations 2030 Agenda and SDGs is a national call for Clean Water and Sanitation. For society's demographic, social, and economic development, reliable and outstanding water quality and long-term water supply services are deemed essential. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the City of Ilagan Water District in terms of water supply and wastewater management. The performance evaluation was based on the following domains - (a) sustainability of water supply; (b) consumer satisfaction; and (c) waste management practices; including compliance of the local government unit and service units by water security and management. The International Water Association's assessment framework and indicators employed (IWA). The method used to collect information and/or data for this study, key informant interviews, and field surveys were conducted, with a total of 300 respondents drawn from 10 active barangays using stratified random sampling. The results showed that in terms of water sustainability for the next 60-year considering the future population and based on the present demand as of 2019, water demand will skyrocket with an equivalent percent increase of 12%, 36%, and 72% for 2030, 2050, and 2080 respectively. The result analysis does not include the agricultural demands or groundwater withdrawal for agricultural purposes and individual domestic wells within the City of Ilagan. Overall acceptability on water quality was acceptable with a rating of 43% wherein 55%, 54%, 43% and 31% acceptability ratings were attributed to taste, odor, color, and pressure, respectively. On the issue of sustainability, it is highly recommended to develop alternative water resources that could increase water distribution efficiency, eliminate or lessen illegal tapping/ connection, increase coverage area, and maintain water quality valuation as a sustainable approach to sufficiently and dependably supply water demand for future generations.\nTechnical Research Category\n1. Visible-light Photodegration of Methylene blue by a layer-by-layer Assembled Ti02/ChlorophyllPoly (acrylic acid) Composite Film\nProponent: Genes P. Maylem, Jose B. Abucay Jr.\nTitanium dioxide/chlorophyll/poly(acrylic acid) (TCP) composite films were fabricated for a potential application in the visible light photodegradation of organic pollutants in water. TiO₂/chlorophyll powders were prepared using various concentrations (32, 67, and 100% v/v) of chlorophyll extracted from mahogany tree (Swietenia sp.) leaves. The TCP catalysts were deposited on glass substrates by a simple layer-by-layer deposition with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). The different TCP films containing 33, 67, and 100% v/v were denoted as TCP 33, TCP 67, and TCP 100, respectively. The FESEM images revealed the spherical orphology of TiO₂ with particle sizes below 200 nm. As the chlorophyll concentration increased, the distinct morphology became less apparent, and cluster formation accompanied by a decrease in surface roughness was observed. Visible light-induced photodegradation of methylene blue as the model pollutant showed a highest degradation efficiency of 24% after exposure to visible light for 2 h. This result was observed from TCP 33. Thus, the addition of chlorophyll to TiO₂ realized visible light sensitivity. Overall, the results suggest that the composite film is ideal for solar light-driven photodegradation of organic contaminants in water.\n2. Biofilter Potential of Indigenous Agricultural Waste Materials for the Removal of Heavy Metals in Water\nProponent: Genes P. Maylem, Goldyn Anne C. Aquino, James Kennard S. Jacob, Ryan C. Dumasig ,Rolando D. Pedro, Sarah B. Aquino\nBioremediation using oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) spent offers a cost-effective and environment-friendly approach to water treatment. However, this needs further study for its application in Isabela province due to the differences in the composition of mushrooms spent in the Philippines compared to those countries. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the quality of water in the Magat dam reservoir, and develop a prototype water treatment system integrated with oyster mushroom spent mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) for the treatment of heavy metals cadmium (Cd) and Arsenic (As) in water. Two stations at the Magat dam reservoir were identified for water sampling for the analysis of heavy metals. Then, a water treatment system incorporated with oyster mushroom spent was developed. Separate biofilter experiments for Cd and As were performed at various flow rates (1 mL/min, 5 mL/min, and 10 mL/min) and the percent removal was calculated. All water samples were analyzed using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAAS). Heavy metals were detected from the Magat dam reservoir water samples (Cd- 0.000046 ppm, As- 0.014 ppm, Pb- 0.0016 ppm) and all were below permissible levels based on the Philippine National Standards. Water treatment system with mushroom spent has the highest efficiency at the slowest flow rate of 1 mL/min (i.e, 97% for Cd and 95% for As). However, of the two heavy metals, As generally had the greater percent removal compared to Cd even at faster flow rates, suggesting that the filter used had a greater affinity towards Cd than As. The fabricated water treatment system based on oyster mushroom spent is effective for the removal of Cd and As in contaminated water. These findings can be used as a basis for a sustainable solution to treating heavy metals from industrial waste and simultaneously solving the waste issue in mushroom farms.\n3. Impact Assessment of Future Water Demand and Supply for Climate Change and Socio-Economic Scenarios using WEAP Model of the Magat River Basin\nProponent: Orlando F. Balderama, Lanie A. Alejo, Jeoffrey Lloyd R. Bareng, Elmer A. Rosete, Catherine A. Bartolome, Arlen S. Alejandro, Carlo C. Ablan\nWater is a vital resource in the river basin, and management of this resource is essential. This study aims to assess the impacts of the likely future water demand and supply for climate change and socio-economic scenarios using WEAP model of the Magat River Basin (MRB). The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) is a user-friendly tool that takes an integrated approach to water resources planning and policy analysis. The model is based on the water balance concept to reproduce hydrological processes. The model simulation demonstrated that WEAP can predict streamflow with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.64 and coefficient of Determination R² of 0.74 for the calibration period and NSE = 0.77 and R² = 0.83 for the validation period. The impact of high conveyance efficiency (CE) and moderate Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) will give zero unmet water demand across population growth in 2025, 2030, 2050, and 2080. Santiago City as additional domestic water users will significantly increase water demand by as much as 473.61 percent, 511.00 percent, 660.56 percent, and 884.91 percent in 2025, 2030, 2050, and 2080, respectively. However, with the combination of high CE and moderate AWD interventions, the significant increase in water demand will result to zero unmet water demand for both domestic and agricultural surface water. For the climate change scenario, the results showed an increase in the future unmet water demand during the dry years and wet years of the mid and late 21st century for both RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios. These findings indicate that climate is expected to significantly affect the MRB where agriculture is vital for the local economy and small farmers. The projected increase in population growth, the impact of climate change, and the increase in water users will only worsen the current levels of unmet water demands. This study recommends the implementation of high CE and moderate AWD interventions as soon as possible. Improvement in water accessibility due to these interventions is enough to meet the water demands across all scenarios tested in this study.\nProponent: Orlando F. Balderama, Lanie A.

Raymundo, Jasmine Pasion\nWater and other natural resources within the Cagayan River Basin (CRB) are recognized as critical resources that must be appropriately managed and maintained to provide greater benefits to communities, farmers, and other water users in the region and surrounding areas. In order to achieve water security in the region, water assessment and resource planning need to be strengthened and integrated. The water security index (WSI) for CRB and MSB was developed using water security dimensions. These dimensions define the overall WSI of the basin. It considers a variety of driving forces that impact water security, including domestic water, economic water, environmental water, water-related disaster, and water governance. Each dimension was evaluated in relation to specified factors using one or more indicators. The values were estimated for each indicator using several standardized variables on a scale of 1 to 5. Based on the computed overall WSI, results revealed that CRB has a descriptive value of \"good\", while MSB has \"very good\". This means that the CRB has a structure and natural configuration that facilitate water security. It is well-positioned in most aspects of water security. Some aspects of water security, however, remain a source of concern. While its security against certain dimensions may not be as high as others, its overall situation is still remarkably good. Several policy recommendations and management interventions for water resources management were identified and specific methods and solutions to address the identified challenges and gaps in various water security dimensions.\nProponent: Orlando F.

The hydrodynamic behavior in the reservoir level was accurately reproduced using Telemac 2D. This model was calibrated and validated using data during typhoons Rolly and Ulysses (November 2020) and Severe Tropical Storm Florita (August 2022). The simulated results showed that the applied model could precisely reproduce outflow conditions. The modelling results can be used to proactively assess the hydrodynamic behavior of the reservoir during extreme and low-flow events.

Since urban areas, such as Cauayan City, are the hub of economic development and activity, there is a tendency for people and businesses to converge, with that, a risk analysis was done to analyze hazards for urban water infrastructures within the city. With the aid of GIS Software and gathered data, maps were generated for flood hazards with 5, 25, and 100 yr. return period, Analysis of liquefaction and ground shaking as well as drought hazard of urban water infrastructures in the City. Risk maps were generated in this study wherein water infrastructures such as drainage and water utilities located at the 4 barangays namely Cabaruan, Alicaocao, Turayong and Labinab were classified as high risk in flooding. For liquefaction and ground shaking analysis most of the barangays were classified as low risk. Similarly, majority of the barangays were classified as moderately dry and near normal for drought hazard analysis.

Water use for agriculture will continue to be an important factor in water supply planning in Florida. The major constraints facing agricultural activity are the opportunity cost of land, scarcity of water resources, and high labour costs. By 2050, the global water demand of agriculture is estimated to increase by a further 19% due to irrigational needs. To incorporate the climatic diversity, climate layers were developed for the entire region on a 500 m x 500 m grid. The objective of the FSAID planning process is to identify potential future agricultural water demands to Agriculture water demand modeling has been addressed mainly by an economical perspective, namely, estimating the water's economical value [Howitt, 1995; Berger, 2001; Fisher et al., 2002; MedellínâAzuara et al., 2012]. The sufficient supply of clean water is essential to public health, ecosystem function, and economic growth. Countries like India, China and Australia, among others are battling the challenge of producing food for an ever-increasing population amid droughts and increasingly volatile climate conditions . Much of the water utilized by crops comes in the form of rain and imposes no net claim on water that could be put to other uses. That includes Californiaâs Westlands Water District, the nationâs largest agricultural water district. Agricultural operations can also negatively affect water quality. Rising demand for energy and for food will increase future demand for water supplies, presenting important challenges for the future. Various crop diseases also affect the demand for water because growth does not take place in diseased plants whereas they need regular supply of water. Box 31, Holetta, Ethiopia Birhanu Zemadim International Crops Research Institute for the Semi- Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), ICRISAT Bamako ABSTRACT The water demand and irrigation requirement of Holetta Catchment is not fully studied. 4. Agriculture Water Demand Model â Report for Cowichan Valley Regional District June 2013 11 Climate Information The agricultural water demand is calculated using climate, crop, irrigation system and soil information data. The relatively high cost of treating and delivering water has led many world governments to subsidize water for agricultural and household use. Since 1962, demand for Oklahoma's water resources has increased due to the expansion of irrigation agriculture, population growth, and diversification of its economy. Accounting for 70% of all water extracted for human purposes, agriculture is by far the biggest water user worldwide. The preferred criteria â¦ Three options are available for simulating water use for agriculture: (1) user-specified demands, (2) demands â¦ Thus, admixture of type of agriculture and sources of irrigation directly affect the demand for water. Prior to the statutory requirements for FDACS to prepare projections, Floridaâs five Water Management Districts prepared estimates independently. Holetta Agricultural Research Center, P.O. During periods of water shortage, domestic use, industry, and the environment generally take precedence. The main cause of this mismatch on a world-scale is due to agricultural irrigation, which accounts for about 70% of freshwater withdrawal. But demand for industrial users and domestic use is now increasing more rapidly. Wilson Walker reports. Water, agriculture and climate change. Agriculture Water Demand Model â Report for Squamish-Lillooet Regional District April 2018 11 Climate Information The agricultural water demand is calculated using climate, crop, irrigation system and soil information data. This report reviews the main linkages between climate change, water and agriculture as a means to identifying and discussing adaptation strategies for better use and conservation of water resources. increasing water demand â will only heighten concerns about the reliability of future supplies for irrigated agriculture. Agriculture is the largest consumer of the worldâs freshwater resources, and more than one-quarter of the energy used globally is expended on food production and supply. 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The 2019 report is the sixth, annual update of FSAID water use estimates. The climate generally gets cooler and wetter Water resources are natural resources of water that are potentially useful. The first priority set out by the executive order is increasing dam storage and other water storage, long a demand of farmers and farm interests in the West in particular. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world, amounting to up to 70% of the total use , which makes the case for smart water management in order to guarantee water and food security to the worldâs population. While most of the worldâs water will continue to be used in agriculture, industrial and household demand is expected to rise at a faster rate as the agriculture sector becomes more water efficient. (1/8/18) The agriculture water demand study has been conducted on behalf of the Regional District of Central Kootenay to help identify the current and potential agricultural demand for water within the Erickson water service area boundary. CHAPTER 5 WATER DEMAND REQUIREMENTS A fundamental consideration for the sizing of any water system, or its component parts, is an estimate of the amount of water expected to be used by the customers on the system. Agriculture Water Demand Model â Report for the City of Kamloops May 2016 11 Climate Information The agricultural water demand is calculated using climate, crop, irrigation system and soil information data. Globally, there is an imbalance between water availability and water demand. Water Supply and Demand Agriculture plays an important part in Californiaâs economy and irrigation water is an essential factor in agricultureâs success. Can solar powered desalination meet water demand for agriculture? The inextricable linkages between these critical domains require a suitably integrated approach to ensuring water and food security, and sustainable agriculture and energy production worldwide. At the same time, waste water treatment plants discharge large volumes of water, hence diminishing the quality of the limited fresh water resources. Net water requirement (NWR) and the risk of changes in water demand volume of crops (e.g., wheat, barley, alfalfa, soybean, feed corn, forage, potato, and walnut orchards) are computed by entering 200 monthly time series of downscaled temperature and precipitation in future periods. Agriculture Water Demand Model â Report for Regional District of Central Kootenay June 2017 6 Background The Agriculture Water Demand Model (AWDM) was developed in the Okanagan Watershed. 2004). Quality of irrigation water used in crops, agricultural practices, and soil preparation methods also affect demand for water. However, California faces serious water supply issues, in which agricultural uses must compete with environmental uses and the demands of a growing population. The development of agriculture in Malta is constrained by the natural and geographical characteristics of the islands. Demand for water increasing dramatically in all major use sectors The demand for water originates from four main sources, namely, agriculture, production of energy, industrial uses and human consumption. Agricultural; Industrial; Domestic; Total; Figure 1: Past and projected water demand in million cubic metres (MCM) for the years 1990, 2000 and 2025. The climate in the interior region is quite diverse. demand for fresh water for agricultural purposes as discussed below. In agriculture, water must be of suitable quality to irrigate crops or provide drinking water for livestock. Irrigation systems and field application methods for the cultivation of crops play an important role therein. Water and agriculture involve two key interrelated issues: Water quality is a measure of the suitability of water for a particular use based on selected physical, chemical, or biological characteristics. The AG Package uses pre-existing hydrologic simulation provided by MODFLOW and GSFLOW. Agriculture is by far the largest consumer of the Earthâs available freshwater: 70% of âblue waterâ withdrawals from watercourses and groundwater are for agricultural usage, three times more than 50 years ago. Inch by inch, a critical, gravity-fed canal system is collapsing in California's Central Valley. All living things require water to grow and reproduce. Uses of water include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities. Traditionally, the largest demand for water comes from agriculture, around 70%. Water demand is expected to increase over the next 30 years. April 20, 2019 - by Agriculture Post - Leave a Comment. Demand for biofuels and fiber drives the demand for agricultural products further and hence increases pressure on agricultural land & water. Agricultural Irrigation Demand project, or FSAID. Water for use in power generation is also an important source of demand. The climate generally gets cooler and wetter from south to north and as elevation increases. AGRICULTURAL WATER DEMAND Agricultureâs share of the GDP for Malta is about 2.5 percent. Modeling the demand for fresh water All crops require water to grow. The Agricultural Water Use (AG) Package was developed for simulating demand-driven and supply-constrained agricultural water use in MODFLOW and GSFLOW models. Climate change, water and agriculture: towards resilient systems / OECD Studies on Water, 2014. For example, the agricultural demand for water increased from 1,152 MCM in 1990 to 1,546 MCM 2011 and, consequently, supply from groundwater aquifers increased from 899 MCM in 1990 to 1,269 MCM in 2011. It is unlikely that natural supplies will be sufficient to meet that demand in some parts of the world. The bulk of non-domestic consumption relates to the water used for agriculture, occasionally delivered from integral water supply systems, and for industry and other commercial uses (shops, offices, schools, hospitals, etc.)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b6585c7-a137-4345-a901-be8103673b1f>","<urn:uuid:424ef85d-edf2-49d6-908f-af26868544d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Yellowstone's geysers compare to Nevada's historic Beowawe Geysers in terms of activity and current status?","answer":"Yellowstone remains highly active with spectacular geothermal features like Great Fountain Geyser shooting water up to 150 feet high and numerous other active geysers and hot springs. In contrast, the Beowawe Geysers in Nevada, which was once the second most active geyser basin in North America after Yellowstone, has become inactive. While steam still rises from vents in Beowawe, the geysers stopped being active in the 1970s after energy companies began drilling wells for geothermal power generation.","context":["Monday, February 05, 2007\nNevada's Lost Natural Wonders\nOver the years, Nevada has experienced the loss of natural landmarks, scenic wonders, and native species of plants and animals. In some cases, the damage was on purpose but in others it was the unintended result of another action.\nThe Nevada Natural Heritage Program estimates that nearly two-dozen varieties of fish, amphibians, birds and mammals that once existed in the state are now extinct.\nYet despite these losses, it is fortunate that Nevada is so relatively undeveloped because that has helped keep some of its more fragile natural sites and environmentally sensitive native species in fairly good shape.\nThe following are some of Nevada’s most regrettable lost natural treasures and missed opportunities:\n1. Ironically, one of Nevada’s most abused places has still managed to remain among its most scenic and beautiful spots. Lake Tahoe is a spectacular destination despite what might best be described as decades of exploitation in the 19th century.\nStarting in the 1860s, Lake Tahoe’s magnificent forests were chopped down to provide fuel for Virginia City’s mills and timber to shore up its underground silver mines. By the late 19th century, most of Tahoe’s slopes were nearly completely stripped of trees.\nStill, at the turn of the century there were proposals to create some type of national preserve at Lake Tahoe. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, Lake Tahoe was on the short list for becoming a national park.\nHowever, Horace Albright, one of the founders of the park service, noted in his memoirs that after studying the area, “we declined to consider Lake Tahoe . . . and many other beautiful areas because they did not measure up to what we regarded as national park standards or had too much commercial development or too many innholdings, or because the cost was prohibitive considering what Congress would give us.”\nThus ended the dream of Lake Tahoe National Park.\n2. Another of Nevada’s lost natural treasures was the ancient bristlecone pine tree that has become known as “Prometheus.”\nIn 1964, a young geographer, Donald R. Currey, a doctoral student at the University of North Carolina, was given permission by the U.S. Forest Service to study the Bristlecone pines growing in a grove at the base of Wheeler Peak in Eastern Nevada.\nIn particular, Currey was interested in studying the rings inside of these ancient trees, which had only been discovered a few years earlier. Researchers had identified Bristlecones in the White Mountains of California as being as old as 4,000 years.\nCurrey’s research specialty was Ice Age glaciers and he hoped that Bristlecone tree rings might provide some insights about the conditions in prehistoric times. One of the trees in the Wheeler Peak grove appeared to be extremely old and it was Currey’s desire to extract tree rings that could help him with his research.\nThe Forest Service gave Currey permission not only to take core samples from several of the oldest-looking Bristlecone trees, but also to cut down one of them to measure its age.\nBristlecone trees often grow in a twisted fashion. Also, it’s not uncommon for one section of the tree to die off even a couple thousand years before another part. This means it can be difficult to locate the oldest part of the tree in a core sample.\nThe tree that Currey chose to cut down in 1964—still living at the time—contained about 4,900 growth rings, making it the oldest tree in the world at the time of its demise.\n3. Until the late 1930s, Pyramid Lake had a twin—Winnemucca Lake. Located directly east of Pyramid Lake on the other side of the Lake Range, Winnemucca Lake was a long, narrow finger of water that at the end of the 19th century was as long as Pyramid but about half as wide.\nFilled with tule reeds, Winnemucca Lake was an important stop for migrating waterfowl. In 1936, it was designated the Winnemucca Lake National Wildlife Refuge because it served as a prime feeding area for white pelicans.\nHowever, Winnemucca Lake was a “terminal” water body, meaning that it sat in a closed basin and did not empty into some other body of water or river. Its main source of water was the Truckee River, which flowed into both Pyramid and Winnemucca lakes via a natural slough at the south end of both bodies of water.\nFollowing construction of Derby Dam on the Truckee River in 1905, water that once flowed into Winnemucca Lake was diverted for irrigation. Within a couple of decades, Winnemucca Lake, which was once as deep as 87 feet, completely dried up. In 1962, the lake lost its national refuge status.\nToday, it is little more than a dry, alkali lake bed.\n4. In 1958, the Nevada State Park Commission developed a list of ten future state park sites. Included was the Beowawe Geysers, an extremely active geothermal field located about 45 miles west of Elko.\nThe Beowawe Geysers had long been recognized as one of Nevada’s natural wonders. A 1930s study noted that several of its geysers regularly erupted to heights of several feet and one to more than 12 feet.\nUntil the 1970s, the Beowawe field was the second most active geyser basin in North America (after Yellowstone).\nHowever, starting in the late 1950s, energy companies began drilling wells at Beowawe to develop the site as a geothermal power source. By the 1970s, the Beowawe Geysers had ceased to be active as the hot underground water was being diverted for power generation.\nToday, the second largest and most active geyser field in the country is quiet. Steam still rises from vents and cracks in the ground but the geysers are no longer active.","Land on Fire\nYellowstone’s spectacular geothermal fireworks draw visitors from all over the world. Here’s where and when to see—and photograph—geysers blowing, hot springs bubbling, and the earth itself steaming beneath your feet.\nImages and tips by Jeff Vanuga\nTake care near this vibrant feature: The 42-foot-deep pool’s violent boiling can toss water 10 feet high.\nLocation: Upper Geyser Basin\nSee it: Stroll the boardwalk from Old Faithful to the Castle Group area.\nWhen to go: Summer, when higher temps promote bacterial growth that deepens the pool’s blue hue\nPro tip: Midday is usually the time to put away your camera for landscape photography, but this is the exception. Crested Pool is best when the sun is high and light filters deep into the water, creating this stunning luminescence.\nShot details: Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera, 24-105mm lens at 28mm, ISO 100, f/16, 1/100 second\nWest Thumb Geyser Basin\nThis small basin is too often overlooked, leaving its scenic hot springs, mud pots, and lakeshore geysers to in-the-know visitors.\nLocation: West side of Yellowstone Lake\nSee it: Walk the 3/8-mile boardwalk.\nWhen to go: Sunrise in summer and sunset in winter for the best light.\nPro tip: When shooting people, include wider perspectives like this one that provide a sense of place for your trip.\nShot details: Nikon D4 camera, 70-200mm lens at 200mm, ISO 220, f/5.6, 1/500 second\nGeyser Photography 101\nUse a tripod. Even the steadiest hands tremble on long exposures, yielding blurry images. Add a cable release (or use your camera’s timer function) for even crisper shots.\nGet up early. Not only is the light gorgeous and the wildlife more active early in the day, but sunrise is your best bet for shooting in the busy geyser basins without catching dozens of other visitors in your shot.\nShield your lenses. Geyser spray contains silica and calcium carbonate, which can build up on lenses in a hard-to-clean film. Be vigilant about wiping lenses and/or keep your lens cap on until you’re ready to shoot.\nSentinel Meadows – Steep Cone Geyser\nThe hot springs in this meadow deposit minerals in a ring as they boil, forming distinctive sinter rims.\nLocation: Lower Geyser Basin\nSee it: Hike 1.5 miles from the Sentinel Meadows trailhead on Fountain Flat Drive.\nWhen to go: June through fall for snow-free trails\nPro tip: When using a wide-angle lens, include something interesting in the foreground (like these bacterial mats) to add depth and dimension to your shot.\nShot details: Canon 1Ds camera, 17-35mm lens at 22mm, ISO 125, f/16, 1/60 second\nGrand Prismatic Spring & Excelsior Geyser\nGrand Prismatic measures 370 feet across, making it the world’s largest hot spring. Despite its name, adjacent Excelsior is considered more like a hot spring, too, as it last erupted in 1901.\nLocation: Midway Geyser Basin\nSee it: On the .5-mile loop trail off Grand Loop Road or from the 5-mile (round-trip) Fairy Falls Trail\nWhen to go: Summer for the brightest colors\nPro tip: This stunning perspective required a flight in a fixed-wing aircraft. Most visitors won’t be flying over the basin, but you can still get a higher view from the Fairy Falls Trail south of Midway.\nShot details: Canon EOS 7D camera, 18-200mm lens at 75mm, ISO 400, f/8, 1/600 second\nWhen to Use a Tripod\nAnytime you are shooting in low light, a tripod can help ensure crisp images. A good rule of thumb is to use a tripod when your shutter speed is lower than 1/60 of a second or when the shutter speed is slower than the focal length. For optimal results from your digital equipment, set your camera at a low ISO and a mid-range aperture of f/8 or f/11. As you’ll have to carry your tripod into the backcountry, invest in the lightest tripod you can afford (and that can support your camera with its heaviest lens). Even point-and-shoot users can benefit from a small tripod, like the flexible GorillaPod models (joby.com).\nGreat Fountain Geyser\nGreat Fountain shoots water 150 feet in the air (and superbursts up to 220 feet have been recorded) from its 16-foot-wide crater, making it one of Yellowstone’s most dramatic geysers. Check visitor centers for predicted eruption times (every 9 to 16 hours).\nLocation: Firehole Lake Drive near Lower Geyser Basin\nSee it: Pick up the 2-mile, one-way drive just south of Lower Geyser Basin.\nWhen to go: Firehole Lake Drive is typically open April through October.\nPro tip: Vary how you approach a subject. Generally, front-lit subjects are boring and lack depth, so change your position to include side or back lighting. Here, the setting sun backlights the geyser for much better color, depth, and illumination.\nShot details: Nikon D4 camera, 24-70mm lens at 48mm, ISO 160, f/16 + .33 exposure compensation, 1/100 seconds\nThis 160°F hot spring may look placid, but beware: The pool was named after a Belgian visitor slipped into it in 1929, suffering fatal burns. The crust in the geyser basins can be dangerously thin, so always stick to the boardwalks.\nLocation: Upper Geyser Basin\nSee it: Head for the Grand Group, north of the Castle Group, on the boardwalk.\nWhen to go: Late spring through fall for the best weather\nPro tip: Experiment with angles. In this shot, the camera was tilted about 20 degrees to create a more interesting diagonal line leading into the image. High-angle sun also intensifies the color.\nShot details: Nikon D4 camera, 24-70mm lens at 52mm, ISO 100, f/16, 1/60 second\nThis river got its name from early trappers in the area, who mistook the steam rising from the valley’s abundant geothermal features for campfire smoke. A major tributary to the Madison, both rivers beckon anglers with plentiful—if challenging to catch—brook, rainbow, and brown trout. Vanuga created this shot in the early morning, when the valley’s steam plumes are most visible.\nLocation: Yellowstone NP, WY\nSee It: Midway Geyser Basin bridge, Grand Prismatic Spring\nWhen to go: May through early July and September through October are best for fly-fishing.\nPro tip: A slow shutter speed lends the river and thermal streams a smooth look and enhances the movement of the scene. Using a neutral density filter allows you slow the shutter enough to create silky effects even in bright light.\nTools: Canon 1Ds Mark III camera and tripod, 70-200mm L lens, ISO 100, f/29, 4 seconds\nWhite Dome Geyser at Night\nThis 30-foot plume usually erupts every 15 to 30 minutes, though the interval can be as long as two hours. The 12-foot-high cone is one of the oldest geothermal features in the park.\nLocation: Yellowstone NP, WY\nSee it: Firehole Lake Drive, Lower Geyser Basin\nWhen to go: Summer has warmer nights, but you’ll find more solitude in the busy geyser basins in September and October.\nPro tip: Night photos require long exposure times; use a tripod and your camera’s two-second timer delay to eliminate shake.\nTools: Canon 5D Mark II camera with tripod and cable release, 24-105mm lens, ISO 1250, f/4, 20 seconds"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:229049b4-120f-4e89-92fd-cf4582211b96>","<urn:uuid:912a390a-66d2-488c-be87-abf83c6acf68>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Biofeed's mosquito control technology work?","answer":"Biofeed's technology uses a Slow Fluid Release (SFR) system that employs a liquid mixture of lures and additives. It works by creating a special 'decoy' that releases smells to attract insects. The target insect is drawn to the decoy through smell, feeds off it, and is eliminated. This device hangs and releases the mixture over an extended period.","context":["The mosquito-borne Zika virus, according to new reports, is even more dangerous than first believed. While better information about prevention has helped slow the rate of infection in some areas, the health community is still urgently searching for a vaccine or drug treatment.\nThe “green” Israeli company Biofeed, specializing in the development and production of environmentally friendly pesticide solutions since 2005, believes the focus should be on eliminating the primary factor: the mosquito.\n“Biofeed’s groundbreaking approach can control any mosquito-borne disease,” CEO Nimrod Israely tells ISRAEL21c.\n“Everybody is looking for a vaccination against Zika virus but we should keep in mind that the same mosquito that transmits Zika is also transmitting other viruses as well. What we’re aiming to do is to control a vector, the mosquito itself.”\nBiofeed’s Slow Fluid Release (SFR) technology employs a liquid mixture of lures and additives to manipulate insect behavior by attract-and-kill or attract-and-feed methods.\n“We have for many years recognized the great potential in harnessing the world of insect smells for the benefit of humans. Evolution has given insects an elaborate sense of smell, which they utilize to find mates, food, egg-laying sites and more,” explains Israely, a world-renowned fruit-fly ecologist with a PhD from the Hebrew University.\n“The company has developed a liquid formula that ‘knows’ how to tie different kinds of smells to other materials, as the need arises. The result is a special ‘decoy’ that draws the target insect through smell. The decoy is slow-released from a hanging device over the course of a year. The insect is drawn to the decoy, feeds off it and is eliminated.”\nLong in use on farms for fruit-fly control, for example, the same technology could be tweaked to target the Zika-carrying Aedes Aegypti mosquito as well as flies, moths and other types of mosquitos, such as those transferring malaria.\n“We have the platform and knowhow; we need to do the development and testing. But it’s only a question of some time and money,” says Israely.\nSFR keeps an area pest-free for any required period of time up to365 days. The Biofeed team is now working on extending its effectiveness to three years.\nGrand Challenges winner\nBiofeed was recently chosen as a winner by the Grand Challenges (Israel) program for creating a technological solution to health challenges in developing countries.\nAs part of the program, Israel’schief scientist and Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ international development agency, MASHAV, pledged grant money to help Biofeed develop new methods of no-spray pesticide application for India.\n“This unique program reflects Israel’s determination to continue helping developing countries with relevant problems and constitutes the meeting point between diplomacy and Israeli technological innovation,” said MASHAV Director Gil Haskel.\nIsraely says 50 percent of India’s crop is lost to pests and that “many companies have tried to solve this problem with spraying and without spraying.”\nBy bringing the pest to the lethal substance and eliminating it without spraying, Biofeed’s chemical-free methodleaves the environment clean and safe, says Israely.\nThe technology has been fully tested and successfully implemented for years in Israel.\n“Israel is a perfect place to develop the Biofeed technology because we have all kinds of weather within one or two hours from where we’re located, we have 30 different crops that we run trials on, and farmers that are open-minded and ready to participate and try new things all the time,” he says.\n“We need to study in the lab but most importantly in the field, under field conditions,” he adds. “We also have great research and development here and this is very important.”\nChief Scientist Avi Hasson noted that much of the world’s population is suffering from lack of food, access to clean water and exposure to diseases.\nThe International Grand Challenges program and Israel’s Etgar Program, which supports development of tech solutions relevant to world health in developing nations,“bring to the fore Israel’s capabilities in technological innovation together with the well-known Israeli entrepreneurial spirit.”\n“We call on Israeli entrepreneurs to develop technologies that will improve the quality of life for billions around the world,” Hassonsaid.\nWhile the whole world of agriculture could benefit from Biofeed’s product, the company specifically chooses to help developing countries.\n“We target Africa, Asia, China, India and other developing countries because we see the future of agriculture over there. We want to bring something that is extremely easy to use; you don’t need tractors, you don’t need to remember to spray once a week, you don’t need to put yourself in danger with sprays, there’s no safety equipment.

Daily traders felt the heat, as volumes dropped. Everything was on expected lines, which limited the disruption. The HFT firms got impacted by this not much by the increase in STT directly, but from the fall in volume that limited the profit making opportunities for HFT as well as for most other firms in the market. In the below chart, the decrease in volume of Nifty Options for the first five days in June 2016 is plotted against the corresponding period of the previous month.\nData Source: nseindia.com\nWhat helps HFT make money\nVolumes and volatility contribute most to the success of trading strategies.\n- High volatility – Ensures there are opportunities for the traders\n- High volumes – Ensures that the opportunities are frequent and sizable\nProfitable Strategies during high volatility events\nThe prime objective here is to capture the bid ask spread during the low volatility events. People buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. Most traders have access to multiple exchanges or trade in multiple asset classes. Therefore, there is also a need to identify the leads and lags of different exchanges, which is embedded in most of the trading strategies.\nVolatility results in disparity at different destinations. Classical arbitrage is a speed game – if you are not the fastest or among them, then there is not point using such a strategy. Of course, speed comes with its associated cost. However, if there is volume, there is an opportunity to scale up.\nMachine learning/Directional strategy\nMany High Frequency Trading firms employ directional strategies and Machine Learning that take full use of the short-term price deviations. At least 1000 orders in a minute’s time can be placed. Traders do not take market risk or hold position for more than a millisecond. Tick based decisions are taken to execute profitable roundtrips trade.\nSentiment Analysis & Machine Readable News based strategies\nSentiment Analysis is gaining popularity with a lot of HFT firms, however, they are more applicable for the events that are certain. People look at the data and react to it. HFT reacts to news much faster than the manual ones. Twitter feeds are used to design trading strategies. The downside is that a lot of processing has to be done to create a quantitative sentiment index and design a strategy around it.\nDifferent kind of market events require relevant market strategies to remain profitable.

Trading with sentiment may also assist investors in determining directional biases and possibly even finding potential trends in markets.\nThis article will provide an explanation of what stock sentiment analysis is, examples of sentiment indicators and how this kind of analysis can be applied when analyzing stocks.\nWhat is Sentiment Analysis in the Stock Market?\nStock sentiment analysis can be used to determine investors’ opinions of a specific stock or asset. Sentiment may at times hint at future price action. This is also an example of how trading psychology can affect a market, assisting as a forecasting tool to determine possible future price changes in a particular asset.\nThere are various factors that influence stock sentiment, which include news (economic, political and industry related) and social media. These factors help influence stock sentiment as they impact stock market volatility, trading volume and company earnings.\nCan Sentiment Help Traders Anticipate Changes in Stock Prices?\nStock sentiment alone cannot always predict changes in share prices, but when combined with tools such as technical analysis, a better understanding can be gained to determine possible scenarios.\nIn periods of high volatility, stock prices can be much more susceptible to rapid changes. Certain informational and emotional events, such as negative comments on Twitter/social media and news, may cause fear in the market and push investors to overwhelmingly sell a specific share or company. The opposite can also be true when positive news is released, which may translate into optimism and perhaps boost the price of a given stock. That initial rush of fear or excitement, creating outsized moves in the market can quickly create overbought or oversold conditions.\nFor example, in February 2018 social media influencer Kylie Jenner tweeted the following:\nWith over 39 million followers, it’s not surprising that this tweet appeared to have a large impact on the share price of SNAP, the parent company of Snapchat. Within a day, the share price decreased by 7% and SNAP lost approximately $1.3 billion in market value.\nWhen technical factors reach extreme readings, traders may begin to see a reversal as more likely. The same can be perceived when sentiment is at extreme levels. For example, if 90% of retail clients are long a specific market or stock, this could potentially be seen as a bearish signal.\nUsing Sentiment Indicators to Trade Stocks\nSentiment indicators are typically used to determine whether a market is “bullish” or “bearish”. When investors predict that the price of a stock will increase, they may purchase the share and if enough investors do the same – sentiment could be deemed bullish. Likewise, when investors think the price of a share can decrease and act as such by selling the stock, then sentiment may be seen as bearish.\nThe most common sentiment indicators are:\n- Put/Call Ratio\n- Volatility Index\n- Client Sentiment\n1) Put/Call Ratio\nTo understand put/call ratios, one needs to understand what an option is. A stock option gives traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) on a specified future date. Options are often used by investors to hedge or reduce risk exposure of their portfolio.\nThere are two flavors of options, call options and put options. A call option is the option to buy a security at a pre-determined price (strike price) by a pre-determined date (expiration). Conversely, a put option is an option to sell at a pre-determined price by a pre-determined date. Investors that are bullish in a stock may look at buying call options to take advantage of the higher prices that they’re expecting; while an investor that’s bearish may look at buying a put option, so that when the stock price falls they can later sell the stock at the higher strike price of the option.\nThe put/call ratio refers to the volume of put options to call options on a given security. The result of the put/call ratio can be used to gauge the sentiment for a given stock. For example, if 9,000 traders have bought call options for Apple Inc and 1,000 traders have bought put options in the same trading session, then sentiment would be seen as bullish as a majority of investors appear to expect the price of Apple to increase.\nThe put/call ratio can be calculated for any security that has tradable options contracts.\n2) Volatility Index\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) represents market expectations of implied volatility – or anticipated price fluctuation – in the S&P 500 over a period of 30 days. Unlike the put/call ratio explained above, the VIX is forward-looking.\nThe VIX tends to increase when traders expect share prices to fall and decreases when traders expect prices to rise. In other words, there is often a negative correlation between the VIX and the US benchmark stock index.\nPut options tend to have a higher weighting than call options since investors frequently use options as a hedging tool to protect their portfolios against potential changes in stock prices. When the demand for put options increases, this can lead to an increase in the VIX, which is one of the reasons why many refer to it as the ‘fear gauge’.\n3) Client Sentiment\nClient sentiment data is derived from retail traders and indicates the percentage who are long or short an asset at a given time. This data can indicate when positioning is approaching extreme ends relative to the price of the asset in question. This is part of how sentiment analysis is referred to as a contrarian indicator.\nDailyFX provides client sentiment data which is based off live IG retail client trades for forex, commodities, cryptocurrencies and major stock indices. However, stock sentiment analysis is also available for individual shares on the IG platform.\nRecommended by Tammy Da Costa\nTraits of Successful Traders\nStock Market Sentiment Analysis: Key Takeaways\n- Trader sentiment can be used to determine hidden trends in the stock market\n- Client sentiment can be beneficial when combined with other analytical tools\n- Sentiment may indicate when positioning is approaching extremes relative to the price\n- IG Client Sentiment (IGCS) shows how many are going long or short, the percentage change over time and whether market signals could be bullish or bearish\nFurther Readings on Trading with Market Sentiment\nStock Market Sentiment FAQs\nWhat does it mean to be bullish or bearish in the stock market?\nTo be bullish a stock means that the trader expects the price to rise. Likewise, if an investor thinks the stock could fall, then they are perceived as bearish.\nWhat is the impact of negative sentiment on stocks?\nThe impact of negative sentiment could lead to an increase in traders looking to sell the share. When sentiment is negative, it likely means that investors are pessimistic about the value of the stock and this could lead to it being oversold, at which point reversal potential may appear from oversold conditions, thereby leading to the potential contrarian implementation of sentiment analysis."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d056d83-581d-4fe7-bcec-444d39f12699>","<urn:uuid:fe7db3fc-e5c2-4d45-844e-f51bff0c26ec>"],"error":null}

The circular economy (CE) model offers a new chance of innovation and integration between natural ecosystems, businesses, our daily lives, and waste management. Find out below the definition, meaning, principles, advantages, and barriers to a circular economy model.\nDefinitions Of Circular Economy\nSimple Definition Of Circular Economy\nIn the linear economy, raw natural resources are taken, transformed them into products and get disposed of. On the opposite, a circular economy model aims to close the gap between our cycle of production and the natural ecosystems’ cycle, as we ultimately depend on them. This means, on one hand, eliminating waste – composting biodegradable waste or, if it’s a transformed and non-biodegradable waste, reusing, remanufacturing and finally recycling it. On the other hand, it also means cutting off the use of chemical substances (a way to help regenerate natural systems) and betting on renewable energy.\nThe World Economic Forum’s Definition Of Circular Economy\n“A circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the end-of-life concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy, eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse and return to the biosphere, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems and business models. ”\nEllen McArthur Foundation’s Definition Of Circular Economy\n“Looking beyond the current take-make-dispose extractive industrial model, a circular economy aims to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits. It entails gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and designing waste out of the system. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital. It is based on three principles: design out waste and pollution; keep products and materials in use; regenerate natural systems.”\nThe Principles Of A Circular Economy\nThe Principles Of The Circular Economy: Energy and Resources Are Gold\nAt its core, a circular economy model has the intention of designing out waste. In fact, a circular economy is based on the idea that there is no such thing as waste. In order to achieve this, products are designed to last (good quality materials are used) and optimized for a cycle of disassembly and reuse that will make it easier to handle and transform or renew them.\nIn the end, these tight product cycles differentiate the circular economy model apart from disposal and recycling, where large amounts of embedded energy and labor are lost. The ultimate the goal is to preserve and enhance natural capital by controlling finite stocks and balancing renewable resources flows.\nThe Principles Of The Circular Economy: Following Nature’s Cycles And Designs\nThe circular economy model makes a distinction between technical and biological cycles. Consumption happens only in biological cycles, where biologically-based materials (such as food, linen or cork) are designed to feed back into the system through processes like anaerobic digestion and composting. These cycles regenerate living systems, such as soil or the oceans, which provide renewable resources for the economy. By their turn, technical cycles recover and restore products (e.g. washing machines), components (e.g. motherboards), and materials (e.g. limestone) through strategies like reuse, repair, remanufacture or recycling.\nUltimately, one of the purposes of the circular economy is to optimize resource yields by circulating products, components, and the materials in use at the highest utility at all times in both technical and biological cycles.\nThe Principles Of The Circular Economy: All In With Renewable Energies\nThe last principle of a circular economy has to do with the fact that the energy required to fuel this cycle should be renewable by nature, with the purpose of decreasing resource dependence and increasing systems’ resilience. In this sense, this principle is about developing the systems’ effectiveness by revealing and designing out negative externalities.\nBenefits Of The Circular Economy Model\nSince industrial evolution, humankind has been following a linear model of production and consumption. Raw materials have been transformed into goods that are afterward sold, used and turned into waste that has been many times unconsciously discarded and managed. On the opposite, the circular economy is an industrial model that is regenerative by intention and design and aims to improve resources’ performance and fight the volatility that climate change might bring to businesses. It has benefits that are operational as well as strategic and brings together a huge potential for value creation the economic, business, environment and social spheres.\nFewer Greenhouse Gas Emissions – Environmental Benefits Of The Circular Economy\nOne of the goals of the circular economy is to have a positive effect on the planet’s ecosystems and to fight the excessive exploitation of natural resources. The circular economy has the potential to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and the use of raw materials, optimize agricultural productivity and decrease the negative externalities brought by the linear model. When it comes to reducing greenhouse gases, a circular economy can be helpful:\n- Because it uses renewable energy that in the long run is less polluting than fossil fuels.\n- Thanks to reusing and dematerializing, fewer materials and productions processes are needed to provide good and functional products.\n- Because residues are seen as valuable and they are absorbed as much as possible in order to be reused in the process.\n- Since the preferred choices will be energy-efficient and non-toxic materials and manufacturing and recycling processes will be selected.\nAs a matter of fact, an Ellen MacArthur Foundation study found out that a circular economy development path could halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, relative to today’s levels.\nHealthy And Resilient Soils – Environmental Benefits Of The Circular Economy\nThe principles of the circular economy on the farming system ensure that important nutrients are returned to the soil through anaerobic processes or composting, which softens the exploitation of land and natural ecosystems. In this way, as “waste” is returned to the soil, besides having fewer residues to deal with, the soil gets healthier and more resilient, allowing a greater balance in the ecosystems that surround it. As well, since the soil degradation costs an estimated US$ 40 billion annually worldwide, and has hidden costs such as the increase of fertilizer use, loss of biodiversity and loss of unique landscapes – a circular economy could prove to be really useful for both the soils and the economy.\nIn reality, a circular economy model working in Europe’s food systems has the potential to decrease 80% of the use of artificial fertilizer and therefore contributing to the natural balance in the soil, according to a study from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n- More information on the negative impacts of the linear economy on the soil in our article > The ecological impact of coffee.\nFewer Negative Externalities – Environmental Benefits Of The Circular Economy\nFollowing the circular economy’s principles, negative externalities such as land use, soil, water and air pollution are better managed, as well as the emission of toxic substances and climate change.\n- More information about this topic in our page > Climate change: meaning, causes and consequences.\nIncreased Potential For Economic Growth – Economic Benefits Of The Circular Economy\nIt is important to decouple economic growth from resource consumption. The increase in revenues from new circular activities, together with a cheaper production by getting products and materials more functional and easily disassembled and reused, has the power to increase GDP and therefore economic growth, according to a McKinsey report.\nMore Resources Saved – Economic Benefits Of The Circular Economy\nWhen compared with the raw material extraction that’s common on the linear approach, the circular economy model has the potential to lead to a bigger (up to 70%) amount of material savings. Considering that the total demand for materials will increase due the growth of the world population and middle classes, a circular economy leads to lower material needs, as it skips landfills and avoids recycling, focusing on making materials’ cycles last longer. On the environmental side, it also avoids bigger pollution that extracting new materials would represent.\nEmployment Growth – Economic Benefits Of The Circular Economy\nAccording to the ‘world economic forum‘, the development of a circular economy model, together with a new regulation (including taxation) and organization of the labor markets, can bring greater local employment in entry-level and semi-skilled jobs. As well, the ExTax tax report made by specialists from several top consultancy firms also concluded about the potential of the circular economy to create new job. The same conclusion was reached by an August 2018 study on the development of practices to implement circular economy says that 50,000 new jobs could be generated in the UK and 54,000 in the Netherlands.\nAnother study conducted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey also concluded about the changes in employment growth in case of a shift to a circular economy model. The study says that this new jobs will be created through increases in:\n- Recycling and repairing practices, where one could add new designers and mechanical engineers to make lasting and easily disassembled products and materials at the transformation/production stages;\n- An increase in new businesses (and niches) due to innovation processes and new business models;\n- An increase in consumption and spending by lower prices.\nNew Profit Opportunities – Benefits Of The Circular Economy On Businesses\nLower input costs and in some cases create entirely new profit streams can be achieved by businesses that move to the circular economy model. In this circular sphere, profit opportunities may come from playing in new markets, cutting costs off with waste and energy reductions and the assurance of continuity of supply.\nMore information on new opportunities in our article > China is banning plastic waste, can this be good?\nVolatility Reduction And Safeguarded Supplies – Benefits Of The Circular Economy On Businesses:\nMoving towards a circular economy model meanings reducing the number of raw materials used. Instead, more recycled (or even reusable or easily transformed) inputs that have a higher share of labor costs would be used, leaving companies less dependent on the volatility of the price of raw materials. This would also protect companies of geopolitical crisis and safeguard them regarding their supply chains – whose probably to be destroyed or damaged because of climate change events is increasing every day. In the end, the circular economy model would turn businesses more resilient, or in other words, make them more resistant and prepared to deal with unexpected changes.\nThe Demand For New Services – Benefits Of The Circular Economy On Businesses\nAccording to Ellen McArthur’s Foundation report, a circular economy model has the potential to create demand for new services and new job opportunities such as:\n- “Collection and reverse logistics companies that support end of life products being reintroduced into the system\n- Product marketers and sales platforms that facilitate longer lives or higher utilization of products\n- Parts and component remanufacturing and product refurbishment offering specialized knowledge “\nThese new services can be both identified by the top management decision-makers, or as well, in a well-developed green by employees from all levels and departments. To get to know more follow on our page > Green human resources management.\nGetting To Know Clients Better – Benefits Of The Circular Economy on Businesses\nThe circular economy model seems to foster business models where products are rented or leased by customers during different periods of time, depending on the type of products. This gives businesses the chance to learn about their customer’s usage patterns and behaviors, as they get to interact more often with them. Ultimately, this new relationship might just improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, and contribute as well for the development of products and services that suit clients better. In a market where suppliers remain responsible for the product supplied for a longer period, communicating well and understanding the clients’ preferences and needs is more important than ever.\n- More information about this topic in our page > stakeholder engagement definition & strategies.\nBarriers To The Implementation Of A Circular Economy Model\nImplementing a circular economic model would have several benefits for the environment, economy and businesses, as we’ve discussed above. Nevertheless, there are some reasons that explain why this model has been growing slowly.\nEconomic Barriers To A Circular Economy Model\nIn our current economic system, there are some barriers to the implementation of a circular economy model, such as:\n- Social and environmental externalities are not considered in prices, privileging financial market signals instead of people and nature when economic decisions are made;\n- Prices of raw materials are fickle and at low prices alternative, good quality secondary resources are not competitive;\n- Circular economy business models are harder to develop, as most investors are still working under a linear economy logic and sometimes upfront investments are required;\n- The demand for circular products and alternatives is still small,\n- There aren’t still many qualified professionals with technical or ‘information and communication technology’ (ICT) knowledge.\nInstitutional Barriers To A Circular Economy Model\nWhen it comes to implementing and developing the circular economy, many different barriers might need to be overcome, such as:\n- The fact that our current economic system is geared towards the demand of the linear economy and ain’t yet prepared to deal with circular economy entrepreneurs;\n- New business models may be challenging to implement and develop because of laws and regulations that aren’t prepared for this kind of innovations;\n- Plenty of business rely on old and/or strong alliances, making it harder to create new alliances and therefore to close loops;\n- Many companies still have goals and appraisal systems that focus on short-term value creation, whereas the circular economy model is a long-term value creation model;\n- The GDP index doesn’t consider social and environmental externalities, discouraging the creation of value in both these areas;\nA Broad Perspective On The Barriers To A Circular Economy Model\nA Swedish study conducted in 2017 that aimed to integrate different perspectives on this topic suggests that the main barriers to moving towards the circular economy model can be divided into financial, structural, operational, attitudinal and technological.\nThe first barrier has to do with the challenge of measuring the financial benefits of CE and its profitability. The ‘structural’ barrier that follows has to do with being unclear of gets responsible for CE within companies. By their turn, ‘operational’ challenges represent the difficulty of dealing and staying in control of processes within the value-chain. The fourth barrier, ‘attitudinal’, has mostly demonstrated the lack of knowledge about sustainability issues and also a big risk aversion – it shows that disruptive changes aren’t the best way to develop circular strategies. The last block on circular economy, named ‘technological’, has to do with the need for changing and re-designing products and production/ take-back systems. These needs end up creating concerns about the ability to do this and still being competitive and having quality products.\n[box] Some of the sources used to find out more about the circular economy:\n- European Comission\n- World Economic Forum Report\n- Science Direct Article 1\n- Science Direct Article 2\n- Ellen McArthur Foundation\n- Ellen McArthur Foundation’s Report 2015\n- Ellen McArthur Foundation’s Report 2016\n- Fiscal Reforms for Circular Economy Report\n- KENNISKAARTEN Knowledge Map\n- McKinsey Report\n- The Ex’Tax Project [/box]\nImage credits for Shutterstock on: circular economy model definition, circular economy definition principles, circular economy model benefits, circular economy model economic benefits, circular economy barriers & circular economy sustainable development"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:75103723-dea5-4b1f-9a2d-c9f0e0109a4f>","<urn:uuid:25ec525f-9ddc-4f38-aa9a-78be85e3c59d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between verification and authentication in cybersecurity, and how are these processes being challenged by facial recognition technology at airports?","answer":"Verification and authentication are distinct but complementary security processes. Verification is a one-time process that confirms a person's existence using identification documents like IDs or passports. Authentication, in contrast, is an ongoing process that determines whether the actual account holder is conducting transactions, typically using PINs, passwords, or biometric data. Meanwhile, facial recognition technology at airports is introducing new challenges to these traditional security processes. At participating airports, this technology matches travelers' photos with existing travel documents from the Department of Homeland Security, but raises concerns about privacy, data storage, and accuracy issues, particularly for people of color due to AI training biases.","context":["Authentication and verification are critical in biometrics security as they help prevent fraud and other cybercrimes. The two may have the same motive, but, looking closely, you will discover that they are not the same, which forms the basis of our discussion.\nSo, what’s the difference between authentication and verification? Verification happens once when the system needs to be sure that it is dealing with a person that exists by using identification documents like ID cards, passports, or driver’s licenses. In contrast, authentication is deeper, aiming to determine whether the actual account holder is conducting the transaction. It involves using codes such as PINs and passwords that are unique to the valid account user.\nThere is a thin line between authentication and verification since they have the same role. As technology develops, so does the need for data confidentiality. There has been a surge in cases of identity theft and imposter frauds in recent years. Consequently, firms and individuals need to go a step further than user identification to avoid losing a lot of money to these attacks.\nIn verification, the system finds out whether you are an actual person. It is a one-off activity at the entry point into an account or site that majorly occurs in two phases. First, the servers can compare the personal details you have submitted, such as name or phone number, against another reliable source.\nAnother viable verification method is looking at the validity of your identification documents like your ID or driver’s license. Ultimately, the sole reason for verification is to confirm that whoever is logging onto a system is genuine and not a fraud.\nVerification ascertains that you are the person you claim to be. It is a critical step because it builds trust between the user and the system, as it helps in knowing the person’s true identity. When the user submits the details, they have to go through a thorough verification process involving automated systems or experts to ensure that the data exists in a third party’s data.\nDoing this protects the company from dealing with fraud because as soon as they verify the credentials, it will be easy to trace the activity to the real account user. It saves a lot of money by diverting cybercriminals; hence, it is critical to invest in such protocols if you conduct your business or other financial services online.\nAs a result, companies avoid falling prey to scams and prevent entry by malicious users. Another advantage is that people are more willing to transact with firms keen on cybersecurity, meaning more revenues.\nWhat Is Authentication?\nCompanies go a long way to ensure that their clients’ data remains private because it guarantees the customers’ safety and maintains trust in transactions. Therefore, stakeholders need elaborate ways to ensure that no other person gains access to personal information through methods like authentication.\nAuthentication is when a system validates the user’s identity through a user’s unique code, ensuring that the individual has the right to access it. In the process, the system makes use of pre-existing details that the client provided initially.\nAs soon as you log in your credentials, the computer compares them with the data in the file’s database, which holds the accurate information. It may be through a string of questions, and unless the user gives the correct answers, the system will not provide access to the account. Alternatively, the system can send the users a code on their phone because they are the only ones to retrieve it.\nAuthentication is one way that humans interact with computers. Naturally, before you log into an account, you have to provide your user ID and a password, and, without it, the system deems you an infiltrator. In some settings, the application automatically shuts down to prevent further trials. Data confidentiality is one of the most heavily invested in systems because otherwise, it opens doors to cybercriminals leading to firm losses.\nTherefore, companies have to put up firewalls to protect their clients’ sensitive information like security numbers and financial details from reaching the wrong hands. Several types of authentication methods are deployed by firms depending on the degree of what’s at stake. The most common process is the single-factor method, where the user provides a login ID and a password.\nThe process can also take other routes depending on the system’s advancements like knowledge, inherence, possession, time, and location factors. First, knowledge tests the user on information that they know, perhaps, their PIN, the user ID, or asks them to respond to a question with a unique answer. Second, you can provide the system with your biometric identity, say, fingerprints or retina scans in the inherence factor.\nThe possession factor, on the contrary, requires credentials based on what the user carries, like mobile phones or any other hardware device. Lastly, there are the location and time factors where servers identify where and when you are accessing the account to prevent attacks from remote areas.\nAuthentication Vs Verification\nThere is a need for private and public entities to secure their data, and the best way is through verification and authentication. Although the two have the same motive, they are still different aspects of cybersecurity, and the focus today is to distinguish them.\nVerification is when an account user has to submit a form of identification to show that they are authentic and with pure intentions. It involves using a driver’s license, ID, or passport that only the valid holder would possess.\nOn the contrary, authentication goes deeper than verification. Instead of identity confirmation, the system requires the user to submit information like a PIN or a password, unique and secret between the two parties. No other person has access to that information except the verified account user.\nEssentially, verification is mostly a one-time thing, where the system wishes to know whether they are transacting with an existing person. It happens at the initial stage of account registration, where the system identifies you as the valid account user.\nTherefore, it helps to know that you will be the right person to conduct transactions and receive secret information in the future, like passwords. The aim is to deal with the actual individual who will be accountable in case of anything, doing this curbs imposter fraud by counterchecking with a third party with the exact details.\nYou may provide your social security number to the system, after which there will be a background check to confirm that the number belongs to you and that you are the actual individual asking for access to the site.\nThe system will then confirm from the database, and if present, the verification system is complete. One challenge, however, with verification, is that some expert hackers can easily forge another person’s ID or driver’s license; here’s where the system needs user authentication.\nAuthentication is a step further after verification. Now that the user has confirmed their identity and the system has verified it to be accurate, certainty is still vital. This process requires you to submit specific information that only you know about or a trait unique to you, taking many forms depending on the system.\nGenerally, the server may need your PIN or password since they are complex to guess and exclusive to each user. Alternatively, the system can detect your location or time to block attackers from different parts of the world. Also, you may have to present your biometric data such as fingerprints, voice, or retina scans.\nUltimately, identification comes before authentication and is also the registration step. The system has to know that it deals with an existing individual first before conducting any business altogether. It is until it has established trust that you can gain access to an account. Authentication, in contrast, happens after verification. You are a verified user since you are a genuine person; however, the system must understand that it deals with a verified person.\nUpon registering for an account, the computer formulates a PIN for you or asks you to input a password. You will need authentication every time you access the site to confirm that you are not an imposter. Therefore, while verification is a one-time affair to verify that you are honest, authentication is a continuous process to prove that you are who you say you are.\nWhat You Need To Know about Authentication and Verification\nAs much as authentication and verification help keep data safe from cybercriminals, they also have some vulnerabilities. Unless you understand your system’s weaknesses, you leave your data vulnerable to cyber attackers; therefore, I will take a closer look at the ups and downs of the two methods.\nAt basic levels, the two identity management protocols are simple and don’t require encryption. Additionally, advanced authentication methods, such as OAuth, use extremely advanced procedures to secure data through cryptography.\nThe advanced level authentication may be accurate but complex and costly, while the primary ones are cheaper but not entirely secure from attacks. Verification also improves customer experience since your vital data is safe in the custody of the organization you trust.\nThese two identity procedures work back-to-back to ensure that your information is safe from unauthorized access. As a result, they reduce confusion and improve customer services without fear of fraud or cases of stolen identities. Moreover, your transactions will undergo keen monitoring, and, in case of suspicious activity, you can get notifications. Apart from data security, these systems also maintain your company’s reputation.\nOn the flip side, authentication and verification also have some downsides. Primary level authentication that uses passwords is the most vulnerable to malicious attackers. It is easy for a genius hacker to crack the system; hence, the need for a two-factor identification method. Secondly, biometric authentication may be safe from fraud, but it also suffers breakdowns when the system fails to identify the user’s inherent features, such as fingerprints.\nTrends in Authentication and Verification\nSince more people are conducting their businesses online, attackers have found a gold mine in accessing individual and firm financial accounts. Therefore, the need for security has led to the development of verification and authentication systems, a sector that has in turn seen several ups and downs in the recent past.\nIdentity verification and authentication are becoming the norm, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to the adoption of online services in most areas, particularly health and businesses.\nHowever, given the millions of users using the internet every day, the avenue for fraud has also increased. Therefore, customers and organizations have found it critical to keep their sensitive data private through elaborate cybersecurity measures.\nThe safety concern is responsible for strict identification procedures and the use of biometric devices. Cybercriminals also use technological enhancements to take advantage of innocent account users by breaking into their systems to commit heinous crimes. Consequently, artificial intelligence and machine learning are expected to grow further in the future to curb increased identity theft issues.\nIn turn, awareness among organizations and customers is now vital in data security. Business owners are now working tirelessly to upgrade to stringent authentication and verification measures to retain their customers.\nIn most cases, companies keen on data confidentiality and integrity are now most preferred by customers. Hence, to keep up with the trends and prevent cyberattacks, firms embrace and implement robust systems using the latest innovations to satisfy client demands.\nFurthermore, the novel Corona pandemic has also significantly affected people’s social lives and internet behavior. More have been working from home, leading to the widespread use of online platforms for financial transactions.\nIn turn, there has been a need for more stringent security measures such as verification and authentication. Besides, due to the nature of contraction of COVID-19, companies and health centers have turned to authentication methods where people limit contact with surfaces to avoid the further spread of the virus.\nThe main reason behind cybersecurity processes is the emerging cases of cyberattacks on individuals and companies. Hackers use devious means to access your sensitive data then use it for personal gains leading to millions lost and company collapses.\nOnline criminals always target the most vulnerable firms with less sophisticated data security systems since they are easy prey. Therefore, to avoid falling victims, such industries improve their identification processes to prepare for impending infiltration.\nAuthentication and verification are key aspects of cybersecurity, and having the same motive makes it difficult to distinguish them. The difference lies in the stage of use and level of scrutiny. Verification is the initial step of interaction between the system and the user when the person proves validity by submitting identity credentials.\nOn the other hand, authentication is a continuous process where each time users wish to log into a site, they must prove that they are the real account holders by answering a series of unique questions.","Last week, writer Mackenzie Fegan boarded an international JetBlue flight without so much as handing over a boarding pass or passport. “I looked into a camera before being allowed down the jet bridge,” she wrote on Twitter. “Did facial recognition replace boarding passes, unbeknownst to me? Did I consent to this?”\nLike a number of recent travellers, she had unknowingly opted into the airline’s facial recognition software—a reality we’ll all soon become accustomed to in the not-so-distant future.\nAnd that might be appealing to you; after all, it should expedite the boarding process (no exchange of documents probably saves you a few seconds and some effort), but there are plenty of reasons why opting out might prove a better decision in the end.\n“We have the government using this extremely powerful and dangerous biometric face recognition, which really has the potential to become a serious technology of control,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said over the phone. “They’re using it in an unnecessary way, like hunting a mosquito with a bazooka.”\nSo you’re finally headed on that overseas vacation that’s been marked on your calendar for months now. Congratulations!\nFacial recognition matches your identity with past travel documents\nHow does an airline let you board without showing proof of a single physical document? According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s website, international travellers at participating airports have their photograph taken before boarding at the gate (or while exiting customs); this information is then matched to images from passports, visas, and other travel documents, provided by the Department of Homeland Security.\n“It’s a really laborious and fancy way of replacing the function that a human engages in when they look at your passport photo and look at your face and make a judgment about whether [you’re] the same person,” Stanley said. “It’s based on the theory that facial recognition software is better than human judgment, which is really not clear.”\nIf you’re a U.S. citizen, your photo will only be retained for up to 12 hours. If you’re a departing non-U.S. citizen, however, CBP will keep your photo for up to two weeks. If you’re a non-U.S. citizen arriving at a participating airport, CBP can store your photo for 75 years, as Buzzfeed News writes, bringing up a number of privacy and data issues and who has access to your information.\nFacial recognition has enormous social implications\nFacial recognition is alarming for a lot of reasons, but Stanley said you shouldn’t be as concerned about its ability to ‘track’ your whereabouts.\n“CBP already knows your location,” he said. “They know you’re on that flight and they know who you are based on the biographical data you’ve given the airline and your passport.”\nThe concerns, however, are much broader as it relates to non-U.S. citizens or people of colour and the potential for false positives. “We worry that ... the system might be used to pressure and bully non-Americans,” he said.\n“And another reason why people might want to opt out is that face recognition has serious accuracy problems. There’s a higher error rate with regard to people with darker skin. Some of that is because of the way that AIs are trained on sample databases that are predominantly white. The privacy implications are large and the benefits for America are low.”\nRequest an alternative screening process\nCurrently, the facial recognition pilot program is operating in a number of major airports like John F. Kennedy International and Los Angeles International Airport and through major airlines like JetBlue, Delta, and British Airways (in addition to one cruise liner, Royal Caribbean).\nDespite its presence at a growing number of airports, you do have the option to opt out of facial recognition software by requesting an alternative screening process.\n“They don’t necessarily do a good job of telling people that,” Stanley said, but you should request the process while in line at the gate. According to Newsweek, they’ll examine your passport or physical documents manually, as they would any other time you’ve boarded a flight.\n“Opting out can have an effect; the government isn’t impervious to the opinion of the travelling public,” Stanley said. And if you do have concerns, voice those to an airline whether in person or by Twitter, too, so you can make sure this process doesn’t become a requirement, instead of an option."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1eb33400-2544-4a92-974c-f3a0e74e2131>","<urn:uuid:573bf671-c42f-49e3-bc3d-109a4aa6f5e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the roles and perspectives of agricultural economists in shaping both public policy and technological advancement in agriculture? Could you analyze their involvement in research implementation versus policy development?","answer":"Agricultural economists play multiple roles in both policy and technological advancement. In terms of policy, while there is some disagreement among agricultural economists about issues like industry consolidation and farm subsidies, most are generally against subsidies due to their deadweight loss effects. For research implementation, agricultural economists are involved in studying the effectiveness of extension services, with evidence showing very high returns on public investment in agricultural extension (over 100% internal rate of return). They also analyze new technologies' impacts - from studying GM crop adoption patterns to assessing public reactions to emerging biotechnology like gene-drive insects. Agricultural economists increasingly work across disciplines to provide perspectives on market reactions and incentives, particularly for cutting-edge technologies. Rather than just analyzing past events, they aim to help craft policy for new technologies and guide successful implementation. This involves both pure economic analysis and broader interdisciplinary collaboration to understand market and societal impacts.","context":["[Please consider supporting GMO Building Blocks with ongoing contribution of $1, $2, $3, $5 or $10 a month on Patreon.]\nJayson Lusk is Regents Professor and Willard Sparks Endowed Chair in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Oklahoma State University. He blogs at jaysonlusk.com. | @JaysonLusk\nHe has researched and written extensively on the impact of the Farm Bill and agricultural subsidies. Jayson joined the FAFDL community last fall for a Q&A on ag economics.\nFAFDL: Do Ag Economics fall into different schools like Keynesian, Chicago, or Austrian, and is it subject to the same kinds of contentious policy recommendations, depending on which school?\nJAYSON LUSK: At the onset, I should mention that I’m the current president of the AAEA (http://www.aaea.org/ – the main professional association for agricultural economists), and with a membership of around 2,500 you can certainly expect some differing opinions.\nHowever, I wouldn’t say there are as clear dividing lines as there are, for example, in macro-economics. One thing that is a little frustrating for me is that the ag economists that are often featured in food documentaries, popular books, etc. are often not what I’d consider to be in the mainstream or in the top active group of top researchers on topics in question.\nThere is some disagreement about the impacts of consolidation and concentration in agriculture, though my general sense is that many (perhaps most) ag economists are less concerned about this than the typical outside observer. There is some contention about the desirability of farm subsidies – most ag economists on principle are against the deadweight loss caused by such subsidies – others some are worried about international trade when other countries have such subsidies, and there are many ag economists that work closely with farmers and farm groups trying to maximize the benefits to farmers.\nFAFDL: What impact, if any, do current crop insurance subsidies play in keeping our commodities competitively priced for international trade?\nJL: Most of the research I’ve seen suggests crops insurance subsidies have small impacts on commodity prices. If they had larger effects, then we’d likely have problems with other countries taking us to court at the WTO for affecting world prices.\nFAFDL member WILLIAM ENRIGHT: As an Irish agricultural scientist now living in a dairy area in Ontario, I love the Supply Management approach here and feel very sorry for my dairy farmer friends in the US who are constantly stressed, always feel the need to increase cow numbers and live in an economically unstable environment. Thoughts?\nJL: I’m generally not a fan of government-run supply management schemes – yes they can stabilize prices, but they can also be costly to the economy as a whole as the can over- or under-encourage production relative to the underlying supply/demand conditions. In general, we WANT farmers to respond to market conditions by cutting back when prices are too low and by producing more when prices are high. It is not as though farmers are at the complete mercy of the market. Farmers can stabilize some of the variation in price risk through: contracting, hedging in futures markets, insurance, savings, and diversification into other commodities.\nWILLIAM ENRIGHT: Thanks, and yet my comments about US dairy farmers still ring true based on the ones I know. The only downside I see in Canada is that the consumer pays more for dairy products but I don’t see that as a bad thing – I feel they pay a fair price for good wholesome products. I also believe that food prices in the US are spiralling downwards relative to inflation and that is not necessarily a good thing – people take it for granted, over-consume, etc. Anyway, I appreciate your answer as a US agri-economist but you have have swayed my opinion.\nFAFDL: Has there been work done to look at the impact of extension services and compare the impact of extension to similar services like private consultants and the advice of input companies and dealers?\nWhat does the research show on that?\nJL: Good question. I’m not aware of this sort of private vs. public comparison. There ARE lots of crop consultants and crop consulting companies that provide private advice to farmers; some of these work for ag input supplies and others are independent. One related paper of interest is the one I discussed on my blog that calculated the rate of return on public spending on agricultural extension.\nMeasuring Public Agricultural Research and Extension and Estimating their Impacts on\nAgricultural Productivity: New Insights from U.S. Evidence (2015) [pdf]\n“For public agricultural research with a productivity focus the estimated real [internal rate of return] is 67%, and for narrowly defined agricultural and natural resource extension is over 100%. Stated another way, these public investment project could pay a very high interest rate (66% for agricultural research and 100% for extension) and still have a positive net present value. Hence, these [internal rate of return] estimates are quite large relative to alternative public investments in programs of education and health. In addition, there is no evidence of a low returns to public agricultural extension in the U.S., or that public funds should be shifted from public agricultural extension to agricultural research. In fact, if any shifting were to be recommended, it would be to shift some funds from public agricultural research to extension. ”\nThe paper includes a couple really interesting graphs on research spending and extension employment over time. First, they show that for four major agricultural states, real spending on agricultural research peaked in the mid 1990s.\nAnd, while extension staff has declined in some states, it hasn’t in others.\nFAFDL: Related, what do we know about what are the most effective conduits for the adoption of best practices and things like IPM, cover crops, conservation tillage, etc?\nJL: Ag extension is certainly relevant here. Some of the commodity organizations also do their own research and outreach. I once visited the Iowa Soybean Association, for example, and they had water testing labs, and scientists reporting on effects of conservation issues. The USDA also plays a role through NRCS and other agencies. There are private foundations who also put information and on research and provide advice (The Noble Foundation in Oklahoma is one prominent example in my locale).\nFAFDL: I’ve seen some of your work cited, especially Compassion by the Pound. Do you have an opinion on how some of the EA animal charities are pushing for cage free, and do you think cage free systems are preferable to battery caged or enriched cages from the hen perspective?\nAlso, what do you think some of the main advances in chicken welfare will be? Especially considering that chickens seem to make up a bulk of farmed animal suffering.\nJL: There are tradeoffs between all housing systems both in terms of animal welfare and in terms of cost. This resource is probably one of the best, most well-researched sources of information out there: http://www2.sustainableeggcoalition.org/research-results/.\nAs you’ll see, no system is perfect and it will depend on which attributes/values are most important to you. As for me personally, I’m a fan of the enriched colony cage systems. I spent a whole chapter on them in my most recent book, Unnaturally Delicious.\nFAFDL: It seems to me that there are three areas where farmers nearly universally need (want) policy support – access to credit, access to risk management tools, supply management (and infrastructure and public investment in research, I suppose but those are of a different category).\nThe case for that support seem to me much stronger in developing countries as framed as an emerging industry/emerging market, but it fades as agriculture industries and markets mature – and farmers are better able to access credit and risk management as well as managing supply and volatile makers.\nI know that you lean pretty heavily against market intervention and subsidies in the US and other developed/mature markets. Do you think that policy support around credit, risk and supply management makes more sense for earlier stages of development in less mature markets?\nJL: I’m really not much of an expert on development economics, but of the people who I know who work in the area do indeed tend to focus more on the market failures that prevent development in those countries. One curious stylized fact is that, in agrarian developing countries, subsidies tend to flow from the country to the cities (not in the direction you’re hypothesizing they should flow); Its in the relatively rich, urban countries like the US and Western Europe where subsidies flow from the cities to the countryside. This probably has more to do with politics than with the underlying economic justifications for the various interventions. It is also worth noting that many developing countries have some really lousy ag/food policies and many have state-run enterprises which control production/seed/fertilizer, etc.\nFAFDL: There was an article recently on the environmental cost of Australia rejecting GMO canola. It seems like there is an option here to share the cost of not adopting the technology which might make a difference to public opinion. At a March Against Monsanto event, people were ok with Golden Rice (the cost in terms of lives lost) but not with Bt corn.\nJL: Generally, I think focusing on the benefits and on the personal stories of the adopters is likely to be most useful. It’s the strategy I tried to follow in Unnaturally Delicious.\nFAFDL: With several proposed mergers Bayer-Monsanto, DuPont-Dow, Chinese buyout if Syngenta, what are possible implications for farmers and consumers?\nJL: Hard to know the full consequences at present. At issue is whether the cost savings from larger size (economies of scale), streamlining of sales force, etc. are larger/smaller than any market power that might be gained from reduced competition. If (and it’s an “if”), the merger leads to more resources being directed to R&D, that could produce beneficial outcomes. A few good writings on this:\nAgricultural Competitiveness – Darren Hudson:\nNow for the downside, and why I am concerned:\n• Less competition. While there are some benefits here, the fact is that less competition is not good for producers on net typically. We are often prone to say that Bayer will have more monopoly power and therefore will raise seed/chemical prices, that is not necessarily true. But, costs need not be just monetary. With less competition, there is less pressure to innovate…\n• Fewer choices. Related to (1), is Bayer as compelled to offer a as broad a range of choices? Here, I am more referring to things like variety lines. Fewer choices would mean fewer options for producers to choose between to fit specific production conditions/needs/preferences. Again, this is less about a monetary cost, and more about the cost to management flexibility. And, further, a more constrained choice set means that producers are (1) exposed to greater business risk with less ability to adapt to changing conditions and (2) less able to negotiation on price based on available competitors.\nBloomberg – Tyler Cowen: People Aren’t Thinking Straight About Bayer and Monsanto\n” Critics who dislike Monsanto for its leading role in developing genetically modified organisms and agricultural chemicals shouldn’t also be citing monopoly concerns as a reason to oppose the merger — that combination of views doesn’t make sense. Let’s say for instance that the deal raised the price of GMOs due to monopoly power. Farmers would respond by using those seeds less, and presumably that should be welcome news to GMO opponents. “\nFAFDL: Following your analysis of the food movement’s policy proposals, do you feel there is a need for Ag econ outreach to inform public just as science communication is crucial for combating anti-biotech fear?\nJL: Generally, I’ve seen a lot of efforts directed toward science communication. I am in favor of such education, and I’ve done a lot of public outreach myself, but realistically, it’s hard to know how much impact it’s actually had. I think productive dialog (i.e., a back and forth communication) is likely to be more effective than “education” (I.e., listen to me – the expert). Moreover, the actual technology itself may be the biggest key. When we have biotech products that produce more obvious and tangible benefits from the consumer, I suspect many more will come on board.\nThe original FAFDL Facebook discussion can be found here.\n[Please consider supporting GMO Building Blocks with ongoing contribution of $1, $2, $3, $5 or $10 a month on Patreon.]","The academic journey of Florida native Mike Jones spans Peruvian potato fields and the irrigated deserts of Syria to arrive where Jones is today: on NC State’s campus, a Ph.D. student investigating the impacts and public perception of cutting-edge agricultural technology.\nJones earned his bachelor’s degree in food and resource economics from the University of Florida, then his master’s in agricultural economics at Purdue University. He chose the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at CALS for his Ph.D. to study how new forms of agricultural biotechnology can impact farmers and society.\nLast month, CALS Dean Richard Linton invited Jones to be part of a panel of experts discussing what’s next for CALS, our state and our nation. We caught up with Jones to talk about his impressive body of work and his thoughts on the future of his own research.\nDid you grow up on a farm?\nNo, and that’s always something I’m trying to overcome. I saw potato fields for the very first time while I was in Peru doing research as an undergraduate. It really struck me, because it was more than just pretty flowers in a garden — it was someone’s entire livelihood on two acres.\nHow did you develop an interest in agriculture?\nIt was by complete accident. I was a political science major at first, in an honors program where a professor in food and resource economics encouraged me to take his class. I thought it was amazing. The applied economics field has a very tangible focus. Instead of focusing on a cloudy “market,” there were tangible products.\nWhat’s your research background?\nAt the University of Florida, I did a lot of international travel — east Asia, southern Africa, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East back when Syria was safer than Miami. I did work there in low-irrigation crops that grow in the desert.\nMy interest when I was at Purdue was how small farmers, especially in the developing world, can use technology — simple things like high-density plastic bags that can be manufactured in developing countries to store corn, beans and black-eyed peas — to keep the food completely safe from insects. The Gates Foundation supported the effort and I got to be part of a project that reached millions of people.\nWhat are you working on right now?\nTwo very distinct projects, with a common thread of how new forms of agricultural biotechnology can impact farmers and society.\nOne is in The Philippines, looking at data tracking the same farmers over multiple years. My interest is in how farmers there are able to increase yields with genetically modified varieties, and why certain types of farmers are more able to than others. A lot of people say that “on average,” yields increased, but I’m interested in the nuance of who gains the most as other developing countries consider whether to allow farmers to grow genetically modified crops.\nIn the United States, I’m looking at genetically modified insects. One of CRISPR’s uses is through gene drives, where they can make genetic changes that are inheritable and can be passed on and theoretically spread through an entire insect species population.\nWe noticed that everybody was talking about how the public might react, but we still needed in-depth studies on what the public actually thinks. With Zachary Brown, who’s the principal investigator, and a team from NC State and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we’re taking proposed agricultural applications and doing a large-scale survey using USDA funds, looking at how people feel about the different uses of gene drives to reduce insect damage and how they might impact consumers. If gene drive insects are used in the field as replacements for pesticides, that could be seen as a good thing because you’re using less pesticide. But if there’s any sort of negative reaction in the market, if people draw away from it the way some are drawn away from genetically modified crops, it’s unclear whether that’s a net win for farmers. New, unexplored technology — there’s so much money going into it, but nobody knows what the public thinks.\nAny of these discussions on new cutting-edge technology sooner or later circle back to economics. It’s not just a question of tacking up all the costs and benefits and seeing if one outweighs the other.\nWhat’s next for agricultural economics?\nMy discipline does have a bright future. I think we sometimes react to past events and try to dissect how things went, but we also can have much to say about how things might go. We can be involved in crafting policy for these cutting-edge technologies, looking at how we can move forward successfully.\nMy interest in this field is really when we work hand in hand with people from other disciplines. I would love to surround myself with people from many disciplines, where I can give informed perspectives on how markets may react to certain things and how incentives may be pushing people to behave in unexpected ways.\nThis post was originally published in College of Agriculture and Life Sciences News."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:20f3139d-14db-4ecc-a530-3732c49f8c6a>","<urn:uuid:cc1239cf-b126-42c2-8407-bda9c5788947>"],"error":null}

Unfortunately, baseball players don't wear headgear (caps don't count), and sometimes baseballs land where they shouldn't …on vulnerable heads.\n- Cracked teeth. Baseball players don't wear mouthguards either, and the ball that misses the top of the head can get the teeth.\n- Broken jaw. The jaw, too, is exposed to flying baseballs during a game. A ball might hit a child on the outside of the jaw or face forward. Even a mouthguard can't protect against that.\n- Black eye. By now, you know the culprit, a hard thrown ball. But, sometimes, a baseball bat can be the culprit. Maybe an enthusiastic hitter, running off to first, throws his bat—and, unfortunately, it lands on your child, who just happens to be sitting in the bleachers or waiting for his turn at bat.\n- Heat Prostration. When an inning lasts forever in the hot sun, the pitcher can begin to look like Gatorade.\n- Foot Injury. Sneakers are not always the best shoe to protect toes from getting stubbed or broken. Making a run to a base or getting hit in the foot from a bat or a ball is all it takes.\n- Back Injury. Picking up foul balls, bending to catch a low-flying ball, jumping at an angle to get a curving ball—all of these cause back injury.\nFirst Things First\nMore than 41 percent of all baseball injuries to kids occur to the head, face, eyes, or mouth.\nTreatment and Prevention\nFlexibility is key for back and shoulder injuries, sprains and breaks. All it takes is a warm-up before a game, plus five minutes of stretches, to keep muscles and joints limber, supple, and resilient.\nMost fitness and exercise books offer good stretching exercises, providing both step-by-step instructions and illustrations. Some of our favorites include The Rockport Walking Program by James Rippe, M.D. and Ann Ward, with Karla Dougherty (published by Fireside Books) and Aerobics by Kenneth Cooper (published by Bantam Books). Your local Y should have drawings of stretches clipped on a bulletin board. And the President's National Council on Fitness, based in Washington, D.C., also has information on the best stretches to perform before exercising.\nAlthough headgear and mouthguards are only found on umpires and the occasional pitcher, all players would do well to arm themselves with this protection. It would stop many tragic accidents to the head, face, eyes, and mouth.\nMore on: First Aid\nExcerpted from The Complete Idiot's Guide to First Aid Basics © 1996 by Stephen J.

Berman, managing partner and co-founder of Seattle-based Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, along with Derek Howard and Jack Lee of San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP, have filed a class-action lawsuit (download PDF) on behalf of several current and former soccer players against soccer’s worldwide governing body—the Fèdèration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)—and affiliated soccer organizations in the United States.\nThe lawsuit alleges that these groups have failed to adopt effective policies to evaluate and manage concussions, a common occurrence at all levels of the game. They also claim that a lack of effective policies poses a greater danger to women and children players, who are more vulnerable to traumatic and long-lasting brain injury.\n“The medical community called for change over a decade ago and despite simple, best-practice guidelines, which have been updated three times since the initial international conference on concussions, FIFA has failed to enact the policies and rules needed to protect soccer players,” Berman said. “We believe it is imperative we force these organizations to put a stop to hazardous practices that put players at unnecessary risk.”\nThe players bringing the suit say that despite participating in and even hosting conferences that have created common-sense guidelines, FIFA has failed to enact the policies and rules needed to protect soccer players. The suit also names U.S. Youth Soccer and American Youth Soccer—leagues responsible for over three million child and adolescent soccer players in the United States—for allegedly failing to incorporate up-to-date guidelines into their concussion policies. The lawsuit could result in reformed concussion policies for millions of soccer players around the world.\nFIFA’s guidelines appear to suggest that players self-diagnose brain injuries by allowing a referee and not a medical professional to determine if the player is too injured to continue. The players allege that “returning a player to play before fully recovered negligently puts him or her at risk of a permanent brain injury.”\n“The negligence is remarkable, given that FIFA actively promotes its activities to children,” Berman said, noting that the FIFA video game is the best-selling sports video game in the world and the second best-selling in the United States. “Yet no rule limits headers in children’s soccer, and children are often taught to head the ball from the age of three. We estimate that a dedicated youth player might sustain 1,000 headers per year, and a high school player more than 1,800 headers.”\nConcern over soccer concussions mounted during the 2014 World Cup, where multiple players returned to play after violent hits to the head. In the final match, Germany’s Christoph Kramer crashed into the shoulder of an opposing player and appeared to pass out. He returned to play, only to be assisted off the field fifteen minutes later in a stupor. Under NFL rules, passing out requires immediate removal from the game. Such spectacles have drawn widespread criticism of FIFA from players, commentators, and even members of Congress.\nThe players cite FIFA’s marketing and policy materials, which tout a commitment to player safety. In the past, FIFA has implemented policies to address health threats including cardiac arrest and performance-enhancing drugs, and concussions deserve the same attention.\nThe lawsuit, Mehr v. Fèdèration Internationale de Football Association, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeks to require FIFA and its U.S. affiliates to implement up-to-date guidelines for detection of head injuries and for return to play after a concussion. The suit also calls for regulation of heading by players under 17 years old, and a rule change to permit substitution of players for medical evaluation purposes. Currently, FIFA rules generally allow only three substitutions per game with no clear provision for head injuries. If an athlete bleeds, even from a scrape, removal is required, but no similar rule exists for concussions. FIFA provides no guidance on substitutions in youth games in the U.S.\n“FIFA’s and U.S. Soccer’s failure to act and protect these young players is no longer acceptable, given the epidemic of concussive injuries and the failure to implement important advances in medical treatments and protocols,” Howard said. “High school soccer players suffer an overwhelmingly disproportionate number of concussions compared to other youth sports.”\nIn addition, the lawsuit seeks medical monitoring for soccer players who received head injuries in the past. The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages to compensate for athletes’ injuries, but injured athletes could still pursue awards individually.\nIn 2013, FIFA reported $1.386 billion in revenue. The 2014 World Cup brought FIFA $1.2 billion from U.S. broadcasters alone.\nHagens Berman recently led a separate class action and settlement that will reform concussion policies across the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The case against FIFA could mean similar changes to soccer around the world.\nAbout Hagens Berman\nHagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP is a consumer-rights class-action law firm with offices in nine cities.

{"question":"I'm studying medical procedures - what's the difference between the post-procedure monitoring requirements for HIDA scans versus lumbar punctures?","answer":"The post-procedure requirements differ significantly. After a HIDA scan, patients only need to wait 10-15 minutes while scans are reviewed and can immediately resume normal activities unless advised otherwise. In contrast, after a lumbar puncture, patients must typically lie flat for about an hour to reduce headache risk, are advised to drink extra fluids, and should limit their activities for 24 hours following the procedure.","context":["What is HIDA Scan?\nA Nuclear Medicine Hepatobiliary Scan is done to study the gallbladder and bile ducts for signs of inflammation, obstruction, function or leakage. Imaging is performed after a small amount of radioactive tracer is injected into a vein in the arm. The tracer travels to the liver, gallbladder and small intestine.\nAbout the Procedure\nThe HIDA scan involves injecting, swallowing or inhaling very small amounts of radioactive drugs called radiopharmaceuticals. The radiopharmaceutical selected for your scan is specific to the organ being imaged. As the radiopharmaceutical travels to the area being examined, a gamma camera detects the photons released by this radioactive material and maps their distribution. Nuclear medicine cameras are connected to computers that process the information to produce pictures for the Radiologist to interpret. Within a few days, all traces of the radiopharmaceutical disappear from the body. These procedures are safe and painless. There are no common side effects in nuclear medicine. Therefore, you should not feel dizzy, nauseous, sleepy or hot.\nMost nuclear medicine exams require simple preparation. Occasionally, you will be asked to discontinue certain medications for a specific length of time prior to your exam. Your physician will inform you of these requirements in advance of your exam. If you have any questions, the nuclear medicine staff will be happy to help you. Since imaging rooms can be chilly, please dress in warm, comfortable clothing without metal buttons, snaps or buckles. We will ask you to remove metal objects such as belt buckles, coins and keys.\nPlease arrive at the hospital or clinic 10-15 minutes prior to your scheduled exam time. A technologist will discuss your procedure with you, answer your questions and obtain other needed information. Please bring a list of your medications, x-rays, CT scans or other pertinent test results with you. If you need to cancel your nuclear medicine exam, please notify your hospital or clinic at least 24 hours in advance since the radioactive material is ordered specifically for you on the day of your exam and cannot be stored for future use.\nDuring the Procedure\nIn the nuclear medicine room, you will sit in a chair or lie on a table where a technologist will administer the radiopharmaceutical – most often by injection into an arm vein. Depending upon your procedure, images may be taken by the gamma camera during the injection. For most exams, you must wait for the radioactive material to be distributed to the organ being imaged. Waiting times vary from a few minutes to several hours. If waiting time permits, you may walk around or even leave the imaging center.\nFollowing the required waiting time, you will lie on an imaging table with the camera above and/or below you. The camera may move very slowly around you or remain stationary, depending upon your particular exam. You will be able to speak to the technologist at any time. You may be asked to remain perfectly still for several minutes at a time while the image is recorded.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter your exam, you will be asked to wait 10-15 minutes while the scans are finalized and shown to the Radiologist. As soon as the scans have been reviewed for clarity, you may go home. If additional scans are needed, they will be taken at this time. Unless advised otherwise by your physician, you may resume your normal diet and activities immediately.\nA board-certified radiologist from CRL Imaging will interpret the HIDA scan and relay the findings to the referring physician, who will, in turn, inform you of the results. All written reports will be available to the referring physician within 24 hours. Any time immediate attention is needed; the referring physician will be contacted the day of the exam.","What is a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture (LP) or spinal tap may be done to diagnose or treat a condition. For this procedure, your doctor inserts a hollow needle into the space surrounding the spinal column (subarachnoid space) in the lower back to withdraw some cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or inject medication.\nCSF is a clear fluid that bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord. CSF is continuously made and reabsorbed in the brain.CSF is made up of cells, water, proteins, sugars, and other substances that are essential to maintain balance in the nervous system.\nWhy might I need a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture may be done for various reasons. The most common reason is to remove a small amount of CSF for testing. This can help in the diagnosis of various disorders. The fluid is tested for red and white blood cells, protein, and glucose (sugar). The clarity and color of the fluid are also checked and it is tested to see whether bacteria, viruses, or abnormal cells are present. Excess CSF may also be removed in people who have an overproduction or decreased absorption of the fluid.\nA lumbar puncture procedure may be helpful in diagnosing many diseases and disorders, including:\n- Meningitis. An inflammation of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. The inflammation is usually the result of a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.\n- Encephalitis. An inflammation of the brain that is usually caused by a virus.\n- Certain cancers involving the brain and spinal cord\n- Bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it (subarachnoid space)\n- Reye syndrome. A sometimes fatal disease that causes severe problems with the brain and other organs; Although the exact cause of the disease is not known, it has been linked to giving aspirin to children. It is now advised not to give aspirin to children during illnesses, unless prescribed by your child's doctor.\n- Myelitis. An inflammation of the spinal cord or bone marrow.\n- Neurosyphilis. A stage of syphilis during which the bacteria invades the central nervous system.\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome. A disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system.\n- Demyelinating diseases. Diseases that attack the protective coating that surrounds certain nerve fibers - for example, multiple sclerosis or acute demyelination polyneuropathy.\n- Headaches of unknown cause. After evaluation by a doctor and head imaging if necessary, a lumbar puncture may be done to diagnose certain inflammatory conditions that can result in a headache.\n- Pseudotumor cerebri (also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or IIH). In this condition,pressure within the subarachnoid space is elevated for reasons that are not clear. A lumbar puncture is only done in this condition after evaluation and head imaging.\n- Normal pressure hydrocephalus. A rare condition affecting mainly older people in which there is a triad of loss of urinary control, memory problems, and an unsteady gait. A lumbar puncture is done to see if the pressure of the CSF is elevated or not.\nIn addition, a lumbar puncture may be used to measure the pressure of the CSF. The doctor uses a special tube (called a manometer) to measures the pressure during a lumbar puncture.\nFinally, a lumbar puncture may be done to inject medicine directly into the spinal cord. These include:\n- Spinal anesthetics before a surgical procedure\n- Contrast dye for X-ray studies - for example, myelography\n- Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer\nYour doctor may have other reasons to recommend a lumbar puncture.\nWhat are the risks of a lumbar puncture?\nBecause this procedure involves the spinal cord and brain, the following complications may occur:\n- A small amount of CSF can leak from the needle insertion site. This can cause headaches after the procedure. If the leak continues, your headache can be severe.\n- You may have a slight risk of infection because the needle breaks the skin’s surface, providing a possible way for bacteria to enter the body.\n- You may have temporary pain or numbness of your legs or lower back pain.\n- Bleeding may occur in the spinal canal.\nYou may have other risks, depending on your specific medical condition. Be sure to discuss any concerns with your doctor before the procedure.\nHow do I get ready for a lumbar puncture?\nHow do I prepare for a lumbar puncture?\nCheck with your healthcare provider about what you should do before the procedure. Below is a list of common steps that you may be asked to do:\n- Your doctor will explain the procedure to you. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the procedure.\n- You will be asked to sign a consent form that gives permission to do the procedure. Read the form carefully and ask questions if something is not clear.\n- Generally, you won’t need to fast before a lumbar puncture unless a sedative is prescribed. Follow your doctor’s instructions.\n- Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.\n- Tell your doctor about any medications (prescribed and over-the-counter) and herbal supplements you take.\n- Tell your doctor if you have a history of seizures or if you are taking any prescribed medications for seizures.\n- Tell your doctor if you have a history of bleeding disorders or if you are taking any anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medications, aspirin, or other medications that affect blood clotting. It may be necessary for you to stop these medications prior to the procedure.\n- If the procedure is done on an outpatient basis, you may be asked to remain in the hospital for several hours following the procedure. You should plan to have another person drive you home.\n- Based on your medical condition, your doctor may request other specific preparation.\nWhat happens during a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture procedure may be done on an outpatient basis or as part of your stay in a hospital. Procedures may vary depending on your condition and your doctor's practices.\nGenerally, a lumbar puncture follows this process:\n- You will remove any clothing, jewelry, or other objects that may interfere with the procedure.\n- You will be given a gown to wear.\n- You will be reminded to empty your bladder prior to the start of the procedure.\n- During the lumbar puncture you may lie on the exam table on your side with your chin tucked to your chest and knees tucked to your abdomen. Or, you may sit on the edge of an exam table with your arms draped over a table positioned in front of you. In either position the back is arched, which helps to widen the spaces between your vertebrae.\n- Therefore, your back will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution and draped with sterile towels. The doctor will wear sterile gloves during the procedure.\n- The doctor will numb the skin by injecting a local anesthetic. This injection may sting for a few seconds, but makes the lumbar puncture less painful.\n- The hollow needle will be inserted through the numbed skin and into the space where the CSF is located. You will feel some pressure while the needle is inserted. You must remain absolutely still during the insertion of the needle.\n- The CSF will begin to drip out of the needle and a small amount, about one tablespoon, will be collected into test tubes.\n- If the doctor needs to inject medication into the spinal canal, it will be given through the same needle after the CSF is collected.\n- When the procedure is done, the needle will be removed and a bandage will be placed over the injection site. The test tubes will be taken to the lab for testing.\n- Tell the doctor if you feel any numbness, tingling, headache, or lightheadedness during the procedure.\nYou may have discomfort during a lumbar puncture. Your healthcare providers will use all possible comfort measures and complete the procedure as quickly as possible to minimize any discomfort or pain.\nWhat happens after a lumbar puncture?\nYou usually will be asked to lie flat for about one hour after the lumbar puncture is completed. This helps reduce the incidence of a headache. You will be allowed to roll from side to side as long as your head is not elevated. If you need to urinate, you may need to do so in a bedpan or urinal during the time that you need to stay flat.\nYou will be asked to drink extra fluids to rehydrate after the procedure. This replaces the CSF that was withdrawn during the spinal tap and reduces the chance of developing a headache.\nAfter recovery, you may be taken to your hospital room or discharged to your home. If you go home, usually your doctor will advise you to only engage in very light activity the rest of the day.\nOnce you are at home, notify your doctor of any abnormalities, such as:\n- Numbness and tingling of the legs\n- Drainage of blood or pain at the injection site\n- Inability to urinate\nIf the headaches persist for more than a few hours after the procedure, or when you change positions, you should contact your doctor.\nYou may be instructed to limit your activity for 24 hours following the procedure. Generally, if no complications occur, you may return to your normal diet and activities.\nYour health care provider may give you other specific instructions about what you should do after a lumbar puncture.\nBefore you agree to the test or the procedure make sure you know:\n- The name of the test or procedure\n- The reason you are having the test or procedure\n- The risks and benefits of the test or procedure\n- When and where you are to have the test or procedure and who will do it\n- When and how will you get the results\n- How much will you have to pay for the test or procedure\nOnline Medical Reviewer:\nNelson, Gail A., MS, APRN, BC\nOnline Medical Reviewer:\nWeisbart, Ed, M.D.\nLast Review Date:\n© 2000-2015 The StayWell Company, LLC. 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067.

{"question":"Which artist, Christina Roe or Debra Fritts, draws more inspiration from natural landscapes para sus obras artísticas?","answer":"Both artists draw inspiration from nature, but in different ways. Christina Roe draws inspiration directly from natural landscapes, being originally from Kodiak, Alaska, and focuses on formal concepts like line quality, space, and texture. Debra Fritts, while also nature-inspired, focuses more on allowing the earth to feed her information for her art, working with wet red clay and exploring her environment in Abiquiu, New Mexico. Her work incorporates natural elements while telling stories of daily life and events.","context":["A “Transposition” of mixed media sculpture, prints & drawings\nThe Nightingale Gallery at EOU announces “Transposition,” a senior capstone group exhibition featuring work by James Long, Christina Roe and Henrik Soerensen.\nThe show will open with a reception for the artists at 6 p.m. April 5 and continue through April 19. Works in mixed media, prints and drawings will be on display.\n“The Other Man” by James Long, graphite on paper, 13” x 13” (2013).\nJames Long is a non-traditional student who began his academic career at Boise State University in 1995. Though he also enjoys painting and digital media, his true passion is drawing with graphite on paper. Many of his conceptual influences involve familial heritage, cultural identity and societal institutions.\nThe body of work Long will be showing began as collages of 19th and 20th century photographs. Through a process of positioning selected elements of two or more photos, such as a daredevil perched at the top of an urban high rise and a sober-faced immigrant, Long is able to craft new situations which explore facets of human nature including hope, disappointment, jealousy and tenacity. Through the black and white of graphite and paper, he presents contrasting subject matter both literally and figuratively.\nUntitled by Christina Roe, print, 22.5” x 30” (2013).\nChristina Roe is originally from Kodiak, Alaska, and she draws much of her inspiration from the natural landscape. Though well-trained in representational art, her new body of work focuses mainly on formal concepts of line quality, space and texture.\nRoe’s work explores intangible ideas of time and thought through non-traditional drawing. Instead of providing a visual representation of these concepts, her drawings seek to capture their reflections in a physical, tangible way. Through materials such as thread and string, chosen specifically for the line quality they possess, she is able to draw images onto a grounded surface, which evolve into their own environments and ask viewers to question reality and perception.\n“Dust Collector” by Henrik Soerensen, 78” x 32” x 26”, granite, wood, wool blanket, scythe handle, bronze, vacuum, paint and rag (2012).\nHenrik Soerensen grew up in Denmark and is currently making work that is inspired by and questions our culturally-formed patterns. Soerensen concentrates on sculpture and his work satisfies, as well as questions, his fascination with the crafted object. He is especially interested in how a particular color or found object can present a narrative possibility or an altered perception of everyday life.\nHis fascination with the process of making, along with a background as a professional chef, fosters his interest in the universal function of objects across cultures. His sculptural installations include the use of found objects combined with painstakingly crafted elements of various materials composed in ambiguous compositions.\n“Despite the wide range of media used by Long, Roe and Soerensen, there is a certain chaos that all three artists rely upon in their respective processes,” said Cory Peeke, Nightingale Gallery director. “As a cohesive whole, ‘Transposition’ illustrates through both 2D and 3D space how the positioning of disparate elements, shapes, or concepts impacts the relevance of an idea.”\nNightingale Gallery is located in Loso Hall.

The stitching has grown out of the ancient art of patterning cloth for kimono, and most names reference the original stitches, even though I’ve transformed those stitches over time. The “Ori-Kume” series combines ori-nui, stitches done on the fold with mokume running stitches. “Ori-maki-kume” describes a combination of mokume running stitches and ori-maki-nui stitches, an original hybrid stitch that creates a density I’ve grown to love...Cloth challenges notions of traditional art. At the same time, fabric is universally accessible and comforting. I’m particularly attracted to dichotomies, to yin/yang, attraction/repulsion, black/white, and the vastness of the gray area in between. All my work begins with a drawing, a plan. But the surprises that develop along the way delight and challenge me. These surprises inform future works.\"\nCavanaugh works by hand with cloth, cord, dye, paint and occasionally wood and wire. She does this by hand and without assistants.

Today I continue to allow the earth to feed me information for my art. Working intuitively from pounds of wet red clay, forms appear and stories develop. I may be questioning an occurrence or celebrating a relationship or just being aware of the precious environment. The search continues until I reach the core: the spiritual level of the sculpture. Then the work can speak. At the present, I am exploring new territory in Abiquiu, New Mexico while embracing my southern heritage. Often symbols are used in the work such as the color red or three dots to honor my mother or the raven as a symbol for my new life in the west. I am “touching ground”, getting to the basics, listening and learning. Each sculpture is hand built, using thick coils, and fired three to five times depending on the color and surface I am trying to achieve. I approach the color on the clay as a painter. My palette is a combination of oxides, slips, underglazes, and glazes. The form of the piece informs the type of surface treatment.\"\nDebra Fritts considers herself a narrative artist allowing her work to tell stories of daily life and events. Her works are influenced by her time in New Mexico exploring the west while embracing her southern heritage.\n“I hand build each sculpture, primarily using thick coils, and fire three to five times depending on the color and surface I am trying to achieve. I approach color on clay as a painter. My palette is a combination of oxides, slips, underglazes, and glazes. The form of the piece informs how I should approach the surface.”\nDebra has been published in books such as: Artists Homes and Studios, Ashley Rooney, Schiffer Publishing. Contemporary Ceramics, E.

Professional and Teaching Experience includes Director of Art Center West, Roswell, Georgia 1995-2011, Beatrice Wood Center, workshop, Ojai, California, and Surface National Clay Conference, San Diego, California.\n\"The work I am engaged in stems from a deep-rooted connection to natural objects and environmental issues while examining the relationship between man and nature. Reverential attitudes and nurturing acts contrast with the destruction of nature. The pod forms I use are both a type of shroud for natural relics and a womb or cradle for rebirth. This dichotomy of ideas is further expressed by the mending of natural objects through the violent act of stitching and fastening parts together. I find it fascinating and somewhat meditative to achieve a whole through the slow and gradual building up of small elements. Weaving is based on this principle and my drawing technique mirrors this idea as I layer graphite and colored pencil to create the image. Even the fibers in my handmade paper echo the idea of small units building to become a whole. Manipulation of materials and the use of traditional techniques in surprising or nontraditional ways are challenging and engage me in problem solving. The engineering necessary to create a three-dimensional piece on a loom intended for two-dimensional processes and the use of soft materials to form substantial objects is of particular interest. As I continue to explore natural relics as icons, votives, or objects of reverence, I hope to engage the viewer in a way of seeing that may lead to a respect and appreciation for the environment.

{"question":"Who faced more severe consequences for challenging religious authorities - Lorenzo Valla who exposed the Donation of Constantine forgery or Galileo Galilei who defended the Copernican theory?","answer":"Galileo Galilei faced more severe consequences. While Lorenzo Valla successfully exposed the Donation of Constantine as a forgery through philological study in 1439-1440 without facing persecution, Galileo was forbidden by the Church to hold or defend the Copernican doctrine of Earth's motion, was denounced to the Inquisition, and in 1633 was forced to 'abjure, curse and detest' his views. He remained under surveillance in Rome until his death.","context":["The Donation of Constantine (Latin: Donatio Constantini) is a forged Roman imperial decree by which the 4th-century emperor Constantine the Great supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope. Composed probably in the 8th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy. In many of the existing manuscripts (handwritten copies of the document), including the oldest one, the document bears the title Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris. The Donation of Constantine was included in the 9th-century collection Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals.\nLorenzo Valla, an Italian Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist, is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid philological arguments in 1439–1440, although the document's authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001.\n|Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|\n|Part of a series on the|\n|Canon law of the|\nThe text is purportedly a decree of Roman Emperor Constantine I, dated 30 March—a year mistakenly said to be both that of his fourth consulate (315) and that of the consulate of Gallicanus (317). In it \"Constantine\" professes Christianity (confessio) and entitles to Pope Sylvester several imperial insignia and privileges (donatio), as well as the Lateran Palace. Rome, the rest of Italy, and the western provinces of the empire are made over to the papacy.\nThe text recounts a narrative founded on the 5th-century hagiography the Acts of Sylvester. This fictitious tale describes the sainted Pope Sylvester's rescue of the Romans from the depredations of a local dragon and the pontiff's miraculous cure of the emperor's leprosy by the sacrament of baptism. The story was rehearsed by the Liber Pontificalis; by the later 8th century the dragon-slayer Sylvester and his apostolic successors were rewarded in the Donation of Constantine with temporal powers never in fact exercised by the historical Bishops of Rome under Constantine.\nIn his gratitude, \"Constantine\" determined to bestow on the seat of Peter \"power, and dignity of glory, vigor, and imperial honor,\" and \"supremacy as well over the four principal sees: Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, as also over all the churches of God in the whole earth\". For the upkeep of the church of Saint Peter and that of Saint Paul, he gave landed estates \"in Judea, Greece, Asia, Thrace, Africa, Italy and the various islands\". To Sylvester and his successors he also granted imperial insignia, the tiara, and \"the city of Rome, and all the provinces, places and cities of Italy and the western regions\".\nThe Donation sought reduction in the authority of Constantinople; if Constantine had elevated Sylvester to imperial rank before the 330 inauguration of Constantinople, then Rome's patriarch had a lead of some fifteen years in the contest for primacy among the patriarchates. Implicitly, the papacy asserted its supremacy and prerogative to transfer the imperial seat; the papacy had consented to the translatio imperii to Byzantium by Constantine and it could wrest back the authority at will.\nIt has been suggested that an early draft of the Donation of Constantine was made shortly after the middle of the 8th century, in order to assist Pope Stephen II in his negotiations with Pepin the Short, who then held the position of Mayor of the Palace (i.e., the manager of the household of the Frankish king). In 754, Pope Stephen II crossed the Alps to anoint Pepin king, thereby enabling the Carolingian family to supplant the old Merovingian royal line. In return for Stephen's support, Pepin gave the pope the lands in Italy which the Lombards had taken from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. It is also possible it originated in the chancery of Stephen's immediate successor Paul I. These lands would become the Papal States and would be the basis of the papacy's temporal power for the next eleven centuries.\nAnother interpretation holds that the Donation was not an official forgery directed at Constantinople, but was instead a ploy in Roman ecclesiastical politics to bolster the status of the Lateran, which does have historical Constantinian connections, against the rising status of the Vatican, and it may have been composed by a Greek monk working in a Roman monastery. In one study, an attempt was made at dating the forgery to the 9th century, and placing its composition at Corbie Abbey, in northern France.\nGerman medievalist Johannes Fried draws a distinction between the Donation of Constantine and an earlier, also forged version, the Constitutum Constantini, which was included in the collection of forged documents, the False Decretals, compiled in the later half of the ninth century. Fried argues the Donation is a later expansion of the much shorter Constitutum. Christopher B. Coleman understands the mention in the Constitutum of a donation of \"the western regions\" to refer to the regions of Lombardia, Veneto, and Istria.\nWhat may perhaps be the earliest known allusion to the Donation is in a letter of 778, in which Pope Hadrian I exhorts Charlemagne – whose father, Pepin the Short, had made the Donation of Pepin granting the Popes sovereignty over the Papal States – to follow Constantine's example and endow the Roman Catholic church. Otto III's chancery denied its authenticity.\nThe first pope to directly invoke the decree was Pope Leo IX, in a letter sent in 1054 to Michael I Cerularius, Patriarch of Constantinople. He cited a large portion of the document, believing it genuine, furthering the debate that would ultimately lead to the East–West Schism. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Donation was often cited in the investiture conflicts between the papacy and the secular powers in the West.\nThe document's contents contradicted the Byzantines' notion that Constantine's translatio imperii transferred the seat of imperial authority from Rome to his foundation of Constantinople, named the \"New Rome\". Consequently, the Donation featured in the east–west dispute over ecclesiastical primacy between the patriarchal sees of Rome and New Rome. Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida also issued a version of the document to support the papacy's claims against the eastern emperors' and patriarchs' primacy.\nBy the 12th century the text existed in Greek translation, of which a 14th-century manuscript survives, and Byzantine writers were also using the Donation in their polemics; John Kinnamos, writing in the reign of eastern emperor Manuel I Komnenos, criticized western Staufer emperors as usurpers and denied the popes had the right to bestow the imperial office. Theodore Balsamon justified Michael Cerularius's behaviour in 1054 using the Donation as a rationale for his dismissal of the papal legation and the mutual excommunications that followed.\nIn 1248, the Chapel of St Sylvester in the Basilica of the Santi Quattro Coronati was decorated with fresco showing the story of the Roman baptism and Donation of Constantine.\nIn his Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century, the poet Dante Alighieri wrote:\nAhi, Costantin, di quanto mal fu matre,\nnon la tua conversion, ma quella dote\nche da te prese il primo ricco patre!\n(Ah, Constantine, how much evil was born,\nnot from your conversion, but from that donation\nthat the first wealthy Pope received from you!)— Dante Alighieri, Inferno, canto 19, lines 115–117.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Donation was widely accepted as authentic, although Holy Roman Emperor Otto III did possibly raise suspicions of the document \"in letters of gold\" as a forgery, in making a gift to the See of Rome. It was not until the mid-15th century, with the revival of Classical scholarship and textual criticism, that humanists, and eventually the papal bureaucracy, began to realize that the document could not possibly be genuine. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa declared it to be a forgery and spoke of it as an apocryphal work.\nLater, the Catholic priest Lorenzo Valla argued in his philological study of the text that the language used in manuscript could not be dated to the 4th century. The language of the text suggests that the manuscript can most likely be dated to the 8th century. Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he suspected that the Church knew the document to be inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the \"overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination.\"\nThis was the first instance of modern, scientific diplomatics. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, Reginald Pecocke, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation must be a fake are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as \"fief\" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317).\nPope Pius II wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming pope, to show that though the Donation was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to Charlemagne and its powers of the keys to Peter; however, he did not publish it.\nContemporary opponents of papal powers in Italy emphasized the primacy of civil law and civil jurisdiction, now firmly embodied once again in the Justinian Corpus Juris Civilis. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Cavalcanti reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward Cosimo de' Medici in Florence, proposing an alliance against the pope. In reference to the Donation, Visconti wrote: \"It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts – which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found – he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the empire takes precedence over any lordship.\"\nLater, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. Wolfram Setz, a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged \"donation\" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in political theory and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.\nThe bulls of Nicholas V and his successors made no further mention of the Donation, even when partitioning the New World, though the doctrine of \"omni-insular\" papal fiefdoms, developed out of the Donation's vague references to islands since Pope Nicholas II's grant of Sicily to Robert Guiscard, was deployed after 1492 in papal pronouncements on the overlapping claims of the Iberian kingdoms in the Americas and Moluccas, including Inter caetera, a bull that resulted in the Treaty of Tordesillas and the Treaty of Zaragoza. Valla's treatise was taken up vehemently by writers of the Protestant Reformation, such as Ulrich von Hutten and Martin Luther, causing the treatise to be placed on the index of banned books in the mid-16th century.\nThe Donation continued to be tacitly accepted as authentic until Caesar Baronius in his Annales Ecclesiastici (published 1588–1607) admitted that it was a forgery, after which it was almost universally accepted as such. Some continued to argue for its authenticity; nearly a century after Annales Ecclesiastici, Christian Wolff still alluded to the Donation as undisputed fact.\n((cite book)): CS1 maint: uses authors parameter (link)","Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) [See biography] studied at the University of Cracow in Poland, and at Bologna and Padua in Italy. He became a canon at Frauenberg Cathedral. During his time in Italy he was assistant to astronomer Domenico Novarra of Ferrara (1454-1504), and made astronomical observations. Copernicus was aware that measurements of the movements of the planets revealed discrepancies in the Ptolemic theory. These were usually explained away by postulating fixes called deferents and epicycles, but the accumulation of \"fixes\" tended to make the Ptolemaic scheme very complicated. Copernicus discovered, perhaps influenced by his reading of ancient Greek manuscripts that mentioned the heliocentric views of Aristarchius and others, that supposing the sun was the center of the planetary motions could make things much simpler. His ideas were summarized in a manuscript circulated in 1530 called the Commentariolus.\nOver the next 13 years he developed his heliocentric theory, culminating in De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, published in 1543. He produced clear arguments against the geocentric view of the universe. His system retained the rigid firmament of the stars, and circular movements for the planets.\n[See Copernican System.]\nIn 1576 Thomas Digges (1546-1595) contributed a supplement containing sections of Book 1 of De Revolutionibus by Copernicus translated into English, in a posthumous edition of his father Leonard Digges's book, Prognostication euerlasting. The universe was described as extending infinitely. Thomas suggested the resulting astronomical system was more than just a mathematical hypothesis, but was \"a Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes.\" He sought to have these ideas tested by experiment and observation. Copernicus had mentioned the idea of infinite space but did not commit himself to it. His diagram of the heliocentric system showed the firmament as the sphere of the fixed stars, which he thought was large enough to account for the absence of stellar parallax.\nFrances R. Johnson wrote that Thomas Digges\n...clearly perceived that, the moment the rotation of the earth was conceded, there was no longer any necessity for picturing the stars as attached to a huge, rotating sphere at a definite distance from the earth... Digges had the courage to break completely with the older cosmologies by shattering the finite outer wall of the universe. He was the first modern astronomer of note to portray an infinite, heliocentric universe, with the stars scattered at varying distances throughout infinite space.\nSimilar views were held by Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) [See biography]. Bruno was in constant conflict with traditional doctrines. His book On the Infinite Universe and Worlds, in which he argued that there are many other inhabited worlds, was published in 1584. Bruno believed that man's perception of the world is relative to the position in space and time from which he views it, and so, there are as many possible modes of viewing the world as there are possible positions. He was tried for heresy by the Inquisition in 1591, and after being imprisoned in Rome, he was burnt to death in 1600.\nDigges apparently experimented with an early telescope. He as well as Tycho Brahe unsuccessfully attempted to detect parallax of a supernova which appeared in 1572. Sawyer Hogg stated:\nIt is one of the ironies of early science that they selected a star of the highest possible absolute magnitude, a supernova, hence the one kind of star visible to the ends of the universe, and therefore on the average having the smallest parallactic shift of any! Even with our modern instruments we could not measure a direct trigonometric parallax for this star.\nTycho Brahe (1546-1601) [See biography] devoted himself to astronomical observation after noticing a new star, a supernova, in 1572. He made observations of stars at his observatory, Uraniburg, which was financed for him by King Frederick II of Denmark. His theology did not permit him to adopt the Copernican theory, and instead he developed the theory which was part geocentric, part heliocentric. The planets revolved around the sun, but the sun and the firmament revolved around the earth.\nGalileo Galilei (1564-1642) [See biography] constructed a telescope, and turned it towards the sky. He discovered four satellites of Jupiter, and interpreted them as evidence in favour of the Copernican theory. He observed sunspots, and mountains on the surface of the moon, and many new stars. He published his discoveries, creating great interest in science. He provoked controversy when he ventured to express his views on the relation between science and scripture in his Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina in 1615. The Church reacted by placing the De Revolutionibus of Copernicus on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1616. Galileo was forbidden to hold or defend the doctrine of the motion of the earth. In 1632 Galileo published his Dialogue on the Two Principal Systems of the World, which his adversaries viewed as supporting the Copernican theory. He was denounced to the Inquisition and forced to \"abjure, curse and detest\" his heresy concerning the motion of the earth in 1633. He was kept under surveillance at Rome till his death.\nFor a Catholic view, see: The Galileo Affair.\nPaolo Antonio Foscarini (1565-1616) [See biography] founded of a Carmelite monastery at Montalto in Southern Italy. Foscarini was a mathematician, and a teacher of philosophy, as well as a theologian. In Naples in 1615 he published a \"Letter concerning the Opinion of the Pythagoreans and Copernicus about the Mobility of the Earth and Stability of the Sun, and about the New Pythagorean System of the World\", declaring the heliocentric theory to be true. It was dedicated to the General of the Carmelite Order. Foscarini then went to Rome to defend the Copernican theory against charges that it was in conflict with scripture. Christoph Clavius, leading Jesuit mathematician from 1570 to 1612, had argued against the heliocentric theory from the Bible in his astronomy textbook. Foscarini's work was placed on the Index in 1616, and he died shortly afterwards.\nJohannes Kepler (1571-1630) [See biography] used the observations of Tycho Brahe to investigate the orbit of the planet Mars. His three laws of planetary motion initiated a new kind of astronomy. The first law stated that the motions of planets are not circular but elliptical with the sun at one focus. The second law stated that the straight line between the planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. These two laws were published in Astronomia Nova in 1609. The third law, that the squares of the periods of revolution of the planets are related to one another as the cubes of the major axes of their orbits, was published in 1619 in Harmonices Mundi. Kepler doubted that planetary spheres existed. He calculated the distance of the firmament to be four million sun diameters, which was 2,000 times greater than Ptolemy's universe. Its thickness he estimated as nine English miles, which meant the stars contained in it would be quite small. Kepler supposed the masses of the firmament, the sun, and the ether were equal, and they were the three symbols of the Holy Trinity.\nThe development of the modern concept of universal gravitation, first proposed by Gilles de Roberval (1602-1675), the suggestion by Alphonse Borelli in 1665 that the planets would fall into the sun if they were not counterbalanced by a centrifugal effect, like a stone in a sling, the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia in 1687, and other developments eventually made the idea of a rigid, rotating heavenly firmament obsolete. But the scriptures that seemed to support this idea had to be explained. Theologians began to say that the word firmament could mean \"expanse\" from the concept of expanding a piece of metal by beating it flat with a hammer. The word \"expanse\" seemed to apply to the atmosphere, as well as to space beyond. Clouds carried water in vapor form, and so could be identified with the \"waters above the firmament.\" The idea that the firmament could refer to the air might be derived from the statement in Genesis 1:20 that birds fly in the firmament. The identification of the firmament with the air was suggested in the writings of Augustine, as Joachim Rheticus pointed out in a tract on scripture and the motion of the earth written about the year 1543 [Hooykaas, p. 89]:\nSt. Augustine, in spite of the fact that the Scripture appears clearly to teach what should be understood by \"firmament\" in the work of the fourth day, yet has praise for him who, because of the authority of Scripture, has managed to find an interpretation about the waters above the firmament both plausible and acceptable to the senses; namely that the clouds in the air should be called waters, - which they are potentially - and the space between us and them \"the firmament,\" since in the Scriptures the air is often called \"heaven.\"\nJohn Calvin's Commentary on Genesis supported this interpretation. Readers who would like to translate the Hebrew word raqia as \"expanse\" should be aware that for many centuries the word was understood to mean something solid. If this is ignored, the writings and beliefs of early theologians and astronomers become incomprehensible, and much of the symbolic meaning of medieval art, architecture and literature is lost. The Church's commitment to the concept of a rigid firmament in the sky was demonstrated and reinforced by the tradition of incorporating elaborate domes and arches in prominent buildings. Medieval paintings generally featured the firmament in a background arc or border, beyond which God and the angels dwelt.\nIn the eighteenth century Isaac Newton's theory was gradually accepted by scholars, especially in the English speaking world, in spite of initial severe criticisms from Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) [See biography] and German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716). [See biography]. The competing philosophy of Rene Descartes (1596-1650) [See biography], which invoked vortices of matter to account for the planetary movements, remained popular in France. In Germany, Leibnitz argued that Newton's force of gravity was an occult quality.\n[See Newton's biography.]\n[See also Newtonia.]\nFrench philosopher Francios Marie Arounet, better known as Voltaire (1694-1778) [See biography], the arch enemy of intolerance in the Catholic Church, and all forms of superstition, popularized Newton's discoveries in France. Elements of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy, dedicated to Emilie de Breteuil, Marquise du Chastelet (1706-1749) [See biography] was an English translation of Voltaire's work. Both French and English editions were published in 1738. Voltaire thought Newton's discoveries were too important to remain in obscurity. He wrote: \"Newton's Philosophy has hitherto seemed to many as unintelligible as that of the Ancients; but the darkness of the Greeks proceeded from their having in reality no light at all, while that of Newton arises from his light's being too remote from our eyes. He has discovered truths; but he has searched for, and placed them in an abyss, into which it is necessary to descend, in order to bring them out, and to place them in full light.\" The story of Newton contemplating the falling apple is due to Voltaire. Emilie, who was a competent mathematician, translated Newton's Principia into French. The work was published posthumously in 1759.\nAbout this time, Mikhail Lomonosov, who had studied at Freiberg, first introduced the Copernican theory at the Academy in St. Petersburg in Russia. James Ferguson published Astronomy Explained by Sir Isaac Newton's Principles in 1756. He claimed astronomy provided strong evidence of creation, because the mechanical principles which governed the universe showed it could not be eternal. The return of a great comet in 1758 as predicted by astronomer Edmund Halley (1656-1742) [See biography] on the basis of Newton's theory gave the final confirmation to the new science. It was Halley who financed the publication of the original edition of Newton's Principia.\nMusician William Herschel (1738-1822) [See biography] of Hanover migrated to England in 1757, having fled from the French occupation, and became interested in astronomy. His improved telescope and diligent observations led to the discovery of the planet Uranus in 1781. He demonstrated the sun's motion through space, and discovered over 800 multiple stars, and more than 2,500 nebulae and star clusters in his lifetime."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9da42abd-3722-47db-aacf-daf7751e6570>","<urn:uuid:c4611b68-0854-45b1-97a3-f620c3b9a506>"],"error":null}

What makes them such effective predators?","answer":"Peregrine falcons are incredibly effective predators due to their exceptional speed, reaching over 200 mph in stoop dives to hunt prey. They are equipped with sharp talons and keen eyesight, making them excellent hunters. These falcons hunt various birds and small mammals, such as mice and squirrels. They're also known as the fastest animal on Earth and have earned the nickname 'wanderer' due to their long migratory flights.","context":["Did you know that golden eagles can be found gliding through the skies of Nevada?\nGolden eagles hold their powerful wings in a V formation, allowing them to soar at speeds of 28 to 32 mph. They can reach up to 120 mph when on the hunt and dive at an astonishing rate of up to 200 mph. Imagine being able to move that quickly!\nAlongside the golden eagle is a host of other fast creatures in Nevada. Some you probably never even thought about as being quick. These incredible creatures have adapted to their environment by being able to outrun predators, escape danger, and survive in a challenging habitat.\nFollow along as we look at some of the fastest animals in Nevada.\nThe pronghorn is the fastest land mammal in North America and can run up to 60 mph, making them one of the fastest animals in Nevada. They got their name from their horns — which point backward towards their rump and then “prong.”\nThese ungulates have specially adapted muscles designed for explosive bursts of energy that help power their impressive speed. On top of that, their body temperature runs relatively high at 100 degrees Fahrenheit!\nThese creatures are usually 4 to 5 feet long from nose to tail and stand about 3.5 feet tall at the shoulder. Males weigh a bit more than females, with males typically heading up to 145 pounds and females up to 85 pounds.\nPronghorns can run at speeds of up to 60 mph for distances when something’s chasing them. At a normal running pace, they’ll reach speeds of 40 mph due to their unique strides. These speedsters have different ways of walking that help them cover as much as 20 feet per step! To protect themselves against uneven ground or firm surfaces, pronghorns have pointed and padded double hooves.\nUnfortunately, rising traffic levels could pose a threat to this species’ well-being. Studies show they might see roads as a risk, causing them to socialize less. The best solution will be traffic plans that take into account this animal’s need to roam.\nJackrabbits can reach up to 40 mph! They have incredibly long back legs with powerful muscles that allow them to make tremendous leaps. Their jumping skills help them to evade predators more quickly than other species.\nDid you know that the white-tailed jackrabbit is not actually a rabbit but a hare? This species is the largest of all the hares in Nevada, and they have some pretty unique characteristics. They have long ears and legs, giving them a dusky gray color with a white tail, which turns completely white in winter!\nYou can find these fast jackrabbits in various habitats across North America. These include open grasslands, pastures and fields, forested areas, and high alpine tundra. This speedy hare is a strict herbivore and feeds primarily on green plants and flowers during summer. Jackrabbits are also nocturnal, meaning it is most active at night. During the day, they rest in shallow depressions in the ground called “forms.”\nThe peregrine falcon is an awe-inspiring bird of prey. It is the fastest animal on Earth, capable of reaching speeds over 200 mph in stoop dives to hunt its prey! Its sharp talons and keen eyesight make it an excellent hunter. Nicknamed the “wanderer,” the peregrine falcon is known for its long migratory flights. They’re the ultimate endurance flyer.\nWhat does this fast falcon eat to stay energized? Their diet consists of various other birds and small mammals, such as mice and squirrels.\nhis fast bird is a global species, present on all continents except Antarctica. In Nevada and other urban areas, they take advantage of tall buildings to make their nests, allowing them to become beloved local celebrities.\nCoyotes can run a jaw-dropping 43 mph! That’s why they earned a spot on our list of the fastest animals in Nevada. Along with being fast, coyotes also have a reputation for being adaptable and smart. They can adapt to almost any habitat, making them comfortable in urban and wild settings.\nCoyotes are incredibly adaptable in their diet too. Opportunistic omnivores can eat various foods depending on what is available. Primarily, their diet consists of smaller animals like cottontail rabbits and ground squirrels — but they will also scavenge for carrion, grasses, fruits, seeds, and insects. No matter the circumstance or availability of food sources, these resilient animals always find a way to survive! And they do it as a team.\nBelieve it or not, coyotes are highly social creatures who often live in packs with dominant alpha males and females. Only the alphas reproduce the pack during the breeding season from January to March. The other pack members take on the important task of defending their territory.\nBig Brown Bat\nThe big brown bat is one of the fastest flying mammals in Nevada, reaching up to 40 mph. Bats use their wings as “sails” that help propel them forward at incredible speeds. They zig-zag around branches and trees on their way!\nThe big brown bat is another endurance flyer. Once a bat starts to fly, they never stop. When they want to drink, bats find a body of water, open their mouths, and swoop down for a sip! When they want to eat, these creatures use echolocation to find their way and hunt their prey.\nIn addition to being essential pollinators, they are also great indicator species since they need particular habitats to survive. For example, they require humid air with trees or other tall structures near water to roost and feed.\nThey can also live in large colonies, with as many as 400 bats living in one place! They typically perch during the day hanging upside down and then emerge at dusk each night to start hunting for food.\nThe desert sidewinder is a small snake native to Nevada that can reach up to 18 mph. These desert dwellers are an incredible species, and it’s no wonder they’ve been able to adapt to such harsh conditions — they’re fast and agile.\nThe sidewinder moves by throwing its body into a series of tight “S” shaped coils, inching forward with each loop. This unique form of locomotion enables the sidewinder to move quickly over sandy surfaces while avoiding predator detection.\nAlso known as the “horned rattlesnake,” sidewinders thrive in the Mojave Desert. Aside from its eye-catching horns and distinctively patterned scales, this species has some unique characteristics that make it particularly interesting!\nFor starters, sidewinders are the fastest-moving rattlesnakes. Secondly, these snakes don’t lay eggs but give birth to live young. Female sidewinders store their eggs inside their bodies until they are ready to hatch. Once hatched, these snakes birth live young — usually in litters of 5 to18!\nLastly, these venomous reptiles use their tails to attract prey. They’ll rattle their tails to spark the curiosity of lizards. When the lizards come by to see what the shaking is all about, the sidewinder will lunge out of the sand and strike!\nMoose are also known as “rubber-nosed swamp donkeys” because they seem not to care about very wet terrain or bogs. They are, however, incredibly fast runners. Moose calves can outrun a human by the time they’re five days old! And if that wasn’t impressive enough, moose can kick in any direction with their front hooves.\nMoose are great swimmers too! They can zoom through the water at up to 6 mph and go for two hours straight without stopping. Even more impressive, there have been reports of a moose swimming an unbelievable 10 miles in one go!\nFor a while, there weren’t many moose in Nevada. But now, the moose population is making a comeback. An estimated 100 live in Nevada, and the numbers are rising. Moose are expanding their territory to Elko and Humboldt counties in Nevada. These habitats provide them with the perfect wet riparian areas, and plenty of aspen and mahogany trees to eat. Some moose have been seen as far south as the Ruby Mountains southeast of Elko.\nDid you know that Nevada is home to a unique species of deer? Mule deer are the only native deer in the state and can easily be identified by their long, mule-like ears. Their coloring varies from light ash gray to dark brown, with a white patch on their throats to complete the look. They’re one of the most common animals in Nevada and can reach up to 40 mph.\nThese deer are fast and hardy. They have a life span of 10-12 years and can weigh over 300 pounds! Male mule deer will sport impressive antlers during the breeding season from late November to mid-December. But even with all that headgear, they can still easily outrun predators. They can even outrun a horse at full force!\nThis four-legged mammal has adapted specialized leg muscles that boost their speed to outrun predators and swiftly maneuver through thickly forested areas. Their legs also help them swim quickly too. However, they rarely use the water as means of escape from predators. Instead, they rely on their swift feet to get them out of danger.\nGreat Horned Owl\nNext on our list of the fastest animals in Nevada, we have the great horned owl. This fast-flying bird of prey can reach speeds of up to 40 mph! They have feathered faces that help reduce wind resistance in flight and large eyes that help them see well at night. Their short but wide wings help them quickly fly through the forest, and their soft feathers allow for silent flying so they can sneak up on unsuspecting prey!\nGreat horned owls’ big eyes and wide pupils give them a strong advantage when hunting. Unlike humans, their eyes don’t move in their sockets. Instead, they can swivel their heads to look in any direction to find a meal.\nThese fast and voracious eaters enjoy a wide variety of prey, from small rodents to skunks and geese. Similarly to other owls, they sometimes swallow their meal in one fell swoop, then regurgitate pellets containing the bones, fur, and other indigestible parts of the meal.\nDespite the name, this bird doesn’t have any horns! The great horned owl gets its name from its distinctive tufts of feathers on its head, known as plumicorns. Scientists may not know why great horned owls have distinctive tufts of feathers on their heads, but there are a few fun theories. These tufts could help identify each other in the forest or blend into the environment and look less like prey. It’s an interesting mystery that has yet to be solved.\nGreat Basin Collared Lizard\nThe Great Basin collared lizard is another one of the fastest animals in Nevada! These little guys can reach speeds of 15 mph. When you add in their impressive bite force, it makes them formidable hunters. Their diet consists mainly of insects, spiders, small mammals, reptiles, and other small animals.\nCommonly known as desert or Mojave black-collared lizards, their range extends from southeastern Oregon to southern Arizona. Collared lizards are known for their bright colors, including shades of yellow, orange, and red. They also have a unique black collar that runs from behind the head to the shoulder region.\nWith the ability to run up to 15 mph, they can easily outrun predators such as foxes, snakes, and birds. Even more impressive is their astounding agility! These lizards can run on two legs! Although they can only go this fast for a short time, it gives them enough time to hide in small spaces.\nWhen seeking shelter, these reptiles prefer sloping rocky areas. Their favorite spots include canyons, rock piles, washes, and slopes. Here, they can bask in the sun while keeping an eye on their surroundings for potential prey and predators.\nDid you know that smaller black bears can run up to 30 mph? That’s pretty fast! They can even do it uphill, downhill, and on level ground. But if a bear puts on too much winter weight, it’ll overheat and tire quickly. So the leaner the bear, the faster the speed.\nBlack bears are the only species of bear found in Nevada. And while they may be named after their color, they come in many shades. A black bear’s coat can range from blonde to brown to cinnamon.\nThese majestic beasts have a keen sense of smell, thanks to their small eyes, rounded ears, and long snouts. This helps them sniff out food items up to miles away! These animals are very determined too. This video of a black bear ripping out a wall to get a meal is a great example.\nBelieve it or not, there are 500 black bears found in the mountainous western part of Nevada. They are part of the Sierra Nevada black bear population, including bears from northern California and southern Oregon! How incredible is that?!\nFinal Thoughts on Fastest Animals in Nevada\nNo matter what time of year it is or what animal you spot in Nevada, one thing’s for sure: speed reigns supreme in the desert. From jackrabbits to mule deer and beyond, these incredible creatures will always leave you in awe of their agility and strength.\nThis state is home to many fast-moving animals that can outrun predators, escape danger, and survive in harsh desert environments. We only had time to name some of the fastest animals in Nevada. So here’s a quick shout-out to the kangaroo rats, wild horses, and the swift fox! If you don’t know what a kangaroo rat is, you owe it to yourself to check out this article.\nFrom fast flyers to speedy slithers, Nevada offers the incredible opportunity to observe some of nature’s speediest species in action. The next time you go exploring, keep your eyes open for these swift creatures! You might catch a glimpse of them as they move through their habitat.\nMore from A-Z Animals\nThe Featured Image\nThank you for reading! Have some feedback for us?

{"question":"What role do exploration and installation stages play in change management, and how does this compare to nonprofit succession planning preparation?","answer":"Exploration and installation stages are crucial initial phases in change management. Exploration involves assessing needs, identifying innovations, and creating readiness, with only 20% of organizations typically ready for change at any given time. Installation focuses on acquiring resources, creating job descriptions, and establishing new protocols. In parallel, nonprofit succession planning requires similar preparatory elements but is largely neglected, with only 17% of nonprofits having succession plans and 45% lacking executive performance reviews. Both processes emphasize the importance of advance preparation - succession planning requires six key attributes including contingency operations plans and strategic human capital development, while implementation stages demand careful resource allocation and stakeholder buy-in to succeed.","context":["As published in The Long Beach Business Journal, Third Sector Report Columnist\nIt’s too bad that whenever the word, “succession,” finds its way into conversations at most nonprofit organizations, most view its utterance as code for someone needs to go.\nWhen an inevitable transition does occur, these same organizations soon discover that having kept succession in the closet ultimately costs their worthy causes significant amounts of time, money and angst.\nWhy Succession Plans Are Crucial\nThe third sector is no different than the other sectors when it comes to human resource matters and leadership. Most transitions in key positions aren’t planned. Messy exits can be a public relations challenge. And, transitions that should have happened earlier, but for personal or political reasons were avoided, creates a domino-effect of other’s choosing to vacate their positions instead.\nWhile nonprofits face other common workforce realities such as a Baby Boomer generation retiring en masse and the difficulty of attracting and keeping up-and-comers, the sector has a couple of quirks that make leadership continuity slightly more complicated: The first is that each of these realities can be applied not only to paid employees, but also to volunteers. The second is that without term limits and a commitment to succession, great causes can easily evolve into family-run businesses disguised as nonprofits.\nAll of these factors sum up to a subject that is emotionally charged and filled with deeply-rooted confusion over what constitutes prudent succession planning for a nonprofit organization.\nReplacing key positions, managing with a leadership void, and curbing high attrition are expensive propositions for any enterprise. For organizations that depend on people’s generosity to survive, however, these are situations that demand pro-active and visible attention.\nMost Nonprofits Lack Adequate Succession Plans\nThe Daring to Lead study released by CompassPoint Nonprofit Services in Oakland dramatically illustrates the current state of the sector when it comes to succession:\n- 17 percent of 3,000 nonprofit organizations indicate having a succession plan\n- 24 percent of nonprofit executives report planning to vacate their positions within two years\n- 45 percent have no executive performance review process to annually discuss succession\nBased on these numbers, there is a significant quantity of important nonprofit organizations whose futures are at risk. Sadly, most of them have little idea how large the risk is because succession has been considered an unmentionable in their cultures.\nFor those who have believed that investing time and money in leadership development, retention and succession will hurt a nonprofit’s overhead calculations, the Daring to Lead numbers suggest that the day in court is nigh. The costs of sloppy human resource practices, poorly managed executive exits, replacing avoidable vacancies, and a lack of competent future board leadership creates a tab that is going to difficult to prove as circumstantial. The sum of these costs will be even more difficult defend as responsible fiduciary oversight in the name of charity.\nSuccession, like fundraising, is an integral piece of a successful nonprofit’s organizational culture. Both subjects are forms of resource development that are equally vital for fueling its future.\nSix Crucial Attributes of a Successful Succession Plan\nCultures that value succession have six distinct attributes. The first is operating with a common understanding that succession is about ongoing efforts to assure a continuity of good leadership is in place for the organization. It is not about naming an heir-apparent or planning one person’s transition.\nThe second attribute is completing a contingency operations plan every year and creating a warehouse of vital organizational information should a key position become vacant for any reason. The third attribute is a series of board-approved succession policies which mandates such things as performance reviews, term limits, human resource procedures, and nominations.\nDemonstrated competencies in basic human resources is the critical fourth attribute. The fifth is completing and managing from a strategic plan that pays as much attention to developing human capital as it does to developing financial capital for creating its future. And, the final attribute is assigning the task of succession to key people as part of their job responsibilities and performance objectives.\nFor me, nonprofit leadership succession has become an obsession. Perhaps I’ve stood on the curb for too many years watching people confuse or avoid the subject and declining to get on the succession planning bus. It’s painful to witness so many great executives, boards and organizations now at significant risk of being hit by it.\nImage courtesy of pexels.com.","Implementation is a process, not an event. The process is marked by implementation stages that have been identified in practice. To use innovations and Active Implementation in practice takes time and effort. Exploration, Installation, Initial Implementation, and Full Implementation Stages guide organization and system investments in innovations supported by implementation best practices.\nThe Stages of Implementation are Exploration, Installation, Initial Implementation, and Full Implementation. The availability of a skilled Implementation Team facilitates the expeditious movement from Exploration to Full Implementation. Without an Implementation Team, organizations and individuals will struggle with what should be predictable issues as well as the many unpredictable issues that always arise as attempts are made to use an innovation in practice. The issues will be there with or without an Implementation Team. The question is, who will resolve stage-based issues effectively and efficiently?\nThe stages of implementation are not linear. They are additive and interactive with movement back and forth with changes in environments, people, and implementation supports. The stages are specific to an innovation. A given organization might be in the Full Implementation Stage with one innovation and in the Exploration Stage with another. With experience, skilled Implementation Teams can anticipate and prevent issues and help move an innovation to Full Implementation more quickly across innovations within an organization and across organizations. And, organizations can learn to learn (develop “absorptive capacity”) and improve their ability to identify, assimilate, and apply innovations more quickly (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Jiménez-Barrionuevo, García-Morales, & Molina, 2011). For example, in the Teaching-Family Model the time for whole organizations to reach site certification (organization fidelity) criteria was reduced substantially while success improved. For Teaching-Family group homes, 23% sustained for 5 years or more without the support of an Implementation Team and 84% sustained for 6 years or more with the support of a site-based Implementation Team. And, the time to develop site based Implementation Teams was reduced from 6.4 to 3.7 years as site development processes were operationalized (Fixsen & Blase, 2018; Fixsen, Blase, Timbers, & Wolf, 2007). Learning to learn produces substantial increases in benefits to a recipient population. As the site development Implementation Teams gained experience, they were able to anticipate problems and do better Exploration and Installation work with organizations to help them be successful more quickly and with more certainty.\nThe stages of implementation outlined here are descriptive rather than prescriptive. By describing identifiable stages, Implementation Teams and others can adjust their inputs to match the stage for achieving full, effective, and sustained use of an innovation. Too often, precious time and resources are wasted on trying to insist that organizations and practitioners use an innovation when they have not yet decided it is a good idea (Romney, Israel, & Zlatevski, 2014). Poorly-informed or half-hearted attempts to appear to do what is mandated consume enormous resources and yield few socially significant outcomes.\nExploration Stage activities include shared communication about the strengths and needs of recipients, identification of possible effective innovations that might help fill the gaps in current approaches, assessment of the Implementation Drivers needed to support practitioners and others, discussion of resources required and their sources, and so on. Exploration activities include executive leadership and stakeholders who consider need, risks and risk management, and contextual factors. The result of Exploration is a common understanding and acceptance of the innovation and the required implementation supports, and a collective decision to proceed (i.e. mutually informed agreement).\nThe Exploration Stage is not just to assess readiness; it also involves creating readiness. Creating readiness for change in individuals and organizations is an important part of the work and effectiveness of Implementation Teams. Prochaska, Prochaska, and Levesque (2001) found that at a given point in time about 20% of individuals and organizations in their studies were “ready for change.” Thus, creating readiness is an essential function for uses of effective innovations and a core activity in the Exploration Stage. Clarifying goals, establishing collaborations, locating and developing resources, securing agreements, and so on are good uses of Exploration Stage discussions.\nThe functions of the Exploration Stage are a critical starting place for work with organizations, systems, and others. Taking the time for Exploration saves time and money (Romney, 2011) and improves the chances for success (Saldana, Chamberlain, Wang, & Brown, 2011; Slavin, Madden, Chamberlain, & Cheung, 2010).\nThe function of the Installation Stage is to acquire or repurpose the resources needed to fully and effectively engage in the new ways of work. Resources and activities during Installation are focused on creating new job descriptions, establishing interview methods and preparing interviewers to select practitioners and staff to do the new work, employing people to do the work, developing data collection sources and protocols, establishing access to timely training, preparing a coaching service delivery plan, and so on. While these topics are discussed and debated during the Exploration Stage (promises made), the resources must materialize during the Installation Stage (promises kept).\nBecause of the changes required, the Installation Stage is replete with adaptive leadership challenges. The attention given to the innovation and implementation supports may lead to dissatisfaction among existing staff members who feel devalued and ignored in the rush to do the new things. Some stakeholders who were enthusiastic advocates during Exploration do not follow through on promises they made. Funders get anxious when funds are being spent and no “real work” with recipients has started. And so on.\nImplementation Team members and leaders need to be ready to exercise adaptive leadership to resolve these issues as supports for the new ways of work are being developed. Knowing that adaptive issues abound during Installation and Initial Implementation, Implementation Teams use this as an opportunity to develop the adaptive leadership capacity in an organization and establish the practice-policy communication cycles from the beginning of the process (see Systemic Change). The issues give the Implementation Team and leaders many opportunities to teach, learn, and practice the new ways to provide adaptive and effective leadership in the organization.\nA challenge during the Exploration and Installation stages is finding or developing the expertise to use the Implementation Drivers to select, prepare, and support the first group of practitioners. Very few organizations or systems already have a functioning Implementation Team in place. As a result, accessing outside expertise is a good option to get started (Nord & Tucker, 1987). This is the approach Ogden and colleagues used to initiate the use of effective innovations in Norway. Once a program was underway, they recruited “home grown” staff who had been high fidelity practitioners to be the first members of an implementation team (e.g. trainers, coaches, fidelity assessors) to support the next generations of practitioners (Tommeraas & Ogden, 2016). However, very few evidence-based practices or innovations have purveyors (program-specific Implementation Teams) that support the effective use of the innovation. Thus, most organizations and systems are left to “do it yourself” and that approach has not proved to be very effective (C. H. Brown et al., 2014; Durlak & DuPre, 2008; Vernez et al., 2006).\nInitial Implementation Stage\nThe Initial Implementation Stage begins when the first practitioners attempt to use an innovation with recipients for the first time. Active Implementation staff refer to this as the awkward stage where the new ways of work are not comfortable for practitioners, managers, and leaders. It “doesn’t feel right” to interact with others in the new ways and “it is confusing” when the units within an organization are not yet fully functional and integrated. Very few attempts to use innovations are able to successfully negotiate the difficulties encountered during Initial Implementation where the challenges are many, the supports for change are weak, and the inertia of the status quo is strong.\nDuring the Initial Implementation Stage, newly selected practitioners and staff are attempting to use newly learned skills (e.g. the innovation) in the context of an organization that is just learning how to change to accommodate and support the new ways of work. This is a fragile stage where the awkwardness associated with trying new things and the difficulties associated with changing old ways of work provide strong motivations for giving up and going back to the familiar, comfortable, and well supported status quo. The status quo is powerful and resilient and readily bounces back from efforts to change it (Jalava, 2006; Oser, 2000; Zimmerman et al., 1998; Zucker, 1987).\nImplementation Teams using the Implementation Drivers are essential to success (80% vs. 14%; Fixsen, Blase, Timbers, & Wolf, 2001; Balas & Boren, 2000) during the Initial Implementation Stage. Implementation Teams help to develop the staff competencies required by the evidence-based program, help administrators adjust organization roles and functions to align with the program, and help leaders in the provider organization fully support the process of using the program and incorporating the necessary implementation supports.\nComparison of Intervention Use With and Without an Implementation Team\nFull Implementation Stage\nThe Full Implementation Stage is reached when at least 50% of the practitioners in an organization meet fidelity criteria on a given day. The 50% criterion is a benchmark established by the Active Implementation Research Network as an indicator of Full Implementation. That is, if the goal is to have 20 practitioners use an innovation in an organization, Full Implementation is reached on the day when 10 (50%) of those practitioners are at or above fidelity criteria. It often takes 2 to 4 years to reach Full Implementation when it is achieved at all (C. H. Brown et al., 2014; Brunk et al., 2014; Fixsen et al., 2007; Sabatier, 1986; Swales et al., 2012)\nThe first time the 50% benchmark is reached is cause for celebration. However, it likely will not be sustained for very long. Once a current high fidelity practitioner leaves it will take a few months for the replacement to be selected, trained, coached, and finally meet fidelity criteria. In the meantime, if that one practitioner was the tipping point for reaching the 50% benchmark then the organization will fall short of the 50% benchmark. If key people on the Implementation Team leave, the Competency Drivers may suffer and it may take longer for practitioners to meet and sustain high fidelity performance. Eventually, for the few organizations that reach and sustain Full Implementation, the new ways of providing innovation-based services become the standard ways of work and the implementation supports become the standard way the organization functions (Fixsen & Blase, 2018). The use of the innovation and the Implementation Drivers becomes the new status quo.\nNote that sustaining Full Implementation requires two things: a) it requires using the Implementation Drivers effectively to generate new high fidelity practitioners routinely and b) it requires keeping current high fidelity practitioners employed. If high fidelity practitioners leave faster than new ones can be developed to meet fidelity standards, then the 50% criterion for Full Implementation will never be reached or sustained. The pool is draining faster than it is being filled. The Leadership and Organization Drivers are designed to keep improving supports for practitioners so they can continue to provide high fidelity results for many years, even when doing demanding work (Aarons et al., 2009; Glisson, Schoenwald, et al., 2008; Strouse, Carroll-Hernandez, Sherman, & Sheldon, 2004).\nImplementation Teams remain essential contributors to the ongoing success of using the evidence-based program. Practitioners, staff, administrators, and leaders come and go and each new person needs to develop the competencies to effectively carry out the innovation and its implementation supports. Managers and administrators come and go and need to continually adjust organizational supports to facilitate the work of practitioners. Systems continue to change and impact organizations and practitioners. Evidence-based programs continue to be developed and programs already in place continue to be improved. The number of variables and complexity of issues probably qualify as “wicked problems” as described by Rittel and Webber (1973). The work of Implementation Teams is to ensure that the gains in the use of effective practices are maintained and improved over time and through transitions of leaders and staff."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:17b4a9a1-a659-4558-9695-74b1c5279415>","<urn:uuid:e753d969-eb11-4507-8366-e0278e50b83b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do scientific models evolve over time, and what role does technological advancement play in improving their accuracy, particularly in physics experiments?","answer":"Scientific models evolve as understandings change, with scientists continuously testing and refining them to build better explanations. This evolution is strongly influenced by technological advances, as demonstrated in physics experiments. For instance, while scientists have known about time dilation for decades, the development of extremely precise atomic clocks at NIST - called quantum logic clocks - has allowed for unprecedented accuracy in measuring relativistic effects. These clocks, using single aluminum ions and operating at optical frequencies, are so precise they can detect time differences at just 33 centimeters in height difference, representing a significant improvement over previous measurement capabilities that required comparisons between ground clocks and those in high-flying rockets.","context":["Home / scientific / which of the following statements about scientific models is true? WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ABOUT SCIENTIFIC MODELS IS TRUE? 04/09/2021 Contrasting student and also clinical viewsStudent everyday experiencesMany younger students think of models as either playthings or straightforward copies of reality. This is extensively continual with the everyday interpretation of ‘model’ (e.g. ‘design cars’, ‘model airplanes’, ‘model railways’). Students frequently think of models as valuable bereason they are copies (or even range reproductions) of actual objects or actions. In such cases, students seldom look past the surchallenge similarities between the version and the object or principle being stood for by the design (that is, the question, \"Does it look favor X?\" will be the method the value of a design of X is judged).You watching: Which of the following statements about scientific models is true?Just like many areas of scientific research, the science definition for the term ‘model’ differs from the daily usage of the word. This is important in understanding student daily experiences with models.For more indevelopment on introducing clinical terms, check out the focus principle Introducing clinical language.Some students have the more occurred watch that ‘models’ have the right to be more than simply physical depictions of objects. They recognise that ‘models’ can also be supplied to test principles and also procedures in ways that may be difficult to do in the genuine world. This notion could be reincompelled by the day-to-day usage of such terms as ‘computer system modelling’ and student experiences of computer system game simulations.A more progressed watch, rarely encountered among top primary/lower additional students, is that experimentation ‘models’ (the act of testing for ‘fit’) can cause their rearchitecture to provide enhanced predictions. Couple of students are conscious of the prominence scientific research areas on trial and error and also refining models to construct better understandings of the procedures they look for to define.Research: Gilbert, Boulter & Rutherford (1998), Gilbert & Rutherford (1998), Grosslight, Unger, Jay & Smith (1991), Harrison & Treagust (2000), Nussbaum & Nokaupunkiopas.comk, (1981), Saari & Viiri (2001), Treagust, Chittleboturbulent & Mamiala (2002)Scientific viewA scientific model is a physical and/or mathematical and/or conceptual representation of a system of principles, events or procedures. Scientists look for to determine and also understand also trends in our world by illustration on their clinical understanding to offer explacountries that permit the trends to be predicted. The models scientists create must be constant through our observations, inferences and existing explanations. However, scientific models are not created to be factual statements about the people. It is useful to categoclimb scientific models as:psychological models (a depiction of a facility principle, for example exactly how we think of an abstract idea like atoms)expressed models (a variation of a psychological model that is expressed by an individual via activity, speech or writing such as in a diagram)consensus models (an expressed model that has been based on trial and error by scientists and agreement reached that the version has merit, for instance The Big Bang Model).The many advantageous scientific models will possess:explanatory power (a model that contributes nopoint to explanations is of exceptionally little bit value)predictive power (the experimentation of predictions obtained from the design is standard in creating the robustness of the model)consistency throughout contexts (the version of an atom is the same as soon as considering an atom of lead or an atom of gold)consistency via various other scientific models (the version of an atom is the exact same for atoms in metal as it is for atoms found within a organic cell; the organic cell is an additional clinical model).Research: Gilbert & Boulter (1998) Critical teaching ideasScience seeks to produce easy descriptions of and explanations for our complex people. A clinical version is an extremely effective and also common means to represent these simplifications.When a scientific version permits us to make predictions it is even more valued.As scientific models are depictions of streamlined explacountries, they execute not look for to explain eexceptionally situation or eincredibly information. This indicates that clinical models regularly are not similar via the ‘genuine world’ from which they are acquired.Students need to appreciate that researchers develop models and also usage them to make predictions. Since models are representations of scientific understandings, as these understandings readjust, so the models readjust too.See more: Principles Of Developmental Biology : Hake, Sarah, Wilt, FredThe emphasis principle The work of scientific research explores the advancement of scientific knowledge.Explore the relationships between concepts in the Concept Development Maps – Models, Scientific World View.

It is currently recognized not to be spherical yet a small more pear shaped.After the students have actually outlined this advancement, have actually them consider:what transforms the model has actually specifically undergoneover what duration of time have the transforms occurredwhy the changes/breakthroughs in the model have actually occurredwhat brand-new indevelopment or modern technology might have actually bring about rethinking the style of the original model.","Scientists have known for decades that time passes faster at higher elevations—a curious aspect of Einstein's theories of relativity that previously has been measured by comparing clocks on the earth's surface and a high-flying rocket.\nNow, physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have measured this effect at a more down-to-earth scale of 33 centimeters, or about 1 foot, demonstrating, for instance, that you age faster when you stand a couple of steps higher on a staircase.\nDescribed in the Sept. 24 issue of Science,* the difference is much too small for humans to perceive directly—adding up to approximately 90 billionths of a second over a 79-year lifetime—but may provide practical applications in geophysics and other fields.\nSimilarly, the NIST researchers observed another aspect of relativity—that time passes more slowly when you move faster—at speeds comparable to a car travelling about 20 miles per hour, a more comprehensible scale than previous measurements made using jet aircraft.\nNIST scientists performed the new \"time dilation\" experiments by comparing operations of a pair of the world's best experimental atomic clocks. The nearly identical clocks are each based on the \"ticking\" of a single aluminum ion (electrically charged atom) as it vibrates between two energy levels over a million billion times per second. One clock keeps time to within 1 second in about 3.7 billion years (see phys.org/news184517462.html) and the other is close behind in performance. The two clocks are located in different laboratories at NIST and connected by a 75-meter-long optical fiber.\nNIST's aluminum clocks—also called \"quantum logic clocks\" because they borrow logical decision-making techniques from experimental quantum computing—are precise and stable enough to reveal slight differences that could not be seen until now. The clocks operate by shining laser light on the ions at optical frequencies, which are higher than the microwave frequencies used in today's standard atomic clocks based on the cesium atom.\nOptical clocks could someday lead to time standards 100 times more accurate than today's standard clocks.\nThe aluminum clocks can detect small relativity-based effects because of their extreme precision and high \"Q factor\"—a quantity that reflects how reliably the ion absorbs and retains optical energy in changing from one energy level to another—says NIST postdoctoral researcher James Chin-Wen Chou, first author of the paper.\n\"We have observed the highest Q factor in atomic physics,\" Chou says. \"You can think about it as how long a tuning fork would vibrate before it loses the energy stored in the resonating structure. We have the ion oscillating in sync with the laser frequency for about 400 thousand billion cycles.\"\n• PhysOrg.com iPhone / iPad Apps\n• PhysOrg.com Audio Podcasts / iTunes\n• PhysOrg.com Android apps\n• PhysOrg.com Blackberry app\n• Join PhysOrg.com on Facebook!\n• Follow PhysOrg.com on Twitter!\nThe NIST experiments focused on two scenarios predicted by Einstein's theories of relativity. First, when two clocks are subjected to unequal gravitational forces due to their different elevations above the surface of the Earth, the higher clock—experiencing a smaller gravitational force—runs faster. Second, when an observer is moving, a stationary clock's tick appears to last longer, so the clock appears to run slow. Scientists refer to this as the \"twin paradox,\" in which a twin sibling who travels on a fast-moving rocket ship would return home younger than the other twin. The crucial factor is the acceleration (speeding up and slowing down) of the travelling twin in making the round-trip journey.\nNIST scientists observed these effects by making specific changes in one of the two aluminum clocks and measuring the resulting differences in the two ions' relative ticking rates, or frequencies.\nIn one set of experiments, scientists raised one of the clocks by jacking up the laser table to a height one-third of a meter (about a foot) above the second clock. Sure enough, the higher clock ran at a slightly faster rate than the lower clock, exactly as predicted.\nThe second set of experiments examined the effects of altering the physical motion of the ion in one clock. (The ions are almost completely motionless during normal clock operations.) NIST scientists tweaked the one ion so that it gyrated back and forth at speeds equivalent to several meters per second. That clock ticked at a slightly slower rate than the second clock, as predicted by relativity. The moving ion acts like the traveling twin in the twin paradox.\nSuch comparisons of super-precise clocks eventually may be useful in geodesy, the science of measuring the Earth and its gravitational field, with applications in geophysics and hydrology, and possibly in space-based tests of fundamental physics theories, suggests physicist Till Rosenband, leader of NIST's aluminum ion clock team.\nNIST scientists hope to improve the precision of the aluminum clocks even further, as much as 10-fold, through changes in ion trap geometry and better control of ion motion and environmental interference. The aim is to measure differences in timekeeping well enough to measure heights to an accuracy of 1 centimeter, a performance level suitable for making geodetic measurements. The paper suggests that optical clocks could be linked to form a network of \"inland tidal gauges\" to measure the distance from the earth's surface to the geoid (the surface of the earth's gravity field that matches the global mean sea level). Such a network could be updated far more frequently than current techniques.\nExplore further: World's first 3-D acoustic cloaking device hides objects from sound\nMore information: *C.W. Chou, D.B.

{"question":"How do the masses of NASA's IRVE-3 inflatable reentry system and SpaceX's Falcon 9 v1.0 compare, and what does this tell us about their different approaches to space technology?","answer":"The IRVE-3 inflatable reentry system and the Falcon 9 v1.0 represent vastly different scales in space technology. The IRVE-3 has a total mass of about 100 kg (220 lb), making it a relatively lightweight system designed for specific reentry purposes. In contrast, the Falcon 9 v1.0 had a mass of 333,400 kg (735,000 lb), as it was a complete orbital launch vehicle. This significant difference reflects their distinct purposes - IRVE-3 being an experimental inflatable heat shield system that could potentially enable easier launches and emergency evacuation capabilities, while the Falcon 9 v1.0 was a full-scale launch vehicle designed to deliver substantial payloads to orbit.","context":["NASA to test IRVE-3 inflatable reentry system\nYour spacecraft is falling from the skies at an initial speed of Mach 25. Your reentry heat shield, that has to survive a 7,800 degrees Celsius (14,072° F) plasma shock, is a finely tuned hi-tech amalgam of refractory metals and carbides and reinforced carbon-carbon ablation materials. Care to replace your mighty heat shield with a balloon? Not likely! But that is exactly what NASA is considering.\nThis summer, the third in a series of NASA suborbital test flights will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of inflatable spacecraft. The Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE-3) is scheduled for a suborbital test flight from the Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore later this northern summer. Part of the Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) project within NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist's Game Changing Development (GCD) Program, IRVE-3 is one of NASA's many projects to develop new technologies to advance space travel.\nCutaway image of 3-meter diameter IREV3 inflatable reentry test vehicle following inflation (Image: NASA)\nWhy a balloon? Balloons – even those designed to withstand the rigors of reentry from orbit – are small and light. Past use of aerodynamic decelerators required that the rigid structures fit within the launch rocket. In contrast, IRVE-3, while three meters (9.8 ft) in diameter when inflated, packs into a 56 cm (22 in) diameter cylinder, which is three meters long. The complete payload will be launched by a Black Brant sounding rocket.\nDuring the flight, the tubes will be inflated, thereby stretching a thermal protection system (TPS) blanket that covers the tubes. The result is an aeroshell with a heat shield that will protect an active payload returning to Earth, while having the advantage of being much easier to launch to orbit. Also, with a total mass of about 100 kg (220 lb), the inflatable aeroshell is far lighter than a rigid aeroshell.\nThe flight plan for the IRVE-3 test includes climbing to a maximum altitude of 462 km (287 miles), at which point the IRVE-3 separates from the Black Brant, and is inflated. The inflated reentry vehicle and its payload will then fall back to Earth, reaching a downward velocity in excess of 2.5 km/s (1.5 miles per second) before the atmosphere becomes sufficiently dense for drag braking to start.\nIREV3 inflatable reentry test vehicle being subjected to reentry thermal and dynamic conditions (Photo: NASA)\nTesting has been a major part of this development effort from the beginning. Although the most visually impressive test was that shown above to test the thermal and dynamic response of the inflated reentry vehicle, perhaps the most important was a complete systems test of the IRVE-3 and its payload in near-vacuum conditions.\nIREV3 inflatable reentry test vehicle being inspected following inflation in the NASA's Transsonic Dynamics Tunnel (Photo: NASA/Sean Smith)\nThis test confirmed that the IRVE-3 release and inflation mechanisms functioned properly, as did the data acquisition and transmission electronics. \"There are an awful lot of complex systems packed inside the payload on IRVE-3,\" said Robert Dillman, the chief engineer for IRVE-3. \"When it works, it looks simple and that's a good thing. But there are a lot of internal parts that have to work together in order to make that simple function achievable.\"\nIf flight tests continue to be satisfactory, one potential application for inflatable reentry vehicles other than planetary probes is emergency evacuation of the International Space Station and other future manned orbital stations. Individual reentry survival mechanisms were first proposed in the early 1960s with the MOOSE (Man Out Of Space Easiest) concept from General Electric.\nAlthough GE performed preliminary testing on some of the components of the MOOSE system, neither NASA or the U.S. Air Force was interested – probably rightly so. Modern techniques and materials developed during the IRVE development and testing program could well make the issuing of inflatable survival vehicles a standard part of space flight contingency planning in the future.\nHere's a video simulation of the upcoming test.","Falcon 9 v1.0\nA Falcon 9 v1.0 launches with an uncrewed Dragon spacecraft on a cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station in March 2013, the fifth and final flight of a version 1.0 Falcon 9.\n|Function||Orbital medium-lift launch vehicle|\n|Country of origin||United States|\n|Project cost||$ 300 million (including Dragon)|\n|Cost per launch||$54–59.5 million|\n|Height||47.8 m (157 ft)|\n|Diameter||3.66 m (12.0 ft)|\n|Mass||333,400 kg (735,000 lb)|\n|Payload to LEO||10,450 kg (23,040 lb)|\n|Payload to GTO||4,540 kg (10,010 lb)|\n|Derivatives||Falcon 9 v1.1|\n|Launch sites||Cape Canaveral SLC-40|\n|Partial failures||1 (secondary payload only)|\n|First flight||June 4, 2010|\n|Last flight||March 1, 2013|\n|Engines||9 Merlin 1C|\n|Thrust||4,940 kN (1,110,000 lbf)|\n|Specific impulse||Sea level: 275 seconds\nVacuum: 304 seconds\n|Burn time||170 seconds|\n|Fuel||LOX / RP-1|\n|Engines||1 Merlin 1C vacuum|\n|Thrust||445 kN (100,000 lbf)|\n|Specific impulse||342 s |\n|Burn time||345 seconds|\n|Fuel||LOX / RP-1|\nThe Falcon 9 v1.0 was the first member of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle family, designed and manufactured by SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Development of the medium-lift launcher began in 2005, and it first flew in June 2010. The Falcon 9 v1.0 then launched four Dragon cargo spacecraft: one on an orbital test flight, then one demonstration and two operational resupply missions to the International Space Station under a Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA.\nThe two stage vehicle was powered by SpaceX's Merlin engines, burning liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1). It had a payload capacity of 10,450 kg (23,040 lb) to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,540 kg (10,000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), though all launches were to LEO.\nThe vehicle was retired in 2013 and replaced by the upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1, which first flew in September 2013. Of its five launches from 2010-2013, all successfully delivered their primary payload, though an anomaly led to the loss of one secondary payload.\nThe Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage was used on the first five Falcon 9 launches, and powered by nine SpaceX Merlin 1C rocket engines arranged in a 3x3 pattern. Each of these engines had a sea-level thrust of 556 kilonewtons (125,000 lbf) for a total thrust on liftoff of about 5,000 kilonewtons (1,100,000 lbf).\nThe upper stage was powered by a single Merlin 1C engine modified for vacuum operation, with an expansion ratio of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345 seconds. For added reliability of restart, the engine has dual redundant pyrophoric igniters (TEA-TEB).\nThe Falcon 9 v1.1 interstage, which connects the upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber aluminum core composite structure. Reusable separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The stage separation system had twelve attachment points (later reduced to just three in the v1.1 launcher).\nThe second stage tank of Falcon 9 is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.\nFour Draco thrusters were used on the Falcon 9 v1.0 second-stage as a reaction control system. The thrusters were used to hold a stable attitude for payload separation or, as a non-standard service, were also designed to be used to spin up the stage and payload to a maximum of 5 rotations per minute (RPM), although none of the five flown missions had a payload requirement for this service.\nSpaceX uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault-tolerant design. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three voting computers, each of which has two physical processors that constantly check each other. The software runs on Linux and is written in C++.\nDevelopment and production\nWhile SpaceX spent its own money to develop its first launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, the development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by the purchase of several demonstration flights by NASA. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. SpaceX was selected from more than twenty companies that submitted COTS proposals. Without the NASA money, development would have taken longer, Musk said.\nThe development costs for Falcon 9 v1.0 were approximately US$300 million, and NASA verified those costs. If some of the Falcon 1 development costs were included, since F1 development did contribute to Falcon 9 to some extent, then the total might be considered as high as US$390 million. \nNASA also evaluated Falcon 9 development costs using the NASA‐Air Force Cost Model (NAFCOM)—a traditional cost-plus contract approach for US civilian and military space procurement—at US$$3.6 billion based on a NASA environment/culture, or US$$1.6 billion using a more commercial approach.\nIn December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one new Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months, with a plan to double the production rate to one every six weeks in 2012.\nSpaceX ran a limited set of post-mission booster recovery flight tests on the early Falcon rocket launches, both Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. The initial parachute-based design approach was ultimately unsuccessful, and the company adopted a new propulsive-return design methodology that would utilize the Falcon 9 v1.1 vehicle for orbital recovery testing, but did use a Falcon 9 v1.0 booster tank for low-altitude low-velocity flight testing in 2012–2013.\nFrom early days in the development of the Falcon 9, SpaceX had expressed hopes that both stages would eventually be reusable. The initial SpaceX design for stage reusability included adding lightweight thermal protection system (TPS) capability to the booster stage and utilizing parachute recovery of the separated stage. However, early test results were not successful, leading to abandonment of that approach and the initiation of a new design.\nIn 2011 SpaceX began a formal and funded development program—the SpaceX reusable launch system development program—with the objective of designing reusable first and second stages utilizing propulsive return of the stages to the launch pad. The early program focus, however, is only on return of the first stage.\nAs an early component of that multi-year program, a Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage tank, 32 metres (106 ft) long, was used to build and test the Grasshopper prototype test vehicle, which made eight successful low-altitude takeoffs and vertical landings in 2012–2013 before the vehicle was retired.\n- Press Release Source: SpaceX (May 4, 2011). \"Why the US Can Beat China: The Facts About SpaceX Costs\". spaceref.com.

{"question":"What are the current challenges in ocean conservation regarding carbon emissions from trawling, and how do different types of marine protected areas compare in effectiveness for biodiversity protection? 🌍","answer":"Bottom trawling releases hundreds of millions of tons of carbon annually from sea sediments - comparable to emissions from the global aviation industry. This is particularly problematic as the ocean is a crucial carbon sink, and disturbing these sediments reduces atmospheric carbon absorption. Regarding protection effectiveness, fully protected areas demonstrate clear benefits with higher biodiversity and fish populations, while partially protected areas show no improvement over unprotected zones. Studies show fully protected areas have 2.5 times more fish biomass and can protect 80% of endangered marine species habitats. However, currently only 7% of oceans are protected, and most protected areas (69% globally) still allow some fishing, limiting their conservation effectiveness.","context":["Trawling the ocean for seafood puts enormous pressure on marine ecosystems, but a new international study further highlights why this practice stirs up trouble for the entire planet.\nMany commercial fishing operations use weighted nets to gather everything from the sea floor up. Fishing this way is already widely known to shatter coral, pull out seaweed, and accidentally kill fish and other marine animals that are captured as bycatch.\nAdding to this list of unintended consequences, scraping the bottom of the ocean also kicks up carbon-rich sea sediment. The study was the first to put a number on the potential release of carbon caused by bottom trawling, and it found that hundreds of millions of tons of carbon are being released into the ocean each year — a volume roughly equivalent to the entire global aviation industry.\nThe study includes contributions from researchers at Dalhousie University and the University of British Columbia, and was published in Nature.\n“The ocean covers 70 percent of the Earth yet, until now, its importance for solving some of the most pressing challenges of our time has been overlooked,” said co-author Boris Worm in a press release.\n“Smart ocean protection can help to provide natural climate solutions, make seafood more abundant and safeguard imperiled marine species — all at the same time. The benefits are clear. If we want to solve the three most pressing challenges of our century — biodiversity loss, climate change and food shortages — we must protect our ocean.”\nTruly, all of these areas are interconnected, and the impact is even felt on land. The ocean is one of the most important carbon sinks on Earth, and increased carbon being released from stable sediments and into the water is amplified, because less is being withdrawn from the atmosphere.\nThe solution needs to address climate change and conservation at the same time. Only 7 percent of the ocean falls under marine protection; the authors suggest that strategically expanding protected areas to cover 30 percent of the ocean would not only protect important habitats and reduce carbon emissions, it would also allow dwindling numbers of fish to recover to the point where more seafood could sustainably be caught.\nTo assess which areas would most benefit from designation as marine protected areas — places where destructive and extractive activities would be banned — the multidisciplinary team looked through the lenses of marine biology, climate change, and economics. Their goal was to look for areas that would give the greatest benefit in terms of biodiversity, seafood production, and climate mitigation collectively.\nIf governments move to enact protection measures mapped out by the authors, the study estimates that 80 percent of global habitats for endangered marine species will be protected. At the same time, barring trawling in these areas is projected to reduce carbon emissions by a billion tonnes each year, while also boosting fishing catches by eight million tonnes per year.\nThe plan requires international cooperation, as the identified areas are scattered through zones controlled by coastal nations and in international waters. Areas that fall under Canadian control include the Fundian Channel south of Nova Scotia, the Southern Grand Banks, and the Central Coast of British Columbia.\nSolutions to the pressures faced by our planet are often viewed as a zero-sum game, where trade-offs need to be made to favour either the environment and biodiversity, or food security and the economy. Changing our perspective to look at these concerns as ones that complement each other, and where changes that benefit one can raise them all, this study demonstrates that it’s possible to arrive at concrete and sustainable solutions.","Partially protected areas – marine reserves that allow some forms of fishing – are no more effective socially or ecologically than open marine areas in Australia’s Great Southern Reef, a new UNSW study has concluded.\nThe research, published in Conservation Biology today, comes at a time when the High Ambition Coalition of 50 countries of the world (which does not include Australia) have pledged to protect more than 30 per cent of the planet’s lands and seas by the end of this decade. But not all protected areas are created equal.\nThe UNSW study discovered partially protected areas in southern Australia had no more fish, invertebrates or algae and no difference in the mix of users – and they were not valued any more highly by users than areas outside reserves (open areas).\nThe social and ecological researchers found fully protected areas (no-take or sanctuary zones), by comparison, had more fish, higher biodiversity of marine life and were an attraction to many coastal users both for their ecological and protection values.\nLead author John Turnbull, UNSW Science researcher, said partially protected areas appear to be the “red herrings” of marine conservation as they distract us from achieving more effective protection.\n“Marine protected areas are the umbrella term for managed marine areas and can be fully or partially protected. They are a primary tool for the stewardship, conservation and restoration of marine ecosystems but globally, 69 per cent of marine protected areas are open to some form of fishing,” Mr Turnbull said.\n“This is a surprise to many people – almost half of the people we surveyed in partially protected areas (42 per cent) mistakenly thought they were in a reserve that protected fish.\n“Just 12 per cent of people knew they were in a partially protected area, compared to 79 per cent of people in fully protected areas who correctly identified they were in one.\n“This is not a small issue; three-quarters of Australia’s marine protected area is open to fishing. Most partially protected areas in Australia even allow commercial fishing, which, on an industrial scale, is contrary to international (“IUCN” – International Union for Conservation of Nature) guidelines.”\nAustralia’s Great Southern Reef surveyed\nThe UNSW Sydney study spanned 7000km of coast and five states. The authors assessed 19 fully protected areas, 18 partially protected areas and 19 open areas. They each had different rules and marine communities but they all had broadly stated goals, such as the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.\nThe researchers conducted 439 interviews and 190 observation surveys to gauge the social impact of each area (human use, perceptions and values), and analysed existing data from 625 underwater visual census Reef Life Surveys to determine the ecological impact of protection on marine communities (fish, invertebrates and algae).\nMr Turnbull said the research team found no social or ecological benefits for partially protected areas relative to open areas. For example, the ecological data revealed that fish species richness and biomass were higher in fully protected areas, but not in partially protected areas. There were 1.3x more fish species, 2.5x more fish biomass and 3.5x more large (20+ cm) fish biomass in fully protected areas compared to open areas.\nMr Turnbull said: “Global studies support our findings: there is a lot of research that shows a reduced, if any, impact of partial protection and it depends on the strength of that partial protection.\n“Despite this, fully protected areas are often a very small percentage of a marine park; for example, Sydney’s recently proposed marine park had less than three per cent designated as fully protected sanctuary zone, meaning 97 per cent of the area would be open to fishing if the park was approved. This is the degree of ‘red herring’ we are experiencing.”\nFully protected areas more valued\nMr Turnbull said their research also busted the myth that fully protected areas were unpopular.\n“On the contrary, 92 per cent of people we surveyed said they supported protected areas that restrict fishing. We believe our research reflects the general views of coastal users, because we designed our sampling to represent all the different types of user at each site; people swimming, walking, diving, fishing and so on.\n“And there was virtually no difference in support for protected areas between people who fish and people who don't – just one per cent.”\nMr Turnbull said the researchers also found most people were passionate about their local coastal areas.\n“People want to see their area looked after and properly protected, especially with sanctuary zones. Often, people specifically visited these because they knew the area was fully protected, and they had personally observed the improvement in marine life” he said.\n“In fully protected areas, we found a higher number of certain types of users; twice as many divers and over three times as many snorkelers. This showed people were directly experiencing the values of fully protected areas and acknowledged them and were attracted to them. This was not the case for partially protected areas; the mix and number of users in these areas were no different to open areas.”\n‘Investment’ should have a return\nStudy co-author and UNSW Dean of Science Professor Emma Johnston said if governments were going to allocate conservation resources to protect marine areas, they needed to be sure the “investment” was paying off.\n“The current trend towards downgrading fully protected areas to partially protected areas in many parts of the world, including Australia, may be wasting precious conservation resources. Partially protected areas could still be useful but only for specific purposes; for example, to support traditional management practices, protect a particular threatened species, or to create a buffer zone for a fully protected area,” Prof. Johnston said.\n“But the results of our substantial study suggest that partially protected areas may be overused and represent a distraction from true conservation measures. The public are confused by partially protected areas and the general biodiversity is no better off.”\nProf. Johnston said she hoped the researchers’ findings would encourage decisionmakers to consider whether their conservation approach was fit for purpose.\n“If we are going to truly protect our planet, partially protected areas must be monitored regularly and the results made public, because if they are failing to provide social or ecological returns, those areas should be upgraded to the level of protection that we know works,” she said.\n- Read more: 75% of Australia’s marine protected areas are given only ‘partial’ protection.

{"question":"Bonjour! I want to comprendre la différence in size between CTA small telescope and Maksutov 150/1800. Which one is bigger?","answer":"The CTA Small Size Telescope (SST-1M) is larger than the Maksutov 150/1800. The SST-1M has a mirror dish diameter of 4 meters (400 cm), while the Maksutov 150/1800 has a lens diameter of only 150 mm (15 cm). The SST-1M is significantly bigger, being designed for a large-scale observatory, while the Maksutov telescope is designed to be compact and lightweight for individual use.","context":["The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will explore with unprecedented precision the Universe in the gammaray domain covering an energy range from 50 GeV to more the 300 TeV. To cover such a broad range with a sensitivity which will be ten time better than actual instruments, different types of telescopes are needed: the Large Size Telescopes (LSTs), with a ∼24 m diameter mirror, a Medium Size Telescopes (MSTs), with a ∼12 m mirror and the small size telescopes (SSTs), with a ∼4 m diameter mirror. The single mirror small size telescope (SST-1M), one of the proposed solutions to become part of the small-size telescopes of CTA, will be equipped with an innovative camera. The SST-1M has a Davies-Cotton optical design with a mirror dish of 4 m diameter and focal ratio 1.4 focussing the Cherenkov light produced in atmospheric showers onto a 90 cm wide hexagonal camera providing a FoV of 9 degrees. The camera is an innovative design based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPM ) and adopting a fully digital trigger and readout architecture. The camera features 1296 custom designed large area hexagonal SiPM coupled to hollow optical concentrators to achieve a pixel size of almost 2.4 cm. The SiPM is a custom design developed with Hamamatsu and with its active area of almost 1 cm2 is one of the largest monolithic SiPM existing. Also the optical concentrators are innovative being light funnels made of a polycarbonate substrate coated with a custom designed UV-enhancing coating. The analog signals coming from the SiPM are fed into the fully digital readout electronics, where digital data are processed by high-speed FPGAs both for trigger and readout. The trigger logic, implemented into an Virtex 7 FPGA, uses the digital data to elaborate a trigger decision by matching data against predefined patterns. This approach is extremely flexible and allows improvements and continued evolutions of the system. The prototype camera is being tested in laboratory prior to its installation expected in fall 2017 on the telescope prototype in Krakow (Poland). In this contribution, we will describe the design of the camera and show the performance measured in laboratory.\nToday the scientific community is facing an increasing complexity of the scientific projects, from both a technological and a management point of view. The reason for this is in the advance of science itself, where new experiments with unprecedented levels of accuracy, precision and coverage (time and spatial) are realised. Astronomy is one of the fields of the physical sciences where a strong interaction between the scientists, the instrument and software developers is necessary to achieve the goals of any Big Science Project. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the largest ground-based very high-energy gamma-ray observatory of the next decades. To achieve the full potential of the CTA Observatory, the system must be put into place to enable users to operate the telescopes productively. The software will cover all stages of the CTA system, from the preparation of the observing proposals to the final data reduction, and must also fit into the overall system. Scientists, engineers, operators and others will use the system to operate the Observatory, hence they should be involved in the design process from the beginning. We have organised a workgroup and a workflow for the definition of the CTA Top Level Use Cases in the context of the Requirement Management activities of the CTA Observatory. Scientists, instrument and software developers are collaborating and sharing information to provide a common and general understanding of the Observatory from a functional point of view. Scientists that will use the CTA Observatory will provide mainly Science Driven Use Cases, whereas software engineers will subsequently provide more detailed Use Cases, comments and feedbacks. The main purposes are to define observing modes and strategies, and to provide a framework for the flow down of the Use Cases and requirements to check missing requirements and the already developed Use-Case models at CTA sub-system level. Use Cases will also provide the basis for the definition of the Acceptance Test Plan for the validation of the overall CTA system. In this contribution we present the organisation and the workflow of the Top Level Use Cases workgroup.\nThe single mirror Small Size Telescope (SST-1M) project proposes a design among others for the smallest type of telescopes (SST), that will compose the south observatory of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The SST camera collecting the Cherenkov light resulting from very high energy gamma-ray interactions in the atmosphere proposes to use Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM). The SST-1M design has led to the use of unique pixel shape and size that required a dedicated development by the University of Geneva and Hamamatsu. An active surface of ~94 mm2 and a resulting total capacitance of ~3.4 nF combined with the stringent requirements of the CTA project on timing and charge resolution have led the University of Geneva to develop a custom preamplifier stage and slow-control system. The design and performance of the tailor made preamplifier stage and of the slow control electronics will be briefly described. The bias circuit of the sensor contains a resistor meant to prevent the sensor from drawing high current. However this resistor also introduces a voltage drop at the sensor input impacting the stability of its operation. A model has been developed in order to derive the parameters needed to account for it at the data analysis level. A solution based on the SST-1M front-end and digital readout is proposed to compensate for the voltage drop at the sensor cathode.\nThe Small Size Telescope with Single Mirror (SST-1M) is one of the proposed types of Small Size Telescopes (SST) for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The CTA south array will be composed of about 100 telescopes, out of which about 70 are of SST class, which are optimized for the detection of gamma rays in the energy range from 5 TeV to 300 TeV. The SST-1M implements a Davies-Cotton optics with a 4 m dish diameter with a field of view of 9°. The Cherenkov light produced in atmospheric showers is focused onto a 88 cm wide hexagonal photo-detection plane, composed of 1296 custom designed large area hexagonal silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) and a fully digital readout and trigger system. The SST-1M camera has been designed to provide high performance in a robust as well as compact and lightweight design. In this contribution, we review the different steps that led to the realization of the telescope prototype and its innovative camera.","Optical tube MAK 150/1800 PRO\nThe Maksutov optical system is one of the most valued optical constructions, widely appreciated for its mobility, ease of use and multi-functionality. It is an excellent choice of both astronomical observations, as well as earth observations and aircraft observations. Excellent optics provide an extremely sharp image throughout the field of view. The telescope consists of the meniscus correction board, the main mirror and the secondary mirror placed on the inner part of the meniscus. These telescopes have a reduced coma and show only a substantial chromatic aberration, giving very sharp and expressive images. A great advantage of the Maksutov telescopes is the compact and compact design and light weight. Due to their large focal length and low light, they are perfectly suitable for planetary observations. This type of construction works well in urban environments, where the main emphasis is on solar system objects, and smaller on nebulae.\nComponents of the set (links):\nTuba SW MAK 150 PRO\nMounting TPL ALT-AZ with micromovement\n| • Optical system: || Maksutow - Cassegrain |\n| • Lens diameter: || 150 mm |\n| • Focal length of the lens: || 1800 mm |\n| • Lighted: || 1/12 |\n| • Switching capacity: || 1 '' |\n| • Theoretical range: || 13.8 magnitude |\n| • Maximum useful magnification: || 300-350x |\n| • Dimensions (diameter x length): || 18.5 x 40 cm |\n| • Weight: || 5.6 kg |\nThe set includes the following accessories:\n• 2 \"spectacle lift\n• Long Eye Relief 2 \"28 mm eyepieces\n• Angle mirror 90 ° 2 \"\n• Integrated dovetail\n• Optical finder 9x50\nUniversal mounting ALT-AZ (AZ5) with micromovers and steel field rack\nUniversal assembly with azimuthal head with a powerful lifting capacity of 12 kg, typical for EQ5 class assemblies.

{"question":"How do hardware-based storage systems and QoS-enabled storage platforms differ in their approaches to performance optimization in multi-tenant environments?","answer":"Hardware-based storage systems and QoS-enabled platforms take different approaches to performance optimization. Traditional integrated storage systems focus on hardware innovation through custom-designed ASICs or FPGAs to improve performance features like thin provisioning and automated tiering. In contrast, QoS-enabled platforms specifically address multi-tenant environments by implementing bandwidth controls that prevent single users from consuming excessive resources. While hardware-based systems deliver storage requests as fast as possible, QoS controls allow for setting specific read/write bandwidth limits for storage volumes to ensure fair resource distribution and predictable performance across all users.","context":["Integrated storage systems are storage solutions where you get both the storage hardware and storage services (snapshots, thin provisioning, replication) from a single vendor. Their goal is to provide a turnkey solution that is easier to implement and support.\nThey are being challenged by software-based virtualization that is either done by an appliance or hypervisor, bringing storage services to almost any vendor's storage hardware. It is the classic turnkey vs. build battle. but the hypervisor may make the build concept easier and may mean that integrated storage needs to up its offerings to compete.\nInnovate Through Software\nOne way that integrated storage systems can continue to maintain their dominance is to continue to innovate through their own storage software. In some cases, this means keeping pace with what standalone or hypervisor-based storage solutions can do. For example, several storage vendors now have the capability to move volumes between different storage systems like hypervisors can. This brings live volume migration to the non-virtualized environment and to those hypervisors that can't perform live storage migrations.\nIn other cases, software innovation means doing what the storage virtualization solutions cannot--like thin reclamation instead of just thin provisioning, automated tiering for block-level data movement between storage types instead of whole volumes, or more robust snapshot and cloning capabilities.\nInnovation may go so far as adding a feature that a storage virtualization tool simply does not have and may never have, like primary storage deduplication. As we discussed in our recent article \"Which Primary Storage Optimization Strategy is Best?\" deduplication could be a key differentiator especially in virtualized environments.\nInnovate Through Hardware\nAnother area that storage systems vendors can innovate is in the storage hardware itself by using custom-designed ASICs or FPGA's that improve on performance. This breaks with the conventional wisdom of using \"off the shelf\" hardware, but it is an area that makes sense for storage vendors to invest in to stop the encroachment of software-only solutions. If you are a hardware vendor, you might as well leverage hardware to improve performance of such features like thin provisioning, automated tiering, and snapshots.\nCompliment The Storage Hypervisor\nAs we discussed in our earlier entry \"The Storage Hypervisor,\" the storage service capabilities of the virtualization vendors are improving dramatically and their shortcomings can be overcome by third-party software add-ons. As a result, the final area that we think that storage hardware vendors should focus on is creating great hardware. Too many vendors are counting on software ingenuity to differentiate their systems and are using off-the-shelf components for the hardware part of their solutions. That is a reasonable strategy, but it means constantly racing to stay ahead of what the storage hypervisor and standalone storage virtualization software vendors can provide. Eventually, many users may decide that the capabilities of the software virtualization stack may be all they need.\nAs we discuss in our article \"The Requirements for Building Reliable Storage Systems,\" vendors should look to building reliable hardware that is cost effective and space efficient. This allows them to be a compliment, not a competitor, to the feature sets that are being added to the hypervisor. We think this gives storage vendors that invest in their own hardware innovations a key advantage as the storage virtualization market takes hold.\nFollow Storage Switzerland on Twitter","Multi-tenant environments work efficiently because computing and storage resources are pooled and shared across a large number of users or “tenants.” In an enterprise deployment these tenants might be from different departments or from various groups within a department like engineering or marketing. In a managed hosting environment the tenants will be separate companies or customers.\nOn the compute side, this is pretty simple because the tenant’s virtual machine is limited by the size and number of virtual cores and memory. But on the storage side, the situation is more complex.\nTraditional storage systems only have one speed to deliver the storage read/write request as fast as possible. This works great when the appliance is dedicated to a particular task or customer, but it falls down in multi-tenant environments because a single user can use up all of the available bandwidth or IOPS thereby negatively impacting the performance of all users of the storage appliance. In some cases, the performance drop can be dramatic to the point of making the storage appliance unusable for all other users.\nIn all of these scenarios, the key technology needed to make the resources sharable is called Quality of Service or “QoS” controls. When QuantaStor appliances are in a multi-tenancy environment it is important to be able to limit the maximum read and write bandwidth allowed for specific storage volumes so that a given user or application cannot unfairly consume an excessive amount of the storage appliance’s available bandwidth. The bandwidth limiting feature is thus referred to as Quality of Service (QoS) controls that limit the maximum throughput for reads and writes to ensure a reliable and predictable “QoS” for all applications and users of a given appliance.\nQuantaStor 3.16 now has QoS controls built-in making it the ideal SDS platform for hosting and enterprise environments that require QoS services (Figure 1).\nQoS controls can only be applied to Storage Volumes (not Network Shares) and must be in a ZFS or Ceph-based Storage Pool. Once QoS controls on a given Storage Volume are applied the settings will be visible in the main center table (Figure 2).\nQoS policies can be created that allow for changing the QoS settings across an appliance grid with a single command. In some cases, storage admins may want to assign Storage Volumes to a QoS level by policy. This makes it easy to adjust the QoS for all Storage Volumes using a given QoS policy quickly and easily. To create a QoS Policy using the QuantaStor CLI run the following command.\nqs qos-policy-create high-performance --bw-read=300MB --bw-write=300MB\nPolicies can also be modified at any time with the changes being immediately applied to all Storage Volumes in the grid associated with the policy.\nqs qos-policy-create high-performance --bw-read=400MB --bw-write=400MB\nWith this command, performance limits can be dynamically changed to increase or decrease the maximums for certain hours of the day where storage IO loads are expected to be lower or higher by using a script or cron job.\nPlease note, if you set specific non-policy QoS settings for a Storage Volume these will override remove any QoS policy setting associated with the Storage Volume. The reverse is also true, if you have a specific QoS setting for a Storage Volume (eg: 200MB/sec reads, 100MB/sec writes) and then apply a QoS policy to the volume as the limits set in the policy will override the Storage Volume specific settings."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9c356687-0bd4-4d94-b4d5-1fe34b4b7673>","<urn:uuid:7169fc32-85ea-4b4e-a786-903202444d46>"],"error":null}

No. 09/305,427 entitled “Method for Coordinating Activities And Sharing Information Using a Data Definition Language” filed May 5, 1999 still pending. That disclosure is incorporated in this document by reference.\nThe present invention is generally related to computer networking. More specifically, the present invention includes a mechanism that provides application-layer information persistence and exchange. This mechanism is scalable, generically applicable, transparently-distributed and based on the tuple-space model.\nMost modern computer systems are designed to use a layered approach to interprocess communication and networking. The layered approach subdivides the tasks associated with interprocess communication and networking into levels of abstraction. This has been found to be an effective method for reducing the complexity and increasing the reliability of programs and systems that use interprocess communication.\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has promulgated a commonly used standard that embodies a layered approach of this type. This standard, know as the ISO Network Reference Model, is based on seven different levels of abstraction. The seven layers are known as the application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link and physical layers.\nThe communications protocols used in the lower levels of the ISO Network Reference Model (i.e., the transport, network, data link and physical layers) are relatively well defined. As a result, these protocols tend to be used, for almost all applications that perform interprocess communication.\nUnfortunately, this type of homogeneity does not really exist at higher levels of the ISO Network Reference Model. Entities at these levels (i.e., the application, presentation and session layers) tend to interact with their peers using special-purpose protocols. Not surprisingly, this type of one off use does little to further the overall effectiveness of the ISO Network Reference Model. Instead, there is a tendency towards increased complexity and lost opportunities for software reuse.\nThe ISO Network Reference Model is, unfortunately, not the only networking environment that exhibits this lack of homogeneity. In fact, these symptoms are generally present (to a greater or lesser extent) in all layered interprocess communication and networking systems.\nFor these and other reasons, a need exits for more generic methods that provide interprocess communication at higher levels of layered interprocess communication and networking systems. Methods of this type would preferable provide uniform interprocess communication protocols at the application level of the ISO Network Reference Model. These methods would also preferably be scalable to work in networks of all sizes without significant performance degradation.\nThe present invention includes a method and apparatus for providing application-layer information persistence and exchange. For an exemplary embodiment, an information space is constructed to span a group of one or more server systems. The information space is based on the tuple-space paradigm first introduced for the Linda coordination model. A coordination entity manages storage of tuples within the information space. The coordination entity determines where in the information space tuples are stored. The coordination entity makes this determination both at initial tuple storage and as tuples are moved to achieve load balancing and other goals.\nApplications access stored tuples by requesting the tuple from their local servers. If the local server knows where the tuple is stored, the local server forwards the request directly to the storing server. In the alternative, (i.e., where the local server does not know where a tuple is stored), the local server queries the coordination entity for the tuple's location. The local server then uses the query result to request the tuple from the storing server. In this case the local server also records the location of the tuple for future reference. This allows the local server to directly request the tuple on subsequent accesses.\nIn some cases, a tuple will have moved after a local server has noted its previous location. If that local server requests the moved tuple, the previously storing server will receive the request. In this case, the previously storing server generates a re-route exception. The re-route exception causes the local server to query the coordination entity to determine the tuple's new location. This new location is then noted by the local server for future requests.\nThe use of tuples and tuple matching allows applications to use a common, flexible, lightweight format for information persistence and interchange. The applications may be local or remote and of heterogeneous types.\nAdvantages of the invention will be set forth, in part, in the description that follows and, in part, will be understood by those skilled in the art from the description herein. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims and equivalents.\nThe accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.\nFIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer network shown as an exemplary environment for an embodiment of the present invention.\nFIG. 2 is a block diagram of a server computer system as used in the network of FIG. 1.\nReference will now by made in detail to preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Each server 102 may also includes a disk drive 210 of any suitable disk drive type (equivalently, disk drive 210 may be any non-volatile mass storage system such as “flash” memory). The memory 204 includes browser 212 and agent 214.\nNetwork 100 and servers 102 provide the physical underpinnings for an information space. The information space allows applications, executing within network 100 to store and exchange information. The information space is based on the tuple-space paradigm first introduced for the Linda coordination model. Tuples in the information space are defined in terms of an abstract base class. The base class includes methods that correspond to the methods in the Linda coordination model. The methods include:\nThe use of these methods and their correspondence to the methods in the Linda coordination model are more completely described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/305,427 entitled “Method for Coordinating Activities And Sharing Information Using a Data Definition Language” filed May 5, 1999. That disclosure is incorporated in this document by reference. As described in that disclosure, the methods are preferably configured to store and retrieve information using XML—an emerging standard for internet data definition.\nIn general, it should be appreciated that the present invention is intended to have general applicability. Thus, the use of the particular methods described or the use of XML are intended to be exemplary. The present invention is specifically intended to be applicable to a wide range of Linda-like methods and information storage methodologies.\nThe base class is preferably used to define a single server subclass and a distributed server subclass. The single server subclass is used in cases where an information space is constructed to include only a single server 102. The distributed server subclass is used for cases like network 100 where multiple servers 102 are used. Each of these subclasses defines its own tuple subspace function. The tuple subspace function defined for the single server subclass directs all requests to store or access tuples to the single server 102. The tuple subspace function defined for the distributed server subclass routes all requests to store or access tuples to the server 102 where the tuple is or should be located.\nNetwork 100 includes a coordination entity. The coordination entity is a network service hosted by one of the servers 102 included in network 100. In some cases, the coordination entity may be replicated on several servers 102 to increase fault tolerance or throughput. The coordination entity manages the storage of tuples within the information space included in network 100. In general terms, this means that the coordination entity controls the distribution of tuples across servers 102 (tuple management). The coordination entity also plays a key role in helping applications find the servers 102 where tuples are located (tuple routing).\nThe coordination entity performs the tuple management function at various times to achieve various goals. As part of this role, the coordination entity determines where new tuples are stored as they are defined by applications within network 100. This determination is generally made in a way that distributes tuples across network 100. This tends to enhance both load-balancing and fault-tolerance. In other embodiments, tuples can be distributed to achieve other goals such as data-locality or server-preference. The coordination entity makes this initial determination each time the write () method is invoked to establish a new tuple.\nThe coordination entity may also perform the tuple management function to migrate existing tuples within network 100. This can be used, for instance, to redistribute tuples for better load balancing. Tuples may also be migrated as part of planned outages, fail-over or hot swapping of servers 102.\nThe coordination entity performs the tuple routing function whenever an application accesses a tuple within network 100. To perform an access of this type, an application invokes one of the read (), read-if-exists (), take () or take-if-exists () methods. These methods are configured to maintain a cache, preferable within each server 102, of known tuple locations. The methods consult this cache before attempting to access a tuple. If the location of a desired tuple is contained in the cache, the methods use the known location. The actual process of accessing the tuple can then proceed using a range of networking methods such as remote method invocation (RMI), remote procedure call (RPC) or socket.\nIn some cases, an access method will be unable to locate a desired tuple using the cache of know tuple locations. The access methods are configured to consult the coordination entity whenever a cache miss of this type occurs. The coordination entity can then provide an authoritative response detailing the location of the desired tuple. This location can be used to access the desired tuple. The response is also used to update the cache to record the location of the tuple.\nFor typical embodiments of the present invention, network 100 does not include a protocol that allows the various caches to be invalidated when a tuple is migrated or removed. The present invention provides for this contingency though the use of re-route exceptions. A server 102 that previously stored a tuple generates this exception if an accessing server attempts to access the now migrated or removed tuple. The access methods are configured to retry RMI, RCP, socket or other network operations that generate re-route exceptions. As part of the retry, the access methods consult the coordination entity. The coordination entity then provides an authoritative response detailing the location of the desired tuple. This location is used for the retry and used to update stale data located in the cache of the accessing server 102. In other cases, network 100 may be configured to use a protocol that automatically invalidates stale cache data through message passing or other methodology.\nThe Linda-like tuple interface combined with the distributed nature of the information space provides applications with a generic and scalable mechanism for information storage, persistence and exchange. Applications that use this mechanism may be local or remote. The mechanism fully supports use by heterogeneous applications.\nOther embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the invention being indicated by the following claims and equivalents."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:696dde96-9b5a-4303-b9f7-9d3afa9d5775>"],"error":null}

{"question":"As a researcher studying climate modeling, I'm curious: What is the main difference between the equilibrium method and transient method in climate projections, and how do their data requirements compare with those needed in brain mapping studies?","answer":"The equilibrium method and transient method differ significantly in their approach and complexity. The equilibrium method involves changing a single variable (like doubling CO2 concentration) and running the model to a new equilibrium, which is relatively simple and requires less computational resources. In contrast, the transient method uses time-dependent profiles of greenhouse gases and aerosols, providing time-dependent projections of climate change. This parallels the complexity seen in brain mapping, which requires multiple measurements and different imaging methods (like CAT scans, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor MRI) to create accurate brain maps. Both climate modeling and brain mapping need sophisticated computational resources - climate simulations require the largest, most capable computers available, while brain mapping involves processing complex 3D imaging data from multiple sources.","context":["The purpose of Brain Mapping is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the human brain. Brain research is a never-ending stream of discoveries. Scientists can better understand patients and their conditions by developing a detailed brain map. In addition, a more detailed map will help doctors understand patients better and help them enjoy life more. Let’s look closely at some of the projects and their goals.\nGoal of brain mapping\nThe ultimate goal of Brain Mapping Denver, CO is to map the brain to understand how it functions. In many ways, it’s like building a 3-D map of ten thousand cities. However, instead of counting the number of people living in each building, we must map the communication pathways within each brain region. According to Moritz Helmstaedter, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Munich, mapping the human brain is like attempting to figure out the layout of a city.\nThere are various ways to map the brain, including using different methods and comparing healthy brains to those of diseased individuals. CAT scans, for instance, use X-rays to look at the brain from several angles. On the other hand, structural magnetic resonance imaging uses the brain’s water content to create better resolution than a CAT scan. And diffusion tensor MRI, or DTI, uses water in the brain to create a 3D image of neurons and brain water movement.\nThe technology used for brain mapping has undergone a lot of revolutions over the last thirty years, allowing researchers to distribute and publish their results in the open. Brain mapping projects have created a positive environment for collaboration between neuroscientists and the public. Projects like ENIGMA and the Human Brain Project have provided a space for collaboration. Nevertheless, technological problems, such as implicit social and cultural biases, are associated with technology.\nOrganization for Human Brain Mapping\nYou may have heard about the Organization for Human Brain Mapping, or OHBM, but do you know who it is? OHBM is a scientific society that holds an annual meeting. The mission of this organization is to study the brain and its connections. It has a conference every year, and you can attend this to learn more about the science behind the process of human brain mapping. In addition, OHBM is a great place to learn about the latest breakthroughs in the field.\nThe OHBM was formed in 1995 in response to the rapid development of neuroimaging technology. OHBM provides a platform for cutting-edge research and promotes educational exchange and networking. The organization’s membership is growing yearly, and the OHBM holds annual conferences in different locations. However, before you plan for OHBM 2022, you should check out its website for more details. And while you’re there, don’t forget to check out the archived posters.\nThe OHBM Annual Meeting is an excellent place to learn about the latest advances in human brain mapping and brain imaging technology. You can talk to field researchers and learn from leading researchers. The conference features sessions that feature senior and junior scientists, as well as presentations on high-resolution imaging and open science methods. The OHBM Annual Meeting alternates locations in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The OHBM Annual Meeting has been a successful gathering for the last few years.\nProjects involved in brain mapping\nBrain mapping involves the study of the anatomy and function of the human brain. This research combines many disciplines, including neuroscience and engineering. Several methods are used, including neuroimaging and intraoperative neurosurgical procedures. Some projects involve mapping pain centers and identifying brain regions in patients with burning skin. These maps can be used to diagnose and understand the brain’s functioning. But one method can be misleading. Multiple measurements must be collected to gain the most accurate mapping, and a systematic approach is essential to the success of brain mapping.\nVarious global projects are involved in brain mapping. Brain mapping projects include the Human Brain Project, the BRAIN Initiative, and the Japan-based Brain/MINDS. These three projects aim to map the human brain in unprecedented detail. The BRAIN Initiative seeks to develop tools to map the human brain, while the Human Brain Project focuses on nonhuman primate brains. The goals of these projects vary, but they all have one thing in common: they aim to discover how human brains function and to find cures for diseases.\nOther fields that benefit from brain mapping include the development of higher-end supercomputers and more advanced techniques. The Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics describes the first kind of brain mapping as a study of anatomy and function through neurophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular and optogenetics. The research also incorporates nanotechnology. Researchers use techniques like MRI and x-ray imaging to map the human brain.","|Working Group I: The Scientific Basis|\n|Other reports in this collection|\n1.3.2 Modelling and Projection of Anthropogenic Climate\nThe nucleus of the most complex atmosphere and ocean models, called General Circulation Models (Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) and Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs)) is based upon physical laws describing the dynamics of atmosphere and ocean, expressed by mathematical equations. Since these equations are non-linear, they need to be solved numerically by means of well-established mathematical techniques. Current atmosphere models are solved spatially on a three-dimensional grid of points on the globe with a horizontal resolution typically of 250 km and some 10 to 30 levels in the vertical. A typical ocean model has a horizontal resolution of 125 to 250 km and a resolution of 200 to 400 m in the vertical. Their time-dependent behaviour is computed by taking time steps typically of 30 minutes. The impact of the spatial resolution on the model simulations is discussed in Section 8.9 of Chapter 8.\nModels of the various components of the climate system may be coupled to produce increasingly complex models. The historical development of such coupled climate models is shown in Box 3 of the Technical Summary. Processes taking place on spatial and temporal scales smaller than the model’s resolution, such as individual clouds or convection in atmosphere models, or heat transport through boundary currents or mesoscale eddies in ocean models, are included through a parametric representation in terms of the resolved basic quantities of the model. Coupled atmosphere-ocean models, including such parametrized physical processes, are called Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). They are combined with mathematical representations of other components of the climate system, sometimes based on empirical relations, such as the land surface and the cryosphere. The most recent models may include representations of aerosol processes and the carbon cycle, and in the near future perhaps also the atmospheric chemistry. The development of these very complex coupled models goes hand in hand with the availability of ever larger and faster computers to run the models. Climate simulations require the largest, most capable computers available.\nA realistic representation of the coupling between the various components of the climate system is essential. In particular the coupling between the atmosphere and the oceans is of central importance. The oceans have a huge heat capacity and a decisive influence on the hydrological cycle of the climate system, and store and exchange large quantities of carbon dioxide. To a large degree the coupling between oceans and atmosphere determines the energy budget of the climate system. There have been difficulties modelling this coupling with enough accuracy to prevent the model climate unrealistically drifting away from the observed climate. Such climate drift may be avoided by adding an artificial correction to the coupling, the so-called “flux adjustment”. The evaluation in Chapter 8 of recent model results identifies improvements since the SAR, to the point that there is a reduced reliance on such corrections, with some recent models operating with minimal or no adjustment.\nFor various reasons, discussed in Section 8.3 of Chapter 8, it is important to also develop and use simpler models than the fully coupled comprehensive AOGCMs, for example to study only one or a specific combination of components of the climate system or even single processes, or to study many different alternatives, which is not possible or is impractical with comprehensive models. In IPCC (1997) a hierarchy of models used in the IPCC assessment process was identified and described, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical processes are explicitly represented, the level to which empirical parametrization is involved, and the computational costs of running the models. In the IPCC context, simple models are also used to compute the consequences of greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Such models are tuned to the AOGCMs to give similar results when globally averaged.\nProjections of climate change\nThe quality of these simulations is assessed by systematically comparing the simulated climate with observations of the present climate. In this way the model is evaluated and its quality established. A range of diagnostic tools has been developed to assist the scientists in carrying out the evaluation. This step is essential to gain confidence in and provide a baseline for projections of human-induced climate change. Models may also be evaluated by running them under different palaeoclimate (e.g. Ice Age) conditions. Chapter 8 of this report presents a detailed assessment of the latest climate models of various complexity, in particular the AOGCMs. Once the quality of the model is established, two different strategies have been applied to make projections of future climate change.\nThe first, so-called equilibrium method is to change, e.g. double, the carbon dioxide concentration and to run the model again to a new equilibrium. The differences between the climate statistics of the two simulations provide an estimate of the climate change corresponding to the doubling of carbon dioxide, and of the sensitivity of the climate to a change in the radiative forcing. This method reduces systematic errors present in both simulations. If combined with simple slab ocean models, this strategy is relatively cheap because it does not require long runs to reach equilibrium. However it does not provide insight in to the time dependence of climate change.\nThe second, so-called transient, method, common nowadays with improved computer resources, is to force the model with a greenhouse gas and aerosol scenario. The difference between such simulation and the original baseline simulation provides a time-dependent projection of climate change.\nThis transient method requires a time-dependent profile of greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations. These may be derived from so-called emission scenarios. Such scenarios have been developed, among others by IPCC, on the basis of various internally coherent assumptions concerning future socio-economic and demographic developments. In the SAR the IPCC Scenarios IS92 were used (IPCC, 1994). The most recent IPCC emission scenarios are described in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakic´enovic´ et al., 2000). Different assumptions concerning e.g. the growth of the world population, energy intensity and efficiency, and economic growth, lead to considerably different emission scenarios. For example the two extreme estimates in the IPCC IS92 scenarios of the carbon dioxide emission by 2100 differ by a factor of 7. Because scenarios by their very nature should not be used and regarded as predictions, the term “climate projections” is used in this Report.\nTransient simulations may also be based on artificially constructed, so-called idealised, scenarios. For example, scenarios have been constructed, assuming a gradual increase of greenhouse gas concentrations followed by stabilisation at various levels. Climate simulations based on such idealised scenarios may provide insight in to the climate response to potential policy measures leading to a stabilisation of the GHG concentrations, which is the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as formulated in its Article 2. See Section 3 of Chapter 9 for an assessment.\nProjections from present models show substantial agreement, but at the same time there is still a considerable degree of ambiguity and difference between the various models. All models show an increase in the globally averaged equilibrium surface temperature and global mean precipitation. In Chapter 9 the results of various models and intercomparison projects are assessed. Model results are more ambiguous about the spatial patterns of climate change than about the global response. Regional patterns depend significantly on the time dependence of the forcing, the spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations and details of the modelled climate processes. Research tools have been developed to generate more reliable regional climate information. These tools and their results are presented and assessed in Chapter 10.\nTo study the impact of climate change, a plausible and consistent description of a possible future climate is required. The construction of such climate change scenarios relies mainly on results from model projections, although sometimes information from past climates is used. The basis for and development of such scenarios is assessed in Chapter 13. Global and regional sea-level change scenarios are reviewed in Chapter 11.\nPredictability, global and regional\nThe climate system is, as we have seen, such a non-linear complex system with many inherent time scales. Its predictability may depend on the type of climate event considered, the time and space scales involved and whether internal variability of the system or variability from changes in external forcing is involved. Internal variations caused by the chaotic dynamics of the climate system may be predictable to some extent. Recent experience has shown that the ENSO phenomenon may possess a fair degree of predictability for several months or even a year ahead. The same may be true for other events dominated by the long oceanic time-scales, such as perhaps the NAO. On the other hand, it is not known, for example, whether the rapid climate changes observed during the last glacial period are at all predictable or are unpredictable consequences of small changes resulting in major climatic shifts.\nThere is evidence to suggest that climate variations on a global scale resulting from variations in external forcing are partly predictable. Examples are the mean annual cycle and short-term climate variations from individual volcanic eruptions, which models simulate well. Regularities in past climates, in particular the cyclic succession of warm and glacial periods forced by geometrical changes in the Sun-Earth orbit, are simulated by simple models with a certain degree of success. The global and continental scale aspects of human-induced climate change, as simulated by the models forced by increasing greenhouse gas concentration, are largely reproducible. Although this is not an absolute proof, it provides evidence that such externally forced climate change may be predictable, if their forcing mechanisms are known or can be predicted.\nFinally, global or continental scale climate change and variability may be more predictable than regional or local scale change, because the climate on very large spatial scales is less influenced by internal dynamics, whereas regional and local climate is much more variable under the influence of the internal chaotic dynamics of the system. See Chapter 7 for an assessment of the predictability of the climate system.\nRapid climate change\nMore generally, with a rapidly changing external forcing, the non-linear climate system may experience as yet unenvisionable, unexpected, rapid change. Chapter 7, in particular Section 7.7, of this Report reviews and assesses the present knowledge of non-linear events and rapid climate change. Potential rapid changes in sea level are assessed in Chapter 126.96.36.199 Observing Anthropogenic Climate Change\nObserving the climate\nThe 20th century\nRegional changes are also apparent.

{"question":"What are key differences between male and female leadership styles in organizations, and how does emotional intelligence impact leadership effectiveness across genders?","answer":"Male and female leaders exhibit distinct leadership styles. Female leaders demonstrate higher levels of effort and performance, showing a more democratic and relationship-building approach with strong interpersonal relationships. In contrast, males tend to display more aggressive, hierarchical, and power-based leadership styles. However, some studies suggest there are more similarities than differences between genders in leadership. Regarding emotional intelligence's impact, research shows that leaders who can identify emotions in themselves and others are more effective, as they can accurately identify peer and group emotions. Emotional intelligence enhances cognitive processes and decision-making, with positive emotional intelligence triggering optimism while negative emotional intelligence leads to pessimism. This emotional awareness is particularly important in transformational leadership, where understanding and responding to subordinates' needs is crucial for promoting effective organizational change.","context":["The notion of good leadership and its effects on employees and the whole organization has long been accepted globally. Leaders have the audacity to regulate the organizational development and thus eventually enhance the outcomes of their employees. The impetus practiced by an organizational leader depicts their ethics and values, this is the reason why employees head towards their leaders whenever faced with any ethical or technical difficulty. This shows how important it is for a leader to show good work ethics and enthusiastic mindset. Studies have shown that a leader’s good work ethics can have a positive imprint on its employees ultimately leading to better and improved outcomes.\nEthics are basis for good administration in all types of organizations. A leader who practices proper work, intentions and values can never promulgate unethical and immoral behavior. According to a recent research conducted by (Rahaman et al., 2019), a leader’s approbatory stance towards good ethical behavior lay down the ground for his ethical ambitions and leadership. Leaders having good intentions and ethical behavior always consider the betterment of their organization in terms of both short and long term. They have the cognitive aptitude and the level of emotional-intelligence to differentiate between the wrong and the right way to successfully escalate their company’s success rate. Their positive attitude and values are therefore implicated in their work, actions and their goals. This has an optimistic effect on their employees as they learn and motivate themselves to work hard and achieve their goals.\nAccording to Treviño and colleagues, an ethical leader is described in context of two realms: a good person and a good manager. This means that if a person is morally correct then he would serve as a morally correct manager as well. A person with good morals is candid and reliable. He understands the situation of others and has a higher level of emotional-intelligence in every phase of life. The same person, which is a moral manager, would uses his values and customs to bring about an ethical administration at the workplace. Ethical managers set example of good customs by practicing themselves and make sure of their implementation at the workplace by exercising award and punishment approach (Brown & Mitchell, 2010). In summary, an ethically accurate manager has to be ethically befitting in order to promote a healthy and decent work environment.\nIn contrast, a leader or an employee can practice unethical behavior while having good intentions and values. This concept has been replicated recently when the term “unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB)” was coined. This is distinguish as any form of unethical work that is performed by the employees in order to benefit their organization but breaching the laws and ethical conduct of the community at the same time. This type of behavior can be detected at any level of the company. Their intentions of achieving bigger goals and directing the company towards the roads of success can sometimes lead them to do unethical or unlawful acts. Such acts come under the headings of either commission or omission. Confounding the validity dates in order to remarket expired items, corrupting consumers to pitch upon competitors, twiddling with the financial figures to escalate company’s value in the stock market are all unethical ways but leaders commit them to enhance the reputation of the company (Zhang et al., 2018).\nThe GLOBE project is an acronym for “Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness”. The concept of this plan was laid down in 1993 by “Robert J House” to analyze the norms, customs and values of different organizations worldwide. Moreover it also focuses on evaluating the beliefs of organizational leaders and its effect on the institutional success report. It focuses on the study of cross-cultural leadership that spreads in more than sixty countries’ culture worldwide (The GLOBE Project, n.d.). This research project has been very beneficial for all business set ups as it provides the important leadership traits that helps in the success of any organization. This project has created nine cultural and six leadership dimensions in order to evaluate differences in organizational and societal cultures. This knowledge of difference helps leaders to differentiate between their norms and that of other organization leading to a significant ramification on administrative department.\nAs the time passes, the world is transforming into a global village. The import and export of goods and other services has become twice in the last ten years while it has been estimated that the transactions between countries will increase the total transaction within the countries (Javidan & Dastmalchian, 2009). With more and more countries collaborating with each other culturally and business wise, it is imperative to understand the norms and values of all those cultures to promote smooth business strategies. In the same way, it has become important for all the leaders to better understand the cultural differences in order to understand their employees, customers and the international market. When organizations decide to go global, they should train their managers and leaders to deeply study the cultural values, norms and beliefs of the society of that country as depicted by the GLOBE project.\nGLOBE project is essential for worldwide leaders so that they can effectually acquaint themselves with all domains of universal congruous businesses. Because when dealing with international businesses, managers need to acquire the circumstances of the place they are dealing with. For example, Walmart is a very successful store business in America with huge freestanding stores surrounded by vast parking lots. But when they expanded their business in Mexico, people found it difficult to walk to the store as majority of their population travelled by buses. Later on, they added shuttle busses for their customers to help them reach the store (Dimensions of Cultural Difference and Their Effect | Principles of Management, n.d.). As GLOBE project aids cross-cultural business, it not only help managers to realize the difficulties their employees face but also the adversities faced by their customers. This abets the globalization of the firm and motivates the culturally diverse staff that their difficulties are being heard and thus they work hard for the expansion of their organization.\nGender discrimination at work place has always been a debating topic. Females have always been treated as unequal competitors to males in a workplace where they clearly showed traits of higher abilities. This inequality not only effects the productive outcomes of the organization itself but also lowers the morale of the employee who is being discriminated. Stereotypes play a huge role when it comes towards gender-discrimination in the workplace. For example, a cliché regarding sales marketing is that women are less able and less competitive in this field as compared to men. As a result, less women are hired in this scope of expertise and if they are hired they are not given the promotion and appreciation that they deserve for their credibility (Heilman & Caleo, 2018).\nThere are many types of gender discrimination that could be experienced in a workplace and the victim could be anyone irrespective of them being a male or a female. Some of the forms of gender discrimination includes direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and victimization (Sex Discrimination | Equality and Human Rights Commission, n.d.). In context to the particular scenario of Jones, Madison, and Conklin organization presented, the form of discrimination faced by Laura was “direct discrimination”. This type of discrimination occurs when a person is treated in an unfair manner as opposed to an employee of an opposite gender who is in the same position. As the organization was male- dominated and fairly informal, Laura was unable to incorporate herself in the workplace environment. Moreover, all the challenging projects were deliberately given to male employees despite of her being more qualified and credible. This not only lowered her morale but harmed her portfolio as well.\nFirstly, Laura should have had read the company’s policies before joining as it should have mentioned to protect every employee from any type of discrimination. Now that she was a victim and even after talking to the company’s president could not resolve her issue, she should have had issued a complaint on different helplines and commissions that would have had assisted ber regarding her rights in the particular case. Her boss on the other hand, should have evaluated the unconscious or conscious biasness among the employees and had mediated the situation right then and there by realizing the form of discrimination faced by Laura and redistributing the projects irrespective of employee’s gender. The boss should have been forethoughtful, unbiased and used objective criteria while evaluating company’s employees. One most important thing that a boss should realize is that every employee should have a mentor in the company who helps them and gives them pieces of advice during any difficulty (Verniers & Vala, 2018).\nUsing the Internet, survey current research comparing male and female leaders, summarize the major trends.\nIt has always been a taboo in our society that females can never be a good leader and that they lack good leadership abilities. This is why when it came to running a company or a country, a male leader has always been preferred. However, the time is changing and that too very rapidly. Females are now being recognized as a competitive leadership no matter what the institution is. Whether it is running a country like Benazir Bhutto (former Prime Minister of Pakistan) and Jacinda Ardern (the current Prime Minster of New Zealand) or being Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors. Women have started to own businesses, schools, universities, fashion brands, property dealing and so much more. Female leadership has been an intriguing source of ponder for many researchers, especially the contrast of male and female way of leadership. Many studies have been conducted to compare and contrast the male and female leadership; the way they think, act and implement their values and beliefs while leading an organization.\nAs a result of different personality traits, cognitive abilities and way of thinking, there are a few differences that makes female and male leaders to stand out from each other. Female leaders display “higher levels of effort, performance, and advancement across organizations” (Jenni, 2017). They possess skills that are required to manage an organization on a higher level. Women depict a more democratic style while administrating in an organization and have a strong interpersonal relationships and objective achievements as compared to men (Gardiner & Tiggemann, 1999). Females tend to demonstrate a conjoint, vicarious and a way of leadership style that is more contributing whereas on the other hand, males are more like rivalrous and power based managerial style (Robinson & Lipman-Blumen, 2003). Males tend to depict an “aggressive and hierarchical” mode of leadership as opposed to more rewarding and relationship building mode of female leaders (Sabharwal et al., 2017).\nIn the contrary, according to some studies, there are not much differences but similarities between the leadership style of male and female (Jenni, 2017). Similarly, there is no major dissimilarities amongst female and male managers’ transformational leadership styles as well as in their emotional intelligence (Mandell & Pherwani, 2003). This means that no matter the gender of the managers, how they lead and how they perceive the feelings of others is somehow the same. A study accomplished by (Silva & Mendis, 2017) suggests that females prefer more transformational leadership style as compared to men because they are more objective in achieving their goals whereas men are subjective when it comes to completion of a task and hence are more effective leaders as compared to Men (Sabharwal et al., 2017). Surprisingly, it has been noticed that female leaders working in a male dominated workplace tend to alter their working style similar to men in fear of losing the job and position (Gardiner & Tiggemann, 1999).","Understanding Emotional Intelligence in Relationship to Leadership\nSenior charge Nurse\nWhat makes a good leader? Is there a simple uncomplicated answer to that small question? In all probability that is unlikely. Finding a definition that would describe this concept has never been agreed (Swansburg & Swansburg 2002). In all probability the lack of a clear concise definition is almost certainly due to the fact that leadership is a multi-complex concept; taking in styles, personality, organisational and political influences, ones ability to mentor or coach, effective communication, critical and creative thinking and effective team building. These are just a few titles of the many aspects of this concept, with each aspect further covering a vast array of sub headings.\nIt is the focus of this article to look at a very different area – the area of emotional intelligence (EI/EQ)—for the essence of this article emotional intelligence will be abbreviated as EI. Caruso et al (2002) described EI as the ability to perceive emotion, to access and generate emotion, to assist thought, and finally to understand emotion, emotional knowledge and intellectual growth. Additionally, Goleman (2001) puts forward the notion that EI refers to ones ability to recognise and regulate emotions in oneself and others.\nTraditionally emotion and intelligence were considered two separate entities. Emotion was considered to perceive feelings, empathy and sentiment, whereas intelligence was considered analytical, aptitude and intellect. Charles Darwin, who, in 1872 published his work on emotions in man and animals, viewed the emotional intelligence system as a necessity for the survival of the fittest. According to Darwin it is not the strongest of the species that survives, or the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.\nSubsequently EI would appear to follow on from Robert Sternberg’s (1985) work on ‘practical intelligence’ and is consistent with theorizing by Nancy Cantor and John Kihlstrom (1987) about ‘social intelligence’. Considering briefly the work of Wechsler (1940), who argued that intelligence carries two elements, non-intellective’ and ‘intellective’. These ‘non-intellective’ elements, as argued by Wechsler (1940) were affective, personal and social factors. Additionally he argued that the non-intellective abilities were necessary for predicting one’s capabilities to succeed.\nMayer & Salovey (1995) brought the concept of emotional intelligence to the forefront of contemporary ideology, with the conceptualization that they describe more specifically by outlining the competencies it encompasses.\nIn their well published ‘Ability Model’ (1995) they organize these competencies along four branches:\n(1) The ability to perceive, appraise, and express emotion accurately;\n(2) The ability to access and generate feelings when they facilitate cognition;\n(3) The ability to understand affect-laden information and make use of emotional knowledge;\n(4) The ability to regulate emotions to promote growth and well-being.\nIt could perhaps be argued that EI is rather broad and includes a range of adaptive characteristics associated with emotions for example, the ability to effectively communicate emotions (Goleman, 2001). Whereas, other principles of EI places emphasis on the cognitive elements, such as emotions aiding judgment and memory (Mayer et al 2000). Furthermore, researchers have conceptualized emotional intelligence both as an ability and as a trait (Goleman 2001 Mayer et al 2001, Schutte & Malouff 1999). Conversely, it has been argued that EI provides little in the way of substantial evidence and that it is no more than assumptions which contrary to what researchers have come to expect when studying types of intelligence (Eysenck 2000). Similarly, Locke (2005) claims that the concept of EI is in itself a misinterpretation of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp abstractions—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labelled and referred to as skills. How does EI link with Leadership?\nLooking at the arguments discussed here, how does EI link with leadership? Does it have a place?\nLeadership is the ability to get the job done with and through others, while at the same time winning their confidence, respect, loyalty and cooperation. Arguably the first part of this statement could also be akin to management. However, the second part of the statement highlights the differences that can exist between a leader and a non- leader. Empirical evidence suggests that the ability for a leader to identify emotions and feelings within themselves also allows them to accurately identify with the emotions of peers and groups, and correctly identify these emotions (Caruso et al 2002).\nGeorge (2000) suggests that leaders’ use of emotions can enhance cognitive processes and decision making. He furthermore reports on evidence that positive EI triggers optimism and initiates positive perception and perspectives. George (2000), additionally offers the contrasting comparison of negative EI triggers, proposing that this will ultimately result in pessimism and negativism.\nThere are many styles of leadership and it is unlikely than any one leader uses the same style all of the time. As situations change then styles will adapt to accommodate that change.\nHowever if we briefly examine two of these styles, that of transformational and transactional leadership.\nThen the link between EI and transformational leadership is fairly obvious.\nTransformational leaders raise the motivation of followers to reach far beyond their established standards and are individuals who promote effective change individually and holistically in their organization. They achieve this by understanding their followers. Subsequently it could be argued that this holistic understanding is achieved by the leader having a commonality of understanding with their followers and their EI. Research undertaken by Palmer et al (2001) provided evidence that emotional intelligence correlated with several components of transformational leadership suggesting that it may be an important component of effective leadership. In particular emotional intelligence may account for how effective leaders monitor and respond to subordinates and make them feel at work.\nConversely, transactional leaders are essentially extrinsic motivators, achieving their outcomes by being target orientated. The transactional leader is much more akin to the traditional managerial concept and recognizes the need for the day-to-day running of the organization (Marquis & Huston 2003). Marturano (2004) argues that transactional leadership is built on reciprocity, the idea that the relationship between leader and their followers develops from the exchange of some reward, such as performance ratings, pay, recognition, and praise. Subsequently, Marturano (2004) suggests, that it involves leaders clarifying goals and objectives, communicating to organize tasks and activities with the co-operation of their employees to ensure that wider organizational goals are met.\nAlthough transformational leadership is held as the current ideal and leaders with these qualities are highly desirable, many theorists argue that this style alone will fail if not coupled with transactional qualities (Bass et al 1987, Dunham and Klafehn 1990, Bennis 1989).\nPerhaps the most effective leaders are the ones who practice situational leadership. Arguably this encompasses all elements of leadership and adapts and changes as the situation dictates. The fundamental ethos behind this theory is that there is no one leadership style that will suit every occasion ( Hersey 1985).\nTo link EI with situational leadership, Goleman et al (2004) identified with the elements of EI and situational leadership emphasizing the need for managers/leaders to change as the situation changes. This can be compared with Hersey ( 1995) descriptor, which depicts similar concepts.\nEmotional intelligence is not a new concept, but it would appear to be one that is divided between what can be proven by scientific evaluation and the concept of theorists. It can however display many benefits in its understanding that intellect and intelligence are not necessarily the same.\nI feel that it can be argued that if EI is used in conjunction with transformational leadership then it can enhance the emotional intellect of followers and motivate them to levels that they may have been essentially unaware of.\nSubsequently if it were possible to enable leaders to have less managerial responsibilities and focus on their leadership qualities then the need for the transactional element would be greatly reduced.\nHowever in today’s health care culture the latter suggestion is unlikely to materialize. Therefore we look set to adopt a multi-faceted style of leadership, ideally one that also enables us to allow the development of emotional intelligence. Perhaps this concept would provide accommodation for more situational leaders to emerge?\nBass, B.M., Avoliio, B.J., Goodheim, L.(1987) “Biography and the assessment of transformational leadership at the world-class level”, Journal of Management (Jan), pp.7-19.\nBennis.

{"question":"I'm doing research on sustainable farming transitions - can anyone compare the agricultural extension program's approach to shiitake farming in North Carolina with the recommended beginner methods for King Stropharia cultivation?","answer":"The North Carolina Agricultural Extension program and King Stropharia cultivation represent two different approaches to mushroom farming. The NC program focused on helping tobacco farmers transition by providing spores for 25 logs (3-4 feet long, 4-8 inches diameter) in exchange for research data, requiring farmers to maintain 200-250 logs for study. In contrast, King Stropharia cultivation is simpler, requiring only fresh hardwood chips mixed with sawdust spawn and spread into landscape or garden areas at 3-8 inches depth. The NC program involves more intensive management of log moisture, shade conditions (80% shade), and specific seasonal timing (March to late April), while King Stropharia mainly needs fresh woodchips (non-conifer) and will naturally fruit in spring and fall with minimal maintenance.","context":["We got involved with Shiitake Mushrooms through our Agricultural Cooperative Extension Agency. This is how our farm became \"The Mushroom Hut @ Fox Farms\".\nBack in 2003, our local office started a program to help the traditional tobacco farmer transition into some other type of crop. Shiitakes were considered, and still are, a specialty crop. What they proposed for the farmer was edible and medicinal mushrooms. That way, there were two avenues a farmer could pursue with his mushrooms. You can go with “edible” and sell to farmers markets, restaurants, and health food stores. “Medicinal” you can pursue the herbal stores and sometimes you can reach out to acupuncturists office and clinics. A diversified farm would do both!\nThe Ag office proposed to the farmer an agreement. The Ag office would provide the farmer enough organic mushroom spore to inoculate 25 logs ( 3 to 4 feet long by 4 to 8 inches in diameter) in exchange for data collected by the farmer on how well the mushrooms produced. The farmer had to agree to keep approximately 200 to 250 logs for research. The spore was being provided by NC A & T, a college associated with our NC Agricultural Extension Agency. Dr. Omon was in charge of this program. The farmer would be given bags of spore with batch numbers only. When giving their data information, the farmer would refer to the batch number. This was, and is ongoing, research to see which strains of Shiitake do best in which areas of North Carolina.\nMost preferred is: Red and White Oaks. Sweetgum is also indicated. The reason these are preferred over others is that they will produce/last longer due to their high wood density and strong bark — you don’t want the bark to be too thick! Here at the farm we have used Maple, Beech, Ash, Cherry and Birch.\nAsh takes longer to produce fruit. The others are good producers but the bark doesn’t hold up long — experiment to see what works for you and keep records (a regular calendar is great to write your notes on). Make sure the bark is in good condition whichever trees you decide to use.\nThe trees should be cut in late fall to late winter (early spring only if sap is NOT up). Be careful not to scuff up the bark — this is very important for several reasons. Ragged bark can allow other fungi to invade the bark. Also, this will allow moisture loss and could slow down fruiting or keep it from fruiting at all.\nIt is recommended to use 3 to 4 feet long and 3 to 8 inches in diameter. It depends on what size you can manage, because you will be moving the logs around — keep this in mind when deciding on size. After cutting the logs, if you are not going to use them for a few weeks, make sure they don’t dry out. Keep them out of direct sunlight, keep them watered if it is unusually dry or keep them loosely covered if it is too rainy. Make sure there is air circulation.\nFind an area suitable for the production of the Shiitake. If you have an area that is naturally shaded by trees that is an ideal area for your \"log yard\". If you are going to “force” fruiting, you will need access to water, so this will be a consideration when deciding where to put your logs. 80 percent shade is suggested.\nIt is suggested, here in Western North Carolina, to start in March and complete by late April. It is best to use the trees as soon as possible after cutting. The production will be much better because moisture content is high. Have your spawn ready, if you order before you are ready to use you can keep it in the bottom of your refrigerator until ready to use.\nRead Part 2 to learn information on materials needed, preparing to inoculate your logs, care of your logs, and then the harvest!\nSusan Tipton-Fox continues the farming and preserving practices that had been passed down to her by her family.

The following species are recommended for beginners based on their high rate of success and also the methods and materials are easy to source.\nMushrooms fruit when they run out of space to colonize, so when they take over a log, mulch pile, bag of pasteurized wheat straw, or compost bed they are capable of fruiting. Check out our Growing Resources page for books, PDFs, and videos that will walk you through the basics of cultivation.\nEasiest Outdoor Production?\nOutdoors on Logs – Shiitake\nShiitake mushrooms grown on logs outdoors is one of the easiest mushrooms for beginners to learn the cycles of mushroom production. Although oyster mushrooms may fruit easiest, they are insect prone, so Shiitakes are the one to start with. All log grown mushrooms are grown on fresh cut logs, so you will need to cut some fresh hardwood logs, preferably oak (check tree chart for alternatives), that is less than a month old cut from living healthy trees, 6-10” diameter logs are best. Logs are drilled with holes spaced out 4-5” around the entire bark covered surface and filled with either plug or sawdust spawn. Sawdust spawn can inoculate up to 100 linear feet o wood. Plug spawn can inoculate up to 10 linear feet of wood. The spawn is inserted, plug spawn is tapped in flush with a hammer and the sawdust is injected (with a plunger or stuffed in manually). Wax is melted in a jar sitting in hot water and brushed on with a small brush to cover the holes after the spawn is inserted. After all holes are spawned and waxed you are done spawning! Water logs occasionally, every week if it doesn’t rain, and after 8-10 months the mushrooms should have colonized and begin to fruit.\nShiitake comes in three strain types: Cold (33-50), Wide Range (50-75), and Warm/Hot (75-100)\nSpawn all of the strain types at the same time. They will fruit when the temperature window comes around AFTER the initial 8-10 months colonization has completed. Each strain fruits twice a year, and you may soak 10% of each strain types every week to optimize your weekly harvest and repeat after the first cycle. Once the logs have fruited twice in a season let them rest, tarping them to dry, and initiating soaking again when the next season comes back around.\nSoaking – To soak logs submerge them in water (well or city), for 12-24 hours, NO MORE, it will drown them.\nFruiting – After soaking lean logs up against trees or cross stack them in a log cabin pattern and the mushrooms should emerge in a few days, keep these logs watered twice a day!\nPicking – When shiitake caps flatten they are mature and can be twisted and harvested.\nLog Resting – After harvesting, the logs can rest for 8-10 weeks, should be tarped to dry, and can be resoaked for a second time each year to produce another flush, after that they can be tarped until the following season. Shiitake logs can go dry for up to a year with no water and still live, so only water them when you want them to fruit!\nOutdoors on Wood Chips – King Stropharia (Stropharia rugoso-annulata)\nKing Stropharia, also known as Garden Giant and Wine Cap, is a hardwood chip loving mushroom that naturalizes easily in landscape mulch and gardens. It will not grow on conifer, so you will need fresh mushroom wood chips (from healthy trees and cut within a few weeks).\nYou will need SAWDUST SPAWN for King Stropharia, and its as easy as mixing in the crumbled spawn into fresh wood chips (it helps to wet the chips first), and spread the spawn and chips into the landscape, between rows of vegetables, or top dress tree rings with the mixture to a depth of 3-8”.\nKing stropharia fruit in the spring and fall, if you spawn your chips in the spring they will fruit in the fall.\nOutdoors on Manure Compost – Almond Portabella (Agaricus subrufescens/A.blazei)\nAlmond Portabellas are the cousins of the common white button and the crimini/portabella complex. Interestingly they are a tropical cousin that prefer to fruit at 75-90F, love composted livestock manure, making them a perfect candidate as a garden additive to intercrop mushrooms into vegetable beds or row crops.\nYou will need SAWDUST SPAWN that can be crumbled and mixed into the manure, which can then be turned into the soil or made into a bed all by itself.\nEasiest Indoor Production?\nOyster mushrooms can grow on a variety of wastes, including spent coffee grounds, recycled paper, cardboard, even cotton clothing.\nYou will need SAWDUST SPAWN for oyster mushrooms on bulk media. The easiest way to start is by collecting spent coffee grounds (daily in your kitchen or ask a local coffee shop to save them). Make sure they are fresh and collected daily using your own container, coffee grounds can get colonized by a competitor green mold easy.\nContainer – Use a gallon screw top container or a 5 gallon bucket with a lid. Add your coffee and filter daily for personal use, sprinkling sawdust spawn into the container sparingly, like you are salting it. If you have a large amount from a coffee shop dump the coffee into a large clean tub and mix 2 cups of sauwdust spawn for every 5 gallons of coffee waste into the media. After mixing dump the coffee back into the bucket to colonize. Fill bucket but leave about 2” of space or so for the developing baby mushrooms.\nSpawn run – Watch your bucket daily, it should start to turn white and begin to colonize, finally taking over the entire volume of coffee. Keep lid cracked very slightly so it can breathe, but not dry out. If it looks dry water it to moisten. Once the mass is solid and white, it will think about fruiting. Baby mushrooms will form after a few weeks and you can mist them with clean water, move lid open slight every day to accommodate the growth, since they can be large. Harvest when they have stopped growing, return lid to its cracked position for two weeks, then pour two cups of water into the bucket to rehydrate the media and repeat the steps of fruiting. It will fruit 2-3 times, maybe more!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12a1aebd-2bb8-44ef-98f9-3ed28f8ad443>","<urn:uuid:7f791ebc-bcc1-4da4-b152-51fa81ee7062>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What equipment is needed for professional audio capture during live streaming, and how does scripting contribute to successful video presentations?","answer":"For professional audio capture, external microphones are strongly recommended over built-in camera microphones. External audio devices provide better quality, additional control over elements like gain, and monitoring capabilities. They also offer portability and flexibility in positioning to capture desired sounds while avoiding unwanted noise. Regarding scripting, it's essential to prepare either a full script or at least bullet points as a checklist, regardless of subject matter expertise. This preparation helps ensure all salient points are covered and enables seamless delivery, especially when one-take recordings are required. If using an auto-cue, the script should be adjusted to match natural speaking style rather than writing style, with unnecessary content removed. The script should also consider whether responses need to be contextually complete, particularly if interviewer questions won't be included in the final edit.","context":["Top tips for presenting to camera\nSeptember 17th, 2013\nThis article is geared toward anyone who has little or no experience presenting to camera. Perhaps you are an employer – or employee – of a business that’s looking to produce a corporate video, and someone suggested it would be better to have someone from within be the face of the business for that video. And they have selected you.\nWhat do you need to do to prepare for presenting to a camera, what do you need to expect on the day of video production, and what top tips should you know to get your presentation done just right?\n1. At Ceres Productions we strongly recommend that you prepare a script, even if it is a set of bullet points to be covered – a kind of checklist – that you can tick off as you go through your presentation on the day. We recommend this, no matter how well you may know your subject. There’s nothing worse than removing that lapel microphone, satisfied that it’s all over, only to realise you didn’t mention a salient point and you have to start all over again.\n2. Another reason why its best to work from a script or at least know the points you need to cover is that you may need to get it all done in one seamless take. So we recommend you know beforehand the kind of video you will be presenting for. Will part of your presentation become voice-over, masked by other visual material, will there be more than one frame-size of you to give the editor more options to work with, or will there be no option to edit out a fluffed line or cut to another take for a portion of the presentation? Knowing whether you will have the option of doing what is called a ‘pick-up’ will allow you to better understand the degree of preparation that will be required of you.\n3. Have someone you trust with you on the day, preferably someone who is familiar with the material you will be covering and can advise you should there be any last minute changes or can pick up on any minor slip-ups of information, is strongly recommended.\n4. Know whether you will be presenting straight to camera or whether you will be directing your gaze off-camera, as if speaking to an interviewer. There are benefits and drawbacks from doing either, and what it really boils down to is the style of video you or your business may be looking for. Talking directly to camera can be quite inhibiting and there is the risk of looking like a deer caught in headlights. The benefit, if it is done right, is that it can provide a more personable and direct style of communicating, as the viewer will feel you are addressing them directly. You may also have the benefit of being able to use an autocue – see more information on this later. The benefit of directing your gaze just off-camera is that you are able to address someone directly (another good reason to have someone with you that you trust), and your tone and presentation may come across more natural and conversational.\n5. Whichever you decided, to keep your gaze on the camera or on someone just off-camera, ensure that your gaze remains fixed there. Beware of your eyes flicking away from your focal point, as the camera (and your audience) will pick it up and it will be a distraction to what you’re saying. The surest way of keeping this to a minimum is to remove any distractions in your line of sight. There should be no other people in your field of vision and the camera operator should stay as still as possible and have his eyes firmly on his camera’s frame and not on you.\n6. Accept the fact that you will have to wear some make-up. Unless you are outdoors and in very cool conditions, you will perspire, if not from nerves then from the lights that ensure you look good on camera. All that will be required is a little matte powder on your nose, cheeks and forehead. Even professional presenters perspire.\n7. Know your environment so you know what you will be contending with. Will you be indoors, and therefore requiring the aforementioned lighting? Or will you be outside where there are more uncontrollable distractions, including more chances of noise pollution that will require you to project your voice a bit more?\n8. Wherever you film, ensure you are not wearing any fabric with detailed patterns on it, or close lines or tight stripes, as this can cause a fluttering effect on the recorded image that can be distracting in the final edit.\n9. Elocution: Remember to enunciate your words, and don’t mumble. Most importantly, vary your tone but not your volume.\n10. If you have someone prompting you with questions, then know whether their voice will be included in the finished edit or not. If not then you will need to provide full answers to questions. Ensure that your answers are contextually relevant, so that anyone who has not heard the question will still understand the point you are making in the context in which it was asked.\n11. Own your frame-size. Know how much of your body is in shot, how much of your arms and hands are visible. The smaller you are in the frame, the more expressive you can be. The tighter the shot, the more you should constrain your movement. Whatever you do, keep it natural.\nFinally, if you are addressing the camera directly, then you may have the option of using an auto-cue, as noted above. If so, you will then have probably produced a script. Preparation with that more full-fledged script should be a case of ‘rehearse, rinse, and repeat!’ What we mean by this is that you should read the script aloud, abbreviating words as you go along, adjusting the script to your style of speaking rather than your writing style; cut out the fluff; and then start again. When presenting through the autocue, don’t fall into the trap of simply reading the script but imagine the camera is a single person with whom you are having a conversation. Here it becomes even more important than ever to vary your tone of voice, to smile, and especially to relax. Pace yourself, don’t rush. All the above points of presenting to camera should also apply.","Want to know how to setup a live stream?\nThis article walks you through 8 steps from start to finish in terms of managing the sources and settings for your live stream. This includes everything from choosing a video source and lighting, to a live encoder and managing your connection. If you consider yourself already setup on the video and audio side, skip to step 4. However, if you want to know more about this step of the process or are considering establishing a studio, please read our Video Studio Recommendations guide.\n- Camera or other video source selection\n- Lighting setup\n- Audio source selection\n- Choosing a delivery method\n- Selecting an encoder for live streaming\n- Inputting encoder settings\n- Securing a stable upload speed\n1. Camera or other video source selection\nThe first step in your live stream setup is to select a video source, or sources. This will often be a camera, although can also be a screen as well, such as a powerpoint presentation or footage of a video game being played as another example. If you are doing a screenshare, this will come into play in step 5 when selecting your encoder.\nIf you are using a camera, this step will vary based on what kind of camera it is. If you are using a webcam, that’s it. That’s your video source and you will need to connect this to your encoder. If your camera is not a webcam, then you will need a capture card or capture device, depending on your encoder. This is a hardware device that connects to your computer. If you are unsure on if you need a capture card, a simple rule here can be if you intend to use a software based encoder and your camera outputs HDMI, HD-SDI, or component then you’ll need a capture device.\n2. Lighting setup\nNaturally, if your broadcast is a screenshare, this step can be skipped. If you are using a camera, though, you should consider the lighting of your subject. If you are outside, in a low controlled environment, plan to do some tests at different spots to see what might be optimal for your broadcast.\nIf you have a more controlled environment, like a studio, consider a three point lighting system. This involves a key light, a fill light and a back light. The purpose of this approach is to properly illuminate a subject in an effective way, avoiding deep shadows. Advantages of three point lighting go beyond just that it’s pleasing to the eye, though, as its also relatively simple to setup. Not only that but by using three different light sources you have more control over how the subject is being illuminated, and control will be a reoccurring theme here.\nTo better demonstrate this, below is an excellent video walkthrough on setting up lighting for a live stream.\n3. Audio source selection\nNext up is securing an audio source. This might be one source or multiple, such as using your encoder to bring in additional sources that could include previously recorded audio files.\nIf using a camera, this could also be a built-in microphone, although this is suggested against. In general you will want to secure an external microphone. This is for both quality and portability. On the quality side, external audio devices give you added support for monitoring the audio while also additional control over elements like gain. The portability is also an important element as it gives you flexibility in your broadcasting. You aren’t tied to doing a shoot with the participant sitting right in front of the camera to pick up their audio. More importantly, you have the freedom to place the mic in the optional position where it can pick up the sound you want, and hopefully avoid the sound you don’t want in your broadcast.\n4. Choosing a delivery method\nWith your video and audio source selected, your next step is choosing a delivery method. This can be going direct to a CDN (Content Delivery Network), although if so will add a lot more steps like securing a video player. As a result, for many the delivery method will come down to selecting a live streaming platform to utilize.\nIBM Cloud Video is an example here. It not only already comes with a video player, but also enhanced delivery capabilities. This is done through a distribution model that includes multiple CDNs. Called SD-CDN (Software Defined Content Delivery Network), this method offers QoS (Quality of Service) where information is relayed from the viewer’s experience back to the platform. One element of this is buffering, and the service responds to this data by trying to optimize the experience. This can include changing not just bitrates but also different CDNs. A side effect of this is not just scalability, but reliability as documented in this Live Video Delivery System Built for Scalability white paper.\n5. Selecting an encoder for live streaming\nSo you have your delivery method locked down, the next step is your encoder. If you are unfamiliar with what a video encoder is and why you need it, in a nutshell it converts the video input into a digital format. In this context, it’s the process of digitizing your video content so that you can send it somewhere online.\nThere are different types of encoders out there, although a lot of live streaming is done under the RTMP (Real Time Message Protocol) format, which is based on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Generally you need to check with your provider before selecting a format, although in the case of IBM Cloud Video and Ustream RTMP is needed. Now this encoder can be software based, hardware based or even “app” based on your mobile device.\nA few examples of software based encoders that output in RTMP include:\n- Ustream Producer\n- Telestream Wirecast\n- Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder\n- OBS: Open Broadcast Software\nOn the hardware side, a few examples include:\nIn addition, broadcasters can also use the browser based IBM Cloud Video Broadcaster as well, although it has limitations such as not being capable of HD broadcasting.\nFeatures across these encoders differ. Some of the software ones, like vMix or Wirecast, can be used to screenshare as well and also switch between video sources. So if you plan to have a multi-camera shoot, or switch between a presenter and a screenshare, factor this into your encoder selection.\n6. Inputting encoder settings\nAfter you have your encoder selected, the next step is entering settings so that you can broadcast to your platform or end source of choice. This will vary greatly based on your provider, although generally it involves entering in an RTMP URL and a Stream Key in the encoder.\nIn the case of IBM Cloud Video and Ustream, this information is found in the dashboard. First click the live channel you want to stream to. Now go to “Broadcast Settings” and then click “Encoder Settings”. This will give you a screen like the left where you are given the RTMP URL and the Stream Key for manual entry into the encoder. If you are using an encoder that accepts XMLs, like Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder, you can also download this file and open it in the encoder, which will remove the manual entry step as these details are contained in that file.\nAn alternate method to this is logging into your account directly from the encoder. A variety of solutions, from Wirecast to vMix support this. For Ustream accounts, this can mean logging in directly with the email and password you use to access your account. For IBM Cloud Video accounts, this involves using the Device Password feature to generate login details.\nAfter logging in, you can set a few quality options, including the keyframe interval. Usually this should be set for 2 second, and many defaults will be set like this, but if not make sure to do the change. Also disable any “auto” keyframe option that might be on. For more details on this, read our Keyframes, InterFrame & Video Compression article. Another quality option is your resolution and bitrate, the latter of which will be dependent on the next requirement: your upload speed.\n7. Securing a stable upload speed\nIt can be hard to stress how important your Internet connection is as part of how to setup a live stream. To execute a live broadcast, you’ll want a fast, stable connection. Upload speed is the key to delivering a live stream, and one rule of thumb is to secure an upload speed that is twice as fast as the quality you plan to broadcast at. So if you are streaming at 2mbps, you’ll want a 4mbps upload speed.\nMake sure to test your Internet speed at the location you plan to broadcast at. Here is an Network Upload Speed Tester that you can utilize. It’s recommended to do the test a few times and then average them to get an idea of your upload speed.\nOther considerations include the type of connection you have. If you can, try to secure a wired connection for your broadcast. The reason for this is that a wired connection is both faster and more stable than a wireless connection, both traits that can be instrumental in a successful broadcast. One attributing factor to this is that Wi-Fi is more subject to interference. This can include physical objects blocking the signal to interference from electrical devices or even other Wi-Fi networks. This interference can lead to dropped signals, which might not seem like a big deal when browsing websites and having to click refresh after a failed load, but will be a major issue when broadcasting the signal momentarily hangs or disconnects altogether.\nAnother consideration to make is to try and get a dedicated connection as well. This means having an Internet connection that is not shared with others. So an office Internet connection that has your whole team working on it is less than ideal. A publicly shared wireless network at an event, though, is a recipe for disaster, especially if other people might be using that same connection to do streaming of their own. If you do have to use a shared connection, add a pretty large buffer in terms of the quality you plan to stream at and your upload speed, since there is a variable for how much upload speed will be there when you start to broadcast.\nThe last piece of the puzzle is transcoding. While RTMP is a common format for live encoders, it’s associated with Flash technology, which, as noted in this HTML5 Video Player versus Flash article, is not just aging but widely unsupported over mobiles as well. As a result, live transcoding for mobile compatibility to iOS and Android devices is recommended.\nWhile you could potentially try and do a broadcast without transcoding, which does have the benefit of reduced delays in the feed, it’s not advised. The reason being that mobile viewership for live streaming is on the rise. In fact, it grew from 25.7% in 2015 to 47.3% in 2016, as noted in this Video Trends to Look for in 2017 presentation. As a result, reaching this audience has quickly grown from a “nice have” to a necessity.\nTranscoding is normally done as part of the delivery process. In other words, this is usually dependent on your provider. In the case of IBM Cloud Video, live content is automatically transcoded when streamed. This is not just for mobile compatibility, but also to create additional bitrates for adaptive streaming. If you aren’t sure if you provider does transcoding on your stream, ask them. In particular look for how or if they are able to reach mobiles as part of this process.\nSetting up a live stream is something that might feel difficult, but often comes down to making a few choices that will dictate the others steps, such as what video sources you want to use and how you plan to deliver the feed. Other aspects, like lighting and determining if you have an adequate connection, come more naturally with experience after a few broadcasts under your belt.\nIf you want to learn more about live streaming, and are interested in doing so with IBM Cloud Video, be sure to watch this Demo Video: Getting Started with IBM Cloud Video’s Streaming Manager."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a3bd28ec-d8dc-4399-a073-503bc15dcb25>","<urn:uuid:575b64d5-ff52-4773-83d1-87e652479e2d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the approaches to human dignity differ between the Crown Prosecution Service and the European Court of Human Rights in police-related cases?","answer":"The European Court of Human Rights and the CPS have different approaches to human dignity in police-related cases. The Court, as shown in the Bouyid v Belgium case, treats human dignity as a fundamental principle that can be violated by even minor acts like slapping when committed by police officers against detainees, considering it a potential Article 3 violation. The CPS, however, approaches dignity through specific prosecutorial guidelines, requiring prosecutors to be fair and objective while considering factors like whether offenses were committed against vulnerable persons or public servants. The CPS focuses on practical prosecutorial standards rather than broad dignity principles, evaluating cases based on evidence and public interest rather than abstract notions of dignity violations.","context":["It is my pleasure to introduce a guest commentary on the Grand Chamber judgment of Bouyid v Belgium (Appl.no. 23380/09 ) of last September. The commentary was written by a colleague here at Utrecht University, dr Stephen Riley, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the Ethics Institute in a project on human dignity and human rights. Here is his commentary:\nCase of Bouyid v Belgium (GC, 28 September 2015)\nBy a majority, the Grand Chamber found a violation of Article 3 following the slapping of two brothers held in police custody. The interest of the case lies in its extending the scope of ‘degradation’ but also in the problematic use of human dignity in the decision.\nThere was a five-year history of conflict between members of the Bouyid family and the staff of a local police station. The applicants, brothers, had at separate times had altercations with police officers, been taken into custody, and been slapped by an officer after provocative or uncooperative behaviour. That the brothers had been slapped was corroborated by medical evidence. Given the special burden of proof applicable in detention cases (it is for the State authorities to cast doubt on the applicants’ account) the Grand Chamber accepted that a claim of mistreatment was justified and that the question of a Convention violation could be addressed.\nThe question for the Court was evidence of ‘degradation’. This requires injury or suffering of a minimum severity (para. 86). Analysis offered by a third-party argued that ‘severity’ is partially relative to circumstances, and situations of detention and vulnerability mean that acts like a slap to the face, which in other circumstances might be at the lower level of criminality, take on greater significance and gain sufficient ‘severity’ (para. 73). The Court itself asserted that circumstances can be such that an otherwise minor form of mistreatment becomes a violation of human dignity and can thereby be considered degrading (para. 87). In conjunction with the remaining evidence, the Court found “that the applicants’ dignity was undermined and that there has therefore been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention” (para. 102).\nIn order to understand how human dignity was at issue, I will briefly reconstruct the judgment and dissent. The majority in the judgment held that, given certain background conditions (detention and vulnerability), what would otherwise only be a criminal act becomes harm to human dignity; that kind of harm, inflicted by an agent of the State, is necessarily a violation of Article 3 unless it is proven that the victim’s own actions justified the harm. The dissenting opinion, denying an Article 3 violation, asserted that given certain background conditions (detention and vulnerability) and a certain level of severity to the act itself what would otherwise only be a criminal act becomes harm to human dignity; that kind of harm, inflicted by an agent of the State, is necessarily a violation of Article 3 unless it is proven that the victim’s own actions justified the harm. That is, while the majority lists certain kinds of physical or mental ill-treatment that would be considered severe, they also include the bare idea of “showing a lack of respect for or diminishing [a detainee’s] human dignity” (para. 87) as a distinctive and supplemental instance of ‘severity ‘. In contrast, the dissenters claim that “there are forms of treatment which, while interfering with human dignity, do not attain the minimum level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3” (dissent para 5).\nWith respect to case as a contribution to Article 3 jurisprudence, the dissent raises important concerns. While not condoning mistreatment by State officials it asserts that it “is not for the Court to impose general rules of conduct on law-enforcement officers […]” (dissent para. 6) and it pointedly questions whether the threat of a single slap by a police officer would be enough to justify a non-refoulement decision (footnote 2). The thrust of the dissent however hinges on the significance and function of human dignity and the redundancy of the majority judgment’s uses of human dignity (dissent para. 4). Why should human dignity be considered redundant?\nWhat engaged Article 3 was ‘harm to human dignity’ understood as unjustified harm, in a situation of detention, amounting to degradation. What, then, justifies the application of this standard? The majority judgment provides a catalogue of human dignity uses in international law (para. 45f). However, their function is not entirely clear. They act partly as prelude to discussion of more directly applicable instruments on torture and police procedure. They also help to justify more dramatic claims about the link between Article 3, human dignity, and the foundations of ‘civilisation’ (para. 81). Crucially, the Court implies that there is a special class of harm, or a special conception of wrong, implied by human dignity which is engaged whenever an individual is vulnerable (relative to the State) and harmed (para. 90). This is problematic and the basis of the charge of redundancy. How would such a class of harm be determined separately from our normal understanding of Article 3? After all, there may be human dignity harms that are not Article 3 violations but they would not be the concern of the Court unless they were violations of other Convention rights (in which case the relevance of ‘vulnerability’ and ‘harm’ would presumably be very different). Conversely, if harm to human dignity arises whenever there is detention and harm, then the scope of Article 3 protections seems to become unworkably wide.\nFrom this we can see in outline the problematic status of human dignity within the Court’s jurisprudence as a whole. Human dignity is often invoked as a foundational principle for human rights law, but denoting a special class of harm does not obviously fulfil this kind of foundational role. Put the other way around, cataloguing ways in which human dignity is foundational fails to justify a special link with Article 3 or a special class of harms; the link between human dignity and a special kind of degradation cannot be made from the preambular remarks of international human rights instruments alone. The growing body of Article 3 jurisprudence that does treat it as a special kind of prohibitive principle is increasingly problematic if it entails that any kind of mistreatment in detention is an Article 3 violation. There is, in essence, a disconnection between the foundational uses of human dignity in international law and the harm-centred jurisprudence of Article 3, a disconnection that only gets wider after a decision like Bouyid.\nIn sum, this judgment hinges upon a set of related claims that continue to inform and distort Article 3 jurisprudence. First, general international and regional materials on human dignity are broadly relevant to Article 3 cases, but they seem far less relevant than specific instruments on detention and mistreatment. Second, human dignity might be seen as a general principle counselling particular care with regards to those in custody, but it is not clear that human dignity provides for a specific kind of injury. Finally, Article 3 and human dignity together are treated cornerstones of ‘civilisation’ but such grand claims seem incongruous with the severity of the mistreatment found in a case like this.","What is the Crown Prosecution Service?\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is responsible for prosecuting criminal cases investigated by the police in England and Wales on behalf of the State. The CPS will co-operate with the investigating and prosecuting agencies of other jurisdictions and its role is similar to that of the Crown Office in Scotland and the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland. The CPS is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) who is answerable to the Attorney General for England and Wales. The Attorney General, in turn, is accountable to Parliament for the service provided by the CPS.\nBrief history of the CPS\nThe Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 was implemented following Royal Commission recommendations that there be a single unified Crown Prosecution Service with responsibility for all public prosecutions in England and Wales. This led to the department of the DPP merging with the existing police prosecutions department, which in turn established the CPS under the direction of the DPP. The CPS started to operate in 1986.\nFollowing the publication in June 1998 of the ‘Review of the CPS’ by Sir Iain Glidewell, the CPS changed in 1999 from 14 to 42 geographical areas. Each follows the existing boundaries of the police forces, except in London, where the area covers the boundaries of both the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police. Each separate area is headed by a Chief Crown Prosecutor. Following the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the power of the police to charge for all but the most minor offences was transferred to the CPS. In 2006, with the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the CPS also became responsible for the prosecution of cases investigated and charged by that body.\nWhat does the CPS do?\nAs the principal prosecuting authority in England and Wales, the CPS is responsible for criminal cases beyond the police investigatory stage. The CPS:\n- reviews cases submitted by the police;\n- decides which cases should be prosecuted;\n- determines any charges in all but minor cases;\n- advises the police in the early stages of investigations;\n- prepares cases for court and presents them in both the magistrates’ courts and the Crown Court;\n- provides information, assistance and support to victims and prosecution witnesses.\nPrimarily, the CPS will review the evidence gathered by the police and provide guidance. During pre-charge procedures and throughout the investigative and prosecuting process the CPS may assist the police by explaining what additional work or evidence could raise the case to a viable charging standard thereby rectifying any evidential deficiencies.\nOnce the evidence is gathered, the CPS will then decide, on the basis of this evidence, whether a case should be pursued or dropped. If the CPS is satisfied that there is enough evidence to prosecute, they will do so either in the magistrates’ court and, if the case needs to go to Crown Court, they will instruct an independent advocate to prosecute for them or, increasingly, they may use their own in-house higher court advocates.\nAlthough the CPS works closely with the police, it is independent of them and except for very minor cases, the decision whether or not to prosecute a case rests with the CPS. The independence of the CPS is of fundamental constitutional importance. Casework decisions must be taken by Crown Prosecutors with fairness, impartiality and integrity to help deliver justice for victims, witnesses, defendants and the public.\nCode for Crown Prosecutors\nThe Code for Crown Prosecutors is issued by the DPP under s 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. It gives guidance on the general principles to be applied when Crown Prosecutors make decisions about prosecutions. In cases where the police determine the charge, which as previously indicated are usually more minor and routine cases, the police should also apply the provisions of this Code.\nThe latest Code is the seventh edition and replaces all earlier versions. The Code is a public document and can be accessed on the CPS official website. It is available in a number of different languages including English, Welsh, Arabic, Bengali, French, Polish, Chinese, Gujarati, Somali, Punjabi, Tamil, and Urdu.\nThe Code sets out the grounds upon which prosecutions are refused, discontinued or proceeded with. It aims to ensure that decisions about prosecutions are fair, independent, objective and consistent and that the prosecutions themselves are fair and effective. While each case is unique and must be considered on its own facts and merits, there are general principles that apply to the way Crown Prosecutors must approach cases. Crown prosecutors must:\n- be fair, independent and objective and not be influenced by personal views about the suspect, victim or witness nor be affected by improper or undue pressure from any source;\n- make sure that the right person is prosecuted for the right offence, acting in the interests of justice and not solely for the purpose of obtaining a conviction;\n- provide guidance and advice to investigators throughout the investigative and prosecuting process and continually review cases in light of any changes in circumstances or evidence;\n- ensure the law is properly applied to cases, all relevant evidence is put before the court and that obligations of disclosure are complied with;\n- apply the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1998.\nHow does the CPS decide to prosecute?\nThe decision as to whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence and what that offence should be are made in accordance with the Full Code Test (s 5 of the Code for Crown Prosecutors), unless in limited circumstances the Threshold Test applies (s 6 of the Code).\nThe Threshold Test can be applied where it is inappropriate to release the suspect on bail but sufficient evidence is not yet available at the time the charging decision has to be made to apply the Full Code Test. However, there must be at least a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed an offence, and if so, it is in the public interest to charge that suspect.\nAs there are statutory limits that restrict the time a suspect may remain in police custody, Crown Prosecutors can only apply the Threshold Test for a limited period and the case must be reviewed in accordance with the Full Code Test as soon as reasonably practicable.\nThe Full Code Test is two-stage, where the CPS will only prosecute a case if:\n- there is sufficient evidence to provide a ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ against each defendant on each charge; and\n- it is in the public interest to bring the case to court.\nWhen deciding whether there is sufficient evidence, Crown Prosecutors consider both whether the evidence can be used in court and whether it is reliable. In deciding whether it is in the public interest Crown Prosecutors must weigh those factors in favour of and against prosecution carefully and fairly although the more serious offences are more likely to be regarded as in the public interest.\nWhile the CPS does not act for victims or families of victims, but rather on behalf of the public, when considering the public interest Crown Prosecutors should always take into account the consequences for the victim of whether or not to prosecute, and any views expressed by the victim or their family.\nFactors to be considered when deciding to prosecute include:\n- the seriousness of the offence;\n- the involvement and culpability of the suspect;\n- whether the offence was committed against a person serving the public, eg, a nurse, or against a vulnerable person, eg, the elderly or a child;\n- whether the offence was premeditated, carried out by a group or motivated by a form of discrimination;\n- the age of the defendant – the younger the suspect, the less likely it is that a prosecution is required;\n- whether the suspect is, or was at the time of the offence, suffering from any significant mental or physical ill health;\n- whether the defendant has committed similar offences and/or the offending is likely to recur;\n- the impact on the community;\n- whether prosecution is proportionate to the likely outcome (cost is an issue, but a prosecution should not be rejected on the grounds of cost alone);\n- whether a prosecution is likely to have an adverse effect on the victim’s physical or mental health;\n- whether details may be made public that could harm sources of information, international relations or national security.\nSelection of charges\nProsecutors should select charges which:\n- reflect the seriousness and extent of the offending supported by the evidence;\n- give the court adequate powers to sentence and impose appropriate post-conviction orders; and\n- enable the case to be presented in a clear and simple way.\nAlternatives to prosecution\nWhen deciding whether a case should be prosecuted, Crown Prosecutors should consider the alternatives to prosecution such as a simple caution, a conditional caution, any appropriate regulatory proceedings, a punitive or civil penalty, or other disposal.\nAccepting guilty pleas\nWhere defendants want to plead guilty to some but not all the charges or to a different, possibly less serious charge because they only accept certain facts, Crown Prosecutors should only accept the defendant’s plea if they think the court is able to pass a sentence that matches the seriousness of the offending.\nCrown Prosecutors must not accept a guilty plea simply because it is convenient. Any decision as to whether it is in the public interest to accept a plea should always take into account the views of the victim or victim’s family, although ultimately the final decision rests with the CPS.\nThe role of the CPS in sentencing\nSentencing is a decision for the court, but Crown Prosecutors should assist the court by drawing attention to any:\n- aggravating or mitigating factors disclosed by the prosecution case;\n- any Victim Personal Statement;\n- evidence of the impact of the offending on a community;\n- statutory provisions, sentencing guidelines, or guideline cases; and\n- relevant statutory provisions relating to ancillary orders (such as anti-social behaviour orders).\nThe Crown Prosecutor should also challenge any assertion made by the defence in mitigation that is inaccurate, misleading or derogatory."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ef2ed563-35e0-45a9-aa3c-b54a6c65d006>","<urn:uuid:b2f74d9d-a247-44ee-a997-e750c24c40fa>"],"error":null}
