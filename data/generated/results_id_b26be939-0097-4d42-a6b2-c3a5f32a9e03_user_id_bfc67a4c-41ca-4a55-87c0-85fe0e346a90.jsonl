{"question":"I've been reading about plastic waste reduction strategies and am curious about both the current recycling challenges and the alternative disposal methods being developed. What's the current state of both aspects?","answer":"Currently, less than 30% of plastic waste in Europe is collected for recycling, partly because recycled plastics produce lower quality products and are less appealing to consumers. As an alternative disposal method, industrial composting facilities are being developed where compostable plastics can be processed alongside organic waste. These facilities maintain specific conditions for proper biodegradation, turning waste into useful compost for land projects. However, it's important to note that these biodegradable materials won't properly degrade in landfills, as landfills are anaerobic environments where organic matter produces methane gas, which is 21 times worse for the environment than carbon dioxide.","context":["Plastic waste: A global problem and an opportunity for microbiology\nPosted on May 1, 2018 by Roya Ziaie\nPublic appetite for reducing plastic waste is insatiable following the release of Blue Planet II; a series narrated by David Attenborough and focusing on the impact of human activity on the marine.\nAt the Microbiology Society’s Annual Conference 2018, delegates heard from Professor Kevin O’Connor, a leading principal investigator at University College Dublin. In his talk ‘Plastic waste: A global problem and an opportunity for microbiology’, he described strategies to reduce plastic waste, consumer confusion and opportunities for the future.\nThe plastic problem:\nDue to its versatility, plastic is used in billions of products worldwide, and we are predicted to produce over 600 million tonnes of it by 2035. The plastic production industry employs 1.5 million people in Europe, plastics play a key role in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) by allowing us to build stronger and lighter vehicles and better insulate homes.\nHowever, the production and incineration of plastic contributes to over 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually and single use plastics are major pollutants on land and in the sea. Alternative materials or methods of plastic management are desperately needed. Many consumers are already aware that plastics are recyclable – why isn’t there an efficient recycling system already in place? Currently, less than 30% of all plastic waste in Europe is collected for recycling, with recycling rates in many other regions even lower. This may be because recycled plastics produce lower quality products than virgin plastics and are aesthetically less appealing to consumers.\nEighty percent of marine litter is made up of plastics. Items such as straws, coffee cup lids, plastic bottles, and plastic bags are single use items that make up the majority of beach pollution. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles and containers can take up to 1,000 years to break down in the environment.\nMicro-plastics are also a major issue. Defined as plastics that are less than 5 millimetres in length, micro-plastics are formed in a variety of ways including through degradation of larger debris or are manufactured as micro-beads for use as exfoliants in beauty products such as cleansers and toothpastes. These minute particles often pass through water filtration systems, ending up in oceans and lakes. Micro-plastics can be extremely damaging to aquatic life; they can be mistaken for food by smaller fish and eventually enter the food chain in the guts of fish we eat.\nIf we can’t prevent the use of plastics, then society should work to reduce its consumption. Do we really need that much packaging? How can we design plastics to aid their re-use?\nTackling plastic waste:\nIn 1999, Kevin and his team began to investigate the reuse of petrochemical plastic waste. They used pyrolysis – a thermal decomposition method that reduces petrochemical plastic polymers to their precursors, or monomers. These monomers were then fed to the bacteria Psuedomonas putida. After consuming the petroplastic monomers, the bacteria produced biodegradable plastic polymers called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHAs break down in the environment to produce no harmful by-products, and were shown to perform either as well as, or better than, petrochemical polymers used for products such as glues, making them a viable alternative use in things like post-it notes.\nKevin’s team also focused on biodegradable polymers and how well they degrade in managed and non-managed environments. These included industrial composting, home composting and the marine, each of which has different composting standards. Ranging from industrial processes, which require plastics to degrade within 180 days at around 50°C, to the marine, which requires plastics degrade after 56 days at 30°C.\nWhat became clear was that different plastics, even those within the same polymer family, vary greatly in their rate of degradation in different environments. The fastest growing biodegradable plastic in the consumer market, polylactic acid (PLA), does not degrade at all in the 28°C conditions seen in home composting. Similarly, many plastics degrade poorly in the marine. With a well-managed industrial composting method however, biodegradable plastic produced fantastic results.\nMore research is needed to ensure that biodegradation is possible for different plastics in different environments, something which will need to be built into the design of new products.\nThe ultimate reality we face is that there is no quick-fix, and biodegradable plastics still need to be managed in the same way as petrochemical ones. A lack of clear messaging on the difference between biobased and biodegradable plastics is causing confusion for consumers and will not build consumer confidence.\nResponsible consumption should continue to be promoted, and initiatives to reduce plastic waste implemented quickly. Charges on supermarket carrier bags have already seen a 95% reduction in their use across Ireland, and 80% across England.\nThe war has officially been waged on plastics, with the government working with trade associations, campaigners and over 40 companies to eliminate single-use packaging under the UK Plastics Pact. Individuals can also play their part, by purchasing a re-usable coffee cup or water bottle, taking a canvas bag to the supermarket and saying no to plastic straws and cutlery. Small changes can have big impact, and as Kevin O’Connor powerfully stated, the solution to plastic waste is us.","What are compostable plastics…? We know that when it comes to zero-waste, food scrap collection, composting, and bioplastics, there can be a questions – because of this, we’ve created detailed responses to some frequently asked questions below.\nDo Natur-Bag® products meet any standards?\n|Yes, they meet the following:|\n|Natur-Bag® and Natur-Ware® Approved!|\nThe Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI), provides an independent certification program for products that meet all requirements of the ASTM D6400 standard.\n|Natur-Bag® and Natur-Ware® Approved!|\nTÜV Austria, an Austrian specification, provides an independent certification program for products that meet all requirements of the European EN13432 standard.\n|Natur-Bag® and Natur-Ware® are Approved for Use in Cedar Grove! |\nCedar Grove is the largest compost facility in the US Pacific NW. Cedar Grove mandates all compostable plastics products be evaluated and approved before accepting them in their compost system which requires a 50-day biodegradation window.\nThe USDA BioPreferred® program specifies the percentage of biobased material in a product or package. This percentage is determined by measuring ratio of carbon-14 (new carbon) to carbon-12 (old carbon) in accordance to ASTM D6866. The purpose of the BioPreferred program is to promote the use of biobased products.\nThe OK Biobased certification, provided by TÜV Austria, is an independent evaluation of the renewable carbon content in a product. On a basis of the determined percentage of renewable raw materials (% Biobased), the product can be certified as one-star-biobased (20% – 40% biobased content), all the way up to four-star biobased (upwards of 80% biobased content.)\n|The Australian Bioplastics Association (ABA) represents members is promotion and advocacy for member’s products, throughout Australia and New Zealand. The Association administers a voluntary scheme for verification of products for members and non-members for compliance to the Australian Standard AS 4736-2006-Biodegradable plastics for composting and other microbial treatment.|\nWhat is ASTM D6868?\nASTM Method D6866 is the US government approved method for determining the renewable/biobased content of natural range materials, including ethanol additives, bio-diesel additives and biobased products.\nASTM D6866 is recognized by regulars and companies world-wide as a valid tool for quantify the renewable carbon content of biobased products. It is routinely used by companies and organizations would-wide who need to:\n- Validate the renewable carbon content of compounds\n- Re-formulate compounds that previously were entirely petrochemical\n- Validate the renewable claims of raw materials supplies\n- Research and develop alternative products with renewable content\n- Obtain marketing data to support renewable claims\n- Obtain data to support regulatory requirements\nWhat is ASTM D6400?\nThe ASTM D6400 Standard for compostable plastics specifies three criteria for compostability\n- The Mineralization\n- At least 90% conversion of carbon dioxide, water, and biomass via microbial assimilation\n- Occurs at the same rate as natural materials (i.e. leaves, grass, food scraps)\n- Occurs within a time period of 180 days of less\n- Less than 10% of test material remains on a 2mm sieve\n- No impact on plants, using OECD Guide 208\n- Regulated (heavy metals less than 50% of EPA prescribed threshold)\nAre Natur-Bag® products GMO free?\nYes, because they do not contain any PLA, corn or starches, they are GMO free.\nDo Natur-Bag® products contain traditional plastics like polyethylene, polystyrene, or polypropylene?\nNo, they do not. Neither Natur-Ba®g or Natur-Ware® contains traditional plastics. Traditional plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or polystyrene do not pass the compostability standards.\nHow do Natur-Bag® products compare in strengths/usability to PE materials?\nThe Natur-Bag® products are similar in strength when compared to the same mil thickness/gauge or PE materials.\nWhat is the BPI?\nBPI is short for Biodegradable Products Institute. It is a multi-stakeholder association of key individuals and groups from government, industry, and academia, which promote the use and recovery of biodegradable/compostable plastic materials. Visit www.bpiworld.org for more information.\nWhat is the purpose of the BPI 100% Composting logo?\nThe BPI composting logo is designed to address the confusion that has existed between truly compostable materials and oxo-degradable plastics by building credibility and recognition for products that meet the ASTM D6400 Standards among consumers, composters, regulators, and others. It is designed to be easily recognizable and able to be placed on the actual product as well as packaging and sales literature.\nWhat is composting and what are the benefits?\nComposting is the natural breakdown of organic material into rich soil known as compost. Tiny micro-organisms found in the soil breakdown organic matter by consuming it as a food source. Composting organic waste (yard trimmings, food waste, etc) helps to divert organic waste away from a landfill.\nCompost, when added back to land projects promotes healthy plant growth, improves soil moisture retention, amends sandy/clay soils, and improves crop nutrient content.\nWhat is the proper disposal environment for Natur-Bag®?\nNatur-Bag® products are designed to be fully compostable in a professional or municipal compost facility. These facilities are carefully controlled to maintain the correct balance of moisture, nutrients, and temperature needed for full biodegradation.\nWhat is a waste diversion program?\nA source separated waste diversion program refers to the successful separation of waste streams. There waste streams include; organics, recyclables and non-organic trash. Each waste stream is collected separated in clearly labeled containers. The collection bin for all organic waste is lined with Natur-Bag compostable bags; this makes the collection process more efficient and hygienic. As additional compostable foodservice products (compostable tableware, cutlery, etc.) are introduced into the facility they can also be collected along with the organic food waste.\nThe organic waste is collected and hauled by a professional compost facility and the resulting compost can be used for land projects in the community. Source separated waste diversion programs are ideal for large institutions, cafeterias, schools/universities, government agencies, etc.\nWaste diversion programs help divert millions tons of organic materials away from landfills, reduce garbage hauling/tipping fees and divert organic waste to a compost facility so waste can be reclaimed for land projects.\nWill Natur-Bag® compostable products biodegrade in a landfill?\nNo, nothing will biodegrade in a landfill. Landfills are anaerobic (without oxygen) environments and oxygen is a vital component in the biodegradation process. Without the presence of oxygen, organic matter will slightly degrade, off-gassing methane gass (CH4). Methane is a green house gas 21 times worse for the environment than carbon dioxide (CO2). Any claim of material biodegrading in a landfill should be treated with skepticism since there are no scientific studies that prove organic materials completely biodegrade in a landfill.\nHow do I find a compost facility in my area?\nTo find a professionally managed compost facility in your area, please visit www.findacomposter.com to search for a facility near you.\nHow quickly will bags start degrading in a home compost pile?\nIt depends on the situation (environment – temperature, humidity, what is packed inside, etc.). We have seen our bags stand strong with food scraps and leaves for up to a week. Plan to have material picked up within a week of placing wastes into the bags. We recommend keeping filled bags on paved or dry surfaces if possible. When bagging grass clippings, it is advised to dispose of within a day or two due to the aggressive decomposition nature of enzymes in grass clippings.\nWhen will the bags start degrading once I put them in use and leave them at the curb for pick up?\nDepends on the situation (environment – temperature, humidity, what is packed inside, etc.). We have seen our bags stand strong with grass clippings for five  days, But plan to have material picked up within a week of placing into the bags.\nHow quickly will bags start degrading in a commercial/industrial compost facility?\nIndustrial/commercial compost facilities should see complete assimilation of the bags in 60-75 days. It could go faster/slower depending on the temperature of the pile, frequency of turning, etc.\nHow quickly will cutlery start degrading in a compost facility?\nCutlery will require the full 180 days to assimilate in a commercially/industrially run facility. Home compost piles can take 2-3 growing seasons depending on location and maintenance of the pile.\nWhat is the shelf life of Natur-Bag®?\nNatur-Bag® has a shelf life of 12 months. Internal studies and experience indicate that if stored in the original packaging and in a cool, dry place our bags will retain strength up to 18 months.\nNOTE: Since Natur-Bag® does not contain starch, our bags do not absorb ambient humidity which allows for a longer shelf life than bags that contain starch."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0608a9e7-f9e9-419b-999d-e01a08a1d753>","<urn:uuid:23898684-c392-4b5c-af80-e0f498a33f68>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences in normalizing temperature requirements between high-carbon steels and AISI 1020 carbon steel during post-forging heat treatment?","answer":"There are notable differences in normalizing requirements between these steel types. For high-carbon steels, the carbon content influences the formation of carbides and carbide networks, producing finer-grained steel, and the normalizing temperature must be above the final heat treatment temperature (typically 15°C higher than processes like carburizing at 925°C). In contrast, for AISI 1020 carbon steel, normalizing is seldom carried out due to its low carbon content, but when performed, it's typically done at 1650-1700°F (900-930°C). When normalizing AISI 1020 before carburizing, the upper range of temperature is used, while the lower temperature range is used when normalizing is the final treatment.","context":["The forging of a component to arrive at a rough shape prior to machining is a procedure that is almost as old as man’s discovery of iron. Forging is not only an ancient craft but also a science in the manipulation of metals – both ferrous and nonferrous – into a predetermined shape that is roughly the final shape of the desired component.\nINDUCED STRESS IN FERROUS COMPONENTSThe forging of steel parts is generally accomplished at a temperature of 1250-1350°C (2250-2450°F). At this temperature range, the steel is very malleable and can be manipulated with reasonable ease into the predetermined die shape required of the component.\nAt room or even warm temperatures, it is very difficult to manipulate the steel into a predetermined die shape. At low temperatures, a great deal of induced stress will be transmitted into the steel. This induced stress will manifest itself in the form of dimensional distortion at the final heat-treatment procedure – for example, austenitizing.\nGRAIN GROWTH AT ELEVATED TEMPERATUREWhile forging at an elevated temperature, steel will experience grain growth because of the time at temperature. It can be said that, “Time and temperature are to steel what rain and fertilizer are to grass. It makes things grow.” In the case of steel, it is grain size that grows in proportion to the forge temperature and to the time at temperature.\nOur forged-steel component in the geometric form necessary for machining into the final shape has an enlarged (and deformed) grain size. This necessitates a process of restoring the grain back to its normal shape and size. Normalizing, which may be used on forgings, castings, weldments, some rolled products, bar and tubular products, and steel sheet and strip, is such a process. A rolled workpiece will yield the same elongated grains as a forged workpiece and will require the same thermal treatment to achieve desired grain size and mechanical properties. Simply put, the process of normalizing is required to break up non-uniform structures (created by the forging process and temperature) and to relieve residual stress, ensuring a more uniform grain size in the steel. The steel is simply heated into the austenitizing range and followed by a controlled cooldown after soaking at the selected process temperature.\nThe normalizing process is generally applied to:\n- Unalloyed steels\n- Low alloy (hypo-eutectoid) steels – less than 0.77% carbon content\n- Hyper-eutectoid steels, carbon content of greater 0.77%, only in special cases\nWHAT PROCESS TEMPERATURE?The selected process temperature must be such that the steel will be austenitized, and in the austenite region, at a temperature above the final heat-treatment temperature. If, for example, the final heat treatment is carburizing and the carburizing temperature is 925°C (1700°F), the normalize temperature should be approximately 15°C (40°F) greater.\nThis means that any residual stresses left over from forging or other procedures will be relieved prior to the final carburizing process. This will not guarantee a distortion-free process, but it will help in minimizing distortion.\nA typical normalizing cycle is shown in Figure 2. It is important for successful normalizing practice for the steel temperature to be within the austenite range of the iron-carbon equilibrium diagram shown in Figure 3. It should further be remembered that in the furnace atmosphere – air or products of combustion – there is a strong likelihood that surface oxidation (scale) and decarburization will occur. These two conditions are illustrated in Figures 4a and 4b.\nCare should be taken with the normalizing process temperature, as higher temperatures will result in the formation of coarse grain structures. The temperature selection will also influence the dissolution of carbides and carbide networks that may have been formed as a result of the pre-forging temperature selection.\nHOW TO COOL AFTER NORMALIZINGThe generally accepted method of cooling is to “cool in still air and free from drafts.” Although this is a general statement and a generally accepted practice, it does not ensure a repeatable and consistent final metallurgy. One method of doing so is to follow a procedure that will ensure a consistent cooling rate.\n- Austenitize (Normalize)\nThe rapid cooling is generally accomplished by an oil quench (depending on the steel composition). Once the steel has been quenched and washed (to remove residual oil from the steel surface), it is tempered at an elevated tempering temperature (still in the ferrite region of the iron-carbon equilibrium diagram) that will produce a consistent and almost repeatable microstructure. This, in turn, will be conducive to reduced distortion at the final heat-treatment process. The load density charged into the normalizing furnace should be considered to ensure a uniform rate of cooling for all the pieces being normalized in a particular load.\nAir cooling, on the other hand, may influence the formation of pro-eutectoid ferrite and pearlite. Remember, if the practice of air cooling is adopted, air flow around the normalized parts should be uniform with no drafts. This will also apply to variation in cross section dimension changes that, in turn, will tend to produce differential induced stresses, non-uniform metallurgy and varying mechanical properties.\nThe following statement can be made regarding the normalizing of higher carbon steels: The carbon content will influence the formation of carbides and carbide networks and produce finer-grained steel.\nTIME AT AUSTENITIZING TEMPERATUREThe criterion of time at austenitizing temperature is based upon the steel’s maximum cross-sectional thickness. It is critical to not over soak at the selected austenitizing temperature because of the potential for grain growth to occur (Figure 5). The characteristics that will further govern soak time at temperature are:\n- The furnace and its heating method\n- Part geometry\n- Load geometry\n- Load density\n- Steel composition\n- Steel thermal properties\n- Steel surface-radiation emissivity\n- Air circulation and air movement within the furnace\n- Atmosphere analysis\nSTAINLESS STEELS AND TOOL STEELSMost grades of stainless can be successfully forged. However, it is not recommended to normalize stainless steel after forging. Tool steels are usually supplied in the annealed condition from the supplier, or they can be normalized after working. The following groups of stainless steels can be forged:\n- Austenitic grades\n- Ferritic grades\n- Duplex grades\n- Martensitic grades\n- Precipitation-hardening grades\n- Maraging steels\nIn austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, no phase transformation is seen as the forging cools. The martensitic stainless steels, however, require a very slow and controlled cooling rate after the forging process. This is also true of precipitation-hardening grades of stainless. The problem with the slow cool is that the steel surface should be protected.\nThe post-forging heat-treatment procedure is that of annealing. If the alloys are the low-carbon grades of stainless steels such as austenitic and ferritic grades, the furnace atmospheres need not be protective because decarburization is not a problem.\nFor the martensitic and precipitation-hardening grades, it will be necessary to protect the steels against surface contamination. Typical atmospheres include:\n- Argon – an inert gas with no steel surface reaction\n- Hydrogen-rich – low moisture/dew points\n- Hydrogen – reducing atmosphere, which reduces any surface scale that forms (bright)\n- Salt bath – will require daily maintenance to keep the salt analysis at the appropriate chemistry\n- Vacuum – cleanest surface finish of all the annealing processes with the least amount of surface-contamination risk. This method will protect the steel against any potential for surface hydrogen embrittlement and nitrogen contamination. It provides the slowest cooling of all annealing methods.\nTITANIUM ALLOYSTitanium offers properties ideally suited to aerospace applications. Depending on the alloy, titanium parts can be successfully forged, but they require alternative heat-treating processes. These processes include:\n- Solution treatment\n- Precipitation-hardening treatment\nThe processes of solution treatment and precipitation hardening offer “tighter” metallurgy and mechanical properties. It is important to note that titanium alloys will react adversely to the following gases: nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This means that post-forging thermal treatments must be conducted under tightly controlled atmospheric conditions, preferably in a vacuum. Thermal treatment of titanium parts in a vacuum means little risk of adverse surface conditions.\nBoth normalizing and annealing processes are relatively simple thermal-treatment procedures. It is evident that, for parts used in aerospace applications (commercial and military), these two simple thermal techniques are critical to the repeatable and consistent metallurgy demanded by the industry. Coupled with repeatable dimensional control and mechanical properties required and imposed by the aerospace industry, these processes are necessary to the proper functionality of the forged part in service.\nAny heat-treatment procedure is a very critical step in the total manufacturing process. Whether it is for an aerospace or any other application, the heat treatment will either make or break the product.\nAuthor David Pye is president of Pye Metallurgical Consulting, Meadville, Pa.

It may, as required, be case hardened, welded and machined. Cold forming may be carried out, preferably from a spheroidized structure.\nForging AISI 1020 Carbon Steel\nC1020 is forged from 2100 – 2300 º F down to a temperature in the region of 1650 – 1750 º F (1150*–1280 º C down to 900 – 950 º C.). The actual forging and finishing temperatures will depend on a number of factors, including overall reduction during forging and complexity of part being forged. Experience alone will determine near exact values for these two parameters. Parts are air cooled after forging.\nApplications of AISI 1020\nThis grade of steel is used for forged motor shafts, hydraulic shafts and pump shafts, as well as machinery parts.\nA significant amount of this grade of steel is used in the as-forged condition, since it shows good machinability in this condition.\nLittle is to be gained, at this carbon level, by a quenching treatment.\nAt this carbon level, annealing after forging may not be necessary, and depending upon the hardness after forging and the complexity of the part being forged, machining may be carried out on the as-forged parts. If parts are of complex shape and hence there are structural variations throughout the part, then normalizing is in order.\nFull annealing of small C1020 forgings is carried out between 1575 and 1650 º F (860 – 900 º C) followed by furnace cooling at 50 º F (10 º C) per hour, to 1300 º F (700 º C) and air cooling.\nNormalizing is seldom carried out on carbon contents at this level, but may be used prior to surface hardening. The normalizing temperature range for this grade is typically 1650 – 1700 º F (900 – 930 º C) followed by air cooling. When forgings are normalized before, say, carburizing, the upper range of the normalizing temperature is used. When normalizing is the final treatment, the lower temperature range is used.\nThis grade of steel is not normally subjected to hardening and tempering treatments as the hardness obtained from such treatments would not warrant their being performed. Carburizing might be carried out at 1620 – 1690 º F (880 – 920 º C,) and carbonitriding at 1470 – 1600 º F (800 – 875 º C,)\nHardening of the carburized case would be performed at 1430 – 1500 º F (780 – 820 º C.) followed by a water quench and a tempering treatment at 300 – 400 º F (150 – 200 º C) to improve case toughness with a minimum effect on its hardness. Case hardness values of Rc 60 may be obtained on carburized C1020.\nFor parts with a diameter less than 2” (50mm) this grade has been found on occasion to show best machinability when normalized. Parts over 2” (50mm) diameter might be machined following forging or rolling.\nThis grade of steel may be welded by all normal methods: low-carbon electrodes are recommended.\nLow-hydrogen electrodes are recommended together with preheat at 300 – 500 º F (150 – 260 º C.) to be maintained during welding, Cool slowly and stress relieve where possible.\nTo Send a Request for Quote, please Click Here, or call 1.973.276.5000 or 1.800.600.9290 or fax 1.973.276.5050."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0ef25a98-a185-439b-923b-09c08befc544>","<urn:uuid:f6e7bb27-dc5e-4297-9f7a-42a7ba483102>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I've been researching historical leadership roles. How do the responsibilities of medieval feast organizers compare to those of religious pastors in terms of managing and serving large groups?","answer":"Medieval feast organizers and religious pastors both managed large groups, but with different scales and responsibilities. Medieval feast organizers handled massive events, such as the marriage feast of Henry III's daughter in 1251 which served thousands, including 1,300 deer, 7,000 hens, and 68,500 loaves of bread. Religious pastors, as described in religious texts, were expected to be fully devoted to their flock, avoiding other pursuits like merchandising or farming. They were responsible for bringing back wanderers, visiting the sick, strengthening the weak, and binding up the broken. While feast organizers focused on one-time elaborate events with elaborate food presentations, pastors were expected to provide continuous care and guidance to their congregation, demonstrating sustained watchfulness and dedication to their flock's wellbeing.","context":["For some people, renting Camelot on DVD just isn't enough. Neither is a trip to the museum, nor sitting down to read A Short History of the Middle Ages. These people want something closer to the real thing. So they visit a medieval-themed banquet to experience the food of that bygone era.\nSince 1983, when its first \"castle\" opened in Kissimmee, Fla., Medieval Times Entertainment Inc. has served over 20 million diners. Today, the company operates eight restaurants across North America; the newest castle, in Hanover, Md., opened last year. Not to be outdone, Las Vegas' Excalibur Hotel & Casino serves about 10,000 rogues and wenches a week.\nBut there's one problem. Medieval-themed feasts aren't medieval. The vegetable soup (dragon tail soup), bland roast chicken (baby dragon), baked potato (dragon egg), and doughy desserts certainly seem pre-modern, not to mention pre-food-processor. It's like the food is the culinary equivalent of the classic stereotype that casts medieval people as belching, rugged simpletons. But throngs of bachelor partiers, group tourists, and amateur historians are being deceived about what it was like to chow down en masse during that long, dark period of history between the fall of the Roman Empire (fifth century) and the Renaissance (15th century).\nHere's how they get it wrong:\nMyth No. 1:Medieval food was bland.\nMedieval chefs used spices as enthusiastically as the boy bands of today use hair products. Yes, medieval chefs did serve plain roasted meats, but they also served many meat dishes that featured thick, gooey sauces very heavily flavored with ingredients like ginger, sugar, vinegar, wine, raisins, mace, cloves, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, pepper, and honey. \"Mawmenny,\" a typical dish, consisted of ground beef, pork, or mutton boiled in wine, which was then served in a wine-based sauce thickened with pounded chicken and almonds, then flavored with cloves, sugar, and more almonds (this time fried), and then festively colored with an indigo or red dye. Medieval food, in fact, was not unlike Indian food of today: sweet and acidic flavors combined, spices used by the handful. If anything, the concentrated, bold flavors would overwhelm the modern palate.\nMyth No. 2:Medieval chefs were lousy when it came to presentation.\nIn the days of courageous knights and fair maidens, presentation went way beyond the present habit of dribbling some raspberry coulis or balsamic reduction around a central, tiered heap. Medieval feasts were all about display. Peacocks were cooked, then returned to their skin to be ceremoniously presented in their original plumage. Animals were stuffed inside other animals like culinary matrioshka dolls—a pig stuffed with a rooster, which would itself be stuffed with roasted pine nuts and sugar. A recipe called \"glazed pilgrim\" consisted of a pike boiled at the head, fried in the middle, and roasted at the tail; this was then served alongside a roast eel. Food coloring was used liberally: red (sandalwood), yellow (saffron), green (mint or parsley juice), black (burnt bread crumbs).\nMyth No. 3: Medieval feasts were merely big.\nWhile a Medieval Times castle seats anywhere from 900 to 1,500 people a night, and the Excalibur's Tournament of Kings about 2,000 (a thousand at each seating), no present-day medieval feast comes even close to approaching the enormity of some of the Middle Ages' heavy-hitters. We don't know exactly how many people attended the marriage feast of Henry III's daughter in 1251, but we do know that they gorged on 1,300 deer; 7,000 hens; 170 boars; 60,000 herring; and 68,500 loaves of bread. Feasters at the enthronement party for England's Archbishop of Neville in 1465 consumed 1,000 sheep; 2,000 pigs; 2,000 geese; 4,000 rabbits; and 12 porpoises and seals. No less than 11,000 eggs were eaten at a 1387 feast for Richard II *. By comparison, the Excalibur goes through a paltry 2,000 Cornish game hens each night.\nMyth No. 4:Medieval feasters ate off pewter plates.\nActually, they ate off rectangular pieces of stale bread called \"trenchers\" (which were fed to dogs or peasants once the meal was finished).\nMyth No. 5:Medieval feasters had atrocious manners.\nTrue, the tined forkwas still centuries away from making it into the cutlery drawer, and even kings ate with their hands. Nonetheless, etiquette was alive and well in the Middle Ages. A medieval dinner guest avoided boorish behavior such as blowing on his soup (he might have foul breath), scratching his head (a dislodged louse might find itself drowning in the gravy), wiping his hands on the tablecloth, licking the serving dishes, picking his nose, or drinking out of a shared cup with a full mouth (backwash is an age-old problem). And if the lords and ladies of the era had possessed cell phones, it's safe to say they would have turned them off.\nMyth No. 6: Medieval feasters ate in set courses.\nThe idea of eating one main dish during every course, which is called service à la russe, didn't become popular in Europe until the 19th century. Before that, grand meals were eaten much the way North Americans eat Chinese food today, with many dishes served simultaneously. At the coronation of Richard III in 1483, for example, there were three courses, each of which included at least 15 different dishes. The third course, which was never eaten because the feast ran late, included three meat, two fish, five bird, and two fruit dishes. Courses would often end with a \"sotelty\" (subtely); similar to an amuse-bouche, a \"sotelty\" was an ornamental offering, usually made from dough or marzipan, which showed off the chef's skill. Often, they resonated with the political theme of the occasion. All the sotelties (there were three, one for each course) served at the coronation banquet for Henry VI cited his politically hopeless claim to the throne of France—the second sotelty, for example, depicted Henry in between his father and the Sigismund, the holy Roman emperor who supported his claim.\nMyth No. 7: Medieval people ate food they couldn't possibly have eaten.\nA tomato might seem medieval when used as the foundation for the Excalibur's \"dragon's blood soup\" (not to be confused with Medieval Times' \"dragon tail soup\"), but medieval people simply could not have eaten food that wasn't present in their world. Tomatoes didn't make it to Europe until Spanish conquistadors brought them back from South America in the 1500s. The same goes for potatoes (dragon's eggs). Similarly, the Excalibur's roast Cornish game hen is a recent chicken breed that was popularized by a 1960s poultry mogul.\nMedieval food was many things—garish, over the top, unsubtle. But it wasn't crude. And neither were medieval people. So, the real question is: Where does the familiar medieval stereotype come from? As with all questions of intellectual decline, Hollywood deserves some blame. (The studios had a thing for bringing the Middle Ages to the big screen in the '50s: Knights of the Round Table, Prince Valiant, The Black Shield of Falworth, The Black Knight.)Yet historical stereotyping, wherever you find it, is symptomatic of a deeper societal ill. Gustave Flaubert famously wrote, \"Our ignorance of history makes us slander our own times.\" When it comes to slander caused by ignorance, history is sometimes on the receiving end, too.\nThose still craving their history fix can take solace, however. After all, medieval people must have attended the odd crappy feast, too. During an evening of inappropriate food, some of them surely wondered: What is the king thinking? My own such moment came during a medieval-themed feast near the Tower of London, which was hosted by \"Henry VIII.\" Not only did it feature a historically inaccurate king—Henry VIII was a Reformation king—and historically inaccurate food, it culminated with a historically inaccurate conga line. Indeed, since the dawn of dinner parties, people have found themselves asking: Am I the only one who thinks this dinner is lame? So, while the medieval feast of today may not be historically authentic, it gets you to that bygone era just the same.","|« Prev||Of Pastors.||Next »|\nDemonstration X.—Of Pastors.\n1. Pastors are set over the flock, and give the sheep the food of life. Whosoever is watchful, and toils in behalf of his sheep, is careful for his flock, and is the disciple of our Good Shepherd, who gave Himself in behalf of His sheep.10171017 John x. 11, sq. And whosoever brings not back his flock carefully, is likened to the hireling who has no care for the sheep. Be ye like, O Pastors, to those righteous Pastors of old. Jacob fed the sheep of Laban, and guarded them and toiled and was watchful, and so received the reward. For Jacob said to Laban:—Lo! twenty years am I with thee. Thy sheep and thy flocks I have not robbed and the males of thy sheep I have not eaten. That which was broken I did not bring unto thee, but thou required it at my hands! In the daytime the heat devoured me and the cold by night.10181018 Gen. xxxi. 38, 40. My sleep departed from my eyes. Observe, ye Pastors, that Pastor, how he cared for his flock. He used to watch in the night-time to guard it and was vigilant; and he used to toil in the daytime to feed it. As Jacob was a pastor, so Joseph was a pastor and his brethren were pastors. Moses was a pastor, and David also was a pastor. So Amos was a pastor. These all were pastors who fed the sheep and led them well.\n2. Now, why, my beloved, did these pastors first feed the sheep, and were then chosen to be pastors of men? Clearly that they might learn how a pastor cares for his sheep, and is watchful and toils in behalf of his sheep. And when they had learned the manners of pastors, they were chosen for the pastoral office. Jacob fed the sheep of Laban and toiled and was vigilant and led them well; and then he tended and guided well his sons, and taught them the pattern of pastoral work. And Joseph used to tend the sheep along with his brethren; and in Egypt he became guide to a numerous people, and led them back, as a good pastor does his flock. Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father-in-law, and he was chosen from (tending) the sheep to tend his people, and as a good pastor he guided them. Moses bore his staff upon his shoulder, and went in front of his people that he was leading, and tended them for forty years; and he was vigilant and toiled on behalf of his sheep, a diligent and good pastor. When his Lord wished to destroy them because of their sins, in that they worshipped the calf, Moses prayed and besought of his Lord and said:—Either pardon the people for their sins, or else blot me out from Thy book that Thou hast written.10191019 Ex. xxxii. 31, 32. That is a most diligent pastor, who delivered over himself on behalf of his sheep. That is an excellent leader, who gave himself in behalf of his sheep. And that is a merciful father who cherished his children and reared them up. Moses the great and wise shepherd, who knew how to lead back the flock, taught Joshua the son of Nun, a man full of the spirit, who (afterwards) led the flock, even all the host of Israel. He destroyed kings and subdued the land, and gave them the land as a place of pasturage, and divided the resting-places and the sheepfolds to his 384sheep. Furthermore, David fed his father’s sheep, and was taken from the sheep to tend his people. So he tended them in the integrity of his heart and by the skill of his hands he guided them.10201020 Ps. lxxviii. 72. And when David numbered the flock of his sheep, wrath came upon them, and they began to be destroyed. Then David delivered himself over on behalf of his sheep, when he prayed, saying:—O Lord God, I have sinned in that I have numbered Israel. Let Thy hand be on me and on my father’s house. These innocent sheep, in what have they sinned?10211021 2 Sam. xxiv. 17. So also all the diligent pastors used thus to give themselves on behalf of their sheep.\n3. But those pastors who did not care for the sheep, those were hirelings who used to feed themselves alone. On this account the Prophet10221022 Ezek. xxxiv. 2–4, 9, 10–12, 18, 19. addresses them, saying to them:—O ye pastors who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord: Lo! I will visit My sheep as the pastor visits his flock in the day of the whirlwind, and I will require My sheep at your hands. O foolish pastors, with the wool of the sheep do ye clothe yourselves and the flesh of the fatlings do eat, and the sheep ye do not feed. That which was sick ye did not heal, and that which was broken ye did not bind. The weak ye did not strengthen, and the lost and the scattered ye did not gather together. The strong ones and the fatlings ye did guard, but with harshness ye subdued them. The good pastures ye yourselves graze upon, and what remains ye trample with your feet. The pleasant waters do ye drink, and whatever remains ye defile with your feet. And My sheep have eaten the trampled (herbage) which your feet have trampled, and they have drunk the waters which your feet have defiled. These are the greedy and base pastors and hirelings, who did not feed the sheep, or guide them well, or deliver them from the wolves. But when the Great Pastor, the chief of pastors, shall come, He will call and visit His sheep and will take knowledge of His flock. And He will bring forward those pastors, and will exact an account from them, and will condemn them for their deeds. And those who fed the sheep well, them the Chief of Pastors will cause to rejoice and to inherit life and rest. O stupid and foolish pastor, to whose right hand and to whose right eye I committed my sheep. Because thou didst say concerning the sheep, let that which dieth, die, and let that which perisheth perish, and whatever is left, let them devour the flesh of one another; therefore, behold I will make blind thy right eye and I will wither up thy right arm. Thy eye which regarded a bribe shall be blinded, and thy hand which did not rule in righteousness shall waste away.10231023 Zech. xi. 9, 17. And as for you, my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men; but I am the Lord your God.10241024 Ezek. xxxiv. 31. Behold henceforth will feed you in a good and rich pasture.10251025 Ezek. xxxiv. 14.\n4. The good shepherd giveth himself for the sake of his sheep.10261026 John x. 11. And again He said:—I have other sheep and I must bring them also hither. And the whole flock shall be one, and one shepherd, and My Father because of this loveth Me; that I give Myself for the sake of the sheep.10271027 John x. 16, 17. And again He said;—I am the door of the sheep. Every one that entereth by Me shall live and shall go in and go out and find pasture.10281028 John x. 9. O ye pastors, be ye made like unto that diligent pastor, the chief of the whole flock, who cared so greatly for his flock. He brought nigh those that were afar off. He brought back the wanderers. He visited the sick. He strengthened the weak. He bound up the broken. He guarded the fatlings. He gave himself up for the sake of the sheep. He chose and instructed excellent leaders, and committed the sheep into their hands, and gave them authority over all his flock. For He said to Simon Cephas:—Feed My sheep and My lambs and My ewes.10291029 John xxi. 15–17. So Simon fed His sheep; and he fulfilled his time and handed over the flock to you, and departed. Do ye 385also feed and guide them well. For the pastor who cares for his sheep engages in no other pursuit along with that. He does not make a vineyard, nor plant gardens, nor does he fall into the troubles of this world. Never have we seen a pastor who left his sheep in the wilderness and became a merchant, or one who left his flock to wander and became a husbandman. But if he deserts his flock and does these things he thereby hands over his flock to the wolves.\n5. And remember, my beloved, that I wrote to thee concerning our fathers of old that they first learned the ways of tending sheep and in that received trial of carefulness, and then were chosen for the office of guides, that they might learn and observe how much the pastor cares for his flock, and as they used to guide the sheep carefully, so also might be perfected in this office of guidance. Thus Joseph was chosen from the sheep, to guide the Egyptians in the time of affliction. And Moses was chosen from the sheep, to guide his people and tend them. And David was taken from following the sheep, to become king over Israel. And the Lord took Amos from following the sheep, and made him a prophet over his people. Elisha likewise was taken from behind the yoke, to become a prophet in Israel. Moses did not return to his sheep, nor did he leave his flock that was committed to him. David did not return to his father’s sheep, but guided his people in the integrity of his heart.10301030 Ps. lxxviii. 72. Amos did not turn back to feed his sheep, or to gather (the fruit of) trees, but he guided them and performed his office of prophecy. Elisha did not turn back to his yoke, but served Elijah and filled his place. And he10311031 Sc. Gehazi. who was for him as a shepherd, because he loved fields and merchandise and vineyards and oliveyards and tillage, did not wish to become his disciple; and (therefore) he did not commit the flock into his hand.\n6. I beseech you, ye pastors, that ye set not over the flock, leaders who are foolish and stupid, covetous also and lovers of possessions. Every one who feeds the flock shall eat of their milk.10321032 1 Cor. ix. 7, sq. And every one who guides the yoke shall be ministered to from his labour. The priests have a right to partake of the altar, and the Levites shall receive their tithes. Whoever eats of the milk, let his heart be upon the flock; and let him that is ministered to from the labour of his yoke, take heed to his tillage. And let the priests who partake of the altar serve the altar with honour. And as for the Levites who receive the tithes, they have no portion in Israel. O pastors, disciples of our great Pastor, be ye not like hirelings; because the hireling cares not for the sheep. Be ye like our Sweet Pastor, Whose life was not dearer to Him than His sheep. Rear up the youths and bring up the maidens; and love the lambs and let them be reared in your bosoms; that when ye shall come to the Chief Pastor, ye may offer to Him all your sheep in completeness, and so He may give you what He has promised: Where I am, ye also shall be.10331033 John xii. 26. These things, brief as they are, will be sufficient for the good pastors and leaders.\n7. Above, my beloved, I have written to remind thee of the character that becomes the whole flock. And in this discourse I have written to thee about the pastors, the guides of the flock. These reminders I have written to thee, beloved, as thou didst ask of me in thy dear letter.\n8. The Steward brought me into the King’s treasury and showed me there many precious things; and when I saw them my mind was captivated with the great treasury. And as I looked upon it, it dazzled my eyes, and took captive my thoughts, and caused my reflections to wander in many ways. Whosoever receives thereof, is himself enriched, and enriches (others). It lies open and unguarded before all that seek it; and though many take from it there is no deficiency; and when they give of that which 386they have received, their own portion is greatly multiplied. They that receive freely let them give freely10341034 Matt. x. 8. as they have received. For (this treasure) cannot be sold for a price, because there is nothing equivalent to it. Moreover the treasure fails not; and they that receive it are not satiated. They drink, and are still eager; they eat, and are hungry. Whosoever is not thirsty, finds not ought to drink; whoever is not hungry, finds nothing to eat. The hunger for it satisfies many, and from the thirst for it flow forth water-springs. For the man who draws nigh to the fear of God is like the man who in his thirst draws near to the water-spring and drinks and is satisfied, and the fountain is not a whit diminished. And the land that needs to drink in water, drinks of the fountain, but its waters fail not. And when the land drinks, it needs again to drink, and the spring is not lessened by its flowing. So is the knowledge of God. Though all men should receive of it, yet there would come no lack in it, nor can it be limited by the sons of flesh. He that takes from it, cannot take away all; and when he gives, he lacks nothing. When thou takest fire with a candle from a flame, though thou kindle many candles at it, yet the flame does not diminish when thou takest from it, nor does the candle fail, when it kindles many. One man cannot receive all the King’s treasure, nor when a thirsty man drinks of the fountain, do its waters fill. When a man stands on a lofty mountain, his eye does not (equally) comprehend the near and the distant; nor, when he stands and counts the stars of heaven, can he set limits to the hosts of the heavens. So when he draws nigh unto the fear of God, he cannot attain to the whole of it; and when he receives much that is precious, it does not seem to be diminished; and when he gives of that which he has received, it is not exhausted, nor has it come to an end for him. And remember, my beloved, what I wrote to thee, in the first discourse, about faith, that whoever has freely received ought to give freely as he has received, as our Lord said:—Freely ye have received, freely give.10351035 Matt. x. 8. For whosoever keeps back part of anything he has received,10361036 Matt. xxv. 29. even that which he has obtained shall be taken away from him. Therefore, my beloved, as I have been able to obtain now from that treasure that fails not, I have sent unto thee from it. Yet though I have sent it to thee, it is all with me. For the treasure fails not, for it is the wisdom of God; and the steward is our Lord Jesus Christ, as He testified when He said:—All things have been committed to Me by My Father.10371037 Matt. xi. 27. And while He is the steward of the wisdom, again, as the Apostle said:—Christ is the power of God and His wisdom.10381038 1 Cor. i. 24. This wisdom is imparted to many, yet nothing is lacking, as I explained to thee above; the Prophets received of the spirit of Christ, yet Christ was not a whit diminished.\n9. Ten treatises have I written unto thee, my beloved. Whatsoever thou hast asked of me, I have explained to thee without (receiving) ought from thee. And that which thou enquiredst not of me, I have given unto thee. I have asked thy name and written unto thee. I have asked of myself thy question, and I have answered thee as I was able, for thy persuasion. Whatsoever I have written unto thee, meditate in these things at every time; and labour to read those books which are read in the church of God. These ten little books that I have written for thee, they borrow one from another, and depend one upon another. Separate them not one from another. From Olaph to Yud I have written for thee, each letter after its fellow. Read thou and learn thou and the brethren, the monks, and the faithful, they from whom mocking is far removed; as I wrote unto thee above. And remember that which I pointed out to thee, that I have not brought these matters to an end, but short of the end. Nor are these 387things sufficient; but hear thou these things from me without wrangling, and enquire concerning them with brethren who are apt for persuasion. Whatsoever thou hearest that assuredly edifies, receive; and whatever builds up strange doctrines, overthrow and utterly demolish. For wrangling cannot edify. But I, my beloved, as a stonecutter have brought stones for the building, and let wise architects carve them out and lay them in the building; and all the labourers that toil in the building shall receive reward from the Lord of the house.\n|« Prev||Of Pastors.||Next »|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0dd55429-b38f-4372-a227-d3db8d254b46>","<urn:uuid:37d73ed4-f173-4a6e-8f7c-ae164e513ba8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What deceptive marketing tactics are used in coin sales advertisements, and how does this contrast with legitimate business moves toward electric vehicles?","answer":"Common deceptive coin marketing tactics include making unsubstantiated claims about gold prices reaching $5,000 per ounce, false 'last chance' offers for common coins, dubious claims about discovering coin 'hoards,' and advertising 'rare' Morgan silver dollars at inflated prices when they're actually common coins worth only their silver value. In contrast, legitimate business developments can be seen in the EV sector, where companies like Amazon and UPS are making concrete steps toward sustainability - Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks and UPS ordered 10,000 electric trucks, backed by real carbon neutrality commitments and practical motivations like avoiding city anti-idling fines.","context":["Coin Buyer Beware… See These 4 Phrases in an Ad? Then Run, Don’t Walk, Away From The Seller\nIf you shop for coins online or from dealer advertisements in magazines and newspapers, then you've likely come across a few familiar marketing phrases with each of the coin ads you've come across. Some of the phrasing is legit, such as \"our business is rated A+ by the Better Business Bureau\" or \"Member of the Professional Numismatists Guild.\"\nIn fact, if you don't see any of those claims, you may want to tread carefully. But do you know the four phrases that really set off alarms signals in the heads of experienced coin collectors? Check out these marketing terms below that are often used to snag buyers into making spur-the-moment – though sometimes regrettable – purchases.\n\"Gold Will Hit $5,000 Per Ounce\"\nThis is one of the most common claims in the book… It sure seems like there are a lot of bullion prognosticators out there! The weird thing about all of these confident predictions is that there is no crystal ball in bullion investing. A lot of gold bullion coin advertisements are designed to make their readers think this is the last chance to buy gold before it goes through the roof.\nThe reality is that gold is always going up and down. Even in bull markets, gold will still tick – sometimes plunge – downward every now and then. Gold is never on a permanent rocket ride up, and only up. And that $5,000 claim? Gold bullion dealers have been saying that for years. Sure, gold may someday hit $5,000 per ounce, but the only way it's going to hit $5,000, given foreseeable market conditions, is if there's a global catastrophe.\nAnd then? No one will care what gold will be worth because all they'll want is food, water, and shelter. Then again, those holding gold and silver sure could trade their coins for a lot of food, but let's hope gold never has a reason to hit $5,000 per ounce.\nThis claim may have some legitimacy, for there are some real offers on genuine, fairly priced coins that really are only valid for a limited time before they're taken off sale. But these claims are usually only for coins or coin products made by the mint during the year it is being offered.\nAlmost any coin or coin product being offered for sale in \"Last Chance\" ads will either turn up in the secondary market soon or are already available elsewhere. Many advertised \"Last Chance\" offers are for old silver coins that most folks in the general public have never seen before but are in fact common and available for, or just above, their melt values.\n\"Just Found in a Hoard/Vault\"\nThere are a plethora of ads that claim the seller has recently located a bunch of old silver coins or Indian Head cents (or similar coins) in a vault or hoard. Often, the seller will give the \"discovered hoard\" a high-sounding name. While some of these ads are selling genuinely scarce coins from verified hoards, in many cases they're selling common coins that were purchased in a mass lot that was given a special name.\nThere's no denying that (most of) these coins are real. But they're hardly ever anything rare or unusual, and they can often be purchased for prices far lower what they're being offered for in the ad.\n\"Rare Morgan Silver dollars for Only $49.95 (Or Another 'Low' Price)\nYou've probably seen the full-page, color ads before. A few old circulated Morgan dollars are scattered upon a photographic scene of the Old West. Old-timey font proclaims these coins \"rare Morgan dollars over 90 years old.\" The price appears, to many unassuming non-collectors, perhaps too good to be true. Maybe it's $29.95. Even a price of $49.95 usually seems appealing for something like a large, old silver coin that yesteryear's frontier cowboys may have once used in an old saloon.\nWhat these ads are selling are common old Morgan silver dollars, oftentimes harshly cleaned, that are worth only their silver spot value – a value that's far lower than what the advertised price is. Maybe these old silver dollars aren't so rare after all…\nShould you spend your money on coins advertised with any of the phrases mentioned in this article? That's for you to decide, but you might want to check out what these coins are worth before you spend money on buying them.","Electric vehicles (EVs) hold a lot of promise for the private sector — especially as consumers, who are increasingly aware of the relationship between emissions and climate change, are starting to demand eco-friendly delivery options. EV adoption, however, has been slowed down by a few different challenges — the US’s poor EV charging infrastructure in particular.\nNow, however, we’re beginning to see signs that major businesses are willing to buy into EVs, despite potential road bumps.\nHere are the businesses that are leading the way when it comes to EV adoption.\nAmazon and UPS Lead Way on EV Adoption\nTwo delivery giants — Amazon and UPS — have begun to aggressively add EVs to their delivery fleets.\nEarlier this year in January, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from EV manufacturer Rivian, as well as 10,000 electric delivery rickshaws for their operations in India. Then, around the end of the month, UPS announced that it had ordered 10,000 electric trucks from the UK-based manufacturer Arrival Ltd., and would soon be teaming up with self-driving car manufacturer Waymo for a pilot test of self-driving delivery vehicles.\nThe moves are part of broader pushes towards carbon neutrality and self-driving delivery by the two companies. Last year, Amazon announced the company’s plan to be 100 percent carbon-neutral by the year 2040. UPS already offers carbon-neutral and carbon-offset delivery options.\nThe moves also come as more cities around the U.S., including New York and Philadelphia., have begun to adopt anti-idling laws that allow the city to fine companies over idling delivery vehicles.\nSome cities have even developed apps that allow citizens to report idling vehicles based on that vehicle’s DOT number — making these policies even more costly for delivery companies. Because electric vehicles produce no emissions, they’re typically free from being fined — meaning savings for businesses that adopt EVs for city deliveries.\nThe announcements are both historic. While other companies have announced EV purchases — like Lyft, which plans to deploy 200 EVs in Denver as part of its rental vehicle program there — there’s been nothing near scale of these announced by Amazon and UPS.\nWhile neither UPS nor Amazon has plans to go fully electric any time soon, the purchases are a welcome sign for the EV industry. Coupled with similar positive signals from the individual consumer side of the industry, they likely demonstrate that despite early growing pains, EVs may be on track for widespread adoption in the near future.\nChallenges Facing Further EV Adoption\nHowever, there still remain significant barriers that may slow or prevent full EV adoption, primarily the weak EV charging infrastructure in the US and limited number of charging stations — although this, too, seems like it’s starting to change.\nChargePoint, in coalition with the National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO) has formed the National Highway Charging Collaborative, which plans to install new charging stations at more than 4,000 highway-side locations in the U.S., in order to increase the availability of EV charging stations in rural areas.\nAt the same time, legislative support for stronger EV infrastructure is beginning to build. In February, Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives announced a new bill that would create a nationwide EV charging network within the next five years.\nUpgrades to existing infrastructure would likely encourage further adoption. They may also be especially beneficial for businesses like Amazon and UPS, as both companies regularly make deliveries to rural parts of the country — areas that don’t always have the charging infrastructure needed to support EVs.\nThe Future for EVs in Business\nEV adoption in the private sector, which has lagged in the past, seems to be accelerating. Two major delivery companies have now announced that they will be adding significant numbers of EVs to their delivery fleets, with more likely to come in the near future as both pursue low-carbon delivery options.\nWhile challenges remain that may slow down EV adoption — primarily the nation’s weak EV charging infrastructure — the purchases are likely a good sign for the industry and the future of EVs in the private sector."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:14f9d8e4-8f69-4dc4-a631-057058cd0d50>","<urn:uuid:a3b2914f-bfcd-4107-a76d-db9ca5d880cd>"],"error":null}

You see new leaves on your herbs and some baby zucchinis starting to form under huge green leaves. You breathe in the fresh air and feel excited to see your garden thrive this year, and a sense of calm knowing it is doing important work for the Earth.\nWith a Climate Victory Garden, everyone can take meaningful action for soil health and emissions. This list for beginners is a jumping off point for learning the basics and starting on a path towards gardening for the planet. Start by asking yourself these important questions:\nAm I protecting the soil?\nSoil puts \"climate\" in climate victory gardening by pulling the powerful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide out of the air and storing it underground where it feeds our plants and soil microbes. Avoiding tilling and keeping soils covered are examples of protecting the soil.\nAm I choosing climate-conscious products?\nWhen you choose what you put into your garden, you may make a climate impact in the wider world as well. Minimize those effects by making decisions that help reduce emissions. When possible, opt for natural and organic alternatives to synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Use sustainably harvested or repurposed materials whenever possible.\nFor example, instead if using synthetic chemical fertilizers—and their associated pollution and emissions from production and transportation—fertilize your garden with compost that supports soil life and keeps food and other organic waste out of the landfill where they produce the potent greenhouse gas, methane.\n1. Set Goals for Your Climate Victory Garden\nThink about your dream garden. What do you see, hear, and smell? Consider drawing or writing about it. Think about how much time you have to commit to your garden—be realistic and start small. If you have just a few minutes a day, consider a container garden—maybe just one pot. If it’s your first time ever gardening, consider a plot ten square feet or smaller, which requires two to three hours per week.\nWhile it will take some time to achieve a dream garden, your vision and goals will guide you through the process. What does success mean to you? Maybe your top priority is growing delicious food to save money on groceries, getting your kids outside, or creating a habitat for pollinators.\n2. Choose Your Plants\nFirst things first—grow what you love! Here are some additional considerations for deciding what to grow:\n- Look at your favorite recipes and grow the ingredients.\n- Plant veggies and herbs that are expensive or hard to find at your grocery store. Veggie blossoms can also support pollinators!\n- Consider how much space you have and grow accordingly—herbs are great for small spaces, while squash need several square feet for each plant.\n- Grow plants that are suited to your climate—find your area’s hardiness zone and match that to the zone to information on the back of your seed packet.\n- Consider perennial plants that don’t have to be replanted each season because they’re great for supporting soil heath and are less work for you.\nChoosing between seeds and transplants\nBeginner gardeners will have the best luck with transplants, because they’ve been nurtured past their vulnerable seedling stage. Transplants are also quicker to mature because they’re several weeks old by the time you get them. Because of that, they’re also more expensive than starting from seed. When buying transplants from your local nursery or neighborhood farm, choose plants that were grown without the use of chemical pesticides or fertilizers.\nIf you’d like to try to start some plants from seed, opt for the easy-to-grow plants like peas, beans, radishes, leafy greens, and sunflowers.\n3. Find the Perfect Place\nBefore you get too excited, be sure to check your zoning laws, any HOA requirements, and—if you’re a renter—talk to your landlord about starting a garden. If you don’t know the entire history of your property, consider getting your soil tested for toxic chemicals like lead paint. If your soil is permanently damaged, you can still grow food in raised beds and/or containers.\nWhen choosing a spot for your garden, the easier it is to see and access your garden, the more you’ll be reminded to care for it. Choose a site that’s visible from a room where you spend a lot of time. It’s also helpful to have a nearby water source, like a hose or spigot to fill your watering can.\nIf you have strict landscaping rules where you live, experiment with including beautiful edible plants in with your ornamentals.\nThink you’ve found the ideal spot? Take some time to observe the area to make sure it gets enough sun—most crops prefer 6-8 hours of direct sunlight every day. Look for other environmental factors like wind and drainage as well.\nNo yard? No worries!\nIf you don’t have a lot (or any) outdoor growing space, it’s time to get creative. Maybe you can grow along fence lines; in the parkways between sidewalks and curbs; at family’s, friend’s, or a neighbor’s house; or other open areas in your neighborhood. Or, you might be able to get a plot at a local farm or community garden. Have a balcony, sunny windowsill, or a little extra space on your counter-top? You can grow a Climate Victory Garden in containers indoors or outdoors too!\n4. Time it Right\nIf you’ve purchased transplants, keep them indoors until the risk of frost has passed. When you’re ready to plant outside, help your seedlings adjust to their new home by hardening off—that is, placing them near their future planting site for a few hours each day and increasing the time gradually until they’ve spent a night outdoors in their pot.\nWhen planting, first water the ground thoroughly. Dig a hole twice as large as the pot, take the plant out of the pot and place in the ground, and lightly pack the soil around the roots. Water thoroughly again and maintain a consistent watering schedule to avoid shocking the plant.\nPlanting from seed is more difficult, as they need regular watering and close attention. Look for seeds that can be direct-seeded right in the dirt of your garden or container, which will be on the back of the seed packet, along with seed depth, row spacing, and dates to plant.\nNo matter what you plant, make sure you incorporate pathways into your layout and beds that you can reach the middle of for weeding and harvesting.\n5. Protect Your Climate Victory Garden Soil\nSoils are rich with life that supports nutritious crops and carbon capture. There are many ways to protect and build soil health, and these are a lifelong part of the gardening process.\n- Avoid chemicals that reduce biodiversity\n- Add compost to support soil life\n- Mulch to protect soils from the elements\n- Allow weeds to cover uncultivated soils\n- Minimize digging to reduce disturbance of fungi and earthworms\n- Keep old plants in the ground over the winter for pollinator habitat and to anchor soils\n- When removing old plants to plant more, cut at the soil level, leaving the root underground\n- Whether you’re a beginner or seasoned gardener, it’s all an experiment. There will be ups and downs.\nLooking for more information about how to do any of the above steps?

You should only water your succulent once a month in the winter (when the temperature falls below 40 degrees), as it goes dormant at this period.\nA few situations constitute an exception to this rule. Because their tiny leaves can’t hold as much water as other varieties with larger leaves, some varieties of succulents need to be watered more frequently. In the non-winter months, feel free to give these small leaf succulents a water if they appear to be thirsty. When they are thirsty, succulents generally exhibit a wrinkled appearance. But always keep in mind that being underwater is preferable to being overwater.\nHow do you tell whether a succulent needs to be watered?\nSucculents are better off dry than wet, but that doesn’t mean you can ignore the need to water them. In fact, the plant needs water to survive, and much like people, it will exhibit dehydration symptoms. Your succulent clearly needs extra water if its leaves are wrinkled and shriveled.\nThe cells attempt to bring in more water to make up for the water that has been lost as they release their stored moisture to the rest of the plant. The cells shrink as they run out of water and the plant is forced to rely on its limited reserves, which causes the once-firm and full leaves to collapse and shrivel.\nHow much water per day should I be giving my succulent?\nOnly water succulents when the soil has totally dried up. There isn’t a standard watering schedule that applies to all succulents in all environments.\nMany indoor succulent growers discover that watering their plants every 14 to 21 days keeps them healthy. Use this timeline as a guide and make adjustments if necessary.\nThe earliest symptoms of underwatering on the leaves are the greatest time to water your succulents. To see what that looks like, have a look at the cheat sheet above.\nThe best course of action is to wait for a signal from your succulent before watering because most succulents are particularly susceptible to rot with regular watering.\nAnd keep in mind how crucial it is to monitor your watering routine. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve assumed that I haven’t watered in a while, just to discover that it was only a few days ago thanks to my notes in the Succulent Tracker app (Apple | Android).\nIn this video, learn about a several factors that could influence how frequently you water your succulents:\nDo cacti require sunlight?\nDepending on the type, succulents need six hours of sunlight each day because they are light-loving plants. You might need to gradually expose newly planted succulents to full sun exposure or give shade with a translucent screen because they can burn in direct sunshine.\nHow long can you go without watering succulents?\nIn general, succulents that are grown indoors or outdoors during the cooler months will need less water. They can go without water for one to three months.\nIndoor succulents will be less exposed to the weather outside because the soil dries out more quickly outside than it does indoors due to the wind and sunlight.\nThe soil remains moist for extended periods of time in milder climes, typically fall and winter.\nTo avoid overwatering indoor plants during the cooler months, read more about our toothpick test here.\nTo avoid root rot, it’s crucial to examine the soil before watering indoor succulent plants and to make sure it is completely dry between waterings.\nSucculents enjoy misting, right?\nWhen I first learned about succulents, I was fascinated by the notion that they couldn’t die. They were frequently referred to as very low maintenance plants that adored being neglected. That sounds fairly simple, hmm.\nTo add to my bewilderment, I frequently heard the word “succulent” used in the same sentence as the word “cactus.” We won’t get into it here because there is a really fantastic essay on this site that explains the link between cacti and succulents, but a widespread misconception regarding cacti is that they never require water. Because I believed succulents required little to no water, I occasionally misted them rather than watering them. They love to be ignored, right? They require little upkeep, right? Well, I hate to ruin the surprise, but my succulents barely made it through this abuse.\nThe scoop about misting and watering is as follows:\n*Water: After the dirt has dried, drown your succulents in water. Put them in water until the bottom of the pot is filled with water. If you have a catch pan, remove any water that has accumulated there. The best kind of pots are unglazed, porous ones with drainage holes (think terracotta pots). Your succulents will appreciate that they allow them to breathe.\n*Low Maintenance: Succulents grow in nature with shallow roots that quickly absorb water and store it in their leaves, stems, and roots for periods of drought. Succulents are considered low maintenance because of this. They are designed to hold water for extended periods of time, so you don’t need to water them as frequently as some plants, like every other day. They won’t wither and die while you’re away, so you may travel with confidence. Just remember to give them a good drink when you do water them!\n*Water Type: Rainwater or distilled water are the ideal water types to utilize. Numerous minerals in tap water can accumulate in the soil and even appear on plant leaves.\n*Watering Frequency: A number of factors determine how frequently you water (climate, season, humidity, pot size, pot type, drainage etc). The best general rule is to wait until the soil has dried before watering it again. The roots may decay if the soil isn’t given a chance to dry up or if water is left in the catch pan. You can stick your finger into the ground and feel around to determine the amount of moisture in the soil, or you can use a moisture meter (commonly sold in gardening centers or online and relatively inexpensive).\nLeave the misting to the babies, please! Actually, fully developed succulents dislike being misted. Because they prefer dry environments, misting them will alter the humidity in the area around the plant. Additionally, this might cause decay. To gently hydrate your propagation babies’ tiny, sensitive roots, spray them.\nHow should I water succulents the best?\nHere is how to water succulents now that you are aware of the variables that influence how frequently you should water them. Yes, there are right and incorrect ways to do things. Native to the desert, succulents receive little rain in their natural settings, but when it does, it pours. Desert downpours resemble monsoons because sheets of water fall from the sky. When you water your succulent, soak it completely to simulate desert rain. Slowly pour water over it, continuing to do so until the drain hole at the bottom is completely filled. Succulents benefit more from irregular, cautious waterings that only moisten the top inch or two of the soil in the pot than they do from periodic, long, deep drinks that soak the soil to the bottom of the pot.\nSo when the earth around your succulent plants is completely dry, water it. Re-saturate the soil after allowing it to totally dry out. Dried up. Drench. Dried up. Drench. You can have succulents that are perfectly watered if you follow that pattern.\nHow are succulents maintained indoors?\nSucculents may not need much attention, but they do need a few essentials to survive:\n- 1. Provide plenty sunlight. Succulents require adequate light—at least six hours each day of direct sunlight. Maintaining succulents outside can be quite simple. However, if you have a succulent indoors, you must keep it in direct sunlight near a window. A plant that is slanting toward the light is not receiving enough sunlight, yet a plant with burnt areas on its leaves is receiving too much direct sunshine.\n- 2. Use proper water. Depending on the season, succulents might have different water needs. Succulents should be irrigated if their soil dries completely during the growing season, but excess water should be avoided. When a succulent’s roots have time to dry out in between waterings, its lifespan is increased. In the chilly winter months, succulent plants go dormant and require less water. Only water your succulent as often as necessary because overwatering the soil is one of the main reasons of most development problems.\n- 3. Use the proper soil and pot combination. The appropriate container and potting soil can make all the difference, whether you’re growing your own succulents or purchasing one from a nursery. Your succulent planter needs to include a drainage hole if it is going to be an outdoor succulent. Proper drainage allows moisture to escape, allowing the soil and root systems to dry and prevent rot. Use well-draining soil instead of standard dirt if you have an indoor succulent. It is coarser than regular soil, enabling more air to pass through and encouraging evaporation rather than requiring to be drained. To increase aeration, perlite and pumice can be added to some potting mixtures.\n- 4.Remember to fertilize. The periodic fertilizing is beneficial for even low maintenance desert plants. To give your succulents a boost, use a diluted, water-soluble all-purpose fertilizer a couple times a year. Although it’s not entirely required, if you notice that your soil needs some help, add a little fertilizer.\n- 5. Examine your plant life. Pest hazards are more likely to affect a succulent indoors than outside. Make sure your plants are periodically checked for gnats or mealy pests. These insects are a sign that your plants are receiving too much water or fertilizer. Mealy bugs can lay hundreds of eggs and consume the plant juices that serve as their host, gradually harming your plant. Rubbish alcohol can be sprayed on your succulent’s leaves or soil to effectively kill mealy bugs and their eggs. Check the leaves and soil of the succulent before bringing it home from the nursery to make sure no bugs are present.\nSucculents—can they survive indoors?\nSucculents thrive in hot, arid conditions and don’t mind a little neglect due to their unique capacity to store water. They are therefore ideally suited to growing indoors and are the perfect choice for anyone looking for low-maintenance houseplants. Follow these instructions for successful plant care if you’re choosing succulents for the first time.\nSelect a succulent that will thrive in your indoor environment.\nThe majority of succulents need direct sunshine, however if your home only has a shady area, choose low light-tolerant plants like mother-in-tongue. law’s A trailing variety, like string of bananas, is an excellent option if you intend to grow your succulent in a hanging planter. To learn about your succulents’ requirements for sunlight, size, and spread, always read the plant labels.\nGive the plants a good draining potting material.\nYou should repot your succulent as soon as you get it home since nurseries always plant their succulents in soil that is overly rich and holds too much moisture. A coarse potting mix with sufficient drainage and aeration is a good place to start. You can use an African violet mix or unique cactus and succulent mixtures that you can purchase at the nursery. Add perlite or pumice to the cactus or African violet mix (up to 50% of the total potting mix, depending on your particular succulent’s moisture requirements) to further increase drainage and prevent compaction. To make sure the mixture is moist throughout, always moisten it before using.\nDecide on a container.\nWhen repotting, use a container that is at least 1 to 2 inches bigger than the nursery container and has a drainage hole. Avoid using glass containers (such mason jars or terrariums) for long-term potting since they prevent roots from breathing and over time may result in root rot. Place your plant inside the container and backfill with extra pre-moistened potting mix after filling the bottom one-third of the container with pre-moistened potting mix.\nPut the succulent plant in a pot somewhere sunny.\nTry to arrange your succulents close to a south or east-facing window because most succulents need at least six hours of sun each day. Insufficient sunlight may cause your succulents to become spindly or to extend toward the light.\nBetween waterings, allow the potting mix to dry out.\nOverwatering succulents is the most common error people make with them. Watering more deeply but less frequently is preferable. Before the next watering, completely saturate the potting mix (while making sure the water drains out of the drainage hole properly). The plant can finally perish if the potting soil is left moist every day.\nSucculents should be fertilized at least once a year.\nFertilizer works best for plants in the spring (when the days lengthen and new growth starts) and again in the late summer. Use a water-soluble, balanced fertilizer (such as 8-8-8 or 10-10-10) that has been diluted to half the strength indicated on the container. Since succulents are semi-dormant in the winter, there is no need to nourish them. Because they are not actively growing, they do not require the nutrient boost.\nHow are cacti stressed?\nPlacing your succulents in the dark is one of the simplest ways to stress them out. For four or five days, cover your succulents in darkness to replicate the conditions they would encounter when being transported in a dark box (one of the reasons why store-bought succulents are so colorful at first).\nFor the colors to truly stand out, you can continue doing this for up to fourteen days. Low-light indoor succulents including jade plants, air plants, gasteria, and haworthia work well for this.\nStressing Succulents With Grow Lights\nOn the other hand, by giving your succulents more sunlight, you might be able to encourage them to exhibit vibrant hues. Consider beginning the plants outside, where they can receive up to a week’s worth of bright shade (note – only do this if you live in a warm enough climate to grow succulents outdoors, or you may kill them with too much cold),\nGive the plants another week or so to adjust before moving them to an area with partial sunlight. Bring the plants inside, where you should place them in a full-sun area or beneath grow lights.\nWhen exposed to more sunshine, certain sun-loving succulents, such as cacti and sedum, will reveal more lovely colours of red, pink, and purple because their pigments will grow more bright.\nPay close attention to your succulents if you plan to light stress them. You’ll be able to recognize sunburn symptoms early. Succulents can typically bounce back from the majority of light-related issues in just a week or two if you gradually introduce them to the proper circumstances.\nHow to Cold Stress Succulents\nStart with a robust collection of plants. You should pick succulent kinds like aloes, kalanchoes, euphorbias, sedums, sempervivums, aeoniums, and echeveria because not all succulents will change color when stressed. Normally, agave doesn’t change color under stress.\nCold stress has the same positive effects on succulents’ color as light stress does. While keeping temperatures above freezing, you could leave the plant outside in the cold. Similar to mild stress, this shock may cause pigments to flush.\nBut this procedure is a little more delicate. To ensure that your succulent plants aren’t stressed to the point of death by spending an excessive amount of time below their cold hardiness thresholds, you’ll want to keep a close check on them.\nHow to Stress Your Succulents With Moisture\nYou may stress your succulent plants with water just like you can with light and cold stress. Succulents are known for their capacity to tolerate extended droughts, therefore doing this can be challenging.\nHowever, you can frequently stress your plant out enough to flush pigments by cutting out water (the precise amount you should cut out will vary depending on what kind of succulent you’re growing and how much water you are giving it now; consult your planting instructions for more information on this)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f7547698-455d-4b8e-b7ea-cadd2a387c45>","<urn:uuid:56b056c3-471b-4d54-a81f-8d0ae52f1cd8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a cybersecurity student, I need to understand both defensive measures for home networks and common attack types. Could you explain how a WPA2-secured home router helps protect against packet sniffing, and what vulnerabilities might still exist?","answer":"A WPA2-secured wireless router provides strong encryption to protect against packet sniffing attacks, which can occur when attackers place passive receivers near wireless transmitters to capture sensitive data like passwords and personal information. However, even with WPA2 security, vulnerabilities may still exist. Packet sniffers can be deployed in wired environments like Ethernet LANs or through compromised access routers. Since packet sniffers are passive and don't inject packets, they are difficult to detect. Additional security measures like firewalls and keeping all devices' software updated are needed for comprehensive protection.","context":["Securing Your Home Network\nA protected home network means your family can use the Internet safely and securely.\nMost households now run networks of devices linked to the Internet, including computers, laptops, gaming devices, TVs, tablets, and smartphones that access wireless networks. To protect your home network and your family, you need to have the right tools in place and confidence that family members can use the Internet safely and securely.\nThe first step is to Keep a Clean Machine and make sure all of your Internet-enabled devices have the latest operating system, web browsers and security software. This includes mobile devices that access your wireless network.\nSecure Your Wireless Router: A wireless network means connecting an Internet access point – such as a cable or DSL modem – to a wireless router. Going wireless is a convenient way to allow multiple devices to connect to the Internet from different areas of your home. However, unless you secure your router, you’re vulnerable to people accessing information on your computer, using your Internet service for free and potentially using your network to commit cybercrimes.\nHere are ways to secure your wireless router:\nChange the name of your router: The default ID – called a service set identifier” (SSID) or “extended service set identifier” (ESSID ) – is assigned by the manufacturer. Change your router to a name that is unique to you and won’t be easily guessed by others.\nChange the pre-set password on your router: When creating a new password, make sure it is long and strong, using a mix of numbers, letters and symbols. Here are some tips for creating a secure password the easy way.\nReview security options: When choosing your router’s level of security, opt for WPA2, if available, or WPA. They are more secure than the WEP option.\nCreate a guest password: Some routers allow for guests to use the network via a separate password. If you have many visitors to your home, it’s a good idea to set up a guest network.\nUse a firewall: Firewalls help keep hackers from using your computer to send out your personal information without your permission. While anti-virus software scans incoming email and files, a firewall is like a guard, watching for attempts to access your system and blocking communications with sources you don’t permit. Your operating system and/or security software likely comes with a pre-installed firewall, but make sure you turn on these features.\nProtect Yourself with these STOP. THINK. CONNECT. Tips:\nKeep a clean machine: Having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats.\nAutomate software updates: Many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. Turn on automatic updates if that’s an available option.\nProtect all devices that connect to the Internet: Along with computers, smart phones, gaming systems, and other web-enabled devices also need protection from viruses and malware.\nPlug & scan: “USBs” and other external devices can be infected by viruses and malware. Use your security software to scan them.\nProtect your $$: When banking and shopping, check to be sure the sites is security enabled. Look for web addresses with “https://” or “shttp://”, which means the site takes extra measures to help secure your information. “Http://” is not secure. Want more security? Have the ability to turn your debit card off and turn it back on from your smart phone with CardValet, giving you an added layer of security against debit card fraud with user controls.\nBack it up: Protect your valuable work, music, photos, and other digital information by making an electronic copy and storing it safely.\nOctober is Cyber Security Awareness month. Take the time to learn more at staysafeonline.org","Types of Network Attacks\nThe internet has become mission critical for many institutions today, including large and small companies, universities, and government agencies. Many individuals also rely on the internet for many of their professional, social, and personal activities. But behind all this utility and excitement, there is a dark side, a side where “bad guys” attempt to wreak havoc in our daily lives by damaging our internet-connected computers, violating our privacy, and rendering inoperable the internet services on which we depend.\nThe field of network security is about how the bad guys can attack computer networks and about how we, soon-to-be experts in computer networking, can defend networks against those attacks, or better yet, design new architectures that are immune to such attacks in the first place. Given the frequency and variety of existing attacks as well as the threat of new and more destructive future attacks, network security has become a central topic in the field of computer networking. One of the features of this course is that it brings network security issues to the forefront.\nSince we don’t yet have expertise in computer networking and internet protocols, we’ll begin here by surveying some of today’s more prevalent security related problems. This will whet our appetite for more substantial discussions in the upcoming modules. So we begin here by simply asking, what can go wrong? How are computer networks vulnerable? What are some of the more prevalent types of attacks today?\nInjecting Malware Into Your Host Through The Internet\nWe attach devices to the internet because we want to receive/send data from/to the internet. This includes all kinds of good stuff, including web pages, e-mail messages, MP3s, telephone calls, live video, search engine results, and so on. But, unfortunately, along with all the good stuff comes malicious stuff-collectively known as malware – that can also enter and infect our devices. Once malware infects our device it can do all kinds of devious things, including deleting our files; installing spyware that collectors our private information, such as social security numbers, passwords, and keystrokes, and then sends this (over the internet of course!) back to the bad guys. Our compromised host may also be enrolled in a network of thousands of similarly compromised devices, collectively known as a botnet , which the bad guys control and leverage for spam e-mail distribution or distributed denial-of-service attacks against targeted hosts.\nMuch of the malware out there today is self-replicating : once it infects one host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the internet , and from the newly infected hosts, it seeks entry into yet more hosts. In this manner, self-replicating malware can spread exponentially fast. Malware can spread in the form of a virus or a worm. Viruses are malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the user’s device. This classic example is an e-mail attachment containing malicious executable code. If a user receivers and opens such an attachment , the user inadvertently runs the malware on the device. Typically, such e-mail viruses are self-replicating : once executed, the virus may send an identical message with an identical malicious attachment to, for example, every recipient in the user’s address book. Worms are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction. For example, a user may be running a vulnerable network application to which an attacker can send malware. In some cases, without any user interaction, the application may accept the malware from the internet and run it creating a worm. The worm in the newly infected device then scans the internet, searching for other hosts running the same vulnerable network application. When it finds other vulnerable hosts, it sends a copy of itself to those hosts. Today, malware, is pervasive and costly to defend against. As you work through this course, we encourage you to think about the following questions: What can computer network designers do to defend internet-attached devices from malware attacks?\nAttacking Servers and Network Infrastructure\nAnother broad class of security threats are known as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. As the name suggest, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users. Web servers, e-mail servers, DNS servers and institutional networks can all be subjected to DoS attacks. Internet DoS attacks are extremely common, with thousands of DoS attacks occurring every year. Most internet DoS attacks fall into one of three categories:\n- Vulnerability attack : This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the service can stop or worse, the host can crash.\n- Bandwidth flooding : The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted host – so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server.\n- Connection flooding : The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at the target host. The host can become so bogged down with these bogus connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections.\nLet’s now explore the bandwidth-flooding attack in more detail. Recalling our delay and loss analysis discussion in section 1.4.2, it’s evident that if the server has an access rate of R bps, then the attacker will need to send traffic at a rate of approximately R bps to cause damage. If R is very large, a single attack source may not be able to generate enough traffic to harm the server. Furthermore, if all the traffic emanates from a single source, an upstream router may be able to detect the attack and block all traffic from that source before the traffic gets near the server. In a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, illustrated in figure 1.25, the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source blast traffic at the target. With this approach, the aggregate traffic rate across all the controlled sources needs to be approximately R to cripple the service. DDoS attacks leveraging botnets with thousands of compromised hosts are a common occurrence today. DDoS attacks are much harder to detect and defend against than a DoS attack from a single host.\nWe encourage you to consider the following question as you work your way through the course: what can computer network designers do to defend against DoS attacks? We will see that different defences are needed for the three types of DoS attacks.\nMany users today access the internet via wireless devices, such as WiFi-connected laptops or handheld devices with cellular internet connections. While ubiquitous internet access is extremely convenient and enables marvellous new applications for mobile users, it also create a major security vulnerability – by placing a passive receiver in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter, that receiver can obtain a copy of every packet that is transmitted! These packets can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including passwords, social security numbers, trade secrets, and private personal messages. A passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by is called a packet sniffer .\nSniffers can be deployed in wired environments as well. In wired broadcast environments, as in many Ethernet LANs, a packet sniffer can obtain copies of broadcast packets sent over the LAN. As described in section 1.2, cable access technologies also broadcast packets and are thus vulnerable to sniffing. Furthermore, a bad guy who gains access to an institution’s access router or access link to the internet may be able to plant a sniffer that makes a cop of every packet going to/from the organization. Sniffed packets can then be analysed offline for sensitive information\nPacket-sniffing software is freely available at various web sites and as commercial products. Professors teaching a networking course have been known to assign lab exercises that involve writing a packet-sniffing and application-layer data reconstruction program.\nBecause packet sniffers are passive – that is, they do not inject packets into the channel – they are difficult to detect. So, when we send packets into a wireless channel, we must accept the possibility that some bad guy may be recording copies of our packets. As you may have guessed, some of the best defences against packet sniffing involve cryptography.\nMasquerading as Someone You Trust\nIt is surprisingly easy (you will have the knowledge to do so shortly as you proceed through this article) to create a packet with an arbitrary source address, packet content, and destination address and then transmit this hand-crafted packet into the internet, which will dutifully forward the packet to its destination. Imagine the unsuspecting receiver (say an internet router) who receives such a packet, takes the (false) source address as being truthful, and then performs some command embedded in the packet’s contents (say modifies its forwarding table). The ability to inject packets into the internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing, and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.\nTo solve this problem, we will need end-point authentication, that is, mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does. Once again, we encourage you to think about how this can be done for network applications and protocols as you progress through the modules in this course.\nIn closing this section it’s worth considering how the internet got to be such an insecure place in the first place. The answer, in essence, is that the internet was originally designed to be that way, based on the model of “a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network”- a model in which there is no need for security. Many aspects of this original internet architecture deeply reflect this notion of mutual trust. For example, the ability of one user to send a packet to any other user is the default rather than a request/granted capability, and user identity is taken at declared face value, rather than being authenticated by default.\nBut today’s internet certainly does not involve “mutually trusting users.” Nonetheless, today’s users still need to communicate when they don’t necessarily trust each other, may wish to communicate anonymously, may communicate indirectly through third parties and may distrust the hardware, software, and even the air through which they communicate. We now have many security-related challenges before us as we progress through this course: We should seek defences against sniffing, end-point masquerading, man-in-the-middle attacks, DDoS attacks, malware, and more. We should keep in mind that communication among mutually trusted users is the exception rather than the rule.

{"question":"How can farmers maintain healthy energy levels during busy seasons like planting and harvest?","answer":"To maintain healthy energy levels, farmers should follow these dietary guidelines: eat a good breakfast and at least one other balanced meal daily, reduce caffeine and highly refined carbohydrates, limit saturated fats, consume plenty of fruits and vegetables, and include fiber in their diet. This approach provides sustainable energy levels instead of the peaks and valleys caused by relying on empty calories from coffee, donuts, soda, and candy bars.","context":["The past 25 years — with low commodity prices, rapidly escalating farm expenses, shifting global markets, and extreme climatic problems including drought, floods, cold springs, hot summers — have been challenging for Wisconsin farmers. Gross farm income has been down and farm expenses have escalated. Many farmers have struggled “to stay up in a down economy” and “to farm in a depressed environment without getting depressed.”\nYou can use a number of approaches to stay up in a down economy, including the following eight strategies. Try one or two strategies today ... the more you use, the greater your likelihood of dealing with stress.\nWatch what you ingest\nFarmers don’t always eat right, especially during spring planting season and harvest times when they are in a hurry to get the work done…while the sun is shining or before the snow flies. Coffee and rolls or soda and candy bars frequently become the norm during these crunch times. A diet of empty calories like this can result in caffeine and sugar “highs” and the “lows” that follow. If you find that you need more and more coffee, donuts, soda, candy bars and chips to “keep your energy up” you are probably addicted to these empty calories. You should consider a major change in your diet. Some simple guidelines are in order: get a good breakfast and at least one other balanced meal each day, cut back on caffeine and highly refined carbohydrates, cut back on saturated fats, get plenty of fruit and vegetables and include fiber in your diet. This diet will result in sustainable energy levels rather than the “peaks and valleys” that will eventually cause “energy crashes” and depressed moods.\nGet regular exercise\nFarmers frequently say “I get plenty of exercise on the farm,” and there was a time when farmers did get plenty of exercise. But today, farmers use barn cleaners, silo unloaders, mechanical feeding equipment, gravity-fed grain handling equipment, and tractors for moving large hay bales. In short, a lot of the backbreaking exercise that was a normal part of farm life has been replaced by mechanized technology. A lack of exercise can cause headaches, backaches, depressed moods, anxiety attacks and insomnia. Fortunately, there are fairly simple ways to get more exercise:\nWalk whenever you can. Walk from the farmstead to the field and from the far end of a parking lot to your church or implement dealer’s door. Take a walk with your spouse in the early morning or after lunch.\nDo stretching exercises to stretch out all of the muscles between your head, neck, shoulders and lower back. Tense muscles cause many headaches and backaches and stretching exercises can prevent this problem.\nJog, swim, go for a bike ride, shoot buckets, or do other kinds of exercise that help you keep your body fit and your mind sharp.\nUse positive self-talk\nWhen we find ourselves in difficult or stressful situations, negative self-talk or chatter usually kicks in immediately. Mastering the fine art of transforming negative self-talk into positive self-talk can be one of the most powerful strategies we have for staying up in a down economy. The first step is to recognize the negative self-talk when it occurs. Five of the most common forms of negative self-talk are using four-letter words, “shoulds” and “oughts,” catastrophizing, putting yourself down and blaming others. If you hear any of these things going through your head, say: “STOP!” Then reframe the self-talk using more positive language. When you use positive self-talk, you allow yourself to accept the situation (you don’t have to like it!), nurture yourself, view the situation as a challenge, and act with courage. Positive self-talk might sound like this: “This is part of the challenge of farming…but I don’t have to worry. I’m a skilled person and I can rise to the challenge. If I do __________, I’ll be on my way to dealing with the situation.”\nPractice the art of relaxation\nWhen we are stressed out, our blood pressure rises, our heart rate accelerates, our metabolism speeds up, our muscles tense up, and our breathing becomes fast and shallow. In short, we are experiencing the “fight or flight” response: our bodies are gearing up to fight or to flee the situation. In addition, we often freeze: we become paralyzed or immobilized and simply can’t act. Practicing the relaxation response on a regular basis can help farm family members get past the fight, flight or freeze response. The relaxation response requires four things: a quiet environment, a comfortable position, a passive attitude and a mental device. In practice, it amounts to getting comfortable in a peaceful, quiet setting; closing your eyes; taking a few deep breaths; letting your muscles relax completely; and then visualizing yourself in a peaceful, relaxed setting for a brief period of time. This activity, if practiced daily, can help farm family members feel more relaxed and centered — better able to take action, rather than being immobilized by stressful situations. Try to find a time — early morning, lunchtime, before bed at night — when you can take five minutes to find the peace relaxation can bring.\nTalk with family members\nWhen we experience stress, we often “clam-up” and fail to talk with the most important people in our lives. It happens for many reasons: we may be embarrassed by the situation; we may feel we have failed as family “providers;” or it may be we simply don’t know what to say or how to say it. But chances are family members already know there are problems ... the tension tells them so. It’s better to talk openly with family members: it will help you get concerns/frustrations off your chest and you may be able to solicit their help in resolving issues. Your children can assist by pitching in to help with the work or by cutting back on family expenses (fewer or less expensive purchases). Adult brothers and sisters can assist by providing labor, offering an operating loan or extending the provisions of a farm purchase agreement. Parents can also help if they know the situation you are facing. So, summon your courage and share your situation in an honest way that is sensitive to the concerns family members may have. It could be one of the most helpful conversations you can have.\nBuild a positive support system\nOne of the most common responses when farm families find themselves in long-term stressful situations is to withdraw or pull back from their social support system — family, friends, neighbors, church, school, and farm organizations. This is a common response but it’s not a healthy one. Family, friends, neighbors and other people or organizations provide us with one of the best buffers for stress. They allow us to vent feelings or get things off our chests, to solve problems and explore options and to identify resources that can be helpful in difficult situations. You don’t want to share your problems with everyone you meet (the grapevine works quite well in rural communities!) but it can be helpful to share problems and concerns with people in a position to be helpful: a trusted friend, your pastor, your veterinarian, your University of Wisconsin-Extension agent or technical college farm training specialist, your DHI representative, your artificial inseminator or your local feed dealer. Build a support system that works for you by building a trusting relationship with people who are in a position to help you succeed in farming.\nLearn to deal with conflict\nFarmers can find themselves in conflict with creditors, farm inspectors, power plant representatives, state food safety staff, natural resources staff, and any number of other people. If a farmer responds in a heated, off-the-cuff way to creditors or regulatory staff, the sparks can fly and the farmer may later regret his impulsive action. A few guidelines are in order for dealing with conflict:\nTalk directly with the other person. Don’t avoid or go around the person you are in conflict with or it will make the situation worse. If you have overdue bills, talk to your creditors, share your situation with them and offer to work out a repayment plan.\nChoose a time that works for both of you. Be considerate of the other person’s schedule and find a time when you can truly focus on the issues to be discussed.\nTake a listening stance into the conversation. The other person will be more likely to listen to you when you have demonstrated that you’ve heard what he/she has said.\nBe assertive but not aggressive. Make sure you help the other person understand your perspective on the issue and assert your needs in the situation.\nTalk it all through. Don’t avoid the big, uncomfortable issues or they will come back to haunt you.\nIdentify mutually agreeable solutions. Strive for win/win solutions and keep talking about options until you find one that will work for both of you.\nReach out for help if you need it — there are mediators available to help settle difficult conflicts so seek out help if you reach an impasse with the other person.\nTake time to laugh and play\nWhen times get tough, farm families tend to work harder — they farm more acreage, add more livestock, start a new enterprise/business, seek an off-farm job or do all of these things. When they do this, they may become exhausted and lose their sense of humor and perspective. It’s important to take time to laugh, to play, and to engage in fun activities or recreation. Fun activities don’t need to be expensive. It can be as simple as getting together with other farm families for a meal, a movie or a rousing game of cards. By getting together with other farm families you are also strengthening your support system. Both things are important during tough times!\nRead more information to help analyze your situation.\nFor assistance in making these tough decisions, contact your UW-Extension county agent, your Farm Business and Production Management Instructor in the Technical College or the DATCP Farm Center at (800) 942-2474.\nSource: University of Wisconsin"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:78901d36-b673-431e-bc4a-c2f21bbe5186>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a coastal ecosystem researcher, I'd like to understand: which ecosystem provides better coastal protection - reed beds or mangroves? Could you compare their specific protective functions?","answer":"Both reed beds and mangroves provide important but complementary coastal protection functions. Reed beds provide shore protection by stabilizing soil with their root systems (called rhizomes) and decelerating wave energy. They also act as the first line of defense against erosion and pollution. Mangroves similarly protect shorelines from erosion and storm damage, while also providing filtering of water. These ecosystems actually work together as part of a larger interconnected system - with reed beds serving as the first barrier, followed by mangroves and seagrass as second and third barriers. This multi-layered protection helps safeguard the shoreline and coral reefs.","context":["Today is World Wetlands Day. We know that most of you know how important wetlands are to the environment but for anyone out there who isn’t sure this a good time to explain what wetlands actually are and why they deserve a day to raise awareness about them. Wetlands are, in general terms, areas in which water covers the soil or where water is present at or near the surface of the soil or within the root zone throughout the year or for varying periods within the year. Think swamps, marshes and, the ones that really interests us today, reed beds.\nReed beds are incredibly important ecologically. They help to protect species of fish and crabs by providing food and shelter in their roots for juvenile animals. They provide shore protection by stabilizing the soil with their root system and decelerating wave energy. Reeds’ grow from an interconnected root system called the rhizome. The rhizome is one continual system that connects plants, which allows the root system to exist for millennia unless threatened or destroyed by changes in their climate (soil changing from damp to dry) or human impact on landscape ecology resulting in the clearing the area and allowing the root system to die. They also provide protection to the sea from pollution. Reed beds are also an incredibly important and useful resource in the Bay of Ranobe and across Madagascar for another reason. Vondro reeds are used for many different purposes throughout Madagascar including making mats, baskets and roofing houses. It is the most economical and easily sourced building material in this area and is used a lot.\nThe importance of reed bed protection is very clear in the village of Ambondrolava, where the Reef Doctor Honko Project (full details of this project to be provided on our new website, coming soon!) is based. Many people in the village make a living from vondro and it provides the main source of income to many villagers. Men in the village cut and dry vondro for use as a building material for roofs. Although vondro does not withstand conditions as well as corrugated iron or slate, it is the most economical and most freely available material and so is used to make the vast majority of roofs on houses in the area.\nWomen in the village, many of whom are members of the women’s association of Amdondrolava, use the reeds to make traditional floor mats known as Tihy, baskets, hats and bags that they sell through Reef Doctor Project Honko to generate an income for the women’s group and for the women’s individual families and an alternative livelihood to women so that they can earn their own money and be empowered by their activity. Reef Doctor Honko has worked closely with the community since 2007 to educate people about the importance of reed beds and mangroves and has actively participated in the protection of these resources. The mangroves and reed beds are protected by the local community and guardians are paid to guard the beds and mangroves at night.\nSo why is an NGO concerned with mangrove protection involved with reed bed protection? Reed beds form their own ecosystem but can also be looked at as part of a larger ecosystem that includes wetlands, mangroves and seagrass. This larger ecosystem also provides protection to juvenile animals and shore protection and reed beds can be seen as the first line of defense for this ecosystem with mangroves and sea grass providing the second and third barriers to erosion and pollution, all of which help to protect the barrier reef that stretches across the Bay of Ranobe. Like many things in nature these ecosystems are intrinsically linked and need each other to survive and to provide protection to the surrounding area including the shoreline and coral reefs so it just makes sense that the villagers of Amdondrolava protect their mangrove forests and their vondro reed beds. Seagrass in the area is also protected with over 400 hectares currently under partial protection with plans to increase the area and level of protection in the future.\nIn 2017 Reef Doctor Honko plans to map the wetlands, mangroves and sea grass in the area and will develop a management plan for sustainable exploitation of reed beds to further ensure the proper management of the resource. Currently an extraction license is required to extract reeds from the beds and the money generated by this will be used to manage and protect the beds to ensure that the people of Ambondrolava will continue to have a source of income that benefits both men and women for generations to come.\nArticle by RD Comms Officer Ivana Rubino","Marine vegetation management strategies\nMangroves and saltmarsh are coastal habitats adapted to living in sheltered parts of the foreshore and to the rise and fall of tides. They provide important benefits by:\n- providing habitat and a food source for animals within estuaries and around their shoreline\n- protecting shorelines from erosion and storm damage\n- filtering the water\n- storing carbon, known as blue carbon.\n- addresses the key threats and risks for mangrove and saltmarsh, identified in the NSW Threat and Risk Assessment (TARA), including changed tidal and freshwater flows often associated with agricultural and urban development, grazing and trampling by livestock, clearing and four-wheel driving in saltmarsh\n- identifies priority areas for the protection of healthy mangrove and saltmarsh areas and rehabilitation of degraded areas. This will ensure coastal management programs and rehabilitation efforts are directed to the best locations having considered climate change impacts (sea-level rise), existing human disturbances and blue carbon opportunities\n- reduces red tape for low risk works required to maintain public infrastructure.\nThe carbon stored by mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands is known as ‘blue carbon’. The capture and storage of blue carbon can be increased by returning tidal flows to mangrove and saltmarsh systems that have been degraded or cleared by removing barriers to tidal flows. Returning the tide also brings back the other important benefits mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands provide, such as improved water quality and more fish.\nThe project team in collaboration with Professor Kerrylee Rogers and Dr Kirti Lal at the University of Wollongong are spearheading new and novel research that identifies co-benefits of blue carbon storage and high priority areas suitable for re-establishing coastal wetlands which can also lead to improved water quality and habitats for important fisheries in NSW.\n- First pass prioritisation of blue carbon opportunities.\n- Identify areas where mangroves can be trimmed to maintain safety clearances.\n- Prioritise estuaries for future strategies.\nMarine Vegetation Strategies are being developed for:\n- Tweed River estuary\n- Richmond River estuary\nLocal government areas - Statewide\nDepartment of Primary Industries - Fisheries (DPI-F)\nSummary: Data layer products developed from the Blue Carbon report are accessible from the Fisheries Spatial Data Portal.

{"question":"I'm studying coastal conservation - what are the main threats affecting both eelgrass habitats and blue carbon ecosystems in general?","answer":"Eelgrass habitats are specifically threatened by pollution, sedimentation, sea level rise, and physical damage from boats anchoring. Similarly, blue carbon ecosystems in general face threats from coastal development, pollution (particularly nutrient runoff from agriculture and sewage which can cause harmful algal blooms), and climate change impacts including rising sea levels and temperatures. Both types of ecosystems are sensitive to these environmental stressors, which can lead to their degradation or loss.","context":["The Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast (MaPP) has picked 14 pilot regional indicators that, taken together over the long-term, will provide insights into the health of B.C.’s North Pacific Coast and help guide implementation of coastal management recommendations in MaPP sub-regional plans.\nHundreds of potential ecological, economic and human well-being indicators were initially identified by experts at Uuma Consulting and planning team members of the four MaPP sub-regions: Haida Gwaii, the North Coast, the Central Coast and North Vancouver Island.\nTo select the pilot indicators, MaPP partners and the Coastal Oceans Research Institute (CORI) took feedback from sub-regional workshops and focused on indicators considered high-priority within each sub-region and which made sense to track at a regional scale. As indicators can be expensive and time-consuming to monitor, the team chose indicators that would each provide unique insights without incurring excessive costs.\n“It was challenging to narrow the list down,” said MaPP regional projects coordinator, Romney McPhie. “There are many things that are valuable to track, but collectively we came up with a short list that all sub-regions agreed upon to start the monitoring process.”\nEelgrass, the ribbon-like seagrass in estuaries throughout the region, was one of the indicators selected. MaPP personnel will track data on eelgrass distribution and biomass regularly during the 20-year implementation period of the MaPP plans.\n“Eelgrass is one of the most ecologically important habitats. It’s also quite sensitive to pollution, sedimentation, sea level rise and even boats anchoring in it,” said Karin Bodtker a manager with CORI, the independent research institute based at the Vancouver Aquarium, that helped refine the list of indicators with MaPP.\n“This plant provides habitat for about 80 per cent of marine species of commercial interest,” Bodtker explained. “Juvenile salmon, for example, use eelgrass habitat to find food, hide from predators and as a highway in their migration out to the ocean.” Eelgrass also captures and stores carbon.\nUnderstanding eelgrass losses or gains, alongside changes to other indicators like ocean acidity, will help MaPP understand the state of the marine environment and how it is changing over time. “The information collected will support sustainable decision-making along the coast,” said McPhie.\nIndicators are to be monitored from the middle of Vancouver Island through to the Alaskan border. They fall under seven themes: marine species and habitats; climate change and oceanography; water cleanliness; sense of place and wellbeing; seafood; coastal development and livelihoods; and stewardship and governance. These indicators reflect the MaPP commitment to ecosystem-based management, which prioritizes ecological integrity, human wellbeing and collaborative governance. In keeping with an adaptive approach, certain indicators may be changed if compelling reasons to do so arise, McPhie said.\nIn addition to the pilot regional indicators, sub-regions will have their own unique indicators for which they gather data. The Central Coast, for example, is monitoring crab and Haida Gwaii is monitoring the spread of invasive species, such as tunicates.\nWith regional indicators chosen, data collection is now underway. An analyst at CORI is assembling existing data on many indicators and identifying sampling gaps.\n“This program couldn’t happen without many other organizations that are collecting data: governments, private organizations, the coastal guardian watchmen and the regional monitoring system of the Coastal First Nations, for example,” McPhie said. “We’re ensuring we have reliable data through our collaboration with CORI, as well as through data access agreements we hope to secure with other governments and organizations.”\nMaPP partners are also now developing data management tools and public reporting strategies.\n“By the end of 2019 we expect a comprehensive report with regional data for all the pilot indicators and how those data relate to MaPP strategies. Analysis of the data will tell us if our strategies are working and if we need to change our strategies because of ecosystem changes,” McPhie said.\n“The purpose of indicator monitoring is to lead to better decision making. The Province can use the data to set or affirm priorities, allocate resources and inform policy and decision making,” said Kristin Worsley, manager of B.C.’s marine and coastal resources section and member of MaPP’s secretariat.\nSteve Diggon, regional marine planning coordinator for Coastal First Nations-Great Bear Initiative said, “Provincial decision-makers and First Nations will have evidence to inform their views on and decisions about issuing tenures for coastal activities.”","When we think about carbon and climate change, our minds often go to fossil fuels, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, there’s another side to the carbon story that’s just as important – the role of coastal ecosystems in storing and sequestering carbon. This is where the concept of “Blue Carbon” comes into play.\nThe Role of Blue Carbon in Climate Change\nCarbon Sequestration in Coastal Ecosystems\nBlue carbon refers to the carbon captured and stored by the world’s coastal and marine ecosystems. These ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, act as carbon sinks, capturing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In fact, they can sequester carbon at a rate up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests.\nThe Blue Carbon Initiative\nRecognizing the importance of these ecosystems, the Blue Carbon Initiative was launched to promote their conservation and restoration. The initiative brings together governments, research institutions, NGOs, and communities to protect and restore these vital ecosystems, which not only help in climate change mitigation but also provide numerous other ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, water purification, and coastal protection.\nCoastal Ecosystems and Blue Carbon\nMangroves are one of the most important blue carbon ecosystems. These unique trees, which grow in intertidal zones, have complex root systems that trap sediments, slowing down water flow and allowing organic material to settle. This creates a carbon-rich soil that can store significant amounts of carbon.\nSeagrasses, another vital blue carbon ecosystem, are flowering plants that grow in shallow coastal waters. They have the ability to capture and store large amounts of carbon in their roots and sediment, making them highly efficient carbon sinks.\nSalt marshes, found in the intertidal zone of coastal areas, are another important blue carbon ecosystem. These marshes are highly productive, with plants that capture and store carbon in their biomass and soil.\nThreats to Blue Carbon Ecosystems\nOne of the main threats to blue carbon ecosystems is coastal development. As coastal areas become more developed, these ecosystems are often destroyed or degraded, leading to the release of stored carbon back into the atmosphere.\nPollution, especially nutrient runoff from agriculture and sewage, can also harm blue carbon ecosystems. Excess nutrients can lead to algal blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in the water, harming seagrasses, mangroves, and other organisms.\nClimate change poses a significant threat to blue carbon ecosystems. Rising sea levels and temperatures can lead to the loss of these ecosystems, while increased storm intensity can cause physical damage.\nConservation Efforts for Blue Carbon Ecosystems\nTo counter these threats, various restoration projects are underway to bring back lost or degraded blue carbon ecosystems. These projects involve planting mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, and are often done in collaboration with local communities.\nPolicy measures, such as designating protected areas and creating incentives for conservation and restoration, are also crucial in protecting blue carbon ecosystems. By recognizing the value of these ecosystems, we can ensure their conservation and restoration, leading to long-term benefits for the climate and biodiversity.\nThe Future of Blue Carbon\nThe concept of blue carbon is still relatively new, but it’s gaining recognition and momentum. As we continue to understand the importance of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation, we can expect more efforts to conserve and restore them. With collaboration between governments, researchers, NGOs, and communities, we can protect and enhance these vital ecosystems for future generations.\n- Biology Niche: Exploring the Fascinating World\n- Biofuels: The Future of Sustainable Energy\n- Biodiversity: Exploring Nature’s Tapestry\nIn conclusion, blue carbon is a crucial part of the global carbon cycle, with coastal ecosystems playing a key role in capturing and storing carbon. By conserving and restoring these ecosystems, we can mitigate climate change while also enjoying other ecosystem services. The future of blue carbon is promising, and with continued efforts, we can ensure these ecosystems are protected for generations to come.\nWhat is blue carbon?\nBlue carbon refers to the carbon captured and stored by the world’s coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes.

Pisac is most known for its Incan ruins and large market every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, an event which attracts heavy tourist traffic from nearby Cusco.\nPisac and the Vilcanota River\n|• Total||148.25 km2 (57.24 sq mi)|\n|Elevation||2,972 m (9,751 ft)|\n|• Density||66/km2 (170/sq mi)|\n|Time zone||UTC-5 (PET)|\nPisac is perhaps best known for its Incan ruins, known as Inca Písac, which lie atop a hill at the entrance to the valley. The ruins are separated along the ridge into four groups: P'isaqa, Inti Watana, Qalla Q'asa, and Kinchiraqay. Inti Watana group includes the Temple of the Sun, baths, altars, water fountains, a ceremonial platform, and an inti watana, a volcanic outcrop carved into a \"hitching post for the Sun\" (or Inti). The angles of its base suggest that it served to define the changes of the seasons. Qalla Q'asa, which is built onto a natural spur and overlooks the valley, is known as the citadel.\nThe Inca constructed agricultural terraces on the steep hillside, which are still in use today. They created the terraces by hauling richer topsoil by hand from the lower lands. The terraces enabled the production of surplus food, more than would normally be possible at altitudes as high as 11,000 feet.\nWith military, religious, and agricultural structures, the site served at least a triple purpose. Researchers believe that Písac defended the southern entrance to the Sacred Valley, while Choquequirao defended the western entrance, and the fortress at Ollantaytambo the northern. Inca Pisac controlled a route which connected the Inca Empire with the border of the rain forest.\nOne of its more notable features was a large pisonay tree, which dominated the central plaza (it was destroyed by a 2013 thunderstorm).\nAccording to the scholar Kim MacQuarrie, Pachacuti erected a number of royal estates to memorialize victories over other ethnic groups. Among these royal estates are Písac (victory over the Cuyos), Ollantaytambo (victory over the Tambos), and Machu Picchu (conquest of the Vilcabamba Valley). Other historians suggest that Písac was established to protect Cusco from possible attacks of the Antis nations. It is unknown when Inca Písac was built. Since it does not appear to have been inhabited by any pre-Inca civilization, it was most likely built no earlier than 1440.\nFrancisco Pizarro and the Spanish conquerors destroyed Inca Písac in the early 1530s. The modern town of Písac was built in the valley by Viceroy Toledo during the 1570s.\n- Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)\n- \"Pisac Market and ruins\".

One of the most atmospheric and mystical sites in the world, it is located among spectacular mountain scenery about 6,750 feet above the Urubamba Valley. Machu Picchu has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is the end point of the most popular hike in South America: the Inca Trail.\nHistory of Machu Picchu\nIt is generally thought that the city of Machu Picchu was built by the Sapa Inca Pachacuti starting in about 1440 and was inhabited until the Spanish conquest of Peru in 1532.\nArcheological evidence combined with recent work on early colonial documents indicates that Machu Picchu was not a conventional city, but rather a country retreat town for Incan nobility (similar to the Roman villas). It is estimated that a maximum of only about 750 people resided in Machu Picchu at any one time, and probably only a small fraction of that number lived in the town during the rainy season and when no nobility were visiting.\nIt is still unknown exactly what role the site played in Incan life. But it was clearly a remarkably well hidden place, and well protected. Located far up in the mountains of Peru, visitors had to travel up long valleys littered with Incan check points and watch towers.\nRemarkably, the Spanish conquistadors missed the site, and the Inca city remained hidden until the 20th century. On a wet day in 1911, Yale scholar Hiram Bingham travelled up the slopes with a few companions from an expedition. He met some local peasants, who told him about ancient ruins that covered the area. He went to see them, and found the lost Inca city of Machu Picchu.\nIn 1913, the site received a significant amount of publicity after the National Geographic Society devoted their entire April 1913 issue to Machu Picchu. Bingham made several more trips and conducted excavations on the site through 1915. He wrote a number of books and articles about Machu Picchu; his account, Lost City of the Incas, became a bestseller.\nIn 2003, some 400,000 people visited Machu Picchu, and UNESCO has expressed concern about the damage this volume of tourism is causing to the site. Peruvian authorities insist that there is no problem, and that the remoteness of the site will impose natural limits on tourism. Periodically, proposals are made to install a cable car to the site, but such proposals have so far always been rejected.\nWhat to See at Machu Picchu\nThe site was probably chosen for its unique location and geological features. It is said that the silhouette of the mountain range behind Machu Picchu represents the face of the Inca looking upward towards the sky, with the largest peak, Waynapicchu, representing his nose.\nThe Inca believed that the solid rock of the Earth should not be cut, so they built this city from rock quarried from loose boulders found in the area. Some of the stone architecture uses no mortar, but rather relied on extremely precise cutting of blocks. Some of the spaces between the stones are so tight that not even a credit card will pass through them.\nThe ruins on Machu Picchu consist of a large palace and temples to Incan deities around a courtyard, with residential buildings for support staff. Entrance is at the southern end of the site, where there is a ticket office. From there, visitors are free to wander through the ruins at leisure, beginning with the agricultural precinct on the southern terraces.\nThere are no signs on any of the structures, which contributes to the atmosphere of antiquity, personal discovery, and harmony with the natural environment for which Machu Picchu is so beloved. To help identify the ruins, guidebooks and maps are available at the entrance. The names of the structures are the English names given by Bingham, which in many cases do not correspond with the actual uses of the buildings.\nA 20-minute walk uphill to the left inside the entrance leads to the House of the Terrace Caretaker and Funeral Rock, which provides the famous and very photogenic view over the ruins of Machu Picchu.\nNear the south end of the city is the magnificent Temple of the Sun, whose walls are fine examples of precise Inca masonry. The temple is astronomically aligned. On the winter solstice (June 22 in the southern hemisphere), sunlight streams in a small trapezoidal window and illuminates a flat granite stone that was probably an Inca calendar. At night, the same window provides a view of the constellation Pleiades, an Inca symbol of crop fertility.\nThe Principal Temple has perhaps the best masonry on Machu Picchu. The stones of its three walls are precisely cut and fitted together without mortar. A small building next to the temple, dubbed the Sacristy, may be where priests prepared themselves for ceremonies.\nThe Temple of Three Windows is a three-walled building reached via a stone staircase. Its east wall is cut from a single piece of rock and pierced with three trapezoidal windows.\nFurther on is Intihuatana, the \"hitching post of the sun\" whose exact purpose remains a mystery. This sacred stone column was a common feature in Inca cities, but the Spanish destroyed most of them as objects of idol worship. This is therefore one of few to survive, since the conquistadors never made it to Machu Picchu. Nearby is a sacred rock that echos the shape of the mountain range behind it.\nAt the north end of the site, the Temple of the Condor is built in the shape of a condor, the Inca symbol of heaven.\nSpectacular views from the north side of Machu Picchu can be had from Wayna Picchu (also spelled Huayna Picchu), a mountain peak that overlooks the ruins. The climb takes 90 minutes and is dangerous after wet weather. Even in good conditions, it is not for the faint of heart when it comes to heights. The path is open 7am-1pm daily and only 400 visitors are allowed to climb each day.\nMany buses leave Cuzco for Machu Picchu and there are frequent trains from Cuzco to Aquas Calientes, the town below Machu Picchu. Buses from Aquas Calientes bring tourists to the ruins. It is also possible to take a helicopter from Cuzco.\nOne of the many advantages of hiking the scenic Inca Trail is that you can enjoy Machu Picchu in relative solitude before the busloads of tourists show up around 10am.\nQuick Facts on Machu Picchu\n|Categories:||sacred mountains; city ruins; astronomical alignments; World Heritage Sites|\n|Visitor and Contact Information|\n|Coordinates:||13.162859° S, 72.546008° W|\n|Address:||Ucayali Department, Peru|\n|Lodging:||View hotels near Machu Picchu|\n- Machu Picchu - Fodor's Peru\n- Ben Box, Footprint South American Handbook 2009 (September 2008), 1442-48.\n- Machu Picchu - Wikitravel\n- Machu Picchu Portal - in-depth information about the Incas, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu\n- Row erupts over Peru's tourist treasure - BBC News, December 27, 2003\n- Inca site cable car plan sparks anger - BBC News, August 23, 1999\n- Machu Picchu on the Web - annotated links\n- Rediscovering Machu Picchu by Bruce Fellman, Yale Alumni Magazine, December 2002.\n- Virtual tour of Machu Picchu and Peru - Destination Peru\n- Machu Picchu, Lost City of the Incas by Antonio Gutierrez\n- Field Museum exhibit website Chicago, Oct. 15, 2004 - Feb 13, 2005.\n- Machu Picchu on the Inca Trail\n- Inca Trail to Machu Picchu - photos of Machu Picchu\n- Photos of Machu Picchu - here on Sacred Destinations\nMap of Machu Picchu, Ucayali Department\nBelow is a location map and aerial view of Machu Picchu.

{"question":"What are the measurement capabilities of DTT assay versus IL-4 ELISA in detecting different biological responses?","answer":"The DTT assay and IL-4 ELISA have different measurement capabilities for biological responses. The DTT assay is an acellular test that measures oxidative potential of particulate matter, showing particular sensitivity to PM from industrial sources and biomass burning, especially in fine particles. In contrast, IL-4 ELISA provides quantitative measurements of IL-4 cytokine levels in biological samples, such as in PBMCs under different stimulation conditions (ranging from 14-70 pg/mL depending on the stimulant), and can be completed within a day using a 96-well plate format.","context":["Over the last few decades, numerous studies have showed how the exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated to negative effects on human health (Pope et al, 2004). Moreover, the evaluation of PM exposure and toxic responses has been focused on the study of mass concentration, chemical composition and dimensional distribution of the particles (Kelly et al, 2012). However, the mechanisms behind the health effects are still not fully understood because of the complexity of PM composition. During the last years, the study of the oxidative potential (OP) has been proposed as a relevant metric related to biological responses to PM exposure (Simonetti et al, 2018a). Oxidative potential (OP) is defined as a measure of the capacity of PM to oxidise target molecules, by generating ROS in environments without living cells. Several acellular assays for testing OP have been developed, such as acid ascorbic (AA), 2,7-dichlorofluorescenin (DCFH) and dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, but anyone has been identified as the most appropriate for interpreting PM oxidative potential results. Therefore, the best solution turned out to be an inter-comparison between the different acellular tests. In fact, the three OP assays have been deemed sensible toward different PM-selected components, coming from various typical urban and industrial emission sources and characterized by very different chemical compositions, which can be associated to different adverse health effects (Simonetti et al, 2018b). In this study we applied the three OP assays (OPAA, OPDTT and OPDCFH) to PM10 samples, previously chemically analysed (Massimi et al, 2017), collected at 23 different sampling sites in Terni (an urban and industrial hot-spot of Central Italy), by using innovative and very-low volume devices for PM sampling on membrane filters (HSRS - High Spatial Resolution Sampler; Fai Instruments, Fonte Nuova, Rome, Italy). The HSRS worked in parallel during a two-month winter monitoring period. The sampling sites have been chosen for spatially representing the main anthropic PM emission sources (i.e. vehicular traffic, rail network, power plant, steel plant, domestic and industrial biomass heating) and the samplers were located in order to cover the study area with around 1 km spatial resolution (Figure 1, upper panel; Massimi et al, 2019). In this study we aimed to assess the spatial variation of the three acellular assays in order to investigate the relationships between the different OP results and the contribution of the local emission sources to the total PM10. To our knowledge, the comparison of the three OP assays applied to PM10 spatially-resolved samples has never been undertaken so far. Furthermore, we applied the three OP assays to size-segregated PM samples collected by a multistage impactor (cut-sizes: 0.18, 0.32, 0.56, 1.0, 1.8, 3.2, 5.6, 10 and 18 μm) at three sampling sites (MA, CA and PR; Figure 1, upper panel), characterized by diﬀerent strength of the main PM sources, in order to evaluate the different sensitivity of the three acellular assays toward fine and coarse particles. The spatial mapping of the OP values, obtained by using the ordinary kriging interpolation (spherical semivariogram model; ArcGis, ArcMap 10.3.1) are reported in Figure 1. The results showed how OPAA was particularly sensitive toward PM10 coming from the rail network, released by resuspension of particles formed through the abrasion of train brakes. On the contrary, OPDTT, OPDCFH were found to be more related to PM10 coming from industrial sources (steel plant at PR and carpentry at FA) and biomass burning (domestic biomass heating at BR). Finally, size distribution analyses of OP confirmed that OPAA was more sensitive toward coarse particles, mainly released by brake abrasion, while OPDTT and OPDCFH were found to be more sensitive toward fine particles, mainly released by combustion processes such as biomass burning and industrial processes. These results confirmed the different sensitivity of the three OP assays toward PM10 released by the local emission sources.\nSpatial mapping and dimensional distribution of PM oxidative potential in Terni (Central Italy) / Massimi, Lorenzo; Ristorini, Martina; Simonetti, Giulia; Canepari, Silvia. - (2019).

The cell-permeant reagents are nonfluorescent (or very weakly fluorescent) while in a reduced state. Upon oxidation, they produce a strong fluorescent signal. With these reagents, researchers can detect oxidative stress in the red, orange, and green channels of their instruments.\nOxidative stress results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cells to scavenge them. In addition to the role oxidative stress plays in the progression of many diseases, ROS also appears to drive T cells toward the Th2 phenotype (J Immunol 176:2765 (2006)).

Thank you Michael — RIP. ~~~ Photo: @danmerkelarchives","Reno Abellira entered surfing’s collective consciousness at the 1968 World Contest in Puerto Rico. He didn’t win or even get second. But his path to sixth place revealed some of the fastest surfing ever seen at the time, drawing unconventional lines in a conventional time. While the traditional approach of Fred Hemmings took the world title that day, Abellira’s unique style and equipment put the world on notice that his surfing was poised to leap into uncharted territory. As an innovative performer and surfboard craftsman, the small framed Hawaiian local made waves throughout the 70’s but will forever be remembered for his Smirnoff Pro/Am win. Besting an international field of competitors in what has been called one of the greatest days in surf contest history and inspiring the next generation of shapers and wave riders, Reno Abellira’s mysterious persona left an indelible mark on surfing’s past and proved a key link in its progression towards the future.\nLife moved fast for the small framed regular foot. He was born 1950 in Honolulu, Hawaii, learned to surf at age 4, and early on lost his father , a boxer, who was shot and killed in a bar fight. He received his first board at age 11 and won the juniors division of the prestigious Makaha International 5 years later. No small feat to win once, Reno won the division again the following year and further solidified his contest results with a win at the 1966 Hawaiian Noseriding Contest, earning him $200 in what is acknowledged as Hawaii’s first professional contest. By 1968, Abellira was the Hawaii juniors champion and heading to the World Surfing Championships in Puerto Rico. At just 18 years old, he sent a shock through the surfing world with a high velocity, avant guard performance, riding a relatively miniature Brewer model faster and more radically than anyone else. Drew Kampion writes, “…diminutive Dick Brewer protégé Reno Abellira administered a future shock speed surfing performance but wiped out several times. The failure of the new school of surfing to win recognition in Puerto Rico dovetailed with a generational rejection of authority and a growing apathy towards competition.” That contest and Abellira’s surfing in particular signaled a separation of the old guard of surfers from the new crop of innovators. Hippy culture was rising and the Shortboard Revolution had been set in motion.\nReno continued to improve in the next few years. He won the Hawaii state title and placed second in the Duke Kahanomoku all the while putting in memorable free surfing performances all over the North Shore. Abellira was making his mark pushing the envelope of surfing, but his career reached a zenith on Thanksgiving Day, 1974. The Smirnoff Pro was recognized as the unofficial world contest, but the event over the years had yet to be blessed with a giant Hawaiian swell that would, as the contest advertising campaign boasted, “leave you breathless.”\nBut as the sun rose on contest day, the 36 invited surfers were just that… breathless. Wayne “Rabbit” Bartholomew would later refer to the scene as “the most terrifying sight I’d ever seen.” Consistent 25 foot bombs blew through the quintessential tropical paradise with bigger freak sets that ripped through the contest site and almost shut the event down. But this was what promoters and organizers where hoping for when they doubled the former 7 day waiting period to 14 days during which surfers were on call for the best possible conditions. For Smirnoff, spectators, and Reno Abellira, this would be a truly epic day. Rabbit described the contest further, “This was the most amazing day of surfing ever…” As the crowd of rabid spectators (estimated anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000) clogged Kamehameha Highway, Abellira surfed his way through the semifinals. While Hawaiian power surfer Jeff Hakman had taken the preliminary heat, the semi was Reno’s, but he would soon meet Hakman again in the final. With the swell still pumping, Reno Abellira won the final over a stellar group of surfers: James Jones, Peter Townend, Sam Hawk, Clyde Aikau, and Jeff Hakman, whom Abellira beat by mere fractions of a point. The crowd went nuts. And Reno took home a check for $5000.\nIn the mid seventies Reno rapidly became recognized as one of the hottest surfers on the North Shore alongside Hawaiian surf “gods” like Jeff Hakman, Barry Kanaiaupuni, Gerry Lopez, and Eddie Aikau; especially at huge Pipeline and Sunset. However, Abellira stood out. His surfing style appeared strange yet functional. His slight build didn’t lend itself readily to power surfing, but his low crouching style enabled him to complete tight turns as he stayed close to the breaking lip with radical skateboard-like pumps that propelled him to speeds that no other surfer of the time could match. In addition to his surfing style, his land persona was equally interesting. Abellira’s presence was described as mysterious. He appeared serious and sometimes somber under meticulous hair and decked out in high-stepping, high fashion outfits, appearing a far cry from your average surfer of the time.\nReno Abellira learned to build surfboards from Hawaiian legend Dick Brewer and eventually worked for Lightening Bolt surfboards. In the early seventies Abellira experimented with different fin designs (even the tri fin at one point) but it would be the twin fin that would strike a chord with the surfing world. Mark Richards would later reflect that it was a short and stubby fish sporting two fins ridden by Abellira in Australia that inspired him to design his famous twin fin surfboard which he would later ride to 4 world titles and spark a late 70’s design phenomenon.\nAs the IPS took shape, Abellira initially shined brightly with a gradual descent to earth, reaching as high as 4th in 1977 before falling to 8th in 1978 and finally 13th in 1979. At 40 years old, he was invited to surf in the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau in conditions at Waimea that conjured up images of his past Smirnoff win. Reno Abellira’s surfing career was complete.

{"question":"I study museum history - how do historical maritime collections relate to modern environmental concerns?","answer":"The East India Marine Society's museum documented global environmental and cultural artifacts through its extensive collection, including natural specimens like elephant tusks, shells, and geological samples from around the world. This historical documentation provides a baseline for understanding environmental changes. Today, similar scientific documentation is critical for tracking climate tipping points - critical thresholds where small changes trigger larger, irreversible effects. For instance, modern research shows the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation has weakened 15% since the 1950s, while the Greenland ice sheet has lost four trillion tons of ice between 1992-2018, demonstrating how historical collections and modern environmental monitoring both serve to track global changes over time.","context":["East India Marine Society\nThe East India Marine Society (est. 1799) of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, was \"composed of persons who have actually navigated the seas beyond the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn, as masters or supercargoes of vessels belonging to Salem.\" It functioned as a charitable and educational organization, and maintained a library and museum. It flourished especially in the 1800s–1830s, a heyday of foreign trade.\nIn 1910 the society reincorporated as \"Trustees of the Salem East India Marine Society.\"\nThe society founders were invested in the establishment of a museum from the beginning: their third objective was \"to form a Museum of natural and artificial curiosities, particularly such as are found beyond the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn.\":6 Within three years, their collection had grown too large for their building, so they relocated to the Salem Bank building, constructed by Colonel Benjamin Pickman, on Essex Street.:34–35\nIn 1825 the society dedicated the newly constructed East India Marine Hall, designed by architect Thomas Waldron Sumner. It shared the building with the Asiatic Bank and Oriental Insurance Company. Museum staff included Seth Bass, Malthus A. Ward, and Henry Wheatland.\nThe museum existed under the East India Marine Society name from 1799 until 1867, when it was purchased by George Peabody for $140,000.:49 The East India Marine Hall and its collections were combined with those of the Essex Institute in the fields of natural history and ethnology, and reimagined as the Peabody Academy of Science.:202 In 1915, the Peabody Academy of Science transitioned into the Peabody Museum of Salem; after merging with the Essex Institute completely in 1992, it became the Peabody Essex Museum.\nThe East India Marine Society museum and its collections were significant in several ways. Firstly, the society's members were obligated to donate \"curiosities\" from their travels; not only did the museum help make Salem a vital location for learning about European and Asian visual and intellectual culture, it signaled America's success and prosperity in global trade.:69 It also established that American cultural institutions were of comparable quality to their European counterparts.:4 On a larger scale, the museum combined the economics of trade with enlightenment philosophy:47 and was believed to have an important role in the study of science and society.:199\nThe collection was started by donations from Captain Jonathan Carnes; items as diverse as an elephant's tooth and a pipe from Sumatra set the standard for the museum's acquisitions.:69 Because of the society's requirement for its members to donate a diverse range of objects from their travels, the collections were specifically related to their business endeavors, which explains the predominance of Pacific artifacts on display.:42 The museum received so many objects in the first two decades of its existence that it hired a curator to fill in gaps in the collection,:188 reorganize the displays, and create a catalogue. This catalogue of the museum's collections was published in 1821, listing 2,269 objects.:36\nAt the time of the first catalogue's publication, the society owned a variety of objects including shells; coins; other ethnological artifacts such as costume, musical instruments, statuary, weaponry; and manuscript journals of sea voyages between Salem and places including Batavia, Bombay, Calcutta, Canton, Ceylon, Isle de France, Manila, Mocha, Sumatra, and Tranquebar. Donors of objects included members, New England locals such as William Bentley, non-member seafarers such as John Derby, and others such as merchant Nusserwanjee Maneckjee of Bombay.\nTen years after the first catalogue, a second was released, with a total of 4,299 objects.:48 These catalogues contained objects including:\n- Ostrich eggs:71\n- A \"pregnant queen ant\":7\n- Stuffed penguins:71\n- Elephant tails:7 and tusks:71\n- \"Lava from Java\":7\n- \"A hornet's nest from Surinam\":7\n- A two-headed dogfish:7\n- Balls of hair from the stomachs of cows from Madagascar and Salem, presumably for comparative purposes:7\n- \"Fragments of granite broken from Pompey's pillar\":40\n- Ivory pagodas:71\n- A \"model of an 80-gun ship, made from soup bones, by a prisoner at Dartmoor\":7\n- Coins and other forms of foreign currencies:361\n- \"Specimens of white marble from the ruins of Carthage\":40\n- A coffee cup and saucer, formerly owned by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte:39\n- A \"very elegant hubble-bubble\":7\n- Paintings and clothing from China, Japan, and India:75\n- A medal with images of the devil and the Pope:7\n- \"Three thousand yards of human hair, braided\":47\n- Female undergarments from Lapland, made from reindeer hair:7\n- \"The elaborate terminal bead of a late medieval Flemish rosary\":40\nThe collection also included several objects that were especially valuable due to factors including rarity, origin, and historical significance. One such artifact is an idol of Kolia Moku, the medicine god, from the Sandwich Islands, donated by John T. Prince in the late 1840s. There are only two other surviving idols of this type.:50\nOne of the more notorious objects was the embalmed head of a New Zealand chief, donated by William Dana; it had to be displayed behind a veil.:185\nAn earlier object of importance to the collection is the sculpture donated by Captain Benjamin Hodges in 1790, Figure of a Chinese Man. Scholars have reported that it was one of the first sculptures to enter the American market from China.:72\nEven though the society's cultural collections largely focused on items gathered from international trade, it still displayed a small amount of objects from Native American tribes. Because there was no strong financial reason to expend concerted effort on collecting Native objects, scholars have reported that the museum's representation of Eastern tribes was small and used to compare them to ancient civilizations: items such as arrowheads that had come up during excavations in New England were displayed with classical artifacts.:54\nMethods of displayEdit\nThere are not many remaining records of the exhibition style of the museum, but a few observations have survived. For example, when the society moved into the newly-constructed East India Marine Hall, tall cases filled with artifacts lined the walls—often with nautical models displayed on top—and more cases were arranged in the center of the room.:45\nIn addition, the museum was decorated with life-size sculptures of merchants from China and India. They were placed in strategic locations throughout the exhibition hall, which allowed them to serve not only as objects within the collection themselves, but also as contextual aids for other objects.:46\nNot much is known about the specific groupings of the collection prior to the 1830s; near the end of the decade, however, records state that items were displayed based on their general function, such as weaponry or musical instruments.:195 The curator, Dr Malthus Ward, did this in an effort to assemble objects that shared similar roles in their various countries of origin.:47\nThe museum had no admission fee, but it required visitors to be introduced by a society member.:45 Prominent visitors to the society's museum included William Bentley, James Silk Buckingham, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Joseph Smith, Andrew Jackson, Anne Newport Royall, and Martin Van Buren.\nIt was one of Salem's most vital attractions, and visitors consistently reported feelings of awe and as though they were entering a separate world: Martha Nichols, the granddaughter of Salem mariner Captain George Nichols, wrote that its \"magic door opened onto so many wonders,\":196 and a guestbook from 1860 contains a visitor's opinion that \"to walk around this room was to circumnavigate the globe.\" These impressions taught the younger generations of Salem knowledge of the global marketplace that was valued highly in the early 19th century: the possibilities for trade relations were enhanced by their prolonged exposure to foreign nations.:191\nAccording to scholars, the exhibits in East India Marine Hall presented visitors with the idea that their sailors had brought them a personalized microcosm of the world.:48 The objects and their displays were meant to do more than just illustrate the rich diversity of other cultures; they were also strongly associated with their donors. This was underscored by the presence of donor portraits hung above the objects, as well as the former sailors serving the society as tour guides.:47 This emphasized the personal connections that surrounded the objects, and demonstrated the sailor's autonomy and success in an international arena.:42\nThe 1830s presented several challenges to the museum's relationship with its visitors. In 1833, the society created and enforced a rule that banned African Americans from attending the museum, despite the fact that it had not previously restricted their attendance.:197 In addition, an entrance fee was briefly charged as an attempt to \"remedy [the] evil\" of their popularity; the more than 2,000 annual visitors, coupled with the society's responsibility to care for its members' families experiencing financial hardship, had become too difficult to maintain.:195\nIn popular cultureEdit\n- Walter Muir Whitehill (1949).

The world is currently on track to surpass both of those limits. Under the most optimistic scenario, if all 140 countries that have announced net zero targets or are considering them actually reach these goals, as well as their more ambitious 2030 commitments under the Paris Agreement, warming could be limited to 1.8°C by 2100. But will overshooting 1.5°C push us over climate tipping points, triggering irreversible and abrupt changes? The IPCC’s latest report warned of that possibility, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently said, “…time is running out. Irreversible climate tipping points lie alarmingly close.”\nWhat are the tipping points? And how close are they?\nA tipping point is the point at which small changes become significant enough to cause a larger, more critical change that can be abrupt, irreversible, and lead to cascading effects. The concept of tipping points was introduced by the IPCC 20 years ago, but then it was thought they would only occur if global warming reached 5°C. Recent IPCC assessments, however, suggested that tipping points could be reached between 1°C and 2°C of warming.\nHere are the major climate tipping points.\nGreenland ice sheet\nThe Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea levels by over 20 feet and its melting is accelerating. From 1992 to 2018, it lost close to four trillion tons of ice. While its disintegration is not likely to be abrupt, there could come a point beyond which its eventual collapse is irreversible for millennia.\nA new study found that ice-sheet height and melting rates in the Jakobshavn basin, one of the fastest melting basins in Greenland, are destabilizing the ice sheet. Most of the melting occurs on the ice surface because of warming temperatures, but as the height of the ice sheet is reduced, the surface is exposed to warmer air at lower altitudes, which further speeds melting.\nIn addition, less snowfall leaves the ice surface darker so it absorbs more of the sun’s heat and warms faster. Scientists are not sure if a tipping point has been passed but the study found that there would likely be more melting in the near future. In other research, scientists speculated that the critical temperature range at which the Greenland ice sheet would go into irreversible disintegration is between 0.8°C and 3.2°C of warming above pre-industrial levels.\nThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)\nThe WAIS is vulnerable to collapse because it sits on bedrock below sea level and is affected by the ocean’s warming. A 2018 study found that the WAIS went from ice loss of almost 58.5 billion tons a year between 1992 and 1997 to 175 billion tons from 2012 to 2017. The Thwaites Glacier on West Antarctica’s Amundsen Sea has lost a trillion tons of ice since the early 2000s, and some scientists believe it could be headed for an irreversible collapse, which could threaten a large part of the WAIS and raise global sea levels by two feet or more.\nThe Pine Island glacier, also on the Amundsen Sea, is thinning rapidly as well. A new study found that current policies, heading for almost 3°C of warming, would result in an abrupt hastening of Antarctic ice loss after 2060, while other research suggests that the tipping point for the WAIS lies between 1.5°C and 2.0°C of warming.\nAnother new study found that if the WAIS melted, it could raise sea levels three feet more than previous projections of 10.5 feet; Antarctica as a whole contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by over 200 feet.\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)\nThe AMOC is one of the main global ocean currents and is critical to regulating climate. Cold salty water, which is dense and heavy, sinks deep into the ocean in the North Atlantic, and moves along the bottom until it rises to the surface near the equator, usually in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Heat from the sun then warms the water, and evaporation leaves the water saltier. The warm salty water travels up the coast via the Gulf Stream, warming the U.S. East Coast and Western Europe. Once the water releases its heat and reaches the North Atlantic, it becomes cold and dense again, and the cycle, which can take water 1,000 years to complete, continues. But as glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add fresh, less dense water to the North Atlantic, which prevents the water from sinking and impedes circulation. This may be why AMOC has slowed 15 percent since the 1950s. A recent study found that the AMOC is in its weakest state in 1,000 years. Moreover, the latest climate models project that continued global warming could weaken the AMOC by 34 to 45 percent by 2100.\nIf the AMOC shuts down, it would cause significant cooling along the east coast of the U.S. and Western Europe. This, in turn, would alter rainfall patterns, make sea levels rise, cause more drying, and reduce agriculture in the U.K. It could also potentially set off other tipping points. And even if global warming is reversed, once shut down, the AMOC would not switch back on for a long time. Scientists believe this occurred during the last ice age when a glacial lake burst and poured freshwater into the Atlantic. As the AMOC shut down, the Northern Hemisphere entered a cold spell that lasted 1,000 years.\nWhile there are still many uncertainties, some studies suggest that the AMOC’s tipping point could be reached between 3°C and 5.5°C of warming.\nThe Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest tropical rainforest, stores 200 billion tons of carbon—equal to about five years of global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels—and is home to millions of species of plants and wildlife. The moisture from the Amazon’s rainfall returns to the atmosphere from the soil through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. This self-sustaining process creates clouds and more rainfall.\nBecause of logging, ranching, mining, agriculture, and fires, the Amazon has lost about 17 percent of its tree cover and at the current rate of deforestation, could reach a loss of 27 percent by 2030. The policies of Brazil’s pro-development president, Jair Bolsonaro, have led to widespread clear-cutting and the rate of deforestation in Brazil is the highest since 2008.\nIf 20–25 percent of the Amazon were deforested, its tipping point could be crossed, according to one study. Fewer trees would mean less evapotranspiration, and without enough rainfall to sustain itself, the Amazon could start to die back. In other words, parts of the rainforest could transition into a savannah, a drier ecosystem characterized by grasslands and few trees. In the process, it would potentially release 90 gigatons of CO2, exacerbating climate change. Crossing this tipping point would also result in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, affect global weather patterns, and threaten the lives of 30 million people, many Indigenous, who depend on the rainforest to survive. One study found that dieback would occur if we reach 3°C of warming.\nThe Amazon is already feeling the effects of climate change, as over the last century, temperatures in the region have increased 1°C to 1.5°C. The Amazon is experiencing longer and hotter dry seasons that make it more vulnerable to wildfires, reduced evapotranspiration in response to higher levels of CO2, and there are now more drought-tolerant tree species.\nScientists are unsure whether the Amazon has a single overall tipping point, or when exactly it might be reached, and the ecosystem has some ability to adapt to changing conditions. But fires and drought could cause local changes that spread drying conditions to other regions because of an overall reduction of moisture. Twenty-eight percent of the eastern part of the Amazon is already losing more carbon than it is absorbing due to deforestation. And some climate models predict that by 2035, the Amazon will be a permanent source of carbon.\nPermafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more consecutive years and is composed of rock, soil, sediments, and ice. Some permafrost has been frozen for tens or hundreds of thousands of years. It is found in northern hemisphere lands without glaciers, including parts of Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada and Tibet. In the Southern Hemisphere, there is permafrost in parts of Patagonia, Antarctica and the Southern Alps of New Zealand.\nFourteen hundred billion tons of carbon are thought to be frozen in the Arctic’s permafrost, which is twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere. But the Arctic is warming two times faster than the rest of the planet—it has already warmed 2°C above pre-industrial levels. As it warms and thaws the permafrost, microbes come out of hibernation and break down the organic carbon in the soil, releasing CO2 and methane, which then trigger even more warming and melting. The 2019 Arctic Report Card from NOAA found that the Arctic’s thawing permafrost could be releasing 300 to 600 million tons of carbon per year into the atmosphere.\nMethane stored in ice-like formations called hydrates are also found in permafrost in ocean sediments. This methane may be released as hydrates are thawed by warming seawater. Scientists recently discovered methane leaking from a giant ancient reservoir of methane below the permafrost of the Laptev Sea in the East Siberian Arctic Ocean.\nScientists don’t know exactly how much carbon could ultimately be released by thawing permafrost or when. According to one report, 2°C of warming could mean the loss of 40 percent of the world’s permafrost.\nEl Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool, naturally occurring weather patterns across the tropical Pacific—the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. Every two to seven years, the pattern alternates, bringing disruptions in temperature and precipitation. El Niño causes impacts around the world, such as more drought in India, Indonesia and Brazil, and flooding in Peru. As the ocean warms, it could push ENSO past a tipping point, which would make El Niño events more severe and frequent and could increase drought in the Amazon.\nTipping point interactions\nA recent study of the WAIS, the Greenland ice sheet, the AMOC, ENSO, and the Amazon rainforest tipping points found that they could interact with one another before temperatures reach 2°C. This interaction would enable tipping to occur at lower thresholds than previously expected. The risk analysis found that a cascade could potentially begin with the melting of the ice sheets because their critical thresholds are lower. For example, as the Greenland ice sheet releases fresh water into the North Atlantic, the AMOC could slow. This would result in less heat being transported towards the north. As the North got colder, it could potentially help stabilize the Greenland ice sheet. However, it would also result in warmer water in the Southern Ocean and this could lead to more drought in some parts of the Amazon while others get more rainfall. Changes in the AMOC could also trigger changes in ENSO, leading to a more permanent El Niño state, whose impacts could lower the critical threshold for Amazon dieback.\nThe scientists say that these changes would occur over long time scales, and that the limits of computing power make it impossible to represent each climate system’s tipping point or their interactions exactly.\nCan we avoid the climate tipping points?\nSeventy-three percent of people in G20 countries think Earth is close to climate tipping points, according to a Global Commons Alliance poll. And much research indicates that if we do not curb our carbon emissions immediately to keep global warming below 2°C, we are headed for irreversible and catastrophic conditions. But some experts are more sanguine.\nRobin Bell, a polar scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who specializes in ice sheet dynamics, doesn’t believe the ice sheets are at a tipping point yet.\n“The most recent science is suggesting that maybe some of the runaway mechanisms we were worried about, might not occur,” she said. “For example, in terms of the WAIS, pressure on the giant river of ice could keep it from flowing. It means either we just need to keep icebergs in the way, or maybe it’s something we can think about engineering. It’s not that we have to hold the whole thing back, we just have to put a little pressure on it, and it will possibly not collapse—the ice sheet may not be as bad as we thought and maybe we have some time to get our act together.”\nBell worries more about the social tipping points than the physical ones. Will they occur fast enough to forestall climate tipping points? Social tipping points are the points where many members of society quickly and dramatically change their behavior or thinking. A 2020 study proposed six social tipping points that could help stabilize Earth’s climate: removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation, building carbon-neutral cities, divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels, clarifying the moral implications of fossil fuels, expanding climate education and engagement, and making greenhouse gas emissions transparent.\n“The real question is: Is there the social will to act?” Bell said. “And it appears that the social will is emerging. We really are starting to have serious conversations. People from the individual scale to the government scale are taking action, and that’s what needs to happen.”\nSteve Cohen, senior vice dean of Columbia University’s School of Professional Studies and a professor in the Practice of Public Affairs at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, places his hope in technology. “The most important driver of change in the modern world has been technology,” he said. “And it’s a pretty simple equation: technological change leads to economic change, leads to social and cultural change, which leads to political change.”\nTechnological change can be difficult to predict but can sometimes lead to rapid changes, said Cohen, citing the ubiquitous and indispensable smart phone as a prime example. “The phone is the most important thing you take when you leave the house because it’s a portable computer that you bring around with you. Would anybody have predicted that 25 years ago?”\nHe also puts great hope in young people. “If you look at polling data, young people by a huge margin understand the climate issue. And it cuts across ideology, cuts across everything. It you’re under 30, you know, there’s a climate crisis.”\nThe pledges countries make in Glasgow at COP26 and the policies they implement afterwards will ultimately determine how close the world will come to climate tipping points.\nGreta Thunberg, the 18-year-old Swedish climate activist with millions of young followers, went to Glasgow to join a climate strike and put pressure on politicians to get them to make real commitments to curb climate change.\n“We know that change is possible because we can look back in history and see that there have been massive changes in society that have been unprecedented,” Thunberg said. “If we felt like there wasn’t any hope, we wouldn’t be activists.”\nEarth Institute at Columbia University\nThis story is republished courtesy of Earth Institute, Columbia University http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu.\nHow close are we to climate tipping points?

{"question":"For my thesis comparing superconductors: which material use electron pairing in specific orbital, Fe selenide or Sr2RuO4?","answer":"Iron selenide (FeSe) shows clear orbital-selective electron pairing, with electrons in the dyz orbital forming Cooper pairs for superconductivity while electrons in the dxz orbital remain in a metallic state. In contrast, Sr2RuO4's superconductivity involves multiple bands derived from different Ru t2g 4d orbitals (α, β, and γ bands), with some evidence suggesting superconductivity occurs primarily in either the γ band or the α and β bands, though there is still debate about which bands are dominant in the superconducting state.","context":["Advancing Basic Science for Humanity\n07/13/2017 - Electron Orbitals May Hold Key to Unifying Concept of High-Temperature Superconductivity\nOriginally published by Brookhaven National Laboratory)\nJuly 6, 2017\nIron-based superconductivity occurs in materials such as iron selenide (FeSe) that contain crystal planes made up of a square array of iron (Fe) atoms, depicted here. In these iron layers, each Fe atom has two active electron \"clouds,\" or orbitals—dxz (red) and dyz (blue)—each containing one electron. By directly visualizing the electron states in the iron planes of FeSe, the researchers revealed that that electrons in the dxz orbitals (red) do not form Cooper pairs or contribute to the superconductivity, but instead form an incoherent metallic state along the horizontal (x) axis. In contrast, all electrons in the dyz orbitals (blue) form strong Cooper pairs with neighboring atoms to generate superconductivity. Searching for other materials with this exotic \"orbital-selective\" pairing may lead to the discovery of new superconductors.\nA team of scientists has found evidence for a new type of electron pairing that may broaden the search for new high-temperature superconductors. The findings, described in the journal Science, provide the basis for a unifying description of how radically different “parent” materials—insulating copper-based compounds and metallic iron-based compounds—can develop the ability to carry electrical current with no resistance at strikingly high temperatures.\nAccording to the scientists, the materials’ dissimilar electronic characteristics actually hold the key to commonality.\n“Scientists have thought that because the starting point for superconductivity in these two classes of materials is so different, you need different theoretical approaches to describe them,” said J.C. Séamus Davis, a physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory and Cornell University, who led the team of experimental scientists. “Instead, we’ve been motivated to explore what is universal about these two systems. Ideally, there should be just one explanation.”\nDavis is a member of the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science.\nScientists have generally understood that the mechanism of superconductivity in copper oxide compounds depends on the ability of electrons on adjacent copper atoms to pair up. Each copper atom has a single, unpaired electron in its outermost energy shell, or orbital. While the outermost electrons on adjacent copper atoms interact with one another strongly, they ordinarily stay locked in place, stuck in a “quantum mechanical traffic jam” with nowhere to go, Davis said. With no electrons moving, the material acts as a “strongly correlated” electrical insulator.\nSéamus Davis, a physicist at Cornell University and the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory\nRemoving some of the electrons that reside on copper atoms results in electron vacancies known as holes. This alleviates the quantum traffic jam so that, when the material is cooled to a certain temperature, oppositely aligned electrons (magnetic partners where the “spin” of one electron points up and the adjacent one points down) form pairs and then become free to zip through the material unimpeded—a superconductor.\nIron atoms, which have a nucleus with smaller positive charge than copper, exert less pull on the circulating electrons. So instead of filling up electron orbitals, electrons in several outer energy orbitals remain unpaired, yet aligned with one another and electronically active. The alignment of unpaired electrons in multiple orbitals gives simple iron its strong magnetic and metal properties, so it’s easy to see why iron compounds would be good conductors. But it’s not really clear how they could become zero-resistance superconductors at high temperatures without the strong interactions that create a correlated insulating state in the copper based materials.\nTo address this conundrum, theoretical physicists began to consider the possibility that the unpaired electrons in iron’s different orbitals could take on very different roles. Perhaps unpaired electrons in one particular orbital could pair up with electrons in the same orbital on an adjacent atom to carry the supercurrent, while electrons in the other orbitals provide the insulating, magnetic, and metallic properties.\nThe custom-built Spectroscopic Imaging Scanning Tunneling Microscope used for these experiments stands one meter high, with cryogenic circuitry at the top for cooling samples to temperatures just above absolute zero (nearly -273 degrees Celsius). Inside, a needle with single atom on the end scans across the crystal surface in steps as small as 2 trillionths of a meter, measuring the electron tunneling current at each location. These measurements reveal the quantum wavefunctions of electrons in the material with exquisite precision.\n“The challenge is to find a way to see that some of the electrons are superconducting and some are insulating in the same crystal,” Davis said.\nThe research published in Science provides the first direct proof that such “orbital-selective” electron pairing takes place.\nThe theory team for this project—Andreas Kreisel (University of Leipzig), Peter Hirschfeld (University of Florida), and Brian Anderson (University of Copenhagen)—defined the electronic signatures that should be associated with each orbital on the iron atoms. Then, experimentalists Peter Sprau and Andrey Kostin (both of Brookhaven Lab and Cornell) used a scanning tunneling microscope at the Center for Emergent Superconductivity—a DOE Energy Frontier Research Center at Brookhaven Lab—to measure the energy and momentum of electrons in iron-selenide samples that were synthesized by Anna Bohmer and Paul Canfield at DOE’s Ames Laboratory. Comparing the measurements with the predicted electronic signatures allowed the scientists to identify which electrons were associated with each orbital.\nWith this information, “We can measure the binding energy and momentum of electrons in the ‘Cooper pairs’ responsible for superconductivity and identify which energy momentum characteristics they have—which orbital they’re from,” Davis said.\n“We were able to show that almost all of the electrons in Cooper pairs in iron selenide were from a particular lower energy orbital (the dyz orbital),” Davis said. The findings also imply that the electron in iron’s outermost orbital in iron selenide exhibits virtually insulating properties, just as it does in the copper oxide compounds.\n“Because iron selenide normally exhibits good metallic conductivity, how would one ever know that the electrons in this orbital are acting as they are in correlated insulators? This strongly interacting and virtually insulating state was hiding in plain sight!” he said.\nWith this outer-orbital insulating state, the iron compound has all the same requirements for superconductivity that the copper oxides do—a strong magnetic interaction (up/down pairing) of the almost localized electrons, and a metallic state that allows those pairs to move. The big difference is that in iron selenide, these contributions come from different electrons in three separate active orbitals, instead of the single electron in one active orbital in copper.\n“In iron you have the conductivity for free. And you have the magnetism for free, but it’s based on a different electron. Both coexist in the same atom,” Davis said. So once you have Cooper pairs, it seems there’s no need to add holes to get the current flowing.\nThis realization may broaden the search for new superconductors that can potentially operate under warmer conditions. Such higher high-temperature superconductors would be more practical for real world, energy-saving applications such as power lines or energy storage devices.\n“Instead of searching for new single-electron antiferromagnetic insulators like copper oxide to make high-temperature superconductors, maybe we should be searching for new highly magnetic, metallic materials that have properties like iron but in an orbitally selective arrangement,” Davis said. “This opens the world of materials science to many new types of materials that could be high-temperature superconductors.”\nThis research was funded by the DOE Office of Science, the Moore Foundation’s EPiQS Initiative, and a Lundbeckfond Fellowship.","The unit cell of the layered perovskite structure of strontium ruthenate. Ruthenium ions are red, strontium ions are blue, and oxygen ions are green.\n|Except where noted otherwise, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C (77 °F), 100 kPa)|\nStrontium ruthenate (SRO) is an oxide of strontium and ruthenium with the chemical formula Sr2RuO4. It was the first reported perovskite superconductor that did not contain copper. Strontium ruthenate is structurally very similar to the high-temperature cuprate superconductors, and in particular, is almost identical to the lanthanum doped superconductor (La, Sr)2CuO4. However, the transition temperature for the superconducting phase transition is 0.93 K, which is much lower than the corresponding value for cuprates.\nHigh-quality crystals of strontium ruthenate are synthesized using a floating zone method in a controlled atmosphere with ruthenium as flux. The perovskite structure can be deduced based on powder x-ray diffraction measurements. Strontium ruthenate behaves as a conventional Fermi liquid at temperatures below 25 K.\nSuperconductivity in SRO was first observed by Yoshiteru Maenu and his group in 1994 when they were looking for high temperature superconductors with structures similar to the cuprates. Unlike the cuprates, SRO displays superconductivity even in the absence of doping. The superconducting order parameter in SRO has been shown to exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking, and hence, it can be classified as an unconventional superconductor.\nSr2RuO4 is believed to be a fairly two-dimensional system, with superconductivity occurring primarily on the Ru-O plane. The electronic structure of Sr2RuO4 is characterized by three bands derived from the Ru t2g 4d orbitals, namely, α, β and γ bands, of which the first is hole-like while the other two are electron-like. Among them, the γ band arises mainly from the dxy orbital, while the α and β bands emerge from the hybridization of dxz and yz orbitals. Due to the two-dimensionality of Sr2RuO4, its Fermi surface consists of three nearly two-dimensional sheets with little dispersion along the crystalline c-axis.\nEarly proposals have suggested that superconductivity is dominant in the γ band. In particular, the order parameter in the momentum space exhibits k-dependence phase winding which is characteristic of time-reversal symmetry breaking. This peculiar single-band superconducting order is expected to give rise to appreciable spontaneous supercurrent at the edge of the sample. Such an effect is closely associated with the topology of the Hamiltonian describing Sr2RuO4 in the superconducting state, which is characterized by a nonzero Chern number. However, scanning probes have so far failed to detect expected time-reversal symmetry breaking fields generated by the supercurrent, off by orders of magnitude. This has led some to speculate that superconductivity arises dominantly from the α and β bands instead. Such a two-band superconductor, although having k-dependence phase winding in its order parameters on the two relevant bands, is topologically trivial with the two bands featuring opposite Chern numbers. Therefore it could possibly give a much reduced if not completely cancelled supercurrent at the edge.\n- Maeno, Yoshiteru; H.

{"question":"How did Iran and Ethiopia's historical experiences with foreign powers in the 20th century differ, particularly regarding their ability to maintain independence?","answer":"Iran and Ethiopia had contrasting experiences with foreign powers in the 20th century. Ethiopia is generally considered to have never been fully colonized, though it experienced a brief period of Italian occupation from 1935-1941, when Italian settlers arrived and Emperor Haile Selassie was forced into exile in the UK. However, Selassie regained his throne on May 5, 1941, when he re-entered Addis Ababa with his troops. In contrast, Iran faced multiple instances of foreign intervention that significantly impacted its sovereignty. In the 1941, Iran was invaded by Britain and Russia when Reza Shah tried to maintain relations with Germany during World War II, resulting in his exile to Mauritius. Later, in the early 1950s, when nationalist prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq attempted to nationalize Iranian oil, he was overthrown in a CIA and MI6 coup in August 1953.","context":["A few years ago, during a visit to Tehran to give some lectures at the foreign ministry research and training institute, I was taken to lunch by a senior Iranian diplomat at a once fashionable Italian restaurant in the northern middle-class suburb of Tajrish. Educated as a scientist in the United States before the 1979 revolution, he had been an important figure in the post-revolutionary regime, and later a senior diplomat. I had met him at various conferences on European-Iranian relations and we had struck up something of a rapport. On this occasion, after the usual semi-official tour d'horizon, we began talking about the early history of the Iranian revolution and of its foreign policy.\n\"We made three big mistakes\", he said: first, in holding the American diplomats hostages for a year and a half and thereby deeply antagonising the US; second, by not accepting the very favourable peace which Saddam Hussein had offered in the summer of 1982, when Iran had the upper hand in the war, then already two years old; and third - to me the most surprising of his points - in not supporting the communist regime that came to power in Afghanistan in 1978, and instead backing the pro-American guerrillas that (with eventual success) opposed them.\nThe reflections of this diplomat are of considerable relevance to the situation in which Iran finds itself today. For sure, the pressure being put on Iran by the US is arrogant and in many ways illegal. For Washington to protest about Iranian \"interference\" in Iraq when it is the US which invaded the country in 2003, and when it is Iranian allies (if not clients) who staff much of the government and armed forces of Iraq, is also ridiculous. So too is the attempt to blame Iran for the spread of Sunni terrorism, including al-Qaida activities, in the region. No country has a greater interest in the stability of Iraq than Iran, a point Washington has stupidly failed to note these four years past.\nFred Halliday is professor of international relations at the LSE, and visiting professor at the Barcelona Institute of International Studies (IBEI). His books include Islam and the Myth of Confrontation (IB Tauris, 2003) and 100 Myths About the Middle East (Saqi, 2005)\nFred Halliday's \"global politics\" column on openDemocracy surveys the national histories, geopolitical currents, and dominant ideas across the world. The articles include:\n\"America and Arabia after Saddam\"\n\"Iran's revolutionary spasm\" (July 2005)\n\"Political killing in the cold war\" (August 2005)\n\"A transnational umma: myth or reality?\" (October 2005)\n\"Iran vs the United States – again\" (February 2006)\n\"A Lebanese fragment: two days with Hizbollah\" (July 2006)\n\"A 2007 warning: the twelve worst ideas in the world\"\n(8 January 2007)\n\"Sunni, Shi'a and the \"Trotskyists of Islam\"\n(9 February 2007)\nYet there is another side to the US-Iranian polarisation that could prove dangerous not only to Washington but also the Islamic Republic and which arises from the miscalculations of the Iranian leadership itself. Iran's President Ahmadinejad has made himself popular in much of the Arab world, and among Muslims more broadly, for his outspoken denunciations of the US. He has also heartened many by his calls for the destruction of Israel (something he did indeed call for, despite claims by some inside and outside Iran that he was mistranslated: the words mahv bayad bashad [must be wiped out] leave no room for doubt).\nYet Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also thrown caution, and a due evaluation of the enmity and strength of his enemies, to the wind. (Ayatollah Khomeini once rebuked Ali Akbar Velayati for following him in a violent denunciation of Saudi Arabia, reminding the longstanding the foreign minister that it was his job to maintain relations with other states.) At the same time the president has indulged in a set of ill-conceived economic policies at home, squandering oil revenue to boost consumption, launching retrograde educational and cultural campaigns against secularism, while failing to meet the campaign promises to the poor that, in 2005, secured his surprise election. The failure of his candidates to prevail in the December 2006 elections to the Expediency Council, an important constitutional watchdog, and a growth of criticism even from conservatives and other clerics, augurs ill for his future.\nNo one can tell where the current confrontation between Tehran and Washington will lead to. Perhaps, as a result of impatience, miscalculation or innate risk-taking, Iran and the US will be at war in the near future. Or it may prove to be the case that both are playing for time: the Iranians want to spin out negotiations with the west over the nuclear issue until the US position in Iraq is even weaker, the US may want to stay its hand in the hope that domestic economic and social problems will further weaken the regime and allow them to precipitate political upheaval. Everything is possible.\nThe roots of turbulence\nIn this context it is worth looking more closely at the way in which Iran formulates its foreign policy, and the roots of its high-risk policy. Much is made of the fact that Iran is an ancient imperial power, one of the four countries in the world - along with China, Egypt and Yemen - which can claim continuity as a state over 3,000 years.\nIt may also be some satisfaction to Iranian leaders that with their influence in Lebanon and Palestine, Iran now has a military emplacement on the shores of the Mediterranean for the first time since the Achaemenid empire (c 550-350 BCE). Moreover, Iran's aspiration to nuclear capability, in whatever form, is as much due to the aspiration to be a major power as to military factors, just as is the retention of what are in practice useless and expensive weapons by Britain and France.\nCertainly, Iranian official, and popular, attitudes towards nearly all their neighbours (with the interesting exception of the Armenians) are replete with prejudice and a sense of superiority. \"You colonialists left your goat's droppings around the region, but sooner or later we will sweep them away\", one interlocutor in Tehran said to me. When I asked what these \"goat's droppings\" were, he replied: \"Pakistan, Iraq and Israel\".\nIt is in part this self-perception which explains one of the most constant features of Iranian foreign policy over the past century, and one to which my diplomat companion was drawing attention during our lunch in Tehran: namely, the recurrent tendency of Iranian leaders to overplay their hand. Even a brief list is striking:\n- in the second world war, Reza Shah, the first of the two Pahlavi monarchs, thought he could balance British and Russian pressure by maintaining relations with Germany, but in the end, and as soon as Russia entered the war in 1941, Iran was invaded and Reza Shah sent off to exile in Mauritius\n- in the early 1950s, the nationalist prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq thought he could nationalise Iranian oil (hitherto a monopoly of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, today's BP) on his own terms and avoid a compromise with western governments: in the end, he was overthrown in the CIA and MI6 coup of August 1953\n- during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, Ayatollah Khomeini failed to grasp the Iraqi near-surrender of 1982, a consequence of his belief that Iranian forces could topple the Iraqi regime and impose a Shi'a substitute; the result was six more years of war, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iranians, the entry of the US navy into the war on the side of the Iraqis, and (in August 1988) a far less favourable peace.\nMuch is made too of the fact that Iran is the most important Shi'a state and that the last great Persian dynasty, the Safavid (1502-1736) made Shi'ism a powerful political and military, as well as cultural, force in the region, a rival for centuries to the Sunni Ottoman empire to the west. This Shi'a identity, one that the mullahs have in any case overblown, has also proved to be a mixed blessing for the Islamic republic; for many outside Iran - and even for Shi'a in countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - Iran's projection of its Shi'ism has put them in a difficult situation, not least for the implied claim of the superior authority of clergy, and politicians, based inside Iran. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the leading Shi'a cleric in Iraq, and himself an Iranian, has long sought to limit such influence, as has, in a much rougher way, the rising Shi'a leader, Muqtada al-Sadr.\nIran's imperial and nationalist past and its Shi'a identity, are not, however, enough to explain the noisy and risky policy Iran is pursuing today. Here two other factors need to be brought into account. The first is that Iran is an oil-producing country, a fact that, especially at a time of high oil prices, gives to the state some leeway simultaneously to mollify the people and pursue expensive military programmes.\nThe problem is that these expenditures do little to alleviate the long-term problems of the economy and are usually, is the Iranian case, and also that of Venezuela, accompanied by much waste, corruption and factionalism. In this regard, Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chávez are two of a kind: intoxicated with their own rhetoric, insouciant about the longer term economic development of their oil industries and economy as a whole, and wilfully provocative, towards the United States and immediate neighbours alike, in foreign policy.\nThe second and indeed the most important (and neglected) factor explaining contemporary Iran, however, is a fact evident in its historical origin, policy and rhetoric: that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a country that has emerged from a revolution and that this revolution has far from lost its dynamic, at home or abroad.\nIt is not in the imperial dreams of ancient Persia, or the global vision of Shi'a clergy, but in the repetition by Iran of the same policies, aspirations and mistakes of previous revolutionary regimes, from France in the 1790s, to Cuba in the 1960s and 1970s that the underlying logic of its actions can be seen.\nAmong openDemocracy's recent articles on Iranian politics in a period of crisis:\n\"Nazenin Ansari, \"An ayatollah under siege … in Tehran\"\n(4 October 2006)\n\"Nasrin Alavi, \"Iran: cracks in the façade\" (11 December 2006)\n\"Nasrin Alavi, \"Iran's election backlash\"\n(19 December 2006)\n\"Dariush Zahedi & Omid Memarian, \"Ahmadinejad, Iran and America\"\n(15 January 2007)\n\"Ali Afshari & H Graham Underwood, \"Iran's post-election balance\" (22 January 2007)\n\"Sanam Vakil, \"Iran's nuclear gamble\"\n(1 February 2007)\n\"Nasrin Alavi, \"Iran's attack blowback\"\n(5 February 2007)\nThe trap of revolution\nThe Iranian revolution of 1978-79 was, as much as those of France, Russia, China or Cuba, one of the major social and political upheavals of modern history. Like its predecessors, it set out not only to transform its own internal system - for sure at a high cost in repression, wastage and illusion - but to export revolution. And this Iran did: to Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon in the 1980s and now to Palestine and, in much more favourable circumstances thanks to the US, to Iraq again. It can indeed be argued that it is the confrontation between internationalist revolutionary Iran on one side, and the US and its regional allies on the other, that has been the major axis of conflict in the middle east this past quarter of a century. By comparison, America's war with Sunni, al-Qaida-type, militancy is a secondary affair.\nHere, however, Iran has fallen into the traps and illusions of other revolutionaries. Like the French revolutionaries, the Iranians proclaim themselves to be at once the friend of all the oppressed and \"a great nation\" (a phrase Khomeini used that echoed, whether wittingly or not, the Jacobins of 1793). Like the early Bolsheviks, the Islamic revolutionaries began their revolution thinking diplomacy was an oppression and should be swept aside - hence the detention of the US diplomats as hostages. Like the Cubans and Chinese, they have combined unofficial supplies of arms, training and finance to their revolutionary allies with the, calculated, intervention of their armed forces.\nAll of this has its cost. The gradual moderation of Iran under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) reflected a sense of exhaustion after the eight-year war with Iraq and a desire for more normal external relations with the outside world, like the period of the Girondins in the France of 1792-93, or the policies of Liu Shao-chi in China of the early 1960s: but as in those other cases, and as in the USSR of Stalin in the 1930s, there were those who wanted to go in a very different direction, and proceeded to tighten the screws of repression, and raise confrontational rhetoric once again. A comparison could indeed be made with the Russia of the early 1930s or the China of the 1960s, and say that Iran under Ahmadinejad is now going through its \"third period\" or a mild replica of the \"cultural revolution\".\nHow long this can continue is anyone's guess; but it is likely to be years, perhaps many, before the Islamic revolution has run its course. Even Cuba, weak and exposed by comparison, has sustained its defiance and its model for well over four decades now. Yet even without war with the US, the risks and the costs (as many people in Iran realise only too well) are high.\nHere, and again in a spirit of comparison, it is worth recalling the words of one of the wisest observers of modern revolutions, the now sadly deceased Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski. His book The Soccer War contains a passage observing the Algeria of the mid-1960s under Ahmad Ben Bella that apply to all revolutions, uncannily so in the case of Iran today:\n\"Algeria became the pivotal Third World state, but the cost of its status - above all the financial cost - was staggering. It ate up millions of dollars for which the country had a crying need ... Gradually, the gap between Ben Bella's domestic and foreign policies grew wider. The contrast deepened. Algeria had earned an international reputation as a revolution state ... it was an example for the non-European continents, a model, bright and entrancing; while at home, the country was stagnating; the unemployed filled the square of every city; there was no investment; illiteracy ruled, bureaucracy, reaction, fanaticism ran riot; intrigues absorbed the attention of the government ... The country cannot carry the burden of these polices. It cannot afford to and it has no interest in them.\"\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad and his advisers, and those of Hugo Chávez too, would do well to read and ponder these words.","Many Africa countries that had been colonised by European countries got independence in the fifties and sixties.\nWho were the founding presidents by country?\nBy 1963 the emerging Africa leaders were inspired enough by the new gained freedom to start talking Pan-Africanism. The states of Africa sought through a political collective a means of preserving and consolidating their independence and pursuing the ideals of African unity. Unfortunately, two rival camps emerged with opposing views about how these goals could best be achieved. The Casablanca Group, led by President Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972) of Ghana, backed radical calls for political integration and the creation of a supranational body. The moderate Monrovia Group, led by Emperor Haile Selassie (1892–1975) of Ethiopia, advocated a loose association of sovereign states that allowed for political cooperation at the intergovernmental level. The latter view prevailed. The OAU was therefore based on the “sovereign equality of all Member States,” as stated in its charter.\n|Country||Independence Date||Prior ruling country|\n|Liberia, Republic of||July 26, 1847||–|\n|South Africa, Republic of||May 31, 1910||Britain|\n|Egypt, Arab Republic of||Feb. 28, 1922||Britain|\n|Ethiopia, People’s Democratic Republic of||May 5, 1941||Italy|\n|Libya (Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)||Dec. 24, 1951||Britain|\n|Sudan, Democratic Republic of||Jan. 1, 1956||Britain/Egypt|\n|Morocco, Kingdom of||March 2, 1956||France|\n|Tunisia, Republic of||March 20, 1956||France|\n|Morocco (Spanish Northern Zone, Marruecos)||April 7, 1956||Spain|\n|Morocco (International Zone, Tangiers)||Oct. 29, 1956||–|\n|Ghana, Republic of||March 6, 1957||Britain|\n|Morocco (Spanish Southern Zone, Marruecos)||April 27, 1958||Spain|\n|Guinea, Republic of||Oct. 2, 1958||France|\n|Cameroon, Republic of||Jan. 1 1960||France|\n|Senegal, Republic of||April 4, 1960||France|\n|Togo, Republic of||April 27, 1960||France|\n|Mali, Republic of||Sept. 22, 1960||France|\n|Madagascar, Democratic Republic of||June 26, 1960||France|\n|Congo (Kinshasa), Democratic Republic of the||June 30, 1960||Belgium|\n|Somalia, Democratic Republic of||July 1, 1960||Britain|\n|Benin, Republic of||Aug. 1, 1960||France|\n|Niger, Republic of||Aug. 3, 1960||France|\n|Burkina Faso, Popular Democratic Republic of||Aug. 5, 1960||France|\n|Côte d’Ivoire, Republic of (Ivory Coast)||Aug. 7, 1960||France|\n|Chad, Republic of||Aug. 11, 1960||France|\n|Central African Republic||Aug. 13, 1960||France|\n|Congo (Brazzaville), Republic of the||Aug. 15, 1960||France|\n|Gabon, Republic of||Aug. 16, 1960||France|\n|Nigeria, Federal Republic of||Oct. 1, 1960||Britain|\n|Mauritania, Islamic Republic of||Nov. 28, 1960||France|\n|Sierra Leone, Republic of||Apr. 27, 1961||Britain|\n|Nigeria (British Cameroon North)||June 1, 1961||Britain|\n|Cameroon(British Cameroon South)||Oct. 1, 1961||Britain|\n|Tanzania, United Republic of||Dec. 9, 1961||Britain|\n|Burundi, Republic of||July 1, 1962||Belgium|\n|Rwanda, Republic of||July 1, 1962||Belgium|\n|Algeria, Democratic and Popular Republic of||July 3, 1962||France|\n|Uganda, Republic of||Oct. 9, 1962||Britain|\n|Kenya, Republic of||Dec. 12, 1963||Britain|\n|Malawi, Republic of||July 6, 1964||Britain|\n|Zambia, Republic of||Oct. 24, 1964||Britain|\n|Gambia, Republic of The||Feb. 18, 1965||Britain|\n|Botswana, Republic of||Sept. 30, 1966||Britain|\n|Lesotho, Kingdom of||Oct. 4, 1966||Britain|\n|Mauritius, State of||March 12, 1968||Britain|\n|Swaziland, Kingdom of||Sept. 6, 1968||Britain|\n|Equatorial Guinea, Republic of||Oct. 12, 1968||Spain|\n|Morocco (Ifni)||June 30, 1969||Spain|\n|Guinea-Bissau, Republic of||Sept. 24, 1973 (alt.

This continued until around 1905, by which time all the lands and resources of the continent of Africa had been completely divided and colonized by European countries. The only country that couldn’t be colonized due to strong resistance by the indegines was Ethiopia, and Liberia which was a place for freed slaves from the Americas.In the 17th century\nThe struggle for independence started after world war II. This led to the independence of the Union of South Africa in 1931 through negatiations with the British empire and Libya in 1951 from Italy; followed by others in the late 1950s. The road to African independence was very hard and tortuous often through bloody fights, revolts and assasinations. For example; Britain unilatearlly granted “The Kingdom of Egypt” independence on Feb. 22nd 1922 after a series of revolts, but continued to interfere in government. More violent revolts led to the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty in 1936 and a coupe detat tagged Egyptian Revolution in 1952 finally culminated in the Egyptian Republic declaration of June 18th; 1953. The peak year for independence came in 1960 when about 17 countries gained independence. These independence days are now celebrated as national day holidays in most countries of Africa.\n|COUNTRY||INDEPENDENCE DAY||COLONIAL NAME||COLONIAL RULERS|\n|Algeria||July 5th, 1962||France|\n|Angola||November 11th; 1975||Portugal|\n|Benin||August 1st; 1960||French|\n|Botswana||September 30th, 1966||Britain|\n|Burkina Faso||August 5; 1960||France|\n|Burundi||July 1st; 1962||Belgium|\n|Cameroon||January 1st; 1960||French-administered UN trusteeship|\n|Cape Verde||July 5th; 1975||Portugal|\n|C.A.R||August 13th; 1960||France|\n|Chad||August 11th, 1960||France|\n|Comoros||July 6th; 1975||France|\n|Congo||August 15th; 1960||France|\n|Congo DR||June 30th; 1960||Belgium|\n|Cote d’Ivoire||August 7th; 1960||France|\n|Djibouti||June 27th; 1977||France|\n|Egypt||February 28th, 1922||Britain|\n|Eq Guinea||October 12; 1968||Spain|\n|Eritrea||May 24th; 1993||Ethiopia|\n|Ethiopia||over 2000 years,\nKingdom of Aksum\n|Gabon||August 17th; 1960||France|\n|Gambia||February 18th; 1965||Britain|\n|Ghana||6 March 1957||Gold Coast||Britain|\n|Guinea||October 2nd; 1958||France|\n|Guinea Bissau||10 September 1974\n24 September 1973\n|Kenya||December 12th, 1963||Britain|\n|Lesotho||October 4th; 1966||Britain|\n|Liberia||July 26th; 1847||American colonization Society|\n|Libya||December 24; 1951||Italy|\n|Madagascar||June 26th; 1960||France|\n|Malawi||July 6th; 1964||Britain|\n|Mali||September 22nd; 1960||France|\n|Mauritania||November 28th; 1960||France|\n|Mauritius||March 12th, 1968||Britain|\n|Morocco||March 2nd; 1956||France|\n|Mozambique||June 25th; 1975||Portugal|\n|Namibia||March 21st; 1990||South African mandate|\n|Niger||August 3rd; 1960||France|\n|Nigeria||October 1st, 1960||Britain|\n|Rwanda||July 1st; 1962||Belgium administered UN trusteeship|\n|SaoTomePrincipe||July 12th; 1975||Portugal|\n|Senegal||April 4th; 1960||France|\n|Seychelles||June 29th; 1976||Britain|\n|Sierra Leone||April 27th; 1961||Britain|\n|Somalia||July 1st; 1960||British Somaliland\n|South Africa||11 December 1931,\nApril 1994(end of apatheid)\n|Union of South Africa||Britain|\n|Sudan||January 1st; 1956||Egypt, Britain|\n|Swaziland||September 6th; 1968||Britain|\n|Tanzania||April 26th, 1964||Britain|\n|Togo||April 27th; 1960||French administered UN trusteeship|\n|Tunisia||March 20th; 1956||France|\n|Uganda||October 9th; 1962||Britain|\n|Zambia||October 24th; 1964||Britain|\n|Zimbabwe||April 18th; 1980||Britain|\n1960 in Africa\nKnown as the Year of Africa, 1960 saw 17 African countries declare independence among other events.\n- Mau Mau Uprising is officially over in Kenya.\n- 9–11 January – Aswan High Dam construction begins in Egypt.\n- 21 January – A mine collapses at Coalbrook, South Africa, killing 437.\n- 24 January – A major insurrection occurs in Algiers against French colonial policy.\n- 3 February – Harold Macmillan‘s Wind of Change speech is made in Cape Town, South Africa.

{"question":"Looking to minimize infrastructure management overhead - serverless computing vs vRealize dashboards?","answer":"Serverless computing offers significantly less infrastructure management overhead since cloud providers like AWS Lambda handle all server maintenance, capacity provisioning, scaling, patches and monitoring - developers just supply code. In contrast, vRealize Operations dashboards focus on providing detailed visibility and analysis of infrastructure costs but still require you to manage the underlying infrastructure components like datacenters, clusters, hosts and VMs. The dashboards help optimize costs but don't remove infrastructure management responsibilities.","context":["What is serverless computing? The idea is growing in popularity, but the term honestly sounds like an oxymoron. How does it work, and why should you consider it for your IT organization?\nWell, the name is a false promise–there are actually servers involved with serverless computing. They just aren’t managed by the organization. A serverless computing model means your cloud provider takes care of adding, removing, and/or adjusting your server resources based upon demand. You end up with a more accurate bill for your usage because it’s based literally on milliseconds, not hours. There are a couple of ideas behind this: One is to avoid prepaying for resources that might be unused, resulting in huge savings for your organization. The second is taking the burden of server management off of the developer’s hands, leaving them free to simply write code.\nThis sounds like something out of the future, but the truth is, the future is now. The big cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) all offer serverless computing services, but Amazon’s Lambda is perhaps the most well-known. According to their website, “Lambda runs your code on high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply the code.” This saves the developer time and effort in rewriting code to fit a specific infrastructure requirement, meaning applications can deploy faster and more accurately.\nServerless building blocks\nThe code that’s uploaded to AWS or Azure is known as a function. A function is an individual action or piece of logic. This tiny code unit is particularly useful for running jobs like these:\n- Scheduled, repeatable tasks\n- Web request processing\n- Processing queue messages\nThe entire function from beginning to end usually takes only milliseconds. It is these functions that form the building blocks of serverless architectures.\nWhere do containers fit in?\nContainers are the latest “hot thing,” but is it possible that serverless computing will render containers obselete? As Michael Churchman of Rancher explains, probably not. “Serverless computing of the type represented by AWS Lambda can be an extremely valuable resource, … but it is far from being an all-around substitute for deploying and managing your own containers. Serverless computing is really designed to work with containers, rather than replacing them.”\nWhat are some cases where containers might be a better fit? If your application is larger and more complex than AWS or Azure can handle, a container-based system can be as large and complex as you need. If you’re also looking for full control over the containers and the system on which they run, container-based deployment can do that. However, because serverless computing is run by a third party, you have no say in how it is run. For security and policy processes, serverless computing may not be a good fit. If you do decide to try your hand at serverless computing, a best practice is to start with new applications, rather than rewriting old ones to fit the model.\nServerless computing is a new developer-friendly offering that holds a lot of potential for cost savings and software deployment efficiency. It is not, however, a replacement for all infrastructure architectures, including containers or on-premise deployment. Again, as with all things IT, whether you use serverless computing or not depends on what your application and organizational needs are. If you want to work in a serverless environment, you will need to prepare for some changes.","Costing with VMware vRealize Operations Part 2\nUpdated: Apr 27, 2022\nLast time we configured the vRealize Operations (vROps) cost settings, this time we'll explore the cost related dashboards. There are several out of the box, I'll provide a custom dashboard as well. Let's start with the most prominent one, Assess Cost, which is available on the Quick Start page.\nClick the Assess Cost link at the bottom of the Optimize Capacity pillar. You'll be presented with a dashboard showing an inventory, datacenter costs, and your most (and least) expensive clusters.\nThe top widget gives you a basic inventory and costs. The second widget gives the user a bit more detail focused on each Datacenter, including total cost of Clusters, total cost of Datastores, and more. The bottom two Top-N widgets provide visibility into your most/least expensive Clusters.\nWhile this is a good start, I wanted a bit more, so I cloned this dashboard and gave it a bit more detail. Top left is my revised inventory/cost summary. Top right you'll find more detail for each Datacenter. I then created four underlying views used by four view widgets showing the monthly cost breakdown for the main vSphere construct: Datacenters, Clusters, ESXi Hosts, and VMs.\nIt's available here for download: https://code.vmware.com/samples/7509/cost-summary-dashboard-and-views?h=Sample\nTo find the other out-of-the-box cost related dashboards, go to Dashboards and select the three lines next to Dashboards (top left), then go to the Cost folder.\nWe've already seen the first one, let's have a look at the other three, starting with the Base Rate Analysis dashboard. This dashboard starts with a descriptive Readme, providing some insight into each widget.\nBelow the Readme, you'll find a scoreboard widget showing the average monthly cost of each VM, the total number of VMs, and the total monthly cost of ownership for your vSphere environment. A 30-day trend line for each metric is also shown, double click on each to show more details.\nThe three heatmap widgets at the bottom detail CPU costs, Memory costs, and Storage costs. The CPU Base Rate Analysis heatmap offers four configurations exploring Cluster CPU cost (GHz/month) in relation to four other metrics.\nCPU Base Rate vs Total CPU Cost (Demand)\nCPU Base Rate vs Expected Utilization (Demand)\nCPU Base Rate vs Total CPU Cost (Allocation)\nCPU Base Rate vs Current Overcommit Ratio (Allocation)\nThe Memory Base Rate Analysis heatmap provides four configurations exploring Cluster Memory cost (GB/month) in relation to four other metrics:\nMemory Base Rate vs Total Memory Cost (Demand)\nMemory Base Rate vs Expected Utilization (Demand)\nMemory Base Rate vs Total Memory Cost (Allocation)\nMemory Base Rate vs Current Overcommit Ratio (Allocation)\nThe Datastore Base Rate Analysis heatmap is storage focused and provides two configurations exploring Datastore cost (GB/month) in relation to two other metrics.\nStorage Base Rate vs Total Datastore Cost (Demand)\nStorage Base Rate vs Total Datastore Cost (Allocation)\nThe third cost related dashboard is Datacenter Cost Drivers. It provides visibility into your private cloud datacenter costs.\nThe Readme at the top provides a nice description. Select a Datacenter in the middle left widget which will drive contents of the others. These are all Views, so to explore them go to Administration - Views.\nThe last cost related dashboard is called Showback. It allows the user to select various Groups, including Departments, Environments, Folders, Functions, and more. Once selected, the user can see a cost summary, most expensive VMs, potential cost savings if you were to rightsize those VMs, and more.\nThe vROps costing engine is a powerful data analytics platform. Use it strategically to show users what their resources cost, this might help when you're trying to re-claim resources."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8e8c4e5f-acef-4f2c-9a91-218de5e81c98>","<urn:uuid:50d588d1-b84a-4b19-85a5-3542c8d30351>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Como estudiante de historia, me gustaría saber cuáles fueron los principales lemas o eslóganes tanto de Zapata como de la Revolución Mexicana en general?","answer":"There were two major slogans associated with the Mexican Revolution: First, Zapata's personal slogan was 'Tierra y Libertad' (Land and Liberty), which reflected his fight to restore land ownership to peasants from wealthy hacienda owners. The second major revolutionary slogan was 'Sufragio Efectivo, No Reelección' (Effective Suffrage, No Reelection), which emerged as a reaction to Porfirio Díaz's 35-year rule and established the principle that presidents could only serve one six-year term without possibility of reelection.","context":["Anyone who has been in the part of Puerto Vallarta that includes Incanto, Olas Altas, Daiquiri Dicks and Molino De Agua loves it and usually refers to it by a gringo description such as “Old Vallarta”, “Old Town” or “The Romantic Zone”. Please, let’s show some respect for one of the leaders of leaders of the Mexican Revolution, and call it by the official Mexican name for the colonia, “Emiliano Zapata.” That Mexican hero of the Revolution deserves our respect as a fighter for land and liberty.\nBorn in 1879 in the small town of Anenecuilco, in the state of Morelos, about 116 Kms south of Mexico City, Emiliano Zapata was one of ten children whose father was a poor horse trader. In the last half of the nineteenth century sugar was a very profitable crop and landowners were hungry for land so they stole from peasants who had occupied it for generations. In 1897, in Anenecuilco, the local hacienda owner cut off the town’s water supply and expropriated part of the common land, and this led to demonstrations by the townspeople. Zapata took part in these demonstrations and was arrested. As he grew into a young adult he continued to believe in the need for the peasants to get their ancestral lands back.\nIn 1909, at a time of political turbulence throughout the country, he was elected as president of the town council of Anenecuilco. By this time Porfirio Díaz had been president of Mexico for twenty-five and many poor Mexicans hated him for his support of the landowners and the aristocracy. In 1910, Zapata joined Francisco Madero’s revolutionary campaign to fight against Díaz. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South and soon became its undisputed leader with over 25,000 men under his command.\nMadero told him that when he, Madero, became president he would introduce land reforms that would restore ownership of hacienda-owned land to the peasants but when Diaz was turfed out and Madero did become president, in October 1911, he ignored the promises he had made to Zapata which, it turned out, was a serious mistake. A month later Zapata published the Plan of Ayala which promised to appoint a provisional president to replace Madero, until there could be legitimate elections, and pledged to buy back a third of the (stolen) land area held by the haciendas and return it to the farmers. Zapata’s slogan became “Tierra y Libertad” (“Land and Liberty”).\nMadero sent his Federal Army, under General Huerta, to wipe out the Zapatista army but Zapata’s support from his local supporters was strong and he defeated Huerta. In February 1913, in a coup against Madero, Huerta grabbed the presidency and assassinated him. The next year the coalition forces in Northern Mexico led by Venustiano Carranza, Álvaro Obregón and Francisco “Pancho” Villa joined up with Emiliano Zapata’s southern army and, together, ousted Huerta.\nAfter the revolutionaries’ victory they found that governing was hard and difficult work. Zapata and Villa broke away from Carranza, and Mexico descended into civil war. Zapata couldn’t get along with Villa and focused his energies on rebuilding society in his state of Morelos.\nCarranza, who had become president in 1914 after Huerta had been kicked to the curb, built up the federal army and defeated Villa the following year. Zapata refused to accept Carranza’s authority because of his lack of action on behalf of the peasants against the landowners and initiated guerrilla warfare against Carranza’s forces for the next four years in the state of Morelos. He was killed in an ambush on 10th April 1919. He was just forty years old.\nWhen the Mexican Constitution was issued later that year, Article 27 contained Zapata’s ideas for land reforms. He hadn’t fought and died in vain. He was a visionary with the goal of achieving political and economic freedom for the poorer people in southern Mexico and, in some measure, obtained it.\nMany popular organizations take their name from Zapata, including the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the Marxist guerrilla group that emerged in the state of Chiapas in 1983 and still exists.\nThe colonia of Emiliano Zapata here includes the million dollar homes in Molina De Agua and the hovels rented by poor Mexicans a ten-minute walk away. Would our Mexican revolutionary be happy to have this area named after him? Whatever the answer, we should all respect him for his struggle and his concerns for his fellow men and women.","Ajijic 2017 Revolution Day Parade\nRevolution Day is always the third Monday of November. This year it happened on November 20th which is the day it began on November 20th in 1910. It was a revolt against president Porfirio Diaz. He was president for thirty five years from 1876 through 1911. He had a stranglehold over the country, taking everything away from the poor Mexicans and giving all the riches to himself and his friends.\nIn 1910, Francisco I. Madero opposed Diaz in the election. Diaz jailed him. He escaped and issued the Plan of San Luis Potosí on October 6, 1910. That plan declared the election of 1910 fraudulent and said he was the provisional president.\nHe called for Mexicans to rise up against Diaz on November 20, 1910. So this is the date officially called the beginning of the revolution.\nHe wrote. ” Throw the usurpers from power, recover your rights as free men, and remember that our ancestors left us a heritage of glory which we are not to stain. Be as they were: invincible in war, magnanimous in victory.”\nThis parade is always filled with marching children of all ages. The ones marching in the above photo are pretending to be the emergency services. You can see that they are dressed as doctors and firemen and carrying stretchers.\nThe Revolution lasted for ten years. Francisco Madero led the revolt and was elected president in 1911. Then he was assassinated just two years later. Pancho Villa was a legendary hero of this war, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. He led the revolt in many battles.\nI am switching back and forth from history to present times. Who could represent the present more than the children? The little girl in the above photo was wearing her best dress. She was hurrying to the parade but stood long enough for me to take her picture.\nDuring the parade, this group of children sat around at various times and danced. The little girl in the middle of the circle was doing a traditional dance.\nThe older children danced in couples. Some of the girls had baby dolls strapped to their backs. I enjoyed seeing the beautiful costumes and hairdos.\nThe girls wore traditional dresses or skirts and blouses. The boys wore traditional outfits and many of them had mustaches glued above their lips.\nAs the parade arrived at the center of town, there was a bottleneck and it became extremely crowded. Check out the faces of the children in the front. They are not happy about getting stuck and having to stand in the hot sun for a long time.\nThe float was also stuck in the bottleneck. At least the people on it did not have to stand up.\nBut check out the expression on these two children. They were not happy about being stuck.\nThe two major themes of the parade were the revolution and children dressed in traditional clothing of that time and the children dressed in their sport clothing of today, ready to play soccer. Soccer is probably the most popular sport in Mexico and the children start playing it very early.\nThe group in the above photo were carrying flags the colors of the Mexican flag. Red, White and Green and they stopped from time to time to wave them around in various tricks.\nAbove are children doing a brief performance with balls. Again, the importance of soccer is always present in these parades.\nThis was a long parade and there were a couple of marching bands. I managed to get this photo of one of them.\nNow a little more about the history of the Revolution. It continued until 1920 when Alvaro Obregón became president. Porfirio Diaz left office and went to Paris where he died in 1915 at the age of 85.\nOne of the mottos of the revolution was Sufragio Efectivo. That means Suffrage, No Reelection. After 35 years of having Diaz in power, they did not want that to happen again. So this slogan means that presidents can only serve one term of six years and cannot be elected again.\nAbove is a photo of the bottleneck in the middle of town. I had a hard time walking out of there. But now more about the revolution. Another slogan that was popular during it was, Tierra y Libertad. That meant Land and Liberty. At that time most of the land was owned by a few wealthy people. It took many years for that to change.\nThe horses came last for obvious reasons. Above were two dancing horses. I love to watch them dance. Often I see cowboys practicing with their horses, dancing on the beach by the lake or in empty fields. Teaching horses to dance is serious business in this area.\nAbove was a group of cowboy on their horses. They were stalled too.\nI like this photo because the horse almost backed right into me. I got a pretty good closeup and managed to avoid that happening. Plus, the cowboy smiled at me.\nAbove are more cowboys and the Escaramuza Charra, the girls that wear beautiful skirts, ride sidesaddle and perform by riding towards each other in intricate patterns. It is fasinating to watch and sometimes scary when they almost run into each other. Sometimes they do run into each other but not often.\nWe are now at the end of the parade. Until next year, Adios to all of the wonderful young people who walked in it or rode on floats, horses or in cars. To the future of this country, I salute their wealth which is their young people."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d9b924b6-3051-49ba-a91e-aa25c5f5b4cf>","<urn:uuid:2bfec2e6-5c57-4888-9adf-d49bf0f0be62>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the immediate practical steps for quitting smoking, and how do psychological factors like mindfulness influence long-term abstinence success?","answer":"The immediate practical steps for quitting smoking include setting a target quit date, gradually reducing cigarette consumption, changing brands, smoking only half of each cigarette, delaying the first cigarette of the day, and creating environmental changes like cleaning clothes and removing smoking paraphernalia. For psychological support, mindfulness plays a crucial role in long-term success. Research shows that higher levels of mindfulness predict better outcomes through multiple mechanisms: it leads to lower negative emotions, higher positive emotions, reduced stress levels, and decreased smoking urges. Importantly, mindfulness helps weaken the connection between craving and relapse, while creating more favorable emotional profiles that increase the likelihood of maintaining abstinence, particularly in the critical first week after quitting.","context":["Return to Index\nTips to Help You Stop Smoking\nSmoking brings thousands of toxins into the body. It is no surprise that it increases the risk of many cancers, heart disease, and stroke. So quitting is one of the best things you can do for your health. You may have also found that smoking makes your clothes, hair, home, or car smell. It may interrupt your workdays or social outings for a cigarette break. Cigarette smoke is also a hazard for those around you. Secondhand smoke increases the risk of illnesses around you, even if they don't smoke.\nWhatever the reason, you are thinking about quitting smoking. Whether this is your first attempt or not, the following steps can help you get started on the right foot.\nOnce you’ve decided to quit smoking, set your target quit date. Make it a few weeks away. In the time leading up to your quit day, try some of these ideas to help you quit successfully.\nSome may feel comfortable quitting on their own. Talk to your doctor if you are looking for tools that can help. Options include nicotine gum, patches, or inhaler, or medicine. Some may need a prescription but many are available over-the-counter. Here are some other steps that may help:\n- Switch to a brand you find distasteful.\n- Change to a brand that is low in tar and nicotine a couple of weeks before your quit date. This will help to ease you off of smoking chemicals. Be careful not to increase the number of cigarettes you smoke to make up for changes in nicotine and tar.\n- Smoke only half of each cigarette.\n- Each day, put off your first cigarette by one hour.\n- Decide you'll only smoke during odd or even hours of the day.\n- Decide beforehand how many cigarettes you'll smoke during the day. For each extra cigarette, give a dollar to your favorite charity.\n- Change your eating habits to help you cut down. For example, drink milk. Many people feel milk and smoking do not mix. End meals or snacks with something that won't lead to a cigarette.\n- Reach for a glass of juice instead of a cigarette for a \"pick-me-up.\"\nRemember: Cutting down can help you quit. It is no substitute for quitting. If you are at 7 cigarettes a day, it's time to set your target quit date.\n- Smoke only those cigarettes you really want. Catch yourself before you light up out of pure habit.\n- Don't empty your ashtrays. This will remind you of how many cigarettes you've smoked each day. The sight and the smell of stale cigarettes butts will be very unpleasant.\n- Make yourself aware of each cigarette. Use the opposite hand or put cigarettes in an unfamiliar location or a different pocket. This will break the automatic reach.\n- Try to look in a mirror each time you put a match to your cigarette. You may decide you don't need it.\n- Stop buying cigarettes by the carton. Wait until one pack is empty before you buy another.\n- Stop carrying cigarettes with you at home or at work. Make them difficult to get to.\n- Smoke in ways that aren't pleasurable for you. If you like to smoke with others, smoke alone. Turn your chair to an empty corner and focus only on the cigarette you are smoking and all its many negative effects.\n- Collect all your cigarette butts in one large glass container. It will give you a visual reminder of smoking.\n- Practice going without cigarettes.\n- Don't think of never smoking again. Think of quitting in terms of one day at a time.\n- Tell yourself you won't smoke today, and then don't.\n- Clean your clothes to rid them of the cigarette smell. The smell can linger a long time if ti is not washed out.\n- Throw away all your cigarettes and matches. Hide your lighters and ashtrays.\n- Visit the dentist. Have your teeth cleaned to get rid of tobacco stains. Notice how nice they look. Commit to keep them that way.\n- Put aside money you would have spent on cigarettes. Make a list of things you'd like to buy for yourself or someone else.\n- Keep very busy on the big day. Go to the movies, exercise, take long walks, or go bike riding.\n- Remind your family and friends that this is your quit date. Ask them to help you over the rough spots of the first couple of days and weeks.\n- Buy yourself a treat or do something special to celebrate.\nTelephone and web-based programs can offer you the support that you need to quit and to stay smoke-free. You can find many programs online.\n- Develop a clean, fresh, nonsmoking environment around yourself. Do it at work and at home. Buy yourself flowers. You may be surprised how much you can enjoy their scent now.\n- Spend as much free time as possible in places where smoking isn't allowed in the first few days. Libraries, museums, theaters, department stores, and churches are good choices.\n- Drink plenty of water.\n- Try to avoid alcohol, coffee, and other drinks that you link with smoking.\n- Strike up conversation instead of a match for a cigarette.\n- If you miss having a cigarette in your hand, play with something else. A pencil, a paper clip, a marble, or a fidget tool may help.\n- If you miss having something in your mouth, try toothpicks or a fake cigarette.\nNational Cancer Institute\nTobacco Information and Prevention Source (TIPS)\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\nCanadian Cancer Society\nThe Lung Association\nBenefits of quitting smoking over time.

Kim Pemberthy\n“Tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States.” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). So, treating nicotine addiction and producing smoking cessation could greatly improve health. But smoking has proved devilishly difficult to treat. There are a wide variety of methods and strategies to quit smoking which are to only a very limited extent effective. According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40% of smokers who want to quit make a serious attempt to do so each year, but fewer than 5% actually succeed. Most people require three or four failed attempts before being successful.\nOne problem is that nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known and withdrawal from nicotine is very stressful, producing many physical and psychological problems, including negative emotional states and depression. In essence, the addict feels miserable without the nicotine. This promotes relapse to relieve the discomfort. Better methods to quit which can not only promote quitting but also prevent relapse are badly needed. Mindfulness practices have been found to be helpful in treating addictions, including nicotine addiction, and reducing the risk of relapse.\nIn today’s Research News article “Mechanisms linking mindfulness and early smoking abstinence: An ecological momentary assessment study.” (See summary below or view the full text of the study at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483850/), Spears and colleagues recruited adult smokers desiring to quit and provided them with “six smoking cessation counseling sessions (10–20 minutes each).” They completed questionnaires on demographics and mindfulness. They were also asked to complete assessments at baseline and for 4 weeks after cessation of smoking on a smartphone of positive and negative emotions, smoking urges, and expectancy of regulating emotions whenever they had an urge to smoke, smoked a cigarette, and 4 randomly selected times per day prompted on their smartphone.\nOf the participants 63% achieved smoking abstinence after treatment and 41% remained abstinent 7 days later. They found that on the day of smoking cessation and 7 days later, the higher the levels of mindfulness the lower the levels of negative emotions, stress, smoking urges, and expectancies that smoking would improve mood and the higher the levels of positive emotions. They also found that lower smoking urges were associated with higher levels of abstinence when the participants were low in mindfulness but not when they were high in mindfulness. In addition, the higher the levels of mindfulness, the higher the levels of positive emotions and the lower the levels of negative emotions which were in turn associated with higher levels of smoking abstinence.\nEven though the smoking cessation therapy did not include a mindfulness component, the participant’s level of mindfulness was an important contributor to successful smoking abstinence. Mindfulness appeared to be associated with improved mood and lower stress levels and urges to smoke which were in turn associated with improved outcomes. Hence, mood and stress appear to mediate the association of mindfulness with successfully quitting smoking. Mindful people appear to have more positive moods which works to improve the likelihood of quitting smoking.\nSo, improve smoking abstinence with mindfulness.\n“stress is caused by craving. If you can let go of that craving, then your stress will dissolve, and practicing mindfulness is the way to do that.” – Judson Brewer\nCMCS – Center for Mindfulness and Contemplative Studies\nThis and other Contemplative Studies posts are also available on Google+ https://plus.google.com/106784388191201299496/posts and on Twitter @MindfulResearch\nSpears, C. A., Li, L., Wu, C., Vinci, C., Heppner, W. L., Hoover, D. S., Lam, C., & Wetter, D. W. (2019). Mechanisms linking mindfulness and early smoking abstinence: An ecological momentary assessment study. Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors, 33(3), 197–207. https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000451\nResearch suggests that individuals with greater dispositional mindfulness (i.e., non-judgmental, present-focused attention) are more likely to quit smoking, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study investigated mechanisms linking mindfulness and early smoking abstinence using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants were 355 smokers (33% Caucasian, 33% African American, 32% Latino; 55% female) receiving smoking cessation treatment. Mindfulness was assessed at baseline and on the quit date. For 4 days pre-quit and 1 week post-quit, participants completed up to 4 EMAs per day indicating levels of negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), smoking urges, and affect regulation expectancies. Mean, slope, and volatility were calculated for each pre-quit and post-quit EMA variable. Associations among mindfulness, EMA parameters, and abstinence on the quit day and 7 days post-quit, as well as indirect effects of mindfulness on abstinence through EMA parameters were examined. Mindfulness predicted higher odds of abstinence in unadjusted but not covariate-adjusted models. Mindfulness predicted lower NA, higher PA, and lower affective volatility. Lower stress mediated the association between mindfulness and quit-day abstinence. Higher ratings of happy and relaxed, and lower ratings of bored, sad and angry, mediated the association between mindfulness and post-quit abstinence. Mindfulness appeared to weaken the association between craving and post-quit abstinence. This study elucidates real-time, real-life mechanisms underlying dispositional mindfulness and smoking abstinence. During the early process of quitting smoking, more mindful individuals appear to have more favorable emotional profiles, which predicts higher likelihood of achieving abstinence 1 week after the quit date."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0545794e-c298-4da6-9179-0ff7ebbd0cd5>","<urn:uuid:2ee718fa-b424-4229-9481-bbc8619758be>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you detail how NYC's handgun transport restrictions impact constitutional rights and interstate commerce, while also explaining how the severity of robbery charges varies based on weapon possession versus actual injury?","answer":"Regarding constitutional rights and commerce, the Second Circuit ruled NYC's transport restrictions don't violate the Second Amendment or interstate commerce since residents can still practice at city ranges and rent guns elsewhere. The court applied intermediate scrutiny, finding the rules serve public safety given past abuses like loaded transport and airplane incidents. As for robbery severity, NY Penal Law 160.15 distinguishes between weapon possession and injury - causing serious physical injury (risking death/disfigurement) qualifies as first degree robbery under 160.15(1), while merely possessing/displaying weapons during the robbery also elevates it to first degree under 160.15(2-4), though proving a gun was inoperable is a defense that could reduce charges.","context":["Coming in the midst of a national discussion on reasonable limits on the Second Amendment right to bear arms prompted by high school students’ reaction to the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, a decision from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upholding a New York City regulation restricting the ability of individuals with a \"premises license\" handgun permit to remove the gun from the specified premises has special resonance. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. City of New York, 883 F.3d 45 (2d Cir. 2018), a firearms owners' association and individual holders of premises handgun licenses sued the City of New York and the New York City Police Department‑License Division (collectively \"City\"), the local office authorized by the New York State Penal Code to issue handgun permits in the City, challenging New York City Rule 5‑23(a) on the grounds that it violates the Second Amendment, the dormant Commerce Clause, the fundamental right to travel, and the First Amendment right to expressive association. The district court granted the City's motion for summary judgment, upholding the regulation on all grounds, and the Second Circuit affirmed.\nThe Penal Code provides for two primary types of handgun licenses: \"premises\" licenses and \"carry\" licenses. N.Y. Penal Law ' 400.00(2)(a), (f). As its name indicates, the premises license authorizes possession of a handgun only at a particular address, in this case, the permittee's residence. The handgun can be removed from the premises only in limited circumstances, such as\n(3) To maintain proficiency in the use of the handgun, the licensee may transport her/his handgun(s) directly to and from an authorized small arms range/shooting club, unloaded, and in a locked container, the ammunition to be carried separately.\nN.Y.C. R. 5‑23(a). According to the License Division, an \"authorized small arms range/shooting club\" must be located in New York City. New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n, 883 F.3d at 53. All of the plaintiffs challenged the Rule's prohibition against transporting their handguns to shooting ranges and competitions outside of New York City, and one of the plaintiffs challenged the prohibition against transporting his handgun from his city dwelling to his second home outside of the City. Id. at 54.\nThe Second Circuit employed a two‑step inquiry for determining whether the Rule satisfied the Second Amendment: (1) Does the challenged Rule impinge on conduct protected by the Second Amendment? (2) If so, what is the appropriate level of scrutiny? Id. at 55. As for the first element, the court assumed without discussion that the Rule impinged on a protected right. Id. Regarding the second element, the court observed that the Rule was not a substantial burden on the right of plaintiffs to keep and bear arms, since there were seven facilities within the City of New York at which all plaintiffs could practice shooting, and if they wanted to go to shooting ranges outside of the City they could rent or borrow a gun at those facilities. Furthermore, the plaintiff with a second home was free to obtain a premises permit in the jurisdiction where he owned the second home. (Because the prohibition as applied to the second-homeowner touched on a core area of Second Amendment protection, i.e., the right to self‑defense at home, the court found, somewhat skeptically, that some level of heightened scrutiny applied to the individual challenge, but nevertheless concluded that the regulation satisfied the requirements of heightened scrutiny. Id. at 55‑61.)\nSince the Rule did not bar gun ownership outright, strict scrutiny of the Rule was not required. Rather, the court applied intermediate scrutiny, under which the government prevails if it can show that the Rule was substantially related to achievement of an important government interest. Id. at 61‑62. The court found no Second Amendment violation because the Rule was substantially related to the important governmental interest in public safety and crime prevention. The City presented evidence that under a previous looser version of the Rule allowing premises permit holders to travel to shooting ranges beyond the City limits there were documented examples of abuse which threatened the public health and safety, including, licensees traveling with loaded firearms, licensees found with firearms far away from the vicinity of an authorized range, licensees taking their firearms on airplanes, and licensees traveling with their firearms when no authorized range was open. The court reasoned that such abuses of the Rule could lead to impermissible uses of a handgun in acts of road rage, crowd situations, demonstrations, family disputes, and other circumstances where possession of a firearm would threaten health and safety. Id. at 63. Plaintiffs, in contrast, offered no evidence of harm suffered under the Rule and they were free to use shooting ranges within the City with their own firearms or to use shooting ranges outside the City with rented or borrowed guns. Moreover, the second-homeowner could obtain a premises license in the jurisdiction of his second home and purchase a handgun to keep there. Id. at 64.\nThe court also held that Rule 5‑23(a) did not discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. The Rule \"does not prohibit a premises licensee from patronizing an out‑of‑state firing range or going to out‑of‑state shooting competitions.\" Id. at 65. No evidence was presented that the purpose of the Rule was to protect the City's firing‑range industry. Finally, there was no evidence that the Rule had a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce aside from the plaintiffs’ assertion that they had refrained from using their own handguns in shooting events outside of the City of New York. Id. The court rejected plaintiffs' efforts to trivialize the prohibition against allowing premises license holders to take their guns outside of the City by analogizing the Rule to a hypothetical rule requiring City tennis racket owners to use their rackets only on tennis courts within the City, observing that, unlike guns, tennis rackets did not pose a public safety issue. Id. at 65‑66.\nFor the same reasons that the court rejected the Commerce Clause challenge, the court found that Rule 5‑23(a) did not infringe on the right to travel, noting, \"The Constitution protects the right to travel, not the right to travel armed.\" Id. at 67. Finally, the court found that plaintiffs could not sustain a First Amendment challenge because the Constitution does not recognize a general right to social association. \"Gathering with others for a purely social and recreational activity, whether it is dancing or shooting guns, does not constitute expressive association under the First Amendment.\" Id. at 67‑68 (citation omitted). And even if social association were protected by the First Amendment, the plaintiffs were free to borrow or rent a gun to participate in shooting activities at any shooting range outside New York City. Id. at 68.","Robbery in the First Degree: NY Penal Law 160.15\nBrace yourself. Remain calm. Think rationally. Pause. If you are arrested by the NYPD in New York City or the county, sheriff, or local municipal police in a Hudson Valley town, village or city, such as any of those in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess or Orange, and charged with First Degree Robbery, you will without a shadow of a doubt have a tumultuous road ahead. While as terrifying as it may and likely will be, by no means is an arrest for New York Penal Law 160.15 a guarantee that you will ultimately serve the twenty-five years in prison allowable by law upon conviction. Although Robbery in the First Degree is by far the most severe and serious degree of Robbery, just like any other crime, the right criminal defense attorney can provide you with the best defense to limit your exposure, challenge the allegations and formulate the strongest means to confront your felony complaint, indictment or evidence at trial.\n- New York Robbery Defense and Criminal Law Information Page\n- Robbery in the Third Degree – New York Penal Law 160.05\n- Robbery in the Second Degree – New York Penal Law 160.10\nIf you arm yourself with knowledge and education, secure the evidence needed to defend yourself against the District Attorney and thoroughly build your case, what is bleak now may be quite different as your case progresses.First Degree Robbery: Understanding the Crime of NY Penal Law 160.10\nFirst Degree Robbery, pursuant to NY Penal Law 160.10, is a violent crime punishable by no less than five years and a maximum of twenty-five years in a state prison. In other words, without any criminal history, if you fail to adequately defend yourself, you will find yourself incarcerated for at least five years. Period. Like the lesser degrees of Robbery, Robbery in the First Degree requires a forcible stealing of property. However, to ascend to PL 160.10, additional actions or elements are required.First Degree Robbery: New York Penal Law 160.15(1)\nIf you forcibly steal property and during that theft, taking, or fleeing from the same, you or another person involved in the Robbery causes an injury meeting the legal threshold of “serious physical injury” to any non-participant, then you have committed NY Penal Law 160.15(1). “Serious physical injury” is that which causes a real risk of death, disfigurement or long-term impairment and not merely a knocked-out tooth, broken finger or bruised ribs.First Degree Robbery: New York Penal Law 160.15(2)\nHave a firearm or similar weapon? If you allegedly stole property with or by a show of force and either you or another person allegedly involved in this wrongful taking was armed with a deadly weapon during the course of the crime or flight from it, you are guilty of NY Penal Law 160.15(2).First Degree Robbery: New York Penal Law 160.15(3)\nNot merely possessing a deadly weapon, if you threaten that you have and will use a dangerous instrument to facilitate a Robbery or do the same while fleeing from this alleged conduct, or your “partners” do so, expect prosecutors to seek Grand Jury indictment for your violation of NY Penal Law 160.15(3).First Degree Robbery: New York Penal Law 160.15(4)\nIf you forcibly steal property and during that theft or flight therefrom, you or another participant actually displays a firearm, then the District Attorney will likely pursue First Degree Robbery charges pursuant to NY Penal Law 160.15(4). It is important to realize, and potentially discuss with your legal counsel, that it is an affirmative defense, one that you, the accused, must establish, that the gun in question was not operable, not loaded, etc. Assuming you are successful in establishing this defense, it does not preclude prosecution for Robbery in the Second or Third Degrees but limits your exposure away from the First Degree offense.\n- New York Criminal Arrests and Convictions: Immigration Consequences\n- NYC Employee Arrests: Direct and Collateral Consequences\n- Doctors, Nurses and Other Medical Professionals: NY Arrests and Licensure\nAlthough the above definitions are fairly clear, they contain critical legal language that someone unfamiliar with the criminal law may not understand. For example, how does physical injury differ from serious physical injury? How far must one go before one’s actions establish a displaying of a firearm or what appears to be one? What about the old finger underneath the shirt trick? Is that pretending to have a firearm criminal in violation of the criminal code?\nThere can be no mistake.

{"question":"How do the A220 and ultra long-range private jets handle turbulence differently?","answer":"The A220 uses crowdsourcing technology that shows pilots where smooth air is by gathering data from all Delta's aircraft, while ultra long-range private jets avoid turbulence by operating at service ceilings of 50,000 feet or higher, well above the busy flight zone.","context":["Atmospheric Turbulence and the Evolution of Aviation Technology in the A220 (Credit: Airbus, CBS News, Meteorologist Jessica Olsen)\nDISCUSSION: Often many do not see the connection between aviation and meteorology, there can be a basic assumption that aircraft can withstand a wide variety of weather phenomena, which is often true but some are lacking in overall capability. In addition to specialized instruments needed for aircraft, basic meteorology is on the forefront of a major phenomena that most airline passengers typically ask meteorologists about, turbulence.\nAccording to the American Meteorological Society, aircraft turbulence is, “ irregular motion of an aircraft in flight, especially when characterized by rapid up-and-down motion, caused by a rapid variation of atmospheric wind velocities.” Which, “this can occur in cloudy areas (particularly towering cumulus and lenticular clouds) and in clear air. Turbulence is the leading cause of nonfatal passenger and flight attendant injuries. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) classifies aircraft turbulence as follows:\nWhile there are a variety of aircraft that do not have operational limitations, some aircraft such as the Canadair (CRJ) 200 or Embraer (ERJ) 140/45, often must remain grounded (until weather should pass) due to lack of ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) (CRJ 200), and weight and balance issues. Aircraft and its flight are also limited to the use of visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR) based on aircraft and pilot ratings.\nTurbulence is by far one of the most noticeable connections between aviation and meteorology, of course behind the use of air as a fluid, the forces of flight and Bernoulli’s Principle. As we investigate turbulence, we can often just deduce that turbulence is the flow of atmospheric winds due to the rising and sinking of air in the atmosphere. Should we further explore wind in turbulent flow we can consider that all turbulence is, is atmospheric motion, and as height increased, pressure typically decreases, with wind increasing, creating various components of vertical motion going on while moving horizontally in the atmosphere within an aircraft.\nAirbus has created the A220-100, built as the smallest jetliner in the Airbus family, designed to serve the 100-135 seat market, in addition to the A220-300 to serve the 130-160 market. These new aircraft are attempting to put down the days of the MD-80, and B717 while providing an economical and efficient aircraft, compared to previous iterations. What is of note is its turbulence avoidance technology which according to CBS News, “shows pilots where the smooth air is by crowdsourcing data from all of Delta's aircraft.” Pilots are hailing this new technology, rather than attempting to maneuver the aircraft to find it, it can be found on the instrument panel. In addition to this valuable technology the aircraft was designed for hot, and high, city-like environments, an ideal aircraft for places like Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport where extreme temperatures often limit aircraft arrivals and departures in the summer months.\nFor further information on aviation and weather visit the Global Weather and Climate Center!\n© 2019 Meteorologist Jessica Olsen\n“A220-100.” Airbus, Airbus, www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a220-family/a220-100.html.\nVan Cleave, Kris. “Delta's New Airbus A220 Features Wider Coach Seats and Turbulence Avoidance Technology.” CBS News, CBS News, 28 Dec. 2018, www.cbsnews.com/news/new-delta-airbus-a220-features-wider-coach-seats-turbulence-avoidance-tech/.","Private Jets with Ultra Long-Range Performance Capabilities\nThe ultra long-range category of aircraft comprises the largest models among private jets, and the capabilities of these jets are impressive. Ultra long-range applies to aircraft with a range of between 6,000 and 6,500 nautical miles, and some can travel even farther. In addition, ultra long-range aircraft are some of the fastest in civil aviation, and are equipped with ever-advancing state-of-the-art navigation, safety and avionics technology. At 50,00 feet or higher, these aircraft are able to operate at a service ceiling that allows them to fly at altitudes well above the busy flight zone that many other aircraft use, and also allows them to avoid turbulence for a smoother in-flight experience. Because passengers spend ample amounts of time on these jets, they are typically equipped with the most comfortable interiors and advanced on-board technologies available. Multi-media and business facilities are standard on these large aircraft, as well as ample space for customized seating configurations, making them optimal jet options for business travelers. The Boeing Business Jet, Bombardier Global Express, Dassault Falcon 7X, and the popular Gulfstream G550 are comparable Ultra Long-Range aircraft.\nThe Boeing Business Jet is the largest of the ultra long-range business jets, with the following cabin dimensions: the length is 107.3 feet, the width is 11.7 feet, and the height is 7.1 feet. The interior seats eight passengers in ultimate comfort and luxury, although the cabin can be organized to seat up to 60 in a high-density configuration. Options include conference and lounge areas, full lavatory with shower, sleeping accommodations and enhanced multi-media and business capabilities. The BBJ utilizes eight auxiliary fuel tanks, which means it can easily complete ultra long-range and overseas trips non-stop.\nThe Bombardier Global Express was an early leader in ultra long-range technology. At the time of its conception, the Global Express had the largest cabin of any private jet and could travel the farthest without making a fuel stop. The cabin layout carries between 13 and 19 passengers, and includes two fully enclosed lavatories and a selection of multi-media preferences. Noise is mitigated by considerable cabin insulation and advanced engines that produce less audible vibration. The engines are BMW/Rolls Royce BR710A2-20 turbofans that execute a rapid ascension to the jet’s optimal cruise level – around 42,000 feet – and can climb to 37,000 feet in just 19 minutes. What sets the Global Express apart from other comparable aircraft is its ability to cruise at a high speed for long hauls; it can travel at .85 Mach for its maximum range of 6,100 nautical miles.\nThe Dassault Falcon 7X is a luxurious business jet arranged with three separate lounge areas conducive to productivity, meetings and optimized comfort. Standard features include a stand-up lavatory, ergonomically adjustable seats, full-size galley, full-length wardrobe, and advanced temperature controls and pressurization system. Exclusive interiors designed by BMW DesignWorksUSA Group are available on the Falcon 7X. The jet’s cutting edge environmental system regulates altitude levels so that at 50,000 feet, the altitude inside the cabin is approximately 5,000 feet. An air humidifier, advanced noise control, and variety of seating configurations all contribute to the Falcon 7X’s comfort and versatility.\nGulfstream is the leader in large cabin jets and one of the most highly recognized and well-known manufacturers in civil aviation. Perhaps that’s why the Gulfstream G550 is such an exceptional ultra long-range plane. The G550 is the revamped edition of the GV, with advanced aviation technologies that enable it to travel farther, faster, and with more cabin space than its predecessor. Although the cabin can carry up to 19 travelers, it is usually configured for 14 to 16 passengers for maximum comfort. Standard amenities include a full lavatory with shower, and separate rooms for conferences, dining, lounging, and a crew rest area. The G550 is propelled by two BMW/Rolls Royce BF 700-710-C4-11 turbofan engines which produce an enormous amount of power enabling the jet to travel fast and for extremely long distances. Enhanced avionics technology including I-NAV increase flight safety and accuracy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dc4578c3-b978-4b98-86bc-d3aa6a4296d4>","<urn:uuid:3dbe22ab-9d48-4431-a19f-306a19b00958>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an art historian, I'm curious - how do the historical uses of glass in Murano compare to the traditional uses of gourds in Peru in terms of their transition from utilitarian to decorative purposes?","answer":"Both materials show a fascinating evolution from practical to artistic uses. Peruvian gourds have been used for at least 4,500 years for both utilitarian purposes (like storing quinoa and rice or drinking corn liquor) and decorative arts. Similarly, glass started as a practical material but gained artistic significance, particularly in Murano where it became a thriving decorative industry by the 15th century. In both cases, the artistic techniques have preserved ancient traditions while evolving - Peruvian gourd carvers like Tito Medina now create complex decorative pieces worth thousands of dollars, while Murano's glass evolution is exemplified by masterpieces like the 1460 Barovier Cup.","context":["Gourds have been used in Peru for at least 4,500 years centuries for utilitarian and decorative purposes. Artist Tito Medina and his workshop of carvers use a uniquely Peruvian style to tell stories great and small about their culture and their everyday lives…in gourd form.\nKnown locally as mate, gourds are grown and dried in coastal regions where water is plentiful. Many centuries old trade routes along which raw gourds traveled country are still intact today. Many rural homes still use gourds to drink home brewed corn liquor – chichi – or to store quinoa and rice.\nThe motifs carved into gourds show us significant community events, and even give a window into the private lives of the carvers’ families. Pastoral scenes illustrate the chores of daily life – farming, cooking, weaving, and hunting. Religious ceremonies – weddings, funerals, and feasts – are also depicted. Carefully rendered plants and animals give us a catalog of the living things surrounding the carvers. When viewed together, these gourd form an important historical document, with every aspect of life and death shown in great detail.\nThe sgraffito technique which transforms humble vegetables into storytelling documents has changed very little across millennia of gourd carving. Once dried and washed, the artisan uses an awl shaped from a nail to scratch through the hard outer surface of the gourd creating the pattern. Then liquid chalk or ash is used to fill in the carved surface and illuminate the design. Sometimes artisans use hot metal to heat-engrave shadows. Recently, modern dyes capable of penetrating the hard surface of the gourd have been added to increase the range of colors and appeal to modern buyers.\nWhile the gourds have a utilitarian history, there are several artisans who have taken the traditional carving to a new level. The central plateau communities of Huancayo and Ayacucho have become home to some of the most accomplished carvers in the region, and Tito Medina is one of the best.\nTito’s family has been carving gourds for more than four generations. His ancestors made mostly utilitarian goods, and were known for their quality craftsmanship. But Tito’s parents started developing a more decorative outlook in the Seventies and Eighties, just as six-year old Tito came into the business to work alongside his family. At this time, characters and images on the gourds became smaller and more detailed: more complex stories and completely carved surfaces clearly showed off an artisan’s carving and storytelling skills.\nWhen Tito started working independently, he incorporated more carving and a more contemporary design aesthetic, advancing the art form and creating a place for himself among the small cadre of artisans forging a modern market for an ancient tradition.\nTito has pioneered the use of mixed materials, adding silver accents to his pieces beginning in the early 2000’s. This has helped to elevate the perceived value of his gourds. He has also added contemporary geometric patterns to his pieces, and sometimes pierces through the gourd to offer a glimpse into its unfinished interior.\nThe Medina taller (workshop) in Huancayo employs 12 to 15 artisans. Under the Tito’s direction his craftsmen learn the Medina family’s techniques to produce thousands of pieces each month for customers around the world, mostly exported to boutique stores in the United States and Europe. The taller’s export work consists mostly of ornaments and figurines created from the smallest gourds. The shop also produces numerous small boxes and miniature nacimientos (Nativity scenes) with the holy family housed in a stable formed by an open gourd. This relatively high-volume production work allows the public at large to have a piece of ancient art in their homes.\nBut Tito’s personal passion is his collector’s line. Some of his larger works, measuring two dozen centimeters in circumference, take months to create, and he is only able to make several dozen pieces in a given year. Demand for his work is high, with pieces ranging in price from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Tito designs his collectible work with an eye to preserving the craft’s ancient forms. Celebrations, pastoral life and the events of the everyday life are his muses. Each scene is rendered with hundreds of precisely detailed individual miniature portraits floating across its surface. With such limited production, most pieces are sold directly to visitors to Tito’s shop on Petit Thours in Lima, or at his taller in Huancayo.\nTito’s children are still young, but he is hopeful they will join him in learning the family business, and that their influence will continue to advance the art form in the coming years.","The glass making has long-standing roots which can be traced back over three thousand years ago. It’s quite difficult to determine with certainty which people can boast the discovery of glass making, which probably was the consequence of an accidental invention.\nAccording to an ancient Phoenician legend, handed down by Pliny the Elder (AD 23 –AD 79), some merchants, returning from Egypt with a large shipment of sodium carbonate, stopped one evening along the banks of a river to rest. They used few blocks of saltpeter to light a fire and cook some food. The fire kept on burning all night long, and in the morning they found with amazement a new bright and transparent material: glass!\nThe oldest archaeological finds of glass pastes date back to around the fourth millennium BC and were found in the area stretching from the Mesopotamian basin to Egypt: mostly rings, beads, seals, inlays and plates, and this goes to show that the most ancient techniques only allow the production of objects of small dimensions, intended to ritual uses or created for ornamental purposes.\nApparently, in the early days of the process, the rarity due to the difficulty of production, was to consider the glass as a precious material like semiprecious gems and stones, with which were realized the jewelry.\nFrom the Hellenistic period there was an increase in long-haul trades, and industries began to produce large-scale, and commonly used luxury items. This is when the glass manufacturing experienced a period of prosperity, spreading throughout the Mediterranean.\nAt the time of emperor Augustus the manufacture of glass, along with the other arts, experienced profound changes. Glass artifacts of that period have been found throughout Europe (France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Spain), and in those days the glass industry experienced a productivity growth.\nImportant production centers were created everywhere, thanks to itinerant craftsmen ready to bring their skills wherever there was demand for glass.\nThe art of glass spread throughout Europe especially during the Roman Empire, and certainly, the phenomenon that favored this expansion is to be found in the orientation to daily use of glass production.\nThe center of glassmaking in Italy was the island of Murano. Murano’s reputation as a center for glassmaking began when the Venetian government, in order to prevent fires in the city centre, ordered to move all glass furnaces to the island of Murano in 1291. From then on all the necessary measures to prevent possible industrial espionage were taken.\nMurano glass production became such a thriving industry that, until the end of the 18th C, the island was Europe’s leading centre for glass making.\nThe art of glass blowing in Murano achieved soon great results, due to the technological innovations introduced by Angelo Barovier, the greatest glassmaker of the 15th C, who in 1460 created the most precious masterpiece of glass art: the famous “Barovier Cup”, made of enameled blown glass, now preserved in the Glass Museum in Murano.\nA visit to Murano glass making factories today offers the opportunity to see how glass is still made, with the same techniques used in the past. You can also enrich the experience with the visit of the Glass Museum to admire the precious old glass works of art which are still today inspiring the glass masters of Murano."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dc468a14-225f-41a0-83bd-1dd504123dc1>","<urn:uuid:e294203e-c509-457a-a9a0-c93750adacb6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does stress affect both heart rhythm abnormalities and the body's response to natural versus artificial sounds?","answer":"Stress plays a significant role in both heart rhythm abnormalities and the body's response to environmental sounds. In terms of heart rhythm, stress and anxiety can be direct causes of arrhythmias. When it comes to sound response, individuals who showed the highest stress levels before exposure to natural sounds experienced the greatest bodily relaxation when listening to them, while those who were already relaxed showed only slight decreases in stress levels. The research shows that natural sounds can help counteract stress-related effects by promoting relaxation and outward-directed attention, while artificial sounds tend to promote inward-directed attention similar to states of anxiety and stress.","context":["Posted on Apr 11, 2017, 6 a.m.\nFor the first time, research shows how the sounds of nature promote relaxation and a sense of well-being.\nNew research from the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) of the University of Sussex reports that a long walk in the woods or on the beach, sitting by a burbling brook, or even the sound of wind or birds in the trees can physically change our bodily systems and mind and lead to relaxation and well-being.\n'Green' environments and naturalistic sounds have frequently been linked to feelings that bring about a relaxing atmosphere; but, until this research, there was no scientific consensus as to how this comes about.\nDr. Cassandra Gould van Praag, the lead author, stated that we now have evidence from the body and the brain that helps us to understand this effect. An exciting collaboration between scientists and artists has produced results which may have a real-world impact, especially for people who experience high stress levels.\nIn collaboration with Mark Ware, an audio visual artist, the research team conducted their experiment. Participants listened to sounds that were recorded from artificial and natural environments. The activity in their brains was measured by an MRI scanner while their autonomic nervous system activity was monitored via heart rate minute changes. Activity in the brain's default mode network, which is a collection of areas that are active when people are resting, was different and depended on the sounds being played in the background.\nBrain connectivity, when listening to artificial sounds, showed an inward-directed attention focus similar to states in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. When the sounds being heard were natural, the brain connectivity exhibited an outward-directed attention focus. Also noted was an increase in nervous system activity, associated with relaxation, when listening to natural sounds compared to artificial ones, and there was better performance in an external attentional monitoring tasks.\nThe amount of change in the activity of the nervous system depended on the baseline state of the participants. Those who displayed the greatest stress before the experiment showed the largest amount of bodily relaxation when they were subjected to natural sounds. Those who were relaxed showed a slight decrease in their stress level when they listened to natural compared to artificial sounds.\nThis study of environmental exposure effects of the environment is of interest in mental and physical health and influences public health issues. This research is the first one to present an integrated physiological, behavioral, and brain exploration of this particular topic.\nMark Ware commented that art and science collaborations can be a problem due to a lack of shared artistic and scientific language and knowledge. However, the team at BSMS sought common ground, and that resulted in this successful and exciting outcome. He further stated that they have plans to continue the collaboration and explore how the results might be applied to the creation and understanding of time-based art such as film, multimedia performance, and installations, that will be for the benefit of people in terms of health and well-being.\nCassandra D.

It can feel like a heart’s fluttering or beating too fast or too slow than the normal rate: signs of abnormal heart rhythm. Called as Heart Arrhythmias, this abnormal heart rhythm condition can carry a life-threatening heart risk or can sometimes stay silent and you don’t feel anything at all.\nHeart Beat & Abnormal Heart Rhythm:\nA group of cells in the heart called the cardiac conduction system sends out electrical impulses through sinus node, natural pacemaker located in the right upper chamber of the heart. These electrical impulses through sinus node start the heartbeat by pumping the blood into lower heart chambers.\nAs the ventricles are filled with blood, the electrical impulses arrive at the ventricle contracting it to pump this blood to the lungs or other parts of the body. Everything goes smoothly and heartbeats at the rate of 60-100 beats per minute depending upon the activity level.\nWhat causes an abnormal heart rhythm?\nThere are many possible causes of abnormal heart rhythms that include heart attack, blocked arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, scarred heart tissues caused by a prior heart attack, overactive or underactive thyroid glands, stress or anxiety or even genetics.\nTypes of Arrhythmia:\nThe speed and rhythm of each heartbeat are controlled by the said electrical impulses. A heartbeat of the patient may fall out of rhythm when these electrical impulses travel in a different direction than normal causing arrhythmia.\nThere are two general types of arrhythmia depending on how they affect the heart:\nTachycardia: Faster heartbeat – when the heart beats faster than 100 beats/minute.\nBradycardia: Slower heartbeat – when the heart beats slower than 60 beats/minute.\nThis is only a general classification and it doesn’t mean all faster or slower heartbeats are arrhythmias. Sometimes a high activity can cause faster heartbeat and deep sleep can cause a slower heartbeat in relaxed states.\nGoing further, arrhythmias are again classified depending upon where the abnormal heart rhythm originates:\nCommon types of Tachycardia originating in Atria (upper heart chamber):\nAtrial fibrillation: Chaotic electrical impulses originated in atria cause weak and rapid contractions in atria, further causing irregular ventricular rhythms resulting in rapid heart rate. This condition can be temporary or sometimes it doesn’t end until treated by a heart specialist.\nAtrial flutter: Rapid heartbeat similar to fibrillation but the heart flutter in a less chaotic way compared to fibrillation. It also carries the risk of heart stroke just like fibrillation.\nSupraventricular tachycardia: This is an umbrella term for all the abnormal heart rhythms originating in the upper chamber or AV node.\nCommon Tachycardias occurring in the ventricles:\nVentricular Tachycardia: Rapid and regular heartbeat that is caused due to abnormal electrical impulses originating in ventricles. These abnormal impulses cause inefficient pumping of blood and this can lead to a serious medical emergency when this happens with a weak heart.\nVentricular Fibrillation: Similar to the above condition the fibrillation causes the ventricles to quiver leading to inefficient pumping of blood. Fibrillation can be fatal if it is not treated by a heart specialist within minutes.\nA slow heartbeat need not always be Bradycardia. But if your heartbeat is slow and your heart is failing to pump sufficient blood than such a problem can be sign of abnormal heart rhythm that falls under Bradycardia. Two common types of Bradycardia:\nSick Sinus Syndrome: When the sinus node which is the natural pacemaker of our heart doesn’t send electrical impulses properly, the heart rate may fall off the rhythm. This condition is mostly found in older adults.\nConduction block: The electrical impulse travel from atria to ventricles through the AV node, which when suffers a blockage can result in disrupted heart rhythms.\nWhile we have briefly discussed about the causes & types of abnormal heart rhythms, our next blog post will give you more information on signs and symptoms of abnormal heart rhythm, treatment option, and tips to reduce abnormal heart rhythms."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5a36ee2-b748-456d-8577-a7d47abe425f>","<urn:uuid:31015019-120b-42d5-bcdf-5eb179076d1f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should flasher wrasses be fed in captivity to maintain their health?","answer":"Flasher wrasses should be fed frequently but in small amounts due to their high metabolism. Their diet should include varied foods such as meaty bits of marine flesh (raw table shrimp, squid, clam, and mussel), supplemented with herbivorous food like flake food for herbivores or seaweed strips such as Sea Veggies or nori. They readily accept commercially prepared pellet food and frozen food. A mature refugium as part of the filtration system can provide a constant food supply.","context":["Genus Paracheilinus - Flasher Wrasses\nFlashy Fish for Your Reef Tank\n|The Bell’s Flasher Wrasse (P. bellae) is a deep water fish from the Marshall Islands and Palau, which is not frequently seen in the hobby. Illustration by Karen Talbot\nThere are 14 described species of wrasses in the genus Paracheilinus, more commonly known as the “flasher wrasses.” Indeed, these are flashy fishes, and they also make great reef aquarium fishes.\nWhile flashing may have dubious (if not outright disturbing connotations for humans), flashing is a natural and quite desirable behavior demonstrated by some marine fishes. Fishes are said to be flashing when they dive toward an object or into the substrate and then quickly flash back. They may do this for two main reasons. First, they may be attempting to dislodge a parasite attached to their flesh by rubbing against live rock, an aquarium decoration or the substrate itself. Second, and as is the case with flasher wrasses, they may be attempting to impress females by quickly emerging from the reefscape, displaying their flashy coloration and showy finnage and then diving back into the live rock or coral. When a male flasher wrasse is kept with two or more female wrasses of the same species, the aquarist is in for quite a show.\nBefore discussing species specifics, it’s worth taking a look at wrasses as a group. All wrasses are from the Family Labridae (from the Greek “labrum” or “lip”). This is one of the larger families of reef fishes, and, as such, there are many variations in behavior, diet, husbandry, and aquarium suitability. Most wrasses are small (as small as two inches), but a few grow to more than six feet in length. They all have protractile mouths, cycloid scales and a lateral line that may either be continuous or interrupted. All are marine fishes, but there are both tropical and temperate species. Despite this variety, it is not infrequent to see wrasses offered by retailers of marine livestock broken down into two somewhat arbitrary categories—reef compatible and not reef compatible. The flasher wrasses are all considered reef compatible fishes.\nReef Compatible Flasher Wrasses\n|The McCosker’s falsher wrasse (P. mccoskeri) replaces the Carpenter’s flasher wrasse in the Indian Ocean. Illustration by Karen Talbot\nFlasher wrasses are zooplankton feeders (like the fairy wrasses of the genus Cirrhilabrus), and they are amongst the best wrasses for a reef aquarium. They generally stay small, are quite hardy and have generally peaceful dispositions. The males are known for their bright colors, gorgeous finnage and flashing behavior. A single male should be kept with two or more females to form a harem.\nDespite their flashy appearance, these are generally peaceful fishes that need to be housed with peaceful tankmates. Two of the most popular flasher wrasses are the filamented flasher wrasse (P. filamentosus) and the Carpenter’s flasher wrasse (P. carpenter). Other popular, although not as commonly seen, species include the McCoskeri flasher wrasse (P. mccoskeri) and (P. octotaenia).\nFilamented Flasher Wrasse (P. filamentosus)\nThis flasher wrasse (to just shy of six inches), sometimes called the filamentous wrasse, the filament-fin wrasse, or the filamentous wrasse, is indigenous to the Indo-Pacific, where it primarily inhabits rubble zones in passages and outer reef slopes. The filamented flasher wrasse forms large shoals most commonly at depths of 70 feet, although small shoals may also be observed at depths of thirty feet or less. There is some geographical variation in the male’s colors based on the presence of similar species in the same general vicinity. Regardless, the male is a very attractive fish with a crescent-shaped (lunate) caudal fin and greatly prolonged dorsal rays. Both males and females possess four or five narrow red to blue stripes, which alternate in length. Some females (depending on geographical location) also have elongate dorsal rays, although they are much shorter than the male’s in all cases. Expect male filamented flasher wrasses to display their colors and finnage to other males and available females.\nCarpenter’s Flasher Wrasse (P. carpenter)\n|The Carpenter’s Flasher Wrasse (P. carpenter) is one of the smaller flasher wrasses, growing to about three inches. Illustration by Karen Talbot\nThe Carpenter’s flasher wrasse, sometimes called the pink flasher or the redfin flasher, is one of the smaller flasher wrasses seen in the hobby (rarely exceeds three inches). It is indigenous to the Western Pacific from the Philippines north to Taiwan and Iriomotejima and south to northern Bali and Flores. This species is most commonly found near the base of steep outer reef slopes above rubble zones or coral in water 70 feet or deeper. In the Indian Ocean, the Carpenter’s flasher wrasse is replaced by the McCosker’s flasher wrasse (P. mccoskeri). Male carpenter’s flasher wrasses are usually redish orange to yellow with a yellow to white underside. The dorsal rays are prolonged, and the fish’s color deepens during courtship. Males are slightly larger than females, which are generally paler in color and almost entirely white ventrally.\nIn terms of husbandry, the filamented flasher wrasse and the carpenter’s flasher wrasse (and McCoskeri flasher wrasse, for that matter) are very similar. They should be placed in an aquarium of at least 30 gallons (larger if you intend to keep a group) that has plenty of live rock. If you are going to keep a small group (which is recommended), add the females first; otherwise add them all at the same time. Most wrasses appreciate a sandy substrate.\nAlthough shy at first, both species should readily accept a captive diet of varied foods including meaty bits of marine flesh such as raw table shrimp, squid, clam, and mussel. Supplement this with some type of herbivorous food such as a flake food formulated for herbivores or seaweed strips like Sea Veggies or nori. Nearly all will readily take commercially prepared pellet food and frozen food. Having a refugium be part of the filtration on a flasher wrasse tank is an excellent idea, as their metabolism is quite high, and a mature refugium will provide a constant food supply. Otherwise, plan to feed your flasher wrasses a little bit, often.\nHusbandry: Reproduction & Flashing\n“One of the biggest questions we get about flasher wrasses is will my male flasher wrasse flash?” says Mark Martin, director of marine ornamental research at Blue Zoo Aquatics. “Flasher wrasse males will flash—or become what some call ‘supermales’—in the presence of females OR other males of similar species. Keeping males of similar species together, such as a male Carpenter’s and a male McCoskeri, is actually a trick that we recommend for both flasher and fairy wrasses.”\nMartin’s advice is particularly useful for species where it is difficult to acquire females. “Often time the females are not collected,” says Martin. “If you have one male in a tank by itself, it will eventually lose its color. So, we will recommend people buy another male so that they keep each other brightly colored.” Do be aware that these fishes do change sex (from female to male) based on social hierarchy. In a group of females, the dominant individual will most likely become a male.\nFlasher wrasses from the genus Paracheilinus generally-speaking make excellent tropical marine aquarium fishes. They are almost as alluring as anthias but don’t have the same dietary needs; they are as pretty as parrotfishes but remain aquarium-sized; and they are as dynamic as shoaling damsels but without the aggression. Given the proper habitat and care, it’s hard to ask for more in a relatively hardy reef fish.\nPublished 17 June 2008. © Blue Zoo Aquatics"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:07f303f2-c94e-4e43-b418-11f9bdb7f32f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm planning a cross-country train trip - how do high-speed passenger trains differ from freight trains in terms of speed capabilities and track requirements?","answer":"High-speed passenger trains and freight trains have significant differences in both speed and track requirements. Passenger trains can reach much higher speeds - for example, the Acela Express in North America reaches 155 mph, while freight locomotives typically have top speeds of 65-70 mph. The track requirements also differ substantially - high-speed passenger lines can use steeper gradients up to 3.5% due to their excellent power-to-weight ratio, while freight services need shallower gradients. Additionally, the curved sections of track are designed differently - high-speed lines use elevated outer rails (called 'cant') optimized for passenger train speeds around 300 kph, which causes excessive rail wear when slower freight trains use the same tracks.","context":["Trains have been around since the beginning of the 19th century, and are responsible for most of the economic growth in countries throughout the world. Since their beginning, technology has evolved to allow trains to travel at record high speeds.\nSo, how fast do trains go? In North America, the fastest train, the Acela Express, reaches speeds of 155 mph, in Europe, the French TGV and German ICE travels at a speed of 186 mph (300 klm). In Asia, the Japanese Shinkansen travels at a speed of 200 mph.\nTrain speeds vary from around the globe, as many factors contribute to the allowable train speeds. Asia has the fastest trains, as it is famous for its high speed and efficient operations.\n|French TGV||Revenue: 200 mph\nRecord: 357.2 mph\n|Japanese Shinkansen||Revenue: 200-224 mph\nRecord: 275.3 mph\n|Eurostar||186 mph (300 kp/h)|\n|Intercity Express (ICE)||220 mph (350 kp/h)|\nCapable of 220 mph\n|RENFE AVE Train||193 mph (310 km/h)|\nIn the early 20th century, North America had some of the fastest trains in the world. Commanded by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Reading Company, and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey (CNJ), these railroads sped throughout the northeast and out to Chicago at speeds of over 100 mph. Some of the most lucrative routes were to the Jersey shore, where the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading raced each other to Atlantic City, NJ, the two routes in view of each other for miles.\nBeginning in the 1930s, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy (CB&Q), began experimenting with their streamlined “Pioneer Zephyr” train sets. These were diesel powered train sets built by Budd in an effort to replace the steam powered passenger trains in their fleet. The train entered revenue service in 1934 and began revenue service between Kansas City and Omaha, at speeds of up to 112 mph. This was effectively the first diesel streamliner in the United States. Although the Pioneer Zephyr was successful, it was soon replaced by the EMD E-series of locomotives.\nBecause of the success and efficiency of high speed trains in Asia, the U.S. government decided to determine whether or not a similar system could be implemented in the U.S., as several high trafficked corridors would prove viable candidates. In the 1990s, Amtrak began looking at the prospect of a high speed train on their lucrative Northeast Corridor route, which is the densely crowded route between Boston and Washington D.C. Amtrak began experimenting with high speed train sets, such as the German ICE and the Swedish ABB X2000.\nEventually, Amtrak settled on a design by Bombardier, who would build twenty train sets for the corridor. Extensive upgrades had to be made in order for the route to accept the new trains, such as improving track infrastructure, as well as electrifying the portion of the route to Boston. The Acela sets are able to travel at speeds of 220 mph, however, infrastructure along the route only allows for 125 mph running for most of the journey, with an exception being made for a portion of track in Rhode Island, where 155 mph running is permitted.\nIn the late seventies, Via Rail Canada began proposing the idea of a high speed train in Canada. However, electrification would prove rather costly, and was not feasible during the time. Thus, VIA turned to Quebec’s Bombardier to construct 31 tilting Light Rapid Comfortable (LRC) train sets which would operate on the Quebec City- Windsor Corridor until 2001, when the LRC locomotives were retired from service, however, the passenger cars remain in use, albeit without their tilt system activated.\nThese train sets were capable of 130 mph running, however, due to traveling on the same route as freight, it was reduced to 100 mph. Additionally, for a short time in the early eighties, Amtrak tested these locomotives on their un-electrified New York-Boston Corridor, however, found them inadequate for their services and were returned in 1982.\nNorth America encompasses a vast freight rail network that is the largest in the world, as thousands of freight trains move about the continent daily. Oftentimes, the top speed of a freight locomotive is either 65-70 mph, which is commonplace with most modern locomotives. However, there are many factors that contribute to the speed of freight traffic, such as track and signal infrastructure, and presence of grade crossings and bridges, which constitutes the average speed of freight trains being just 21.5 mph. For example, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) limits freight trains to 49 mph, in territory that lacks block signaling, also known as “dark territory”. The FRA has established a set speed limit for each class of track for both freight and passenger traffic. Additionally, these speed limits and class systems are the same in Canada.\n|Class of Track||Freight Traffic||Passenger Traffic|\n|Excepted||Less than 10 mph||Not permitted|\n|Class 1||10 mph||15 mph|\n|Class 2||25 mph||30mph|\n|Class 3||40 mph||60 mph|\n|Class 4||60 mph||80 mph|\n|Class 5||80 mph||90 mph|\n|Class 6||110 mph||110 mph|\n|Class 7||125 mph||125 mph|\n|Class 8||160 mph||160 mph|\n|Class 9||220 mph||220 mph|\nInformation courtesy Federal Railroad Administration\nEuropean countries have always commanded a vast and advanced high speed rail network. The German Intercity Express (ICE), has been traveling at speeds of up to 200 mph since its introduction into service in 1985. The ICE train network encompasses one of the vastest routes in Europe, completing various international routes daily. The ICE trains are operated by Siemens Velaro train sets, which are widely utilized by various railway companies worldwide.\nAnother renowned European high speed network, France’s TGV, reaches speeds of up to 200 mph. On a record setting run in 2007, a modified TGV duplex train dubbed “V150”, reached 357.2 mph on the LGV Est between Paris-Strasbourg. Although this test successful shattered any previous records, the TGV operates its revenue services at 200 mph.\nFreight train speeds in Europe vary, as each country has cited its own regulations due to locomotive and rail car capability, as well as infrastructure integrity. In the United Kingdom, the fastest freight trains classified as Class 4, can reach speeds of up to 75 mph. While in Germany, freight trains reach speeds of up to 99 mph (160 kp/h) for lighter freight trains, and 74.5 mph (120 kp/h) for heavier trains.\nAt one time France commanded the world’s fastest freight trains, as seven TGV Sud-Est sets were converted to transport overnight freight and mail in 1984. Called the “TGV La Poste” after the country’s mail carrier, the trains traveled at speeds of up to 168 mph (270 kp/h). However, due to operational and logistical changes, the overnight mail was to be transported via containers, effectively marking the end of the TGV La Poste service.\nAsia encompasses perhaps the quickest and most efficient passenger rail travel in the world. China and Japan, known for their high speed trains, have perfected their logistics and operations. In China, there are various high speed rail lines connecting the country’s most populous areas. High speed passenger rail in China is considered to be a line that is dedicated to the high speed train sets, and are to travel at no less than speeds of 155 mph.\nAs high speed rail in China has continued to evolve, technologically advanced train sets and infrastructure improvements are at the forefront of the continuation of the services. Furthermore, China’s Beijing-Guangzhou Railway is the longest railway in the world, measuring in at 1,428 miles (2,298 km).\nPerhaps the most advanced and punctual high speed rail system is in Japan. The Shinkansen, operated by Japanese Railways, is known for its on-time performance and world class speed shuffles commuters around the country at speeds of up to 200 mph (320 kp/h). The Skinkansen is also known for its record shattering run in 1996, reaching the speed of 275 mph. Punctuality on the Shinkansen is held to the highest caliber, as the services are rarely late, and when they do stray from the set schedule, it is only by mere seconds.\nRail freight in Japan is usually hauled in the evening hours, and travels at speeds of up to 68 mph (110 kp/h), which is usually achieved by intermodal or container trains. Japan Railways freight has developed a tank wagon for crude oil and gasoline that will be able to travel at speeds of up to 59 mph (110 kp/h), a vast improvement from previous examples. (Japan Railway & Transport Review)\nWhat Makes High Speed Rail Successful?\nHigh speed rail systems are successful because of the dedicated track allotted for their operation, as their speed is not hindered by slower local trains and other rail traffic. Furthermore, the proper track and signal infrastructure must be implemented to allow high speed running. Additionally, technologically advanced train sets with tilting mechanisms are imperative for banking into turns that normal trains would not be able to achieve at speed. As technology continues to advance, and train speeds continue to increase, the future of the world’s high speed rail network looks bright.","The most significant difference between high speed passenger trains and freight services is – of course – speed. When passenger and freight services wish to share the same tracks, you have to consider both the technical aspects and the capacity issues.\nWhen designing a new high-speed line, the minimum radius of the curves will be determined by the desired line-speed. In order to minimise rail wear, and provide a smooth and comfortable ride for the passengers, the outer rail of the pair of tracks is usually elevated above the level of the inside rail. This is known as “cant”, and in Europe it is usually measured in degrees, i.e. the angle of elevation of one rail above the other. In US terminology, “cant” is known as “cross level” and it is measured as a height difference, rather than an angle.\nPut simply, the theoretical aim is to achieve a balance between the centripetal force of the train being pushed outwards around the curve, and the gravitational force pulling it inwards, at the speed at which the passenger train will normally transit that section of track. If the track designer achieves this, then the train ride will be smooth, and the wear on both the rails and the wheelsets of the train will be minimized.\nIt gets much more complicated if you add freight trains into the equation. Whereas the passenger train might be travelling at 300 kph or more, the freight train is likely to be travelling at 120 kph or even less. So when the freight train tries to go around this curve, the wheel flanges will be continually grinding at the lower rail head, as the gravitational force pulling the train downwards greatly exceeds the centripetal force, because of the lower speed. The result is significant rail wear, and the need to inspect and replace rails much more frequently.\nAnother technical issue is the design of the trackbed drainage. When building a new line, it is necessary to consider the consequences of any derailment which might release hazardous goods into the environment. So the drainage of the line has to include catch ponds to prevent any such spillage from entering the public drainage system. However if you design for passenger trains only, the issue of dangerous goods does not arise, so this element of the infrastructure design can removed from the plans.\nWhen designing a line purely for high speed passenger trains, you can use steeper gradients because of the excellent power:weight ratio of the rolling stock. Gradients as steep as 3.5% can be used. This is too steep for heavy freight services, particularly if they are to run at sensible speeds (both for commercial and operational reasons). If the line is passenger only it can be designed to follow the contours of the countryside more closely, whereas a line designed for freight will require shallower gradients, and therefore higher bridges and deeper cuttings.\nThe big difference in speed between a high speed passenger train and a freight train means that trying to run both together on the same line at the same time consumes a huge amount of capacity. With a modern signalling system such as ETCS Level 2, you can run successive trains at intervals as low as 3 minutes, even at speeds in excess of 300 kph. Imagine you have a freight train in a siding, waiting to join the main line, with the next place it can be looped being some 50 km distant. A non-stop passenger train will cover that distance in just 10 minutes, whereas the freight train will take 45 minutes or more, maybe over an hour depending upon the weight, maximum speed, and type of locomotive. So to run a freight train you would need a gap of at least 40 minutes in the passenger service – maybe more. With the signalling enabling a path every 3 minutes, that means in this example 1 freight path equals 13 passenger paths! Would the freight operator pay for 13 passenger train paths in order to move his train? I don’t expect so!\nYou can overcome this to some extent by changing the use of the route according to time of day. For example, in Germany the Hannover to Würzburg line is used for passenger services between 05:30 and 23:00, and freight services overnight. Similarly in England the line from the Channel Tunnel to London is used by some freight services overnight, when no Eurostar international passenger trains or “Javelin” domestic express passenger trains are running.\nOne other option to consider is moving high value parcels traffic in specially-adapted high speed trains. In France, SNCF do this with their “TGV Postale” sets, which move letters and parcels traffic between Paris and Lyon at speeds which match the passenger services. Of course this requires investment in specialist equipment and rolling stock, but it does neatly overcome the issue of trying to obtain capacity for this specific type of freight during the hours of daytime passenger train operation.\nSo it is possible to run both freight and passenger on a high speed line? Yes, provided the line is specifically designed to accept them both from the outset, and provided the capacity can be split in such a way that the two different types of train have minimal interaction. However, running freight on a high speed line involves a significant number of compromises, some with big price tags attached, so it is not to be considered as a “free gift”.\nCategories: Railway Infrastructure"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2601d0bc-98ee-4d6c-bad2-641e1e31dd66>","<urn:uuid:7d4027a6-a1bd-451f-9dd4-7b6d51c7bd71>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are proximal cues in seasonal biological changes and how do they work in desert environments?","answer":"Proximal cues are environmental triggers like rain, temperature, and social cues that directly affect the onset of annual biological events like reproductive maturation, hibernation, or migration. In unpredictable desert environments, organisms remain in constant readiness for these cues. For example, desert finches in Australia are always receptive to proximal cues - when it rains, they can mate and lay eggs within just a day or two.","context":["This post (click on the icon) was originally written on May 07, 2005, introducing the topic of neuroendocrine control of seasonal changes in physiology and behavior.\nSo far, I have directed all my attention to daily – circadian – rhythms, and pretty much ignored other rhythms that correspond to other cycles in nature. Another obvious cycle in nature is the procession of seasons during a year.\nJust as an environment during the day is different from the same environment during the night and thus requires different adaptations for survival, so the winter environment and the summer environment present very different problems for an organism’s physiology to solve. If one thinks of the circadian clock as a relay timer that orchestrates switching on the “night adapatations” in the evening and “day adaptations” in the morning, then what mechanism plays an analogous role over the course of a year?\nThere are a number of obvious changes in the environment that occur as a year progresses. It is cold in the winter and hot in the summer. It snows in the winter, and there is a lot of rain during spring and fall. It is easy to find food during the warm season, but very difficult during the winter. It makes sense that organisms would evolve physiological mechanisms that allow them to allocate energy-expensive and risky activities (e.g., reproduction, parenting) to the times of the year when food and cover are abundant, while switching to a more energy-saving mode in the winter.\nIt also seems wise to be able to predict changes before they happen: not starting a big reproductive effort while the weather is good if it is going to turn cold and nasty just at the time the young are born. Interestingly, it has been found that many mammalian species harbor a subset of individuals that do not respond to seasonal cues – they are quite capable of breeding during the winter. This is an evolutionarily risky strategy, but the pay-off is large whenever the winter is particularly mild. Such non-responsiveness has been studied in a number of species, particularly white-footed mice, and was easily artificially bred in Japanese quail.\nOne such mechanism for governing biological seasonality is the circannual clock (or “calendar”). In many organisms (even when kept in constant conditions in the laboratory), certain events, e.g., reproductive maturation and behavior, occur with a precise rhythm whose period is close to (usually a little shorter than) 365 days. Not much is known about the physiology of circannual rhythms, though. Deletion of the SCN in rodents does not eliminate circannual rhythms, for instance, suggesting that circannual clock is a separate mechanism from the circadian clock and is also located elsewhere in the brain or body of the animal.\nFreerunning circannual rhythms have periods too different from 365 days to be accurate on their own. They have to be entrained to the actual year, in a manner similar to the way circadian rhythms need to be entrained to the day/night schedule. Circadian rhythms can be entrained by a large variety of cues (e.g., temperature cycles, noise, social cues, cycles of magnetic field changes, barometric pressure cycles, etc.), but by far the strongest cue is light. Changes of light intensity over the course of 24 hours are the universally most-utilized entraining agents in nature, because they have the greatest predictive power: no other cue is as reliable. How about circannual rhythms?\nDepending on the geographic region, a number of environmental cues serve as dominant triggers for annual physiological changes. Rain (e.g., monsoons), temperature and social cues can trigger reproductive maturation and behavior, entry into hibernation, or start of annual migration. These cues are sometimes called “proximal cues” as they more or less directly affect the onset of annual biological events. However, the proximal cues can only work if the organism is already ‘prepared’ for them.\nIn very unpredictable environments, e.g., in deserts in which it may not rain for years, the organisms are at a constant readiness – always receptive to proximate cues. A well known example is a finch living in deserts of Australia. When it rains, it is ready to mate and lays eggs within a day or two.\nIn almost constant environments, e.g., at the poles and at the equator, the plants and animals may follow freerunning circannual rhythms. For instance, elephant seals have a breeding season every ten months, thus falling in a different month every year.\nIn most areas of the planet, however, there are sharp and predictable changes between the seasons. The “ultimate cue” that prepares the body for the emergence of proximal cues is the gradual change in daylength – photoperiod.\nUnlike fluctuations in temperature, humidity, or even light-intensity, photoperiod is a reliable cue. On March 21st of EVERY year, photoperiod is LD 12:12. At any latitude, the photoperiod is always exactly the same on the same date of the year. No other cue can come close to matching such precision. Thus, it is not surprising that almost all organisms, even those living on the equator and the poles, are capable of responding to changes in daylength, at least in the laboratory. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) – or “Winter Blues” – in humans is thought to be a response to changes in photoperiod. It is not cold weather that makes you depressed in winter, it is the short days and long nights.\nIn many organisms circannual rhythms are too weak, or even undetectable, to be able to drive a seasonal rhythm of responsiveness to the environment, let alone a rhythm of actual behavior. Still, no matter if the circannual rhythm is robust, weak, or undetectable, changes in photoperiod are capable of entraining (robust) or directly driving (weak) circannual rhythms.\nNext couple of posts will focus on the phenomenon of photoperiodism and what we have learned about the mechanisms organisms use to translate changes in daylength into seasonal biological events. You should not be surprised that evolution used an existing timer – the circadian clock – to measure the length of the day.

While composting reduces landfill waste and creates beneficial soil products, there are microbial risks to consider. Studies show that while proper composting eliminates most pathogens, additional research is needed to determine the fate of spore-forming bacteria and prion agents in the process.","context":["Organic composting is the approach of recycling natural product and even food waste into a kind of \"black dirt\" that can be used to promote soil preservation. A garden compost business can improve the total health of your garden and yard. This procedure gets rid of both the important nutrients found in our breaking down waste or food scraps and microbes simplify to be made use of in the soil. As an outcome, you will discover that your plants, vegetables, trees and flowers tend to grow more rapidly and become more resistant.\nIn addition to the advantages that it supplies the garden, natural composting helps to lower the amount of trash that ends up in garbage dumps, making this approach an especially viable option for those who are concerned about the damage that our natural supplies are taking on our environment. Since it is made from organic product, you can be specific that you are not contributing to the damage of our environment when you make usage of this method.\nWhat does an organic composting business do in a different way than the typical backyard composting lover?\nThere are a few various things, and among the most essential is that they work towards a focus on being ecologically responsible - indicating that instead of utilizing materials that have actually been treated with chemicals to aid with decomposition (often in the kind of fertilizer, or perhaps left in the soil for a longer time period), they compost their materials with materials that have actually been neglected in the open and free of any additives.\nThere are a variety of various locations where you can discover a Composting Service in your community. Depending on the size and appeal of your neighborhood, you may have to locate numerous services prior to finding one that you want to use. Prior to contacting any companies though, you should ensure that they follow great sanitation practices so that you will be able to recycle all of the waste that they produce. After all, it is not only your own personal health that is at threat but the health of others also.\nWhat is the factor for composting? It is a technique of recycling the organic waste materials that can otherwise end up as some kind of strong fertilizer in land fills, and is an all natural approach of decay that likewise consists of the decayed plant and animal matter. The procedure of decay requires the breakdown of plant product, animal material, human waste items and other organic matter that can not be classified as 'fertilizer'. This raw material breaks down into humus (also known as sludge), which is transported through the composting load to the central composting chamber, from where it will be broken down even more into nutrient-rich humus.\nIf you are looking for a new method to get rid of your garden waste, choosing to start composting is a terrific alternative. The composting process not just helps in reducing landfill waste but also has a favorable environmental effect by reducing the quantity of natural deposits such as wood, coal, and farming chemicals that are required to develop brand-new gardens.\nThroughout the standard composting process, waste material, such as veggie peelings, grass clippings, coffee premises, and eggshells, are decayed into nutrient-rich humus. The resulting garden compost is a completely natural, healthy item that can be utilized to improve your garden, flower bed, yard, and plants. Compost that is abundant in beneficial microbes and other microbes motivates the development of beneficial germs and fungi. These practical organisms break down natural materials, producing the nutrient-rich compost that plants need to grow.","|Berge, Anna Catharina - WASHINGTON STATE UNIV|\n|Glanville, Thomas - IOWA STATE UNIV|\n|Klingborg, Donald - UNIV OF CALIFORNIA|\nSubmitted to: Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association\nPublication Type: Peer Reviewed Journal\nPublication Acceptance Date: November 11, 2008\nPublication Date: January 1, 2009\nRepository URL: http://hdl.handle.net/27173\nCitation: Berge, A.B., Glanville, T.D., Millner, P.D., Klingborg, D.J. 2009. A review of methods and microbial risks associated with composting of animal carcasses in the United States. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 234:47-56. Interpretive Summary: Most livestock and poultry production operations result in few mortalities, particularly with young animals or birds. In cases of epidemics or adverse weather, large numbers of mortalities may occur within a short period of time. Whatever the cause or extent, all mortalities must be managed to reduce pathogens and their spread, to protect the environment, and to reduce negative aesthetic impacts. Typical options for dealing with carcasses have included: Rendering, Composting, Incineration, Landfilling, and Burial (in soil or pits). The latter three options are increasingly limited. Furthermore, in situations involving catastrophic mortalities, existing rendering capacity may be exceeded. For these reasons, carcass composting, when properly conducted, has been used in many places in the U.S. to successfully manage on-farm animal mortalities. Carcass composting differs from composting manure and green waste because carcasses are typically composted whole and piles are not turned until self-heating has subsided. The overall strategies for constructing and managing carcass compost piles are described in this report. Based on extensive published results from livestock and poultry carcass composting studies, it is clear that proper composting eliminates most pathogens and reduces the number of spore-forming bacteria, prions, and viruses. The disinfection capacity of carcass composting helps protect public health and the environment by substantially reducing the pathogen load in material that is ultimately land applied. This is an important element in reducing the source of food and water contamination. Soil contaminated with pathogenic bacteria from improperly managed mortalities may contaminate water sources or runoff from pastureland. A risk assessment approach which includes all stages of disposal of animal mortality, such as handling, transportation, processing, storage and disposal, would provide a useful perspective for decision-makers who want to compare composting with other means of mortality management. The information in this report will help inform livestock and poultry producers, scientists, regulators, and others interested in evaluating the use of carcass composting as an animal mortality management and carcass/bedding disinfection tool.\nTechnical Abstract: Animal carcass composting for both routine and emergency management of food animal mortalities is an alternative method of carcass disposal in those situations where conventional methods are inadequate. Carcass composting has been referred to as ‘above ground burial in a bio-filter with pathogen kill by high temperature.’ In most composting systems a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 25:1 to 30:1, moisture content of 50-60 percent and a temperature in the range 43-65°C are considered optimal for supporting the performance of the microorganisms that drive the composting process. Carcass composting differs from composting other materials such as manure and green waste and present some unique challenges. Carcasses are typically composted whole and do not present uniformly chopped substrate for microbial action, nor are these compost piles turned as frequently. Both of these factors contribute to a non-uniform compost composition at the end of the process. While allowances for this non-uniformity need to be made in the criteria, it has been demonstrated that well designed carcass compost systems with proper maintenance and monitoring do result in a safe and efficient method of disposing of animal mortalities with minimal environmental impacts. Studies demonstrate proper composting eliminates most pathogens and reduces spore-forming bacteria, prions and other selected pathogen levels. Additional studies are needed to determine the fate of spore-forming bacteria and prion agents in carcass composting. Regulatory agencies are encouraged to evaluate carcass composting by using a risk assessment approach which includes all stages of disposal of animal mortality, such as handling, transportation, processing, storage and disposal. Risk comparisons need to account for the sum of risks from the point of death to sequestration or destruction of potential animal mortality threats associated in the various disposal systems under consideration."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dbd32f9e-ad43-4ccb-8aff-eaa5f7bc5a44>","<urn:uuid:5cca6571-a099-4b5e-b673-55370cdeac1a>"],"error":null}

The main antiemetic options include prochlorperazine (which can be taken by mouth, injection, or suppository), ondansetron and granisetron (which can be taken orally or as injections), and metoclopramide (usually given by injection).","context":["Editorial Staff and Contributors\nThe information provided here is meant to give you a general idea about each of the medications listed below. Only the most general side effects are included, so ask your doctor if you need to take any special precautions. Use each of these medications as recommended by your doctor, or according to the instructions provided. If you have further questions about usage or side effects, contact your doctor.\nMedications may help to either prevent or reduce side effects of treatment or to manage certain side effects after they occur. You can develop side effects from the treatment and/or from the cancer itself.

Therefore, filgrastim helps to reduce your risk of infection.\nEpoetin helps your bone marrow to make new red blood cells. Low red blood cell levels can lead to anemia. Therefore, epoetin helps reduce your risk of anemia. Epoetin is effective, but it has a 2-week delay between the injection and when your red blood cell count starts to come back. It is not used as a quick fix for a low red blood cell count. A blood transfusion is usually performed if you need to recover your red blood cell count more quickly.\nBoth filgrastim and epoetin are given by injection in your doctor's office.\nSome specific bacterial infections are associated with lymphomas that affect the stomach, lungs, or intestines. Antibiotics are used to fight the infection. In some cases, it may also help with treating the associated lymphoma. Antibiotics are usually taken by mouth. If the infection is serious, they can be given by IV. For some infections, a combination of antibiotics may work best. Talk to your doctor if you are or think you are pregnant, or breastfeeding.

{"question":"What are the steps by which misleading information can alter someone's memory of an event?","answer":"Memory becomes vulnerable to modification through a specific process: First, time needs to pass, allowing the original memory to fade. In this weakened state, the memory becomes defenseless against misinformation. Then, misleading post-event information can be introduced through various means, such as hearsay or discussions with others who experienced the same event. People often fill in gaps by guessing, which can lead to significant alterations in recall - for instance, studies have shown people can remember a clean-shaven person as having a mustache or straight hair as being curly.","context":["Psychology's fascination with memory and its imperfections dates back further than we can remember. The first careful experimental studies of memory were published in 1885 by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, and tens of thousands of memory studies have been conducted since. What has been learned, and what might the future of memory be?\nSome researchers believe that memories can be repressed and later recovered--the stuff that movies and lawsuits are made of-while most insist that memory is imperfect, creative and highly vulnerable to suggestion. If some of our memories are actually \"false,\" how can we know which are true? And given that our very identity is determined by our memories, can we be sure who we really are if we can't be sure of our memories?\nTechnology seems to be changing just about everything these days. Can it ultimately change how human memory works? Two experts from the University of Washington in Seattle, Elizabeth Loftus and William Calvin, got together recently to review and speculate. Loftus, perhaps the world's leading expert on memory malleability, is a professor of psychology and adjunct professor of law. She has written 18 books, including Eyewitness Testimony, The Myth of Repressed Memory, and her prophetic 1980 Memory. William Calvin, a renowned expert on the brain, is an affiliate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Calvin's recent books include How Brains Think, The Cerebral Code and Lingua ex Machina. Here are highlights of their discussion.\nELIZABETH LOFTUS: A flimsy curtain separates memory from imagination. Suggestions, strong and subtle, can make people believe that they had experiences in childhood that they almost certainly did not have.\nWILLIAM CALVIN: Yes, we've long known how false memories can be created. Human memory is always having to contend with the power of suggestion. After all, most happenings aren't \"good stories\" that fit our narrative expectations, so with retelling they get \"improved.\"\nEL: But who is most susceptible to \"adopting\" a memory? And who is most resistant? There ought to be a lot of individual variability in the susceptibility to false memories. Maybe it correlates with genetics, intelligence and other individual differences. Perhaps we'll develop recipes for what works with various personality types.\nWC: Who am I, if not my memories--and if they're not mine, what does that say about me? It must be threatening to a lot of people, to think that their memories aren't their own.\nEL: Memory is creative. There, I've said it all.\nWC: But human memory isn't supposed to be creative. Facts are facts, and the past is finished. So when memory scrambles things, you get annoyed.\nEL: I was very annoyed when my laptop's RAM started to shuffle the files on my hard disk. I was amazed that it could be fixed, just by removing the memory.\nWC: You might think that computer memory would be a useful analogy for how human memory works. And, to some extent, it is. At first, human memory seems to be a lot like the computer's three versions: type-ahead buffer, RAM and hard disk. We, too, have a sensory buffer called immediate memory, usually seen as a ghostly image of a flashbulb, rather like the keyboard's type-ahead buffer. And we also have working memory, part of which is a short-term memory store much like the computer's RAM. It is also as volatile, because its contents can be lost following a concussion or seizure. The \"consolidation\" of episodic human memories is a lot like transferring files from RAM to a new file on the hard disk. In humans, the process takes days or weeks to complete, most likely because you have to strengthen synapses into a new pattern.\nEL: Unfortunately, the analogy ends there. And, as the adage says, \"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\"\nWC: The big difference is that the human brain has no pigeonholes for data, like RAM. Human memory is cluttered. Memories don't get lost so much as they become distorted or hard to find. We may like to say that we've lost something--but often, an hour later, it pops uninvited into our consciousness, where it has been lurking all along. The serious difference between computer and human memory is that we don't pop out a pristine copy of the original event, the way a computer does. Instead, we reconstruct things as best we can from all the clutter. We guess. Often that isn't good enough, especially for a fair judicial process. Or just one's self respect, it's embarrassing to be badly wrong and we'll deny an error even to ourselves.\nEL: Twenty years ago, I tried predicting memory's future. It was back in the days before eyewitness fallibility and \"recovered\" memories became the stuff of courtroom contests. I imagined a future world in which people could go to a special kind of psychologist or psychiatrist--a memory doctor--and have their memories modified. Little did I know.\nWC: Just shows you that expertise does not equal foresight. Even you didn't foresee who the \"memory doctors\" of today would turn out to be, or how reckless they'd become. Or how our own state legislature would pave the way for them. Washington state was the first to waive the statute of limitations for \"recovered memories\" during the do-something panic over child abuse.\nEL: Well, decades ago, there was ample evidence that our memories of past events can change in helpful ways, leading us to be happier than we might otherwise be. But memory also changes in harmful ways and can occasionally land us--or others--in serious trouble. On the therapeutic side, I imagine a person could have some particularly difficult memory altered. If a patient was plagued by feelings of deep sadness or worthlessness, I suppose the memory doctor might modify the memories leading to the feelings. For example, if the patient was having marital problems, the memory doctor might enhance pleasant memories involving the spouse. On a grander scale, such doctors might even be useful for curing societal ills such as social prejudice. Prejudice can be, for example, based in part on a few incidents involving a unique group of people, so the memory doctor could wipe out or alter memory of these incidents. Memory doctors would be nearly omnipotent. They would hold the key to total mind control.\nWC: It would be a customized form of book burning. While a lot of people would have serious reservations about this, I can see some consumers loving it.\nEL: Scores of studies on memory distortion had been conducted. People recalled a clean-shaven man as having a mustache, and even straight hair as curly. This showed that misleading post-event information can alter a person's recollection in powerful, predictable ways. In the real world, such misinformation is often available via hearsay or when people, who experience the same event, talk to one another and fill in gaps by guessing.\nAfter years of investigation about the power of misinformation, researchers knew a fair amount about the conditions that made people susceptible to its damage. People were particularly prone to having their memories modified when the passage of time first allows the memory to fade. In its faded, weakened condition, memory becomes defenseless to misinformation.\nWC: So all of that was known, long before the boom in \"recovered memories\" hit the courtrooms?\nEL: Definitely. And we researchers would never have guessed that such a prospector version of the memory specialist was in the making. But they were. \"Repressed memory therapists\" went out and prospected for early childhood memories of trauma. \"Are you sure you weren't abused?\"\nIn the process they appear to have inadvertently created false memories of the worst sort in some of their clients. This is not to say that there haven't been many thousands of genuine cases of child abuse. Psychotherapy has surely been a comfort to many victims. But the aggressive use of memory work led some patients to false memories of child molestation, ones that were a blend of dreams and movies, made real only by suggestion. In some cases, what surfaced were violent traumas spanning years of the patient's life. If these were false memories, the patient was surely being harmed.\nWC: Even with the best intentions and the best of precautions, the cure is sometimes worse than the disease. When the therapist is ill-informed, it happens even more often.\nEL: So where do we think the field of memory is going now?\nWC: Better research ideas can happen anytime, but what's more predictable is the applied technology and its legal ramifications, lust remember what fingerprint and other physical evidence standards did to the former reliance on sweating a confession out of a suspect, with all its hazards of suggesting a nonexistent memory. Once webcams become ubiquitous, they too will reduce the number of times that the unsupported word has to decide things.\nEL: Webcams in preschools are truly amazing. We're raising a whole generation used to being \"on camera.\" There's a new video monitoring system in which parents can go into a web browser, enter a password, and have access to a live video feed of their child in daycare at any time, no matter where in the world they tap into the Internet. Check once, or watch all day from a little window in one corner of your computer screen at work. The idea does have its drawbacks: Overprotective parents can check compulsively. Other parents can watch your child misbehaving. Maybe they'll sue you, too, if the video file shows your Johnny hitting their Susie.\nWC: The novelist David Brin explores the possible effects of tiny cameras mounted in your eyeglass frames in one of his novels. \"Peepers,\" he called them, and depicted disgusted adults using them to record misbehaving youths riding on public transit.\nEL: A publicly supported surveillance trend began in Britain nearly 20 years ago. They installed 60 remote-controlled video cameras at various \"trouble spots.\" Where they put them, crime dropped by half.\nWC: Just think what ubiquitous webcams and eyeglass cams will do to make the public aware of what the eyewitness memory researchers have been saying all along: Eyewitnesses are often badly mistaken, after some time has passed. The public is used to the instant replays to prove the referee wrong on occasion. Soon we'll have a courtroom industry devoted to mining video files, just to supplement eyewitness testimony. Just as DNA has changed the standards of evidence for rape convictions, the webcams and email archives will change the standards for all sorts of things.\nEL: The Webcam is already small and inexpensive, with a price tag of less than a hundred dollars. Most popular are the property-surveillance devices. You can check on your vacation home via a simple phone call. But you can also broadcast your video monitor over the web so anyone can look.\nWC: And there will be automatic face recognition. A display on your eyeglasses might allow you to view the results of a database search. The person's name would be flashed on the inside of your eyeglasses. When you ask, \"What is her name?\" the traditional limitations of human memory will be transcended.\nEL: So what's the next decade of memory therapy going to be like? Psychotherapy with a pharmaceutical booster? I can envision 21st-century memory doctors helping clients with their academic performance by prescribing additives for the coffee they drink before an upcoming test. They might even begin their psychotherapy sessions with a drug that enhances the malleability of memory, making the patient more susceptible to positive suggestions that occur later in their session.\nWC: More of human memory will move offline. We'll rely more on digital storehouses full of video and audio files of our lives. It'll happen because digital storage is cheap--and hopefully because we also realize how unreliable human memory can be. Maybe some of the storehouses will be portable, like today's music for joggers, and will provide you with help in remembering people and places.\nEL: But when we do get the false memory recipes down pat, we'll be left with critical questions. Who controls that technology? What brakes should be imposed on police, lawyers, advertisers and others who try to manipulate people using these findings? When memory creation technology becomes readily available, how will society protect itself from misuse? We'll need to constantly keep in mind that memory, like liberty, is a fragile thing.\nREAD MORE ABOUT IT\nThe Myth of Repressed Memory Elizabeth Loftus and Katherine Ketcham.

{"question":"How does personal responsibility factor into safety practices in medieval combat training versus industrial construction work, and what protective equipment is required in each context?","answer":"In medieval combat training, individuals are personally responsible for judging received blows and their own fitness level, while carrying 20-25 kilos of equipment including padding and armor. They must use proper protective gear like groin protection, leather boots, knee pads, and elbow pads. In construction work, employers have a duty of care and must provide workers with personal protective equipment including helmets to prevent injuries from falling objects, safety glasses, puncture-resistant work boots, and appropriate gloves. Both activities require proper training - combat participants need authorization and must learn proper techniques, while construction workers need specific training for equipment operation and hazardous material handling. Both contexts emphasize the importance of proper protective gear and individual compliance with safety protocols.","context":["Welcome to the Canton of Dragon’s Bay information page on local martial activities.\nWhile our combat related activities are still developing, the good news is that what we do is compatible with the other four groups of the SCA on these western shores, as well as all of Lochac (Australia) and the rest of the world.\nIt should be noted that any Society combat requires you to be authorised and adhere to our behaviour and equipment standards, and all combat must be overseen by authorised Marshals. All pretty normal so far?\nWhat makes us different is that the Marshals on the field while controlling activities and ensuring safety are not there to judge or determine outcomes. Unless safety is compromised in some way, marshals do not interfere and victory or otherwise is determined solely by the person who is struck. The person who does recieve a “good” blow judges that blow on the force delivered, versus the standard type of armour we are all assumed to be wearing and reacts accordingly.\nIt is this system, based on the honour of the participants, that forms the foundation of our martial ethos which is… Chivalry.\nIf this is an ethos with which you can relate and be guided by then please continue.\nSociety combat itself is divided into three major disciplines, and these are Rattan, Archery and Rapier. There are times when we will combine two of these and we have Wars, at which you will see Engineers take the field with their war machines.\nCertainly there is more to our martial activities than you will see on this and the other pages, but to truly understand what we do and aspire to, a person needs to participate. That level of participation is entirely left to the individual to determine and while there are those that train two to three times a week there are also those that may only come along once per year.\nAs with the rest of the Society activities within the Shire of Dragons Bay, you get to decide what is right for or suits you.\nRattan combat is not just about having fun, running around dressed up as knights or medieval soldiers and trying to hit each other with various swords, axes, spears, and poleweapons.\nOkay, so mostly it is, but the essential essence of what we do should always be chivalric combat and our behaviour in combat should always reflect this romantic ideal. Andre de Montsegur once passed on these words of wisdom to me “The SCA is not about reality but a 60’s recreation of a Victorian perception of an Authurian fantasy.”\nPersonally I still can’t find anything wrong with that. If however you reject this as just a fantasy and want to do a recreation of historical combat bear in mind the image of reality is a wonderful thing to copy or recreate, but if you discard the key element of idealism that permeates Victorian, Authurian and period literature then you will lose any semblance of balance between competitiveness and for want of a better term sporting behaviour.\nWhy winning sucks, I will take the time to say this here because too often a fighter will be feted and gain acclaim because they win fights, but winning in Society combat should never be considered as anything other than the temporary good fortune it is. It is far more important to have the respect and trust of the other fighters and also the general populace.\nAnyway for now enough of the reasons why you should be a perfect and genteel ‘knight’ if you are going to participate in rattan combat here a few more tangible pointers.\nThere is the matter of completing the prerequisites and paperwork required by our Laws and insurance requirements before you can join in. Don’t worry if it all seems a bit complicated. The Marshals and senior fighters will be happy to help you out in this area. Also if you are currently under 18 years of age, Lochac Kingdom Law dictates that you must have written permission from a parent or guardian to participate.\nContact the Shire Knight Marshal prior to attending for important information about the above info.\nThe Shire of Dragon’s Bay holds regular fighting sessions, at which informal training occurs. Please see the Calendar for details, or check out the Links & Resources page for other sessions that are nearby. This makes the first step pretty simple get to a training session, watch what we do, ask questions and if it appeals to you talk to the people there about what you need to do next.\nIf you want to get a head start there are a few things you can sort out prior to turning up.\n- Make sure you have groin protection, leather boots, loose fitting pants, a loose fitting shirt, a stout leather belt, and if you already have some knee and elbow pads bring them too.\n- Contact the Shire Knight Marshal to confirm current times and dates and get yourself down to our training session, one of your priorities as a newcomer is to watch and ask questions.\n- If you can try and get hold of some rattan and plywood to make yourself a training sword and shield.\n- Find someone who will either sew for you or better yet teach you how to sew & look at getting a gambeson made.\n- Start saving money.\nIt would be remiss of me if I didn’t mention that you should be prepared. Fighters tend to be an entusiastic lot and circumstances permitting they are very likely to try and put you in armour ‘to have a go’ at the first opportunity that presents. Declining is perfectly okay if you are not ready to do this.\nEach individual is responsible for their own fitness etc, but please be aware that however well distributed over your body you are likely to be carrying an additional 20 to 25 kilos of equipment when fighting and given the padded garments and armour you will get hot.\nChoosing your Kit\nYou may choose to take this combat thing relatively seriously, and go to great lengths to research totally authentic armour, alternatively you may decide to get into some passable armour as quickly as possible so that you can join in the aformentioned running around and hitting people in short order… and of course you may find yourself somewhere in the middle. All of these are just fine, because this is a hobby not an exam or a job, so the whole point is to have fun, and set your own goals.\nAs far as appearances go if it looks medieval at 10′ (3m) it is fine, and here it may be appropriate to mention that one of the greatest strengths of the SCA lies in its ability as a community to accept anybody who makes a reasonable effort to fit into the ambience we try to create at events.\nYour choice of kit can be based on practically anything pre 1600 and known to Europe. If you are not sure where to start something along the lines of the Western European armours circa 1300 – 1400 are relatively easy to pattern or purchase and can get you into combat relatively quickly. This type of armour is relatively simple to reproduce in a basic workshop with minimal tools, you might even decide to purchase the more complex pieces such as knees, elbows or helmets and finish them up as complete armours yourself. It all depends on what you can afford the most of, time or money.\nMaking armour is fun, no particular skills are require to get started, just some enthusiasm and the ability to listen. Figure out what sort of look you want, get some pictures of the way you want it to look and get yourself along to the local armouring meeting or workshop.\nRemember if you are going to fight in your armour check what you want against the SCA rules and your Kingdoms requirements before committing your resources. Which neatly brings us back to one of your priority as a new member, ask questions.","Construction is a high hazard industry with a wide range of activities like new constructions, renovations, and or alterations. BanvilleLaw.com also mentions that a state like New York has been an industrial capital since founding days, and sees a lot of construction activity. The accident fatality rate in this industry stands at more than double the average of all sectors. In short, construction sites can be safety nightmares: conceivable hazards exist almost everywhere in the working environment.\nFortunately, the hazards associated with the construction industry are well known, and most responsible employers know that they owe a duty of care to employees, visitors and other people who might be affected by their activities. The employer is tasked to manage the construction site effectively and implement appropriate accident control measures.\nSix Common Construction Site Hazards\nFollowing are various hazards that are present in the construction industry and the safety regulations attached to some of these hazards.\nEvery year falls account for the highest number of deaths in the construction industry. The fall protection fines amounted to over $30 million in 2015 alone from over 6,000 sites in the United States. There are several factors that come into play with this hazard, including unstable working surfaces, failure or misuse of protection equipment, and human error. Researchers have shown that using fall arrest systems, guardrails, covers, safety nets and restraint systems can effectively prevent injuries and death from falls.\n- Erect guardrail systems with strong toe boards and warning lines. Or simply install a computerized system to protect workers near the edge of the roof and floors\n- Use aerial lifts or high platforms to offer safe elevated working surfaces\n- Use personal fall arrest systems or safety net systems\n- Cover floor holes\nAbout $ 6 million of the total fines issued by Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) to construction companies in 2015 was mainly attributed to ladder safety. OSHA estimates that there about 25,000 injuries and as many as 40 fatalities annually due to falls from ladders and stairways used in construction. In fact, most of these injuries required time off the job.\n- Have a competent person inspect all the ladders before use Use the right ladder for the task\n- Make sure the ladder is of appropriate height to reach the work area\n- Never load ladders beyond the manufacturer's rated capacity\n- Mark or tag defective ladders for replacement or repair\n- Avoid metal ladders near overhead power lines or electrical works\n3. Bodily Injuries\nSerious injuries can occur to your body when it exposed to hazardous materials and equipment that may cause injuries or illness. As an employer, you must provide your employees with personal protective gear, including clothing and other work gear designed to create a barrier against workplace dangers as specified by OSHA.\n- Ensure all construction workers wear helmets to prevent injuries from falling objects\n- Ensure employees wear safety glasses or face shields whenever work operation can force objects in their eyes\n- Ensure workers wear work boots that are puncture and slip resistant\n- Ensure workers wear the correct gloves for the job\nApproximately 2.5 million construction workers regularly work on scaffolds. According to OSHA, preventing these scaffold accidents would reduce an estimated 5,000 injuries and more than 50 fatalities from occurring every year.\n- Unstable objects like boxes, barrels, loose concrete or bricks should not be used to support scaffolds\n- The scaffold must be rigid and good enough to carry its own weight plus five times the intended load without displacement or settling\n- The scaffold must be equipped with high-quality mid-rails, guardrails, and toe-boards\n- The scaffold should not be moved, dismantled, re-erected or altered except under the authority and supervision of a competent person\n- The scaffold must be at least 10 feet from live electric power lines at any time Inspect synthetic and manila ropes used as mid-rails and top rails as frequently as possible for the strength required\n- Provide work safety and health training to employees using scaffolds\n5. Vehicles And Mechanized Equipment\nMost potential hazards in the construction industry are associated with the use of vehicles and mechanized equipment. Unfortunately, vehicles and mechanized equipment are involved accidents as a result of mechanical failure or human errors, causing injuries to the operators or to bystanders.\n- All construction equipment left adjacent to construction areas or unattended at night should have reflectors, lights or barricades to identify their location\n- The supervisory professionals should ensure that all vehicles and equipment are inspected before use to verify their operating condition\n- A fire extinguisher not less than 5 BC rating should be available at any operator station\n- Only those operators trained in the use of a specific type of machinery should be authorized to operate the machinery\n6. Lack Of Communication\nFailure to recognize and understand the material safety data sheet instructions with chemicals can lead to respiratory problems, chemical burns, explosions, and fire. Although this rarely happens on a construction site, employers must take appropriate precaution to ensure that employees and third parties are safe.\n- Maintain a clear MSDS for all chemicals in the facility\n- Train employees on how to use the MSDS\n- Have a written spill control plan\n- Strictly encourage employees to follow the instructions of the material safety data sheet from the manufacturer when handling hazardous chemicals\nOverall, if you identify the most hazardous areas on the construction site, and provide the most appropriate safety regulations, you will definitely improve the safety and health of workers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:366320b5-56e5-41a9-834a-60c510f88185>","<urn:uuid:2fa79b8f-0401-4204-b3a5-ac68bc050516>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Brian Bress transition from traditional painting to video art installations, and what motivated this change?","answer":"Bress transitioned from painting to video art after discovering that everything in his studio was more interesting than the paintings themselves. He began by creating tableaus as settings for improvised performance and making single-shot videos meant to function as paintings. Initially, he projected these works in dark rooms, but found audiences weren't engaging with them as intended. To solve this, he began presenting his works in seamlessly installed, framed flat screen monitors, making them function more like traditional paintings with a singular viewing experience.","context":["By Lex Brown\nIn Brian Bress' one minute and ten second video, \"World Report\" (2006), Bress sits onscreen dressed as a news reporter, rhythmically chanting \"Bangladesh,\" until he changes the words to \"dish, dish, this your dish, this your dish it's super delish.\" As his words change, so does the image in the top left corner from a picture of Bangladesh to a picture of a plate of food. Bress continues to morph the words through improvisation and repetition, and the visual elements of the video respond in kind. With the words \"delete these files,\" Bress invokes the disappearance of his image entirely and the video ends soon after.\nThis early work is short and easy to overlook amongst Bress' numerous other pieces from the same year, yet \"World Report\" serves as a compact and potent example of some of the ongoing concerns of Bress' work: namely the agency of a performer within a fully realized visual environment, play between real-time and post-production, outlandish characters looking for meaning, and the production and productivity of artists working in the studio. Consistent throughout Bress' work is his manipulation of the perceptual mechanics of video through perspective, camouflage, and visibility. Bress began creating the tableaus that would eventually become his sets because \"everything in [his] studio was more interesting than the paintings.\"\n\"I tried a lot of different ways of making paintings. I would find collage material and figures in the photo material, and I would print graphite on the back and trace over it and create this Henry Darger-esque, complicated world of figures moving around. [Others were pieces where] I would paint onto these images and try to interact with these found objects to change these images. I would go thrifting and I would find these objects and I didn't know why I was drawn to them, but I would bring them back to my studio and I would set them in front of a painting, and hang something in front, and it started become like a tableau and a painting was just secondary, it was was a backdrop.\"\nUsing the tableaus as settings for improvised performance, Bress began composing single-shot videos meant to function as paintings. Ultimately, he found that audiences were not engaging with them as such because the work was still presented as a projection in a dark room with a defined starting and ending point. Realizing that he had to shift the formal context in which his work was seen and take his work into the light, he began to present his works in seamlessly installed, framed flat screen monitors. This translation from projected image to autonomous object was a key turning point in Bress' practice.\nEach video only exists in two editions: an artist's proof and an edition for display. \"I like for them to exist in the same way paintings exist, in a very singular way. When you see a painting you're like, 'Well, that's the only time I get to see this painting,' you walk away from it, you hope that maybe you'll get to see it somewhere else and I think that feeling that you get have you look at something.\"\nTo display a video like a painting is concept whose strength is in its literalness, and with that there is a risk of gimmicky appeal. However, the richness, complexity, and reflexive humor within the construction of the videos steers Bress' work clear from novelty while also setting up up several subtle but important peripheral tensions within his work.\nFirst, there is the alternately futuristic and familiar feeling upon encountering one of his videos on the wall. On one hand, a viewer can recognize the ubiquity of the flat screen, the beyond-normalcy of the television's displayed image. On the other hand, the flat screen is a literal embodiment of digital compression, of technological progress that puts an interesting spin on the notion of progress in painting. To think about these works within the long view of painting is to become acutely aware of how far in the future we live. And then, with a second kind of tension, Bress' work brings the viewer back to the present with its robust materiality, unpredictability, and collage aesthetic.\n\"What I sort of enjoy about presenting these slick objects is that the things that are photographed are also really handmade and really cruddy, and there's still drips from glue and there's this sort of disconnect between the way the thing is presented and the thing that is presenting it.\"\nTexture, color, movement, and dialogue are used with decisiveness and restraint within the \"infinite\" space of video to create compositions that are intricate yet accessible. In his 2012 solo show, \"Under Performing,\" Bress' focus was on creating performance with as little movement as possible.\n\"In a lot of the other videos I was improvising so much and it was so dense with those moments that I was making so much noise and so much improvisation and so much was going on that there weren't a lot of entry points. And now I think that [viewers] are first of all watching other people do some more quiet things and the improvisation is really small so there's a point where they can imagine, 'Oh I would put that block there,' and it's just a little slower.\"\nIn most of Bress' work, a character -- either played by himself or by another performer -- wears an elaborate mask or full-body costume, often blending entirely into the environment or sticking out like a sore thumb. With a determined set of objects, costume, or situation Bress makes a preliminary set of conditions for the performance, and then lets the improvisation go from there.\n\"It got to a point where I knew sort of what was going to happen and I knew the videos were going to be dramatic and crazy and people were going to be like, 'that's absurd!' and I'd be like 'yeah!' and they'd laugh and go about their business and I think what's more fun as an artist is watching it evolve and letting other people participate in the videos and seeing what they do when I give them the opportunity to be the last piece of the puzzle.\"\nWhile Bress' humor remains as witty, bizarre, and enjoyable as in his earlier works, it has also become more precisely executed. Much of this humor was present in \"Under Performing\" -- so-titled for its tri-fold nod to the expectations people come into the gallery with, the subtlety of the performance, and the economics of being an artist. \"I thought it would be nice to give it a title that was immediately a little self-deprecating, like 'this is not quite resolved, don't get your hopes up.'\"\nIn the video \"Sleeper II\" (2012), a female character whose face and surroundings are painted in a pre-modern style dozes off to sleep within her own painting as the viewer watches -- a playful commentary on the experience of viewing a painting. \"Sleeper\" is a particularly good example of the vocabulary that video adds to painting: the movements within it are so slight that the painting's element of duration fades in and out like the sleeper's own consciousness. The video is neither a moment frozen in time, nor a meaningful sequence of events: it is an extended moment, infinitely looped. And while the work is structured so that viewers can enter and exit the piece at any time -- so that it doesn't \"hold the viewer hostage\" -- it certainly benefits from an inherent sense of anticipation produced by the moving image.\nIn a new video presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art's online channel MOCAtv, Bress gives the backstory behind two more video works from \"Under Performing.\" Both characters emerged from two-dimensional sketches: \"The Cowboy\" from a sketch on graph paper and \"The Architect\" from a collage. In both videos, the characters are extruded from two-dimensional form into three-dimensional performance, and compressed back again into the two-dimensional screen. Each character blindly performs the actions used to create himself: the Cowboy appears to doodle on the monitor, while the Architect stacks oddly-shaped objects.\nBoth of these works are examples of Brian Bress' great panache for visual punning and his ability to generate a wealth of work from even the slightest of source material. Within this work, there is a fusion and confusion of materials, of language and image, of the non-sequitur and the meaningful. Bress is an artist who mobilizes all of these elements to dismantle the distinctions between drawing, painting, video, and object with both levity and sincerity.\nAbout the Author\nTrackBack URL: http://www.kcet.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/18068\nSelect the most compelling article and help us make TV.\nCalifornia becomes an international export by redefining the concept of city and home.\nThrough workshops, education and placed based projects, art is the connective tissue of a community.\nFunding bubbles, cultural deserts and the politics of access to the arts in the 21st century.\nAt the shadow of the entertainment industry, video artists and underground filmmakers take a stand.\nNoir, sunshine and dystopia create a multi-ethnic narrative that is read, watched and admired around the globe.\nMulti-hyphenate works that combine disciplines, remix dogmas, and reinvent the wheel.\nA dialogue between cultures, the music of our state serves up the California dream like no other artform.\nStaging the drama of California through dance, music and theater.\nBreaking away from the European and New York vanguard, California reinvents the art world."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a5a9d7f-1a61-4e95-8fb8-f49a4c56a1aa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between setting up camp in regular backpacking versus camping in Death Valley?","answer":"When setting up camp in regular backpacking, you typically need to hang a bear bag 15 feet off the ground to protect food and smellables from bears. In contrast, camping in Death Valley focuses more on finding spots near desert springs and oases for water access and shade from cottonwood trees. Regular backpacking requires protection from wind, rain, and insects with a free-standing tent, while Death Valley camping emphasizes finding secluded sandy benches and dealing with extreme temperature variations in the desert environment.","context":["How to get started backpacking [and contest!]\nWhat You Need\nDepending on where you will be traveling, whether or not you need to pack for winter, and your level of experience, your pack on a multi-day trip can be a hulking behemoth or a featherweight sack barely heavier than your day pack. Regardless of your destination or the season, however, one rule governs the packing for every backpacking trip: Light is right.\nYou will be carrying that bag for hours everyday, while negotiating difficult terrain. It is essential that you bring only what you absolutely need and avoid everything else.\nThat said, there are three main areas to consider when compiling gear for a backpacking trip:\nFood: Hiking with a heavy pack burns a lot of energy and you will need lots of food to replace those calories. Most backpackers try to balance heavier foods with lighter quick-cooking meals. This is an important consideration because you will also be carrying all the fuel needed to prepare each meal. Cheese, bread, sausages, pasta, and instant dinners and sides are the most commonly carried foods.\nAnother important consideration when selecting and packing food is its packaging. Cans and jars are heavy and leave you with large containers that must be carried out. Most foods come in extra paper and plastic wrapping that also must be packed out. Instead of filling your pack with boxes, repackage your food in single plastic bags. Most people cut the instructions off the original package and place them in the new bag, just in case.\nShelter: While camping under the stars is great in mild weather, you need some protection from wind, rain, and insects. Many ultra-light backpackers favor tarps but usually you will want a free-standing tent with mosquito netting and a separate rain fly.\nClothing: Generally, the thing that separates the packs of new backpackers from experienced ones is how many clothes they contain. Experienced backpackers know that you do not need much clothing on the trail. A single pair of comfortable shorts with a built-in liner eliminates the need to carry underwear. Regularly rotating between two pairs of socks, and rinsing one pair before bed, means that you only need a single extra pair. Accepting that you will get dirty and smelly means you only need a single tank-top or t-shirt.\nThe clothes you do need include: an insulating layer (either a light fleece or light wool sweater in summer) and a rain shell that is breathable enough to hike in. It doesn’t seem like much and that’s the entire point.\nBefore you begin backpacking, it is important to practice the skills required of both hiking and camping. Some of the most important ones include:\nThe Bear Necessities: Bears love to eat camper’s food, especially when it’s easy to find in the roadside parking lots and campgrounds of a busy national park. When you venture into the backcountry, however, it is even more important to protect yourself, your food, and the wellbeing of bears and other animals by hanging anything that smells (this includes toothpaste, deodorant, and feminine products) in a bear bag.\nTo make a bear bag, place all your smellables in a stuff sack or two, tie it to a rope that is strung between two branches 10 feet from the tree trunk and at least 15 feet off the ground. Obviously, this is easier said than done. Practice setting up a bear bag at home before you leave for your first trip.\nYou are Here?: Even if you plan to stay on well-established trails, some basic map-reading and orienteering skills are necessary. At the very least you should be able to orient a map to a compass bearing and read a topographic map. Not only will this help estimate your general location if you get turned around or take the wrong trail, it will also allow you to identify interesting landmarks along the way.\nPlaying Doctor: Knowledge of some basic first aid, like cleaning and dressing a wound, is very important when venturing into the backcountry. More important, however, is knowing how to prevent and treat blisters, hypothermia, heat stroke, and dehydration. These maladies are much more common on trail than the fractured femur that requires a traction splint to be made from a ski pole.\nTake Only Pictures: Along with “light is right,” the motto of every backpacker is “take only pictures, leave only footprints.” This is an easy way of invoking the core principals of Leave No Trace. The ideas are simple, but practicing them with diligence is vitally important.\nWhere to Go:\nOnce you have the gear and the skills you need to start backpacking, it’s time to hit the trail. But where should you go?\nNational Parks: In the United States, backpacking is an exceptional way to experience national parks. While the roadside campgrounds are crowded and cost money, the backcountry sites, some only a mile or two down the trail, are free and often empty even at the peak of the summer. Once you get a day or two from the road, it is like you have entered an entirely different place: one marked by solitude, wildness, and pristine natural beauty.\nThe Appalachian Trail: On the East Coast, the Appalachian Trail offers a 2,175 mile venue for backpacking. A complete “thru-hike” is the dream of many experienced backpackers, but hiking even a small section of the trail over a weekend is a great way to introduce yourself to the pursuit.\nBackpacking gives the hiker a new feeling of independence, self sufficiency, and responsibility. It also provides an opportunity to escape the modern world and enter one in which nature still rules. As John Muir said,\nIn every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.\nWe’re running a mini-contest here at Sports! Give us 2 or 3 paragraphs on your first backpacking trip. Where did you go? When? What happened? What did you pack that you never used? What did you find you needed but didn’t have? What happened along the way?\nJust add your story to the comments below.

This trip explores lush, desert oases, ancient petroglyph rock art and some of the most impressive narrows anywhere. Our adventure begins in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we’ll pick you up from your hotel and get an early start out to Death Valley National Park, Cottonwood Canyon and this otherworldly Basin and Range environment. We'll spend 4 days traversing a series of valleys and canyons, camping near springs and oases, and sleeping under one of the most vivid night skies you've ever seen!\nFrom the trailhead, we’ll begin our hike up the uniquely-fertile Cottonwood Canyon, one of Death Valley’s true treasures, camping in tree-shaded luxury and exploring some twisty-turny side canyons before making our way via Dead Horse Canyon to stunning Marble Canyon. Descending into Marble Canyon, we’ll enjoy hiking through towering narrows and spot prehistoric petroglyphs along with epically ancient fossils.\nTrip Dates & Booking\nYou can also click here to request new dates or book through customer service.\nWe may be able to add new trip dates.\n- Shuttle to Death Valley: 4 hours\n- Hiking Mileage: 8.5 miles\n- Elevation Gain: 1300 feet\nThis multi-day Death Valley hiking trip begins with pickup from your hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada and transportation to our trailhead. Upon entering Death Valley National Park we’ll stop at the Furnace Creek Visitors’ Center to pick up our permit. After Furnace Creek, we’ll have about 30 more minutes of driving on the pavement before we turn off at Stovepipe Wells onto a rough dirt road. Ten miles of washboarded four-wheel driving will take us to the start of our hike at the confluence of Cottonwood and Marble Canyons. We’ll make lunch at the car before heading off down the trail. Our hike will take us along 8.5 miles up the Cottonwood Canyon road to the wilderness boundary. We’ll make camp here under the shade of a few cottonwood trees next to a lush desert spring, a pleasant anomaly in such a harsh environment.\n- Hiking Mileage: 3.5 miles\n- Elevation Gain: 500 feet\nWith just a few miles on our plate today, we’ll enjoy a leisurely breakfast this morning and take our time packing. Traversing along Cottonwood Creek for another 3.5 miles, we’ll come to another spring where we’ll make camp and break-out lunch.\nWe’ll then enjoy the option of exploring one of the many narrow, side-canyons or summiting one of the surrounding unnamed peaks for incredible, 4,000-foot views of the surrounding desert. Tonight, we’ll stock our bellies with a hearty dinner and go to bed early to get plenty of rest for tomorrow’s adventure.\n- Hiking Mileage: 6.5 miles\n- Elevation Gain: 1500 feet\n- Elevation Loss: 1200 feet\nAlthough today doesn’t have the most mileage, many would consider it the most difficult day of the trip. We’ll start by hiking further into Cottonwood Canyon. Our now-familiar springs quickly dry out as the once-dramatic canyon dissipates into a shallow valley.\nHiking towards the head of Cottonwood Canyon, we’ll continue up over a pass and drop down a steep, off trail descent into Dead Horse canyon -- all the while enjoying tremendous views of 6,381-ft Thimble Peak and the Grapevine Mountains to the Northeast. After a steep descent, we'll enter Dead Horse Canyon and make our way to our campsite for the evening near a friendly spring. We’ll follow this trickle to an eight-foot dry-fall, scramble down the fall and take a rest at the confluence of Dead Horse and Marble Canyons. Tonight’s camp is here on a secluded sandy bench at the confluence with our third and final canyon.\n- Hiking Mileage: 7.8 miles\n- Elevation Loss: 1800 feet\n- Shuttle to Las Vegas: 4 hours\nToday, we’ll finish out our trip with an exciting early-morning hike down stunning Marble Canyon. In many ways, we’ve saved the best for last. Today’s scenery is enough to turn any hiker into an aspiring photographer.\nWe’ll pass several smaller springs along the hike today, providing pockets of riparian vegetation. Further on, the incredible geology of Marble Canyon starts to show us a wheel of colors. We’ll also try to spot fossil shells in the polished dolomite wall, and find ourselves marveling under the most impressive collection of petroglyphs in Death Valley National Park.\nAfter exiting the last narrows, we’ll come upon a primitive dirt road that signals our final two miles of easy cruising back to the vehicle for our return drive to Las Vegas.\nPlease Note: We always do everything in our power to follow the set itinerary, however it can change occasionally based on temporary access restrictions, weather, lodging/campground availability, guest ability/injury, natural events like fires and flooding, and other potential causes.\n- Top-of-the-line tent, sleeping pad, sleeping bag, and technical backpack\n- Use of trekking poles\n- All meals are included from breakfast the first day through lunch on the last day\n- A professional, knowledgeable, certified Death Valley hiking guide\n- Comprehensive, roundtrip transportation from your hotel in Las Vegas and back\n- All necessary entrance fees and permits\n- Emergency equipment including a company-issued first-aid kit and satellite phone\n- You will receive a Lifetime Hiking Membership entitling you, your spouse and kids to a lifetime discount of 10% off any Wildland Trekking hiking trip after your first one!\n- Clothes, raingear, and footwear (Oboz hiking shoes and boots recommended)\n- Sunscreen, toiletries and personal items\n- Water bottles and a headlamp or flashlight\n- Guide gratuity (industry recommendation is 10-20% of trip cost)\nAll of our hiking and backpacking tours include a diversity of tasty meals packed full of critical carbohydrates, proteins and fats.

{"question":"What penalties can be imposed for not complying with electrical safety regulations in the UK?","answer":"Non-compliance with electrical safety regulations in the UK can result in fines up to £5,000 and/or six months imprisonment. In more serious cases, fines can reach £20,000, and when heard in the Crown Court, offences can carry sentences of more than 2 years imprisonment along with unlimited financial penalties.","context":["Conforming to PAT testing regulations will help you to ensure that the portable appliances in your business are safe and help you to avoid violations. PAT testing legislation was put into effect to ensure that all companies conform to the Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974, Electricity at Work Regulations of 1989, Provision and Use of Work Equipment regulations of 1998 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work regulations of 1999.\nThe current law requires that all employers maintain portable appliances and ensure their safety. This is done through testing of the appliances to safeguard against damage and to make certain that these items perform properly.\nPAT testing law requires that all landlords, employers and even self-employed individuals make sure that their portable electrical appliances are safe and are suitable and used for the purposes intended. These appliances should always be maintained properly and remain in good working order.\nThe guidelines are designed to make certain that this equipment is kept protected and is preserved through regular maintenance as well as inspections and periodic testing. Damage and fault can occur with all electrical equipment use which makes it essential that these items are tested regularly for safety.\nPAT testing is done to ensure that all electrical equipment that is classified as “portable” is deemed safe for use. The legislation deems that any competent person can perform it by using a PAT instrument or tester. The visual examination of each appliance in addition to the actual PAT test should be performed only by someone who is deemed competent.\nAccording to PAT testing legislation, a competent person is someone who has experience or knowledge of being able to check and test appliances for safety purposes. Those with knowledge of electricity in general as well as anyone who has experience in electrical work can be deemed capable.\nIt is imperative that employers, landlords and self-employed individuals follow the rules to ensure that their workplaces are safe. Testing can be done by any number of PAT testing companies or individuals can obtain certification to perform their own testing by successfully completing coursework in this field.\nIs PAT Testing A Legal Requirement?\nThere is currently no strict legal requirement for PAT testing. The Government however has put regulations into place that pertain to the maintenance of electrical appliances and the most effective way to ensure that these regulations are met is through PAT testing.\nThe UK Health and Safety Executive along with insurance companies will expect you to perform PAT testing to ensure that you are compliant with certain regulations including:\n- Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974\n- The Electricity at Work Regulations of 1989\n- The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations of 1998\n- The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations of 1999\nNot complying with the above mentioned regulations can result in fines up to £5,000 and/or six months imprisonment. Fines have been seen to go as high as £20,000 and offences heard in the Crown Court have carried sentences of more than 2 years imprisonment in additional to unlimited financial penalties. So even though PAT testing itself is not legally required, it simply helps you to protect yourself by ensuring that you are complying with these regulations.\nClaims that PAT testing is required by law and that the client is breaking the law by not having it done are simply not true. The law does require however that employers, including self-employed, ensure that all electrical equipment that they provide in their business is safe and properly maintained. This means that PAT testing is a critical part of your company’s health and safety and should be considered part of a solution to your safety concerns.\nPAT testing provides the most effective way to identify defects that can come with use. Faults in electrical equipment pose a potential hazard, particularly if they are not repaired readily. Even though PAT testing itself is not required by law, the consequences of electrical faults should be considered carefully.\nPAT Testing Frequency\nPAT testing is required by employers, landlords and self-employed to ensure safety of portable appliances. The Health & Safety Executive provides no set rule on PAT testing frequency, only that testing should be done regularly to ensure preventative maintenance. The reason that there is no set frequency is because different situations arise that call for different measures. There are a number of factors that affect PAT testing frequency and it is up to each individual to determine when testing should be carried out.\nIn order to determine how often you should have your appliances tested, you should bear in mind a few different factors:\n- Equipment that is used more should be tested more frequently. This equipment is likely to suffer less damage than that used regularly.\n- If people using equipment report any damages as they become noticeable, there is less chance of a major hazard. If equipment regularly receives damage or abuse that is not reported then inspections and testing are required more frequently.\n- The type of equipment in question is a major factor in determining PAT testing frequency. Hand held appliances are more likely to become damaged than those that are stationary. Class 1 appliances carry the greatest risk of danger and should be tested more often.\nAlthough there are no requirements for PAT testing frequency, there are recommendations:\nOffices, Shops and Hotels – Class 1 equipment including stationary and IT equipment should be tested every 48 months. Moveable equipment such as extension leads and portable equipment should be tested every 24 months. Handheld equipment should be tested every 12 months.\nSchools – All Class 1 equipment in schools should be PAT tested every 12 months. Class 2 equipment should be tested every 48 months.\nPublic Use Equipment – Stationary and IT equipment such as computers should be tested every 12 months. Moveable, Portable and Handheld equipment falling into Class 2 should be tested every 12 months. Moveable, Portable and Handheld equipment falling into Class 1 should be tested every 6 months.\nConstruction – All 110V equipment used on construction sites should be tested every 3 months.\nIndustrial – All industrial sites, including commercial kitchens should have Portable and Handheld equipment tested every 6 months. Stationary, IT and Moveable equipment should be tested every 12 months."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:060cfa9a-efe1-418f-ac4d-e9a1e24bc662>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do RangerBot and ROVs differ in their control systems?","answer":"RangerBot is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) that operates independently using real-time on-board vision for navigation, obstacle detection and management tasks, with an intuitive tablet-based interface. In contrast, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are tethered vehicles that require direct control from a remote operator via a power and communication cable. This fundamental difference means RangerBot can operate without continuous communication while ROVs need constant operator control to complete their missions.","context":["I am a Professor in Autonomous Systems at the Queensland University of Technology's (QUT) Institute for Future Environments, and a Chief Investigator in the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision. I am known for my research into field (environmental) robotics and their application to large-scale environmental monitoring, management and change quantification, particularly in marine and aquatic systems.\nI received a B.Eng in Aerospace Engineering from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and a PhD from QUT. I started my professional career in 1995 as a project engineer at Roaduser Research International. Following my PhD I joined the CSIRO Autonomous Systems Laboratory in 2001. As a Principal Research Scientist at CSIRO I held various roles including project leader and the Robotics Systems and Marine Robotics team leader before moving to QUT in 2013.\nI have wide research interests including vision-based navigation, vision-based learning and classification, adaptive sampling and path planning, cooperative robotics, and visual and acoustic stealth. A detailed bio is on my QUT profile.\nI undertake a range of robotics research particularly focused around vision-based navigation and control, adaptive sampling, associative learning, and image-based habitat mapping and change quantification. This fundamental research is typically applied to help solve challenging environmental science problems. Below is a summary of current (2018) projects.\nRangerBot Autonomous Underwater Vehicle\nThe RangerBot Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a novel vision-based robotic tool that has been developed to provide coral reef managers, researchers and community groups extra ‘hands and eyes’ in the water to help monitor and manage various threats on the Great Barrier Reef. This includes monitoring reef health indicators like coral bleaching and water quality, mapping and inspection, and the monitoring and control of pests like the Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). The RangerBot AUV significantly extends the capabilities of its predecessor, the COTSbot AUV, and exploits real-time on-board vision for navigation, obstacle detection and management tasks. The RangerBot has been developed for single person deployment and operation from any size vessel or shoreline with an intuitive tablet-based interface created using feedback from key stakeholders. This project is in collaboration with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation with support from the Google Impact Challenge.\nThe official public release of RangerBot will be mid-August 2018. Stay tuned!\nFor more information check out the GBRF RangerBot page here.\nVision-based multi-robot formation control & docking\nThis project is developing scalable vision-based formation control algorithms that allow multiple AUVs to conduct novel swath bathymetry and benthic imagery surveys in complex coral reef environments. Using customized RangerBot AUVs, the approach exploits their on-board vision capabilities of the AUVs for a V-formation \"follow-the-leader\" approach to ensure complete coverage without the need for inter-robot wireless communications. A key challenge is to ensure complete minimally overlapping coverage over complex 3D benthic terrain at relatively low attitudes above the seafloor (< 2m).\nIn addition to the vision-based formation control algorithms, new approaches to scalable docking (deployment and retrieval) of multiple AUVs are being developed and experimentally evaluated using the RangerBot AUVs and a customized Inference ASV. This work has built on previous vision-based AUV and ASV docking research for at surface (paper) and underwater water (paper) retrieval and cooperative underwater robotic systems (paper). The overall goal is to allow a single ASV to deploy and retrieve up to 4 AUVs at sea to demonstrate large-scale autonomous benthic surveying capabilities.\nAutonomous Underwater Lander (Mission orientated perception)\nThe Autonomous Underwater Lander (AUL) project is focused on developing advanced real-time vision systems that allows an underwater robot to automatically select benthic landing locations during its decent. The approach uses multi-resolution and multi-sensor classification which upon selection of a region of interest from multi-beam sonar maps (e.g. Halimeda bioherms), the AUL starts to descend and continuously classifies the benthos to guide the robot to a landing site which has the desired characteristics for sampling. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of obtaining relevant benthic and pore-water samples in previously unmapped scientifically relevant locations. This project is in collaboration with Mardi McNeil and Alistair Grinham who are developing the physical sampling system for the AUL (a customized RangerBot AUV).\nAutomated marine pest population monitoring & management: COTSbot\nThis project is developing advanced image processing techniques and underwater robotic platforms to detect, count and map the distribution of a range of marine pests. It expands previous research into automated marine pest classification for Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (Acanthaster planci) and Northern Pacific Sea Star (Asterias amurenis), with the goal of improving detection rates and providing tools for accurately measuring their spatial and temporal distribution. The results will assist marine scientists and authorities in understanding pest movement dynamics, their impact, and in managing threats. This project is in collaboration with Feras Dayoub with financial support from QUTbluebox.\nFor more information check out the COTSbot project page here.\nLarge-scale aquatic greenhouse gas quantification\nThis project is developing novel techniques for the large-scale temporal quantification of greenhouse gases (particularly methane) from inland waterways. It is uniquely combining persistent robotic platforms, image-processing, sensor networks, and automated sensors. The techniques and sampling paradigms developed in this project are providing limnologists and ecologists the ability to accurately quantify methane flux rates, improving model development and fundamental process understanding. This work is in collaboration with Alistair Grinham from The University of Queensland.\nSome of the latest publications are:\nRobots for Environmental Education\nThis project focuses on engaging primary and high-school students with robotic technology to raise awareness on key environmental issues and to encourage broader on-the-ground action to help mitigate these issues. In 2017, in collaboration with ManuelaToboaba and Tim Williams from the QUT School of Design we developed the “Plastic Waste Elimination Challenge”, an interactive technology-based activity for engaging and educating the public of the impact of plastic waste/litter on waterways. It was first showcased at the 2017 QUT Robotronica event which attracted over 22,000 people. A refined version was showcased at the 2018 World Science Festival Brisbane in collaboration with The Great Barrier Reef Foundation.\nAnother project, completed 2017, has focused on evaluating how non-tech savvy community groups can upscale Crown-of-Thorns Starfish control programs funded by the Dalio Foundation and the Lord Mayors Charitable Fund.\nInference: Robotic adaptive sampling\nThis project has created and is demonstrating new scalable adaptive sampling capabilities to enable large-scale monitoring of the environment, including dynamic and extreme events (e.g. floods, cyclones, fires) using multiple, persistent robotic sensors. To facilitate algorithm development, a novel persistent robotic system has been developed called Inference. The system consists of multiple networked robotic boats which provides an open architecture allowing researchers to evaluate new sampling algorithms on real-world processes over extended periods of time.\nThe Inference ASVs are currently being used in collaboration with Sara Couperthwaite for water sampling at Mount Morgan, and Alistair Grinham for large-scale green-house gas sampling on inland waterways.\nHigh-speed Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) control in narrow waterways\nThe goal of this project is to develop novel adaptive controllers and vision-based perception and trajectory planners for high-speed ASV's in narrow and cluttered waterways. Target operating scenarios include previously unmapped creeks and high flow-rate flooded rivers with limited and/or unreliable GPS localization to perform tasks such as sample collection and help with swift water rescue operations. A prototype jet powered ASV has been developed with a maximum speed of 22 knots. It has on-board cameras and LiDAR for situational awareness and a computer for real-time processing and control.\nThe latest conference paper describing an experimental evaluation of an adaptive receding horizon controller for the high-speed ASV can be found here.\nMaritime RobotX Challenge\nThe Maritime RobotX Challenge is an international student competition with the goal of significantly advancing the autonomy capabilities of Autonomous Surface Vehicles on a range of complex real-world tasks. The RobotX Challenge started in 2014 and is held every two years. QUT was selected as one of three teams to represent Australia at the Maritime RobotX Challenge that took place in Singapore in 2014. The Challenge sponsors provides all competing teams with a WAM-V USV manufactured by Marine Advanced Research Inc., however, they are supplied with no propulsion, power, sensors or computing hardware. TeamQUT has fitted their platform with an electric propulsion system and various localization and perception sensors, as well as high-performance computing and communication hardware. TeamQUT consists of a group of enthusiastic students studying a range of engineering majors, including mechatronics, electrical, and computer and software systems. The team has developed and continually refine a set of novel vision-based target detection systems, as well as LiDAR and Radar based mapping and path planning systems which allowed them to place 3rd overall in Singapore (2014) and place 2nd overall in Hawaii (2016). The next RobotX Challenge will be held in December 2018 with TeamQUT fielding a new team with improved hardware and software systems.\nFor more information check out TeamQUT's 2018 official website.\nArchive: TeamQUT 2016 Journal Paper\nArchive: TeamQUT's 2014 official website.\nVisual and Acoustic Stealth\nTracking dynamic targets without being detected requires not only visual but also acoustic stealth. Our goal is to significantly extend both these concepts by uniquely combining visual and acoustic stealth to maintain continuous line-of-sight observation to a moving natural object of interest, such as wild animals, in outdoor environments without being detected. We have demonstrated the combined acoustic and visual stealth approach for covertly tracking a moving target and more recently extended this for the robot to recognise and use shadows as more discreet vantage points (paper). This work is in collaboration with Ashley Tews from CSIRO.\nExtreme Robotics: Robots vs volcano\nSometimes it can be fun to push robotics to the extreme. Since 2014, in collaboration with Alistair Grinham and Simon Albert from The University of Queensland, we have developing very low-cost (essentially disposable) imaging and robotic sampling systems to explore one of the most active submarine volcanoes in the South Pacific called Kavachi. Initially this was just a fun activity to blow up some robots in a volcano, but from the data we collected, we discovered some amazing things such as sharks living in one of the most hostile places on earth. We were lucky enough to team up with explorers from National Geographic who produced a number of cool YouTube videos on what we were finding. The next trip is planned for late 2018 with some even cooler robotic tech.\nVideo: Robot vs Volcano\nAlso there is a journal paper on the latest findings: Exploring the “Sharkcano”: Biogeochemical observations of the Kavachi submarine volcano (Solomon Islands).\nRobots Past and Present\nOver the last 14 years I have developed and built many field robot platforms for the sea, land and air domains. Particular emphasis has been on applying them to undertake complex tasks and answering specific questions particularly relating to environmental science.\nRobots developed and used since joining QUT in June 2013.\nThese are the many robots I worked on and developed whilst working at the CSIRO Autonomous Systems Laboratory.\nComplete publication list and citation analysis is available from Google Scholar.\nYou can also access most of my publications at the QUT ePrints repository.\nDunbabin, M. and Grinham, A.

One method of categorizing these vehicles is to identify them as members one of two classes of vehicles; manned and unmanned systems. We are all familiar with the manned systems. They can be described simply as falling into two sub-classes; military submarines and non-military submersibles such as those operated to support underwater investigations and assessment. The navies of the world utilize a number of different classes of submarines to conduct their missions.\nOn the other hand, Alvin (USA), Epaulard (France), Mir (Russia) and Shinkai 6500 (Japan) are all familiar names of small submarines that allow a few individuals to descend into the ocean to gather data and information from observations of the water column and ocean bottom.\nUnmanned submersibles also fall in to a number of different sub-classes. The simplest and most easily described are those submersibles that are towed behind a ship. They act as platforms for various sensor suites attached to the vehicle frame. A second type of submersible system is called a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). An ROV is a tethered vehicle. The tether supplies power and communication to the ROV and is controlled directly by a remote operator. A third type of unmanned submersible is an Unmanned Untethered Vehicle(UUV). This untethered vehicle contains its own onboard power, but is controlled by a remote operator via some type of a communications link. An AUV is an undersea system containing its own power and controlling itself while accomplishing a pre-defined task. A further distinction between the AUV and UUV is that the AUV requires no communication during its mission whereas the UUV requires some level of communication for it to complete its assigned mission.\nVideo provided by Sonardyne International\nNARRATOR: Henry Stommel, an eminent oceanographer from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, envisioned the day that there would be “a thousand swimming robots” in the sea. His vision has been partially realized with the technology in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), computer-controlled systems operating under the water.\nWhen you compare vehicles, some of them look like torpedoes, some of them look like stingrays, some of them look like things with flippers on them. So the breadth of that is pretty exciting, and what they can do.\nThey are designed with the intelligence to perform their tasks, identify problems, and adapt to different situations. AUVs can help protect our environment, as well as mitigate threats to our national security. And now, they are even being used to search for sunken history.\nSo, when you take AUV technology, you can see how the ships maneuvered, where the canon balls landed, where all the ship debris scattered as they blew up. That gives you greater insight as to the decisions that were made on those significant days.\nAutonomous Underwater Vehicles can be equipped with sophisticated sensing devices. These sensors can measure different ocean characteristics; others can provide images of objects under the water or even buried below the ocean bottom. Since visibility under the sea is usually poor, sound - or SONAR - is used to create these acoustic pictures.\nSide-Scan Sonar can produce very realistic imagery of objects and the seafloor. As the ping, or sound wave, travels underwater, it will reflect off objects such as sunken ships. The sonar distinguishes between these objects and creates dark or light regions that make up the astonishingly clear images we are able see today.\nSince the 1990’s, the Office of Naval Research has been investing in AUVs and their advanced sensors to help search for mines. Now, marine archeologists are able to use this amazing technology and put it to use exploring sunken history.\nOver 2,000 shipwrecks can be found in the waters off Rhode Island, which has more shipwrecks than any other state per square mile. These shipwrecks include British frigates intentionally burned and sunk during the Revolutionary War in 1778 to avoid capture by a French fleet.\nFour of these shipwreck sites, including the HMS Cerberus and HMS Lark, were explored using AUV technology. Several new discoveries are being made with these advanced remote sensing technologies, as they help marine archeologists answer important questions about our history.\nA benefit of AUV exploration, and one that is of critical importance in exploring sunken ships, is the non-invasive nature of the technology. AUV missions will not disturb these delicate sites in any physical way.\nNot only can AUVs help marine archeologists, but they are also being used in coastal surveys, fisheries research, and ocean exploration. Through these demonstrations, we can really grow the pull for this technology and basically increase access to the sea. Everything good will follow from that.\nPerhaps a thousand swimming robots in the sea is closer than we think.\nDesign of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Download\nThere are concerns about the impact that global warming will have on our environment, and which will inevitably result in expanding deserts and rising water levels. While a lot of underwater vehicles are utilized, AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) were considered and chosen, as the most suitable tool for conduction survey concerning these global environmental problems. AUVs can comprehensive survey because the vehicle does not have to be connected to the support vessel by tether cable. When such underwater vehicles are made, it is necessary to consider about the following things. 1) Seawater and Water Pressure Environment, 2) Sink, 3) There are no Gas or Battery Charge Stations, 4) Global Positioning System cannot use, 5) Radio waves cannot use. In the paper, outline of above and how deal about it are explained.\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored the development of these documents. They are intended for students who are considering participation in the annual AUVSI/ONR Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) competition. The documents provide an overview of engineering and organizational considerations for designing, building, and operating a vehicle for this event. Development of an underwater system requires knowledge of multiple engineering disciplines, as well as good organizational and execution skills. These documents provide a brief overview of these topics to acquaint readers with the subjects, knowledge, and skills important to competitive teams. The documents also include practical tips and advice based on experience developing and operating AUVs. The authors include past AUV competition participants who have shared their experience."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:16c3544d-63cb-4616-acad-97bfaea3e729>","<urn:uuid:57b9f6fd-1e38-4f2a-978b-1a82133b781d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the steps involved in conducting publicly engaged archaeology and engaging with multiple stakeholders in archaeological research?","answer":"Conducting publicly engaged archaeology involves several key steps: First, students interact with community members to learn how to disseminate information and understand heritage tourist site development. They attend public lecture series and participate in open houses where they showcase archaeological findings to the broader community. Students also discuss their role in history recovery with the public. Furthermore, they engage with communities to make historical documentation more collaborative, working to transform and decolonize the discipline. The process involves recognizing and working with multiple stakeholders who have an interest in the archaeological work.","context":["Anthropology Field Study SL Course\nCOURSE CURRICULUM SCHEDULE\nThe 2016 archaeological field school will continue investigations designed to identify, investigate, and interpret the physical remains of Fort St. Joseph (20BE23) and contemporaneous sites in the St. Joseph River valley of southwestern Michigan. This year we will expand our excavations on the floodplain (Fort St. Joseph—20BE23) and continue to explore adjacent areas.\nStudents in the field school will receive instruction in surveying techniques, proper field excavation, artifact processing and analysis, and interpretation of findings as part of a long-term program devoted to exploring colonial interactions between Native Americans and Europeans in the North American fur trade. In the course of a 4-day orientation, we introduce students to archaeological theory and method; background information on the fort site; and the results of previous work. We will also discuss the development of a research design and how we will implement our field methods to address our research questions. There will be lectures and discussions during orientation and later in the field school on the Native American occupation of the region before contact, the motivations of early French explorers, activities associated with the fur trade and daily life, the history and material evidence of 18th century architecture, and the importance of the St. Joseph River for people who lived in the vicinity of Niles—the theme of this year’s open house. Students will also be exposed to various information sources that historical archaeologists use in their studies such as written records, maps, and museum collections. We’ll spend the next six weeks in the field recovering, recording, and interpreting archaeological materials from sites in the St. Joseph River valley, weather permitting, including Fort St. Joseph. All students have the opportunity to gain experience in a range of different field techniques. In the event of rain we schedule other learning activities such as lectures and field trips whenever possible.\nSERVICE LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Students gain competence in surveying techniques, proper field excavation, artifact processing and analysis, and interpretation of findings by practicing and teaching novice archaeologists in our summer camp program.\n2. Students learn to practice publicly engaged archaeology and heritage management by interacting with members of the community to learn how to disseminate information and how decisions are made in developing and interpreting a heritage tourist site.\n3. Students gain an appreciation for the multiple stakeholders who have a concern with archaeology by attending our public lecture series and participating in an open house that showcases archaeological findings to a broad segment of the community and allows students the opportunities to discuss their role in the recovery of history.\n4. Students learn how to conduct archaeology in the contemporary world in which there are multiple stakeholders with an interest in the work by engaging with communities to make the writing of history more collaborative in an effort to transform and decolonize the discipline (see Nassaney 2011, 2012).\nREQUIRED READINGS: The materials in the course pack are required readings. You should read the course pack carefully from cover to cover by the end of the orientation and have it with you at all times in the field. In addition, you should consult the readings in the bibliography.\nSee below for full syllabus:\nMore Syllabi Archive\nSEMINAR: Dialogue, Discourse, Identity a\nEducational Policy – Community Par\nEducational Policy – Community Pro"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a40e32b6-de2f-4c0d-89c4-4700bc95c5cd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Sophie and Hans Scholl's path to resistance differ from Willi Graf's?","answer":"Sophie and Hans Scholl's path to resistance differed from Willi Graf's in their initial relationship with Nazism. The Scholls were initially drawn to Nazi organizations - Hans became a Hitler Youth leader and Sophie joined a Nazi girls' group, but they were influenced away from Nazism by their father, who was a conscientious objector to WWI. In contrast, Willi Graf opposed Nazism from early on, driven by his Catholic faith rather than family influence. He consistently refused to participate in Nazi organizations, even when mandatory, and maintained this stance despite potential consequences, including imprisonment in 1938.","context":["Today 99 years ago Willi Graf was born. Willi was a member of the White Rose Society. This society was a Nazi resistance group. The core members were students Hans and Sophie Scholl, Alex Schmorrel, Christof Probst, and Willi Graf.\nAll of these core members had very interesting – if short – lives. Hans and Sophie were Lutheran, Schmorrel was Orthodox, (He is officially an Orthodox Saint) Willi was Catholic and Christof Probst became Catholic just before he died. I found all of these members to be inspirational. They got together through a connection to the University of Munich. Alex Hans and Willi were Medics and served together on the eastern front.\nLeft to right: Hubert Furtwangler, Hans Scholl, Willie Graf and Alexander Schmorell on the Eastern Front (1942)\nLeft to right: Hans Scholl, Sophie Scholl and Christoph Probst.\nThey published leaflets trying to change germans’ minds about the Nazis. They would also spray paint “Down with Hitler” And “Freedom!” throughout the city. They would write and print out the leaflets and then they would mail them to people who they thought would be influential, or just leave them throughout different cities. Willi was not the author of the leaflets but instead he would form contacts in other cities. They would distribute the leaflets at the same time in different cities so it appeared to be larger than it was.\nBefore the white rose was even formed, Sophie and Hans Scholl were influenced by Bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen. There was a transcript of one of his sermons condemning the Nazis pogrom against disabled people. They actually distributed his sermon just as they would later distribute their own work as the White Rose.\nHere are some excerpts from the leaflets:\nThe first leaflet Said: “…Therefore every individual, conscious of his responsibility as a member of Christian and Western civilization, must defend himself against the scourges of mankind, against fascism and any similar system of totalitarianism. Offer passive resistance – resistance – wherever you may be, forestall the spread of this atheistic war machine before it is too late,..”\nThe Second leaflet said “…Why tell you these things, since you are fully aware of them – or if not of these, then of other equally grave crimes committed by this frightful sub-humanity? Because here we touch on a problem which involves us deeply and forces us all to take thought. Why do the German people behave so apathetically in the face of all these abominable crimes, crimes so unworthy of the human race? Hardly anyone thinks about that. It is accepted as fact and put out of mind. The German people slumber on in their dull, stupid sleep and encourage these fascist criminals; they give them the opportunity to carry on their depredations; and of course they do so. Is this a sign that the Germans are brutalized in their simplest human feelings, that no chord within them cries out at the sight of such deeds, that they have sunk into a fatal consciencelessness from which they will never, never awake? It seems to be so, and will certainly be so, if the German does not at last start up out of his stupor, if he does not protest wherever and whenever he can against this clique of criminals, if he shows no sympathy for these hundreds of thousands of victims. He must evidence not only sympathy; no, much more: a sense of complicity in guilt. For through his apathetic behavior he gives these evil men the opportunity to act as they do; he tolerates this government which has taken upon itself such an infinitely great burden of guilt; indeed, he himself is to blame for the fact that it came about at all! Each man wants to be exonerated of a guilt of this kind, each one continues on his way with the most placid, the calmest conscience. But he cannot be exonerated; he is guilty, guilty, guilty!”\nThe third leaflet again tried to trigger the conscience of their fellow Germans ending with “We will not be silent. We are your bad conscience. The White Rose will not leave you in peace!”\nThe Fourth Leaflet said:\n“…Every word that comes from Hitler’s mouth is a lie. When he says peace, he means war, and when he blasphemously uses the name of the Almighty, he means the power of evil, the fallen angel, Satan. His mouth is the foul-smelling maw of Hell, and his might is at bottom accursed. True, we must conduct a struggle against the National Socialist terrorist state with rational means; but whoever today still doubts the reality, the existence of demonic powers, has failed by a wide margin to understand the metaphysical background of this war. Behind the concrete, the visible events, behind all objective, logical considerations, we find the irrational element: The struggle against the demon, against the servants of the Antichrist. Everywhere and at all times demons have been lurking in the dark, waiting for the moment when man is weak; when of his own volition he leaves his place in the order of Creation as founded for him by God in freedom; when he yields to the force of evil, separates himself from the powers of a higher order; and after voluntarily taking the first step, he is driven on to the next and the next at a furiously accelerating rate. Everywhere and at all times of greatest trial men have appeared, prophets and saints who cherished their freedom, who preached the One God and who His help brought the people to a reversal of their downward course. Man is free, to be sure, but without the true God he is defenceless against the principle of evil. He is a like rudderless ship, at the mercy of the storm, an infant without his mother, a cloud dissolving into thin air….”\nHere is a bit from the 6th Leaflet:\n“…The Hitler Youth, the SA, the SS have tried to drug us, to revolutionise us, to regiment us in the most promising young years of our lives. “Philosophical training” is the name given to the despicable method by which our budding intellectual development is muffled in a fog of empty phrases. A system of selection of leaders at once unimaginably devilish and narrow-minded trains up its future party bigwigs in the “Castles of the Knightly Order” to become Godless, impudent, and conscienceless exploiters and executioners – blind, stupid hangers-on of the Fuhrer…”\nWilli Graf in Particular:\nOne thing I found interesting about Willi Graf, is that he did not seem to have any authority figure or other adult to lead him to his courageous life.\nHans and Sophie had their father who was a conscientious objector to fighting in WWI. He did not want them participate in anything Nazi. Hans however was initially beguiled by the Nazis and became a leader in the Hitler Youth. Sophie, also initially joined a nazi girl’s group. However their father seemed to have a clear head and did push them in the other direction. Their sister Inge Scholl wrote of this later:\n“But there was something else that drew us with mysterious power and swept us along: the closed ranks of marching youth with banners waving, eyes fixed straight ahead, keeping time to drumbeat and song. Was not this sense of fellowship overpowering? It is not surprising that all of us, Hans and Sophie and the others, joined the Hitler Youth? We entered into it with body and soul, and we could not understand why our father did not approve, why he was not happy and proud. On the contrary, he was quite displeased with us.”\n— Inge Scholl, The White Rose\nAlexander Shmorrel was half Russian and so it is no surprise he came to find Nazis revolting – considering he spent time on the Eastern front. And Probst’s stepmother was Jewish so he presumably would have a strong counterinfluence at home as well.\nBut Willi’s youth seemed a bit different. It appeared that his anti-nazi views came solely from his belief that it was inconsistent with his faith. He joined catholic youth organizations and remained with them even when they were illegal. He also refused to join Hitler youth when it was mandatory. Not only that but he would cross his acquaintances names out of his personal address book if they joined the Hitler Youth. In some of my reading it seemed as though his actions went against his parents wishes. Not that his parents were Nazis but that they just wanted the best for him and wanted him to get along. I should point out that one source says his father was a Nazi leader but I was not able to verify this or get the fuller story.\nWhen Willi was seventeen he marched in a Mayday parade. But whereas there was a sea of brown marching in step giving “heil Hitler’s” and carrying Swastika flags, he and his friends marched purposely out of step, did not wear brown, and carried their tattered school flag.\nA friend commented: “Willie Graf… was one of those young people who have always found it impossible to remain indifferent in the face of injustice.” This obstinate refusal to comply would lead to fights where it was said Willi would give as good as he would get.\nAnd all of this was before he witnessed the horrors on the eastern front.\nTo his sister he wrote from the Eastern front “The war here in the East leads to things so terrible I would never have thought them possible… Some things have occurred… that have disturbed me deeply… I can’t begin to give you the details… It is simply unthinkable that such things exist… I wish I hadn’t had to see what I have seen…. I could tell you much more but do not want to trust it to a letter.”\nEven though I live at a time where it is much easier to live a good Christian life I still can relate to him when he wrote in his journal: “To be a Christian, is perhaps the hardest thing to ever become in life.” He was devoutly Catholic and it was said he would attend mass every Sunday even as a college student. He was interested in the liturgy and composed some alternate liturgies that could be used at mass. He was also chess player and philosopher.\nBut perhaps what I admire most about him is that despite harboring doubts he made a decision as to how to live and stuck to it even when it meant death. He wrote in his journal: “Sometimes, I am certain of the rightness of my course. Sometimes I doubt it. But I take it upon myself nevertheless, no matter how burdensome it may be.”, and “Sometimes you can’t just go where favoring winds send you. Sometimes one must take a direction which isn’t that easy. You can’t allow yourself to be continually blown about.”\nHe was not as eloquent at his trial as Sophie or Hans Scholl. However, despite being interrogated the longest he never gave additional names of any his contacts. All of the members of the white rose remained loyal to each other throughout their interrogations. This reminds me of John 15:13 “ There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”\nIn the movie Sophie Scholl last days they make it appear that Willi was very vocal against the actions Sophie and Hans took, which lead to all the arrests. But even, if this is true, nothing I have read suggests he ever held it against them. I think they all decided it was just a matter of time before they were caught and killed.\nWe must remember that Willi and his friends were still quite young during this time. They died at ages ranging from 21 to 25. I think as I am older and wiser, not only from an age perspective but a historical one, I can see how what they did was necessary. But when I consider the inevitable doubts of the moment to go against all of society, at such a young age, and with full knowledge of the dire consequences, I can only marvel at the dedication of these young men and women.\nI have been pondering their lives for a few months now and I am still looking for more information – especially on Willi Graf. I know there has been a book written on him but it is in German. I would love to get a translation.\nMy thoughts here were based on a 2 books, “A Noble treason” by Richard Hasner and “At the Heart of the White Rose: Letters and Diaries of Hans and Sophie Scholl” Hardcover – August, 1987 by Hans Scholl (Author), Sophie Scholl (Author), as well as the movie The last days of Sophie Scholl and the White Rose.\nThere are also numerouse webpages that I read as well including the following:","Willi Graf, the son of the director of a wholesale wine business, was born in Kuchenheim, Germany, on 2nd January, 1918. Educated at the Humanistische Ludwigsgymnasium, he became interested in history and philosophy.\nIn 1934 Graf joined the Nazi youth movement, the Graue Orden. As a committed Roman Catholic he gradually became convinced that his Christian faith and National Socialism were incompatible. After refusing to join the Hitler Youth he was briefly arrested and imprisoned in 1938.\nAfter six months in the German Labour Service he became a medical student at the University of Bonn. In the summer of 1940 Graf was sent as a member of the medical corps that went with the German Army invading France. Later he took part in the occupation of Yugoslavia.\nIn 1941 Graf returned to Germany where he joined with Hans Scholl, Sophie Scholl, Christoph Probst, Kurt Huber, Alexander Schmorell, Willi Graf and Jugen Wittenstein to form the ant-Nazi group, White Rose. The group decided to adopt the strategy of passive resistance that was being used by students fighting against racial discrimination in the United States. This included publishing leaflets calling for the restoration of democracy and social justice.\nIn June, 1942, Graf, was called up as a medic during Operation Barbarossa. Graf was accompanied by three fellow students Alexander Schmorell, Hans Scholl and Jugen Wittenstein. While on duty Graf and his friends witnessed Jews being murdered by the Schutzstaffel (SS) in Poland and the Soviet Union.\nWhen Graf returned to Germany in October, 1943, he and the White Rose began publishing leaflets about what he had seen while in duty. The leaflets were at first sent anonymously to people all over Germany. Taking the addresses from telephone directories, they tended to concentrate on mailing university lecturers and the owners of bars.\nIn Passive Resistance to National Socialism, published in 1943 the group explained the reasons why they had formed the White Rose group: \"We want to try and show that everyone is in a position to contribute to the overthrow of the system. It can be done only by the cooperation of many convinced, energetic people - people who are agreed as to the means they must use. We have no great number of choices as to the means. The meaning and goal of passive resistance is to topple National Socialism, and in this struggle we must not recoil from our course, any action, whatever its nature. A victory of fascist Germany in this war would have immeasurable, frightful consequences.\"\nThe White Rose group believed that the young people of Germany had the potential to overthrow Adolf Hitler and the Nazi government. In one leaflet, Fellow Fighters in the Resistance, they wrote: \"The name of Germany is dishonoured for all time if German youth does not finally rise, take revenge, smash its tormentors. Students! The German people look to us.\"\nThe White Rose group also began painting anti-Nazi slogans on the sides of houses. This included \"Down With Hitler\", \"Hitler Mass Murderer\" and \"Freedom\". They also painted crossed-out swastikas.\nMembers also began leaving piles of leaflets in public places. On 18th February, Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl began distributing the sixth leaflet produced by the White Rose group. Jakob Schmidt, a member of the Nazi Party, saw them at the University of Munich, throwing leaflets from a window of the third floor into the courtyard below. He immediately told the Gestapo and they were both arrested. They were searched and the police found a handwritten draft of another leaflet. This they matched to a letter in Scholl's flat that had been signed by Christoph Probst.\nInge Scholl and her parents were also arrested and imprisoned. Over the next few weeks Graf, Kurt Huber, Alexander Schmorell, and over eighty others suspected of being members of the White Rose group were taken into custody. Willi Graf was found guilty of sedition and was executed on 13th July, 1943.\nGermans! Do you and your children want to suffer the same fate that befell the Jews? Do you want to be judged by the same standards as your traducers? Are we do be forever the nation which is hated and rejected by all mankind? No. Dissociate yourselves from National Socialist gangsterism. Prove by your deeds that you think otherwise. A new war of liberation is about to begin. The better part of the nation will fight on our side. Cast off the cloak of indifference you have wrapped around you. Make the decision before it is too late! Do not believe the National Socialist propaganda which has driven the fear of Bolshevism into your bones. Do not believe that Germany's welfare is linked to the victory of National Socialism for good or ill. A criminal regime cannot achieve a victory. Separate yourself in time from everything connected with National Socialism. In the aftermath a terrible but just judgment will be meted out to those who stayed in hiding, who were cowardly and hesitant.\nThe day of reckoning has come - the reckoning of German youth with the most abominable tyrant our people have ever been forced to endure. We grew up in a state in which all free expression of opinion is ruthlessly suppressed. The Hitler Youth, the SA, the SS, have tried to drug us, to regiment us in the most promising years of our lives. For us there is but one slogan: fight against the party!\nThe name of Germany is dishonoured for all time if German youth does not finally rise, take revenge, smash its tormentors. Students! The German people look to us.\nThe People's Court of the German Reich, in session in Munich, dealt with a number of accused persons who were involved in the high treason of the brother and sister School sentenced on February 22, 1943.\nAt the time of the arduous struggle of our people in the years 1942-43, Alexander Schmorell, Kurt Huber, and William Graf of Munich collaborated with the Scholls in calling for sabotage of our war plants and spreading defeatist ideas. They aided the enemy of the Reich and attempted to weaken our armed security. These accused, having through their violent attacks against the community of the German people voluntarily excluded themselves from that community, were punished by death. They have forfeited their rights as citizens forever."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:16968dca-6eac-4ebb-9610-42b995a60608>","<urn:uuid:265446a2-9647-45fa-a07d-433af384b412>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the key differences between how monasteries tracked time in medieval Europe versus the early developments in mechanical watchmaking?","answer":"Monasteries relied on multiple simple time-tracking methods including sundials, hourglasses, calibrated candles, and water clocks. They used bells to signal specific prayer times throughout the day like Prime (6am), Tierce (9am), Sext (noon), and Nones (3pm). In contrast, mechanical watchmaking began at the end of the 15th century in Nuremberg with large 'Nuremberg eggs' watches. These early watches were gradually refined, with major improvements coming through innovations like Thomas Tompion's escapement, and culminating in precise instruments like Harrison's chronometer which lost only 1 minute 54½ seconds over several months at sea.","context":["“If nobody asks me, I know what time is, but if I am asked then I am at a loss what to say.”\nSt Augustine 354 – 430 AD\nTime is the one of the most elusive and mysterious concepts that philosophers and scientists have grappled with throughout the history of mankind. I am not even remotely qualified to expound on this subject and do not intend to do so. However, on the measurement of time as a practical everyday aspect of living, I do have an interest, particularly its measurement in Medieval times.\nHow did the poor medieval labourer or peasant know when to go to work and when to finish work? An anonymous versifier of the fifteenth century gives us a clue about one way to gage the start of day.\nI have a gentle cock,\nCroweth me the day\nHe doth me risen early\nMy Matins for to say.\nIn truth, things were not so haphazard as that. Bells from the local monastery were rung to signal the different hours of the day. The monks used sundials, hourglasses, calibrated candles and water clocks to calculate the time.\nThe latin system of counting the hours of the day was:-\nPrime – 6 am\nTierce – 9 am\nSext – 12 noon\nNones – 3 pm\nThe Church designated other times for prayer:\nMatins – Midnight\nLauds – Dawn\nVespers – Evening\nCompline – Before Bedtime\nThe astrolabe was another method of calculating the hours of the day. Chaucer himself wrote a treatise, for his young son, on how to use it to tell time. Interestingly, by Chaucers time (1343 -1400), great mechanical clocks were beginning to be built all over Europe. These clocks were housed in the belfries of Churches and Cathedrals and later bell towers in city squares.\nIt is hard to say when the first mechanical clock was invented, but in Europe they began to appear by the late 13th Century. The earliest public tower clocks had no dials or clockface; they simply rang a bell on the hour. Some of the more elaborate ones triggered displays of animated automatons. The clockface and a single hour hand followed. Other ingenious clocks gave, not only the time, but all kinds of astronomical information.\nIn 1344 Jacopo Dondi installed an astronomical clock in the facade of the Palazzo de Capitano at Padua.\nIn England an extraordinary astrological clock was designed by the country’s greatest medieval scientists, Richard of Wallingford (1292-1336). Son of a blacksmith, he was a brilliant mathematician and was obsessed with the practical application of science and mathematics, to the extent that he was rather neglectful of his spiritual role and later his administrative role when he became abbot of St. Albans, the principle abbey in England. It is recorded that he gave precedence to the work on his clock over the repair of the Abbey. When mildly rebuked by King Edward III, he argued that any successor of his could hire workmen to repair the abbey but only he could design and make the clock. The clock was not completed in his lifetime but design details are recorded in his Tractatus Horologii Astronomici (1327). Richard’s was not the first tower clock in England but it was the most advanced in its design.\nTime has always been considered a precious commodity. In the middle ages one of the greatest preachers and orators was Bertold of Regensburg (1220-1272) . Time, he said was one of the talents referred to in St. Mathews parable of the talents. It was man’s duty not to squander it.\nThis idea of the preciousness of time is well articulated in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales when the Host address the Company before the Lawyers Tale:\n“Let’s lose as little time now as we may.\nMy lords, it’s time that wastes both night and day,\nThat robs us while we sleep without defense,\nAnd while awake, through our own negligence.\nIt’s like a stream returning not again,\nDescending from the mountain to the plain.\nWell Seneca, like others of his measure,\nBewails the loss of time more than of treasure:\n‘Of chattels there may be recovery,\nBut we are ruined by loss of time,’ said he.”\nI just wonder if Bertold of Regensburg or Chaucer would approve of the time I spend ‘on the Internet.’ ? Probably not.","Another industry for which brass was found to have special advantages was the manufacture of clocks and subsequently watches. It is not known who made the earliest true clocks, but they extend back at least to the 10th or 11th Centuries. Their working mechanism was then extremely primitive with gear wheels either carved out of hardwood or made of wrought iron. Some of the earliest known true clocks were installed in Old St. Paul's (1286), in Canterbury Cathedral (1292) and in Exeter Cathedral (1300).\nClocks derive their name from the French cloche, doubtless because they included a bell which sounded the hours. Clocks with a striking mechanism appear to have been introduced in the 14th Century. There exists a very remarkable old astronomical clock by Giovanni Dondi, which, in addition to telling the time, shows correctly all the movements of the planets; it was made entirely of brass and copper. Time, itself, was apparently not of much consequence in those days, for Dondi took sixteen years to complete this masterpiece, from 1348 to 1364.\nEarly bracket or chamber clocks were almost invariably encased in gilt bronze or brass. The working parts were generally also of brass; and as glass was not used for clock faces until the 16th Century the dial was normally engraved on a brass face. A brass clock, made in 1632, was stated recently to be still in its original condition and keeping good time. Clocks have always exercised a fascination and many wonderful examples of the art may be seen in museums all over the world. Both the Wallace Collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London possess a number of priceless exhibits. Those in the Wallace Collection are mostly of the 17th and 18th Centuries and the majority are still kept working. The collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum is devoted mainly to watches and is perhaps the finest in Europe, but it also includes a number of remarkable old clocks (Figs. 22 and 24). The ornamentation on all these old clocks is lavish and in fact the great majority of the intricate chamber, bracket, lantern and other clocks that were produced up to the 19th Century had brass faces often engraved and chased.\nThe earliest known watches were made at Nuremberg at the end of the 15th Century. They were large and ungainly; some, in fact, resembled an egg so much that they were called 'Nuremberg eggs'. Refinement in design gradually transformed them into the flatter and more practical form of later times.\nOne major improvement lay in the escapement, the first effective one being invented by Thomas Tompion (1639-1713). Graham, Le Roy, Earnshaw and Harrison were among the celebrated watchmakers who followed him. John Harrison (1693-1776), in particular, earned great fame by making his famous chronometer, and thereby winning an Admiralty prize of £2O,OOO in 1761. The immense value of the reward was due to the long-standing need for accurately ascertaining the time at sea, in order to determine the ship's longitude.\nHarrison, who had begun as a Yorkshire carpenter's son, made a clock with wooden wheels while still a boy. He persevered with practical clock-making, and like others attempted to solve the longitude problem; his success came when he thought of the idea of an accurate Compensation-curb which would alter the effective length of the balance spring in proportion to the expansion or contraction caused by changes in temperature. His invention was given a very severe test. It was wound up and sent to Jamaica and back; on its return after several months, it was found to have lost only 1 minute 541/2, seconds. Harrison, like the other master clockmakers, worked in brass."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:141f77b6-564d-4693-86e5-a5efc50dad7b>","<urn:uuid:df75296c-4a3f-4faa-9e56-f621ce1117df>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm planning extended cruising trips and want to compare the storage and living space configurations between the Hampton Endurance and Catalina 545. How do their interior layouts differ?","answer":"The Hampton Endurance and Catalina 545 offer different interior configurations for extended cruising. The Hampton Endurance features a combined social bridge and galley area in the pilothouse, with a partially separated salon for conversation while maintaining connection to the galley. It includes a grand ensuite master stateroom with king bed, a queen bed ensuite VIP stateroom forward, and a guest cabin with optional twin or over-under berths. The Catalina 545, on the other hand, has a saloon that accommodates eight people in two areas, with movable hassocks and a convertible starboard settee. Its owner's cabin forward features a queen-size center island berth with side access, while aft it offers a port cabin with double berth and a starboard cabin with motorized twin berths that can combine into a double. Both vessels feature well-equipped galleys for extended cruising, though the Catalina specifically includes large fridge/freezer capacity and the Hampton offers additional options like crew quarters and a skylounge version.","context":["The design of the Hampton Endurance series represents a new, unique combination of safety, comfort, and efficiency in a serious cruising yacht. This is based on rigorous engineering as well as extensive experience. Few yachts in this size range embody both; though that may often be claimed or implied.\nThe builder’s objectives for these craft included high efficiency across a range of speeds, combined with comfort and safety on long ocean passages. Cruise speed was to be 10-12 knots, with an efficient top speed of 18-20 knots; and a very long range at 9-10 knots. Naval Architect and Licensed Professional Engineer Howard Apollonio was engaged to develop the overall design of these vessels. He notes that it is hard to make a slow boat go fast; but much easier to make a fast boat go slow. The trick is to do so efficiently.\nThe beginning of this solution was the design of the Hampton Hybrid Hull. Its roots go back to Apollonio’s development of split-chine hulls starting in 1977. With his specialty in hydrodynamics, he studied the shortcomings of conventional hulls with respect to wavemaking resistance. To overcome these, he divided the forward chine into upper and lower parts to reduce bow wave while retaining dynamic lift and spray control. The forward cross sections were made to resemble those of traditional round-bottom hulls to insure a smooth ride in waves. A combination of race boat and sailboat characteristics was employed to insure superior directional stability in following seas. Decades of successful versions of this hull form led to constant praise of Apollonio’s designs, large and small, fast and slow, including fine performance in severe sea states.\nThe Hampton Hybrid Hull combines this experience with recent design changes to these hulls where the lower chine actually disappears in the forward of the hull. That also eliminates wave slap at rest. This, and changes to the upper chine, required very careful development to be successful. That was then proven in extensive model tank tests of this hull in rough and smooth water. The results confirmed the intended high efficiency in the targeted speed range, combined with exceptional seakeeping in very rough conditions, including sea state 4. The latter actually exceeded that of good 80-90 ft hulls in the same sea states at the same speeds. In the model tank test, significant (average of the 10% highest) vertical accelerations were low at 0.34 to 0.47g’s at speeds of 8 to 20 knots in sea state 4, with a 59 ft. boat length. The deck stayed dry in all cases.\nIt should be noted that this hull overcomes the often-cited limitation of so-called “hull speed” at speed/length ratio (SLR) of 1.34. Its speed of 12-18 knots represents SLR = 1.57-2.35. This is in the pre-planning “hump” speed realm, which is a notoriously difficult regime to operate for most boats. And, this model has a displacement/length ratio around 240, which makes it far from a lightweight. Another part of this hull’s success is the careful proportioning of its basic hull form. The center of gravity and center of buoyancy at about 56% of waterline length sets the stage for fine waterlines forward and optimal stern fineness (while preventing squat). These, and the modest prismatic coefficient Cp=0.67, all match the criteria for efficient operation in the planned speed range. Carefully integrated propeller tunnels and a keel of modest depth provide protection without compromising shallow draft (around5 feet).\nOnto and into this superior hull form is placed a spacious, comfortable interior. This benefited from Apollonio’s long, successful experience designing motoryachts large and small. Attractive, interesting public and private areas are tastefully and ergonomically arranged and proportioned. Rails and soft features enhance safe movement in rough conditions. A combined social bridge and galley area make for a friendly pilothouse. The helm station can be isolated from the rest of the interior with curtains for night navigation. The partially separated salon provides a separate conversation area; yet is open enough for socializing with the galley and pilothouse. The large aft deck with built-in seating and table is an ideal location for fair weather gatherings. So too is the seating forward of the protective Portuguese bridge. An expansive flying bridge features abundant seating, storage, bar, and meal-prep areas, covered with a well-styled hardtop canopy. The lower level features a grand ensuite master stateroom with king size bed and several arrangement options. A queen bed ensuite VIP stateroom is forward. Between is a guest cabin that can have twin berths, or over-under berths and an ensuite head. Optional crew quarters are offered aft of the finely finished, ergonomically arranged, professional engine room. The optional skyloungeversion, opening up tremendous space and arrangement possibilities. Hampton’s renowned quality of construction and finish completes this picture, and insures lasting value.\nIt was deemed essential that the foregoing attributes be packaged in such a way as to meet the highest stability criteria. The Hampton Endurance series was designed and evaluated to meet or exceed the Weather Criterion stability standard of the US Coast Guard for licensed passenger vessels in exposed waters service (Subchapter T, type S vessels, Subpart 170.170), proven for decades to insure passenger safety. Each and every Endurance LRC is, and has been, incline stability tested to determine the G.M. value for confirming compliance to above mentioned standard. Abundant initial stability, illustrated by high GMt values about 3.4 to 4.0 ft fully loaded, insure a solid, confidence-inspiring feel to the Endurance craft. At the same time, roll stiffness is kept to comfortable levels by tuning the roll period to a particular range of values. Historical and engineering research have shown that the ratio of natural roll period divided by waterline beam (Tn/B) should be about 0.25 - 0.27. Above that, boats feel increasingly rolly-poly. Below that, roll becomes increasingly stiff and quick. The Endurance vessels have Tn/B about 0.25 - 0.27, with a safe feel and long-term comfort.\nWhile the Hampton Endurance yachts are neither particularly light nor heavy, it should be noted that weight has little to do with comfort. A heavy boat may feel good a first, but will often roll a lot at sea, requiring stabilization for acceptable ride. Technically, for a particular vessel configuration, adding weight will reduce stability, unless it is added quite low in the boat. Hence, it is best to keep a boat light, within reason. A prominent shipyard long ago pointed out that the lightest versions of a standard series of passenger vessels also rode best in head and following seas, compared with their heavier counterparts. They did not have to plow through waves and take green water aboard; rather rode partly over waves, with acceptable motions. The other down-side of extra weight, as in most displacement hull craft, is that added weight always increases power required and fuel consumption at a given speed. Hence all boats should have weight kept to practical minimums. Practical includes cost and suitably rugged construction, as in the case of the Endurance series.\nIn summary, the Hampton Endurance series of yachts embodies a fully-integrated set of vital features that function together synergistically. Comfort, safety, efficiency, solid quality construction, and fine finish are smoothly blended into a yacht that feels right and works right, for confident passagemaking and lasting value.","Catalina has long been the largest All-American family cruiser company, building what sailors might call “standard” boats. Moving up from the popular 30ft to 45ft sizes puts the company into “yacht” territory, and the new Catalina 545, winner of the SAIL magazine 2020 Best Boats award for “Best Monohull Flagship,” adds some real innovations to its traditional features.\nDESIGN & CONSTRUCTION\nThe obvious new feature of the Catalina 545 is found at the sheer, where designer/builder Gerry Douglas incorporates a molded box-beam collar to replace the conventional hull/deck joint, toerail, stanchion bases, scuppers and anchor platform, all at once. It’s one of those ideas that makes you slap your forehead and ask, “Of course. Why didn’t I think of that?”\nBesides providing great strength and rigidity, the collar adds a smooth integrated sheerline to the hull and conceals a set of scupper drains, which carry any water that collects on deck to below the waterline, thereby eliminating topside stains. The bowsprit also no longer has an added-on appearance but extends cleanly forward as a kind of extension of the overall hull structure. Perhaps we will see future Catalinas built with sheer-line collars as well.\nThe forestay extends nearly to the masthead, and a large light-air headsail can be easily attached to the tip of the anchor platform. The tall mast is stepped on the keel, not the deck, and those more technically minded might be tempted to install a clear plastic door in the forward cabin to display the gorgeous turnbuckles and chainplates. The high air draft and moderately deep keel mean this is will not be an Intracoastal Waterway boat.\nThe electrical system is simple, neat and conventional, with individually wired circuits leading to breakers on a regular panel. Douglas values easy maintenance and cited reports of troublesome distributed systems on other builders’ boats as his reason for doing wiring the “old fashioned” way.\nThe big house battery bank is easy to reach through a large hatch in the saloon sole. There is also excellent access to all filters and through-hulls for the engine.\nThe detailing aboard the Catalina 545’s deck is a testament to the builder’s experience and attention to customer feedback. The cockpit seats and deck, for example, are all at the same level and backrests are low, making movement in and out of the cockpit that much safer and easier. A steel railing, not a wire lifeline, wraps around the cockpit and extends well forward. Secure handrails provide grab points the rest of the way to the bow, and that same sheerline collar creates a high toerail/bulwark to help keep crew aboard as they make their way along the expansive side decks.\nThe cockpit is designed for shorthanded sailing, with control lines leading to powered winches near the twin wheels. It will also be easy to thread new lines for various headsails through the oversize covers. The controls, sightlines, seating and helm position all seem right for an average-size sailor.\nThe thoughtful layout works at anchor, too. The big teak cockpit table, for example, includes a fridge and is easily removable for varnishing/maintenance over the winter. Similarly, the starboard-side seat flips up to create a berth for sleeping under the stars.\nThe huge anchor locker includes carbon-fiber partitions to reduce weight while retaining maximum strength. It also serves as a crash compartment, being fully isolated from the rest of the hull.\nAstern, the dinghy garage is also kept completely separate from the hull for safety. There’s excellent access to the rudder post and steering cables inside. With the hydraulic transom platform in the raised position, a set of handy steps molded into its slightly reverse outward face ensures it's still easy to climb aboard.\nThe overall impression of the Catalina 545 interior is of a simple, light, pretty apartment with quality teak and maple furnishings. The plentiful portlights, clear hatches and big square hull windows all have light-darkening shades. It’s all distinctly American, although I cannot explain how the designer achieved that effect.\nThe saloon includes plenty of room for eight people in two areas, with movable hassocks for added seating and a starboard settee that pulls out to form a double berth. A pretty dropleaf table and a large motorized combination TV/nav display rises from a low bulkhead complete the setting.\nAn efficient galley to port has stowage and fridge/freezer capacity for extended cruising. There are two small step-downs to the galley and the aft cabins, bothersome tripping points until you get used to them, but also necessary for headroom.\nThe owner’s cabin forward features a queen-size berth on a center island with clear access to the sides, a reading nook and an abundance of stowage. The port aft cabin of our test boat had a double berth, while the starboard aft cabin sported a pair of motorized twin berths that could whir together to form a double.\nDouglas designs boats for sail reduction at around 15 knots, but we would not have that on the bright, clear autumn day of our test sail off Annapolis, Maryland. Instead, it was a pleasant, easy sail with 8 to 10-knot winds, gradually dropping to around 5 knots. I would be the first reviewer to sail this boat, which was untuned and still in its final assembly stage having just made its debut at the Annapolis boat show.\nI measured 5.8 knots of boatspeed close-hauled before the wind dropped. The boat handled well, but the fluky wind precluded being able to accurately gauge our tacking angles. Our test boat had a roller-furling 135 percent genoa and an in-mast furling mainsail. The double-ended German mainsheet system worked well. I liked having all the controls to hand at the helm and completely clear of the guest area farther forward in the cockpit. The uncluttered space stretching between the transom and companionway will make daysailing with friends delightful.\nMany thanks to Catalina for putting the tachometer up on the steering pedestal within easy view! All too many builders overlook this important detail. A 2,800 rpm setting produced 8 knots of boatspeed, while a wide-open throttle added another knot. There was a bit of prop vibration, and the noise level was higher than normal for a boat this size. Douglas said he plans to add more soundproofing to the engine compartment.\nThe turning circle was just one boatlength, and the boat stopped accurately, although it tended to kick markedly to port in reverse. This was easily solved aboard our test boat, however, thanks to a massive double jet-drive thruster system that moved both bow and stern, slipping the vessel in any direction, including sideways.\nThe Catalina 545 is an attractive, competent, comfortable coastal cruiser that can go offshore with ease—a straightforward, well-planned vessel that should take a couple or a family many miles with only simple maintenance.\nLOA 56ft 2in LWL 50ft 6in\nBEAM 15ft 6in DRAFT 6ft 3in\nSAIL AREA 1,350ft2 (100% FT)\nFUEL/WATER (GAL) 130/225\nENGINE 115hp Yanmar\nBallast Ratio 39\nSA/D Ratio 20\nWhat do these ratios mean?

{"question":"As a safety equipment specialist, I'd like to understand the durability differences between cotton and fiberglass when exposed to heat - can you compare their heat resistance properties?","answer":"Fiberglass and cotton have distinct heat resistance properties. Fiberglass, being made of extremely fine glass filament woven into a binding agent, demonstrates strong heat resistance and is commonly used in face shields to protect against heated particles, sparks, and molten metal. Cotton, while natural, can be made fire-resistant with special treatment and offers more breathability than synthetics. In terms of specific heat tolerance, cotton begins to show degradation at relatively lower temperatures - it starts to turn yellow after several hours at 120°C and decomposes markedly at 150°C. Due to oxidation, cotton becomes severely damaged after a few minutes at 240°C, after which it will burn in air. This comparison shows that fiberglass generally offers superior heat resistance for industrial protection compared to cotton.","context":["Every day, countless people around the world put themselves at risk in the workplace. Construction workers are surrounded by weighty objects. Tractor and forklift operators work with heavy machinery. Employees of chemical manufacturers are constantly surrounded by hazardous substances.\nTo do their jobs efficiently and safely, all these workers rely on PPEs, or personal protective equipment, to reduce risks. But what are these equipment pieces made of?\nMade of extremely fine glass filament woven into a binding agent, fibreglass is one of the most commons substances in PPEs. In its clear, plastic form, fibreglass is often employed to protect the eyes and face.\nTinted fibreglass goggles protect your people’s eyes from irritants and particles. These types of goggles are indispensable to welders. Fibreglass face shields are resistant to heat as well, protecting the wearer’s face from heated particles, like sparks and molten metal. Fibreglass can also be used to create or reinforce hardhats.\nThe importance of neon dyes to personal protection cannot be overstated. Thanks to the fluorescent qualities of these dyes and paints, workers can easily spot each other and avoid accidents.\nFor example, high visibility vests ensure drivers and other operators of heavy machinery can see the wearer, protecting them from getting run over. Aside from their importance in protective clothing, neon dyes are also integral in paints. Strips of neon paint designate lanes in warehouses and loading docks. They’re also used to demarcate hazardous areas, such as deposit zones for heavy loads and places with high-voltage components.\nRubber is an incredibly versatile substance. Aside from its flexibility and elasticity, different types of rubber also resist different kinds of chemicals. Basic rubber gloves and aprons can resist household cleaning chemicals and solvents. Specialised types of rubber gloves and aprons handle more specific chemicals.\nFor example, butyl rubber gloves can resist different types of acid including nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Meanwhile, nitrile rubber gloves are resistant to chlorinated solvents. Finally, natural rubber or latex PPEs are suited to handling water-based acids and solutions, as well as alkali and salts.\nNatural leather, once properly cured and processed, is suitably resistant to fire and dry heat. There’s a reason that for centuries, blacksmiths and people in similar professions used it to make their gloves and aprons. Leather also offers basic protection from wounds, such as abrasions and incisions.\nAlthough they’re not as strong and resilient as most synthetic materials, natural substances still offer a measure of protection against harm. This is because some synthetic materials, particularly some kinds of plastics, are even more flammable than natural materials.\nFor example, with special treatment, cotton and wool become fire-resistant not to mention they’re more comfortable and breathable than synthetics. Disposable paper suits are often used to protect people from irritants, like dust.\nNow more than ever, we need to understand PPEs. These materials are often the only things standing between people and grievous harm. Thanks to these assorted substances, hardworking men and women can continue to provide society with the products and services it needs.","Cotton fiber is a cellulosic fiber. It has worldwide popularity for its variety of use. Cotton fiber is the most used fibers for producing various types of fabric through all over the world. Cotton Fabrics are comfortable to wear than the other fibers product. It is comfort to wear in all the season.\nLike all the textile fibers, cotton has its own physical and chemical properties which are required to know for better processing in spinning, weaving, knitting, dyeing, printing as well as finishing. Here, I have written about physical and chemical properties of cotton fiber.\nPhysical Properties of Cotton: Physical properties of cotton fibers are given below:\n- Color: The color of cotton fiber could be white, creamy white, bluish white, yellowish white or grey.\n- Tensile Strength: Cotton is moderately strong fiber. It has a tenacity of 3-5 gm/den. The strength is greatly affected by moisture; the wet strength of cotton is 20%, which is higher than dry strength.\n- Elongation at break: Cotton does not stress easily. It has an elongation at break of 5-10%.\n- Elastic Recovery: Cotton is inelastic and rigid fiber. At 2% extension it has an ER of 74% and at 5% extension it has an ER of 45%.\n- Specific Gravity: Specific gravity is 1.54.\n- Moisture Regain (MR %): Standard moisture regain is 8.5.\n- Effect of Heat: Cotton has an excellent resistance to degradation by heat. It begins to turn yellow after several hours at 1200C and decomposes marked by at 1500C. As a result of oxidation, cotton is severally damaged after few minutes at 2400C. Cotton burns in air.\n- Effect of Sun Light: There is a gradual loss of strength when cotton is exposed to sun light and the fiber turn yellow. The degradation of cotton by oxidation is done when heat is promoted and encouraged. By sun light much of the damage is caused by UV-light and by the shorten weaves of visible light.\n- Effect of Age: Cotton shows a small loss of strength when stored carefully. After 50 years of storage cotton may differ only slightly from the new fibers.\nChemical Properties of Cotton: Cotton is a natural cellulosic fiber and it has some chemical properties. Chemical properties of the cotton fiber are given below:\n- Effect of Acids: Cotton is attacked by hot dilute acids or cold concentrated acids which it disintegrates. It is not affected by acids.\n- Effects of Alkalis: Cotton has an excellent resistance to alkalis. It swells in caustic alkalis ( NaOH) but it does not damaged. It can be washed repeatedly in soap solution without any problem.\n- Effect of Organic Solvent: Cotton has high resistance to normal cleaning solvents. Cotton is dissolved by the copper complexes, such as cuprammonium hydroxide, cupriethylene diamine and concentrated 70% H2SO4.\n- Effects of Insects: Cotton is not attacked by moth-grubs or beetles.\n- Effect of Micro Organism: Cotton is attacked by fungi and bacteria. Mildews will feed on cotton fabric, rotting and weakling the materials. Mildews and bacteria will flourish on cotton under hot and humid condition. They can be protected by impregnation with certain types of chemicals. Copper Nepthenate is one of the chemical.\nI think above physical and chemical properties will help us to be careful about the processing of cotton in the different stages of processing from spinning to garments making."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9fd23c62-8e03-4e3c-9741-d4ef822b707c>","<urn:uuid:0c94547c-513f-4485-8185-b194d2815a2e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Stravinsky's instrumentation changes compare with jazz artists' instrumental innovations?","answer":"Stravinsky expanded traditional instrumentation by using a 32-piece chamber orchestra instead of the original 4 players, adding unconventional elements like solo trombone and virtuosic double bass parts. He also introduced new playing techniques like glissandi and specific bow instructions. Similarly, jazz innovators pushed instrumental boundaries - Pat Metheny pioneered guitar synthesizers, Bill Evans developed new piano voicing techniques using rootless chords, and Thelonious Monk created a distinctive 'stabbing' piano style. Both Stravinsky and jazz artists used their expanded instrumental techniques to create unique timbres and sounds while building upon traditional foundations.","context":["- Russian composer who brote this ballet piece after the 1st World War\n- Other compositions The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913) used massive symphony orchestras\n- After war performances had to be less flamboyant\n- Director of Ballet Russes Serge Diaghilec asked Stravinsky to take 18thC composer Pergolesi's work and rearrange it\n- Vivo (cello sonata) is by Pergolesi, Sinfonia (Trio Sonata) is actually by Gallo and Gavotta (keyboard piece) is by Monza.\n- The suite completed in 1922.\n- First performed in 1922 in Boston, USA by Pierre Monteux who championed Stranvinsky's music.\n1 of 14\nRepresented reaction against overblown emotions and formlessness of late 19thC music.\n- Movements in neo-classicism were short -

Those who follow try to copy their sound and then move beyond to be creative forces in their own right. Despite living in different eras, and representing different niches of jazz, some qualities are common to all of them. Qualities like passion, leadership, virtuosity, and fearless innovation.\nRead on to discover six of the true “giants” of jazz improvisation through the ages and what you can learn from them to inspire your own improvising.\n1. Charlie Parker\nCharlie Parker created the blueprint for post-swing jazz improvisation. Even now, 70 years later, musicians play the phrases and techniques he created. Serious jazz students internalize Charlie Parker’s personal language of jazz improvisation through transcribing and playing his solos, analyzing them in detail, and learning specific quotes (i.e. musical phrases) in all the keys.\nSo why is Charlie Parker so important to the jazz scene?\n- He was the guy who started the bebop movement, which transformed jazz music into a fine art form for listening rather than dancing.\n- He was the first true modern jazz virtuoso, who mastered complex harmonies, rhythms, and melodies.\n- He popularized a songwriting format for jazz by borrowing and altering chord changes from existing songs and creating new melodies on top.\nListen to Parker’s solo on “Confirmation” starting at [0:43]. It’s a virtual catalogue of his trademark techniques—endless arpeggios, chromatic lines, impeccable sense of swing and instrumental dexterity. His influence extended beyond the jazz world: the cartoon Woody Woodpecker laugh is actually an imitation of a famous Charlie Parker lick.\n2. John Coltrane\nStorming the scene in the 1950s, John Coltrane collaborated with such seminal artists as Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk. Coltrane’s unmatched virtuosity has carved him a place as one of most sophisticated jazz improvisers to date.\nColtrane’s groundbreaking improvisations are studied intensely by many jazz aspirants. He explored the frontiers of tonality with pieces like “Giant Steps”, and helped define modal jazz, free jazz, and beyond with works like “My Favorite Things” and “A Love Supreme.”\nLike Charlie Parker in his day, Coltrane’s new harmonic concept challenged his peers. When he broke free from traditional tonal chord progressions with “Giant Steps” he was pretty much the only one to nail it. The harmonic changes of this record became known as the Coltrane Changes. The chord roots are all a major third apart, thus integrating whole-tone scales, interesting sequential patterns, and the scale now known as Coltrane’s Pentatonic (playing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th degree of the current chord).\nBesides constantly shifting tonality every bar, “Giant Steps” is also played at an insane 300 BPM. Watch this animated sheet music video of “Giant Steps” and see the Coltrane Changes and Coltrane Pentatonics come to life in his jaw-dropping solo [0:35].\n3. Bill Evans\nA quiet guy, Bill Evans made a huge impact. Among the people he influenced are Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, and Keith Jarrett His exquisite taste in harmony—he was left handed which explains his complex accompaniment—and melodic approach earned Evans an iconic status among generations of jazz musicians. A little-known fact is that he helped develop George Russell’s Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization. This concept was the foundation for styles like Modal Jazz and later on, Fusion.\nThis is one of the most famous performances by Bill Evans called “Waltz For Debby”. His solo starts at [2:43].\nAs did Charlie Parker, Bill Evans created a blueprint of jazz improvisation, but for pianists. His beautiful lines, stylish accompaniment and perfect phrasing are studied by all pianists, and pretty much any jazz musician. Bill Evans created a new way for pianists to comp by using rootless voicings. He used the 3rd and the 7th degrees of the chord (these are responsible for the minor, major qualities of the chord) combined with upper structures, or embellishment tones. He left the root of the chord to the upright bass.\n4. Miles Davis\nKnown as not one of the most pleasant guys in the scene but, nonetheless, perhaps the most important genre innovator in jazz. Miles Davis started his journey alongside Charlie Parker playing bebop and moved forward helping to shape Cool Jazz, Modal Jazz, and Fusion.\nHe created one of the most-played jazz records of all time, was known to nurture the talents of the most important musicians in the generations to come.\nMiles’ style of improvisation is usually very laid back, relying more on melody rather than playing the changes. Jump to [1:15] to hear an example of his improvisation. You can always recognize his “cool” approach when listening to his solo. He is great at working with motifs and developing them from a single note to a beautiful flow of ideas, just like classical composers would do.\n5. Thelonious Monk\nThelonious Monk is an amazing example of a pianist with a strong signature sound. While it may be somewhat difficult to distinguish between instrumentalists at times, you will never confuse his seemingly-sloppy piano stabbing style for anyone else’s. Making an enormous contribution to the overall repertoire of jazz standards, Monk is a musician and composer to be reckoned with.\nHere’s a recording of “Blue Monk”. The tenor sax solo starts at [1:04]. Pay attention to the quirky accompaniment provided by Thelonious Monk: he was one of the first guys to inadvertently “brand” instrumental playing. Monk’s solo starts at [3:08]: notice the deliberate silences and the staccato approach. Additionally, he plays a lot with sparse intervals, and all with a certain swagger and rough humor.\n6. Pat Metheny\nWinner of a total of 20 Grammy awards, Pat Metheny is one of the pioneers of Jazz Fusion. Drawing a lot of his influences from the sounds of South America, Middle East and the works of classical composers (especially Claude Debussy) this guy can really paint a whole sonic landscape in front of you.\nAlso known for his work with synthesizers, he was one of the first musicians to start using a guitar synthesizer. Check his solo starting at [6:06], on “Imaginary Day”. One of the improvisation techniques that he uses a lot is a highly modal approach with diatonic and chromatic sequences. All coupled with tons of FX processing on his guitar (often made to sound like a trumpet), his shows are one of the most spectacular in the jazz realm.\nOn the Shoulders of Giants\nAs Igor Stravinsky, a great composer of the 20th century, once said, “Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.” The giants of jazz spend lifetimes acquiring their sound and style, leaving behind the gift of their massive legacies. As jazz improvisers, why not open our ears, hands, and minds to receive these gifts?\nAs children, we mastered the language of our parents through listening and practicing our skills until we could reproduce the sounds. Eventually we learned to express our most complex thoughts with fluency. So we can stand on the shoulders of the jazz giants by listening, transcribing, and practicing their language of jazz until it becomes our own.\nWant to grow your jazz improvisation to massive proportions? Here’s the recipe: grab your favorite jazz solo, find your favorite lick, sing it, transcribe it, learn it on your instrument, and transpose it. Each small bite of this “giant food” will leave you wanting more!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:be80df7d-9848-4098-943a-1ddcdd7fdef3>","<urn:uuid:27faac0b-942e-4db7-9807-43ae02acacd2>"],"error":null}

You must be able to influence others with your communication skills and ability to establish rapport with them. Your ability to understand the business strategy, as well as the financial aspects, is important.\nAnalytical skills: As an analyst, you will look hard at numbers and data to determine courses of action. It is critical that you provide examples of times in your past where you had to interpret data and solve problems. Since you have no authority over your peers/team, you secure their agreement by making effective use of data and facts. Discuss any finance case studies that you did in a business class or masters program. PC spreadsheet skills are also important.\nProject management skills: You must be able to handle multiple projects from start to finish. You will define project scope, develop specifications, analyze resource requirements, establish timelines, manage budgets, resolve conflicts, work with external vendors, and manage projects to conclusion. Use projects you managed in the military as proof of your project management skills.\nPossible Job Titles:\nSample Job Description – Finance Please keep in mind the following job description is just one of many possible Finance job descriptions.\nYou will begin your Finance career as a member of an audit/business process review team (3-5 people per team). In this role, you will work on projects designed to obtain an understanding of business systems controls for various functions and activities throughout the company. You will work with internal business groups to evaluate processes and systems and identify opportunities for improvement. While you will be responsible for the analysis of financial and operational data, you will also be expected to go beyond the numbers to understand the effectiveness and efficiency of their business condition to include strategy, processes, technology, risk, controls and more. You will identify business trends, develop root causes of business issues and proactively identify opportunities to reduce costs or improve productivity. As a result of your review, you will be actively involved with management, making oral and written recommendations and presenting agreed-upon actions to improve operations and reduce costs. Finance serves as the primary “feeder” group for talented professionals and, as a result of the exposure and valuable experience you gain in this role, you will be well positioned for roles of increased responsibility within the company.","Who is an IT Project Manager?\nAn IT (Information Technology) Project Manager is a professional responsible for overseeing and managing the planning, execution, and completion of IT projects within an organization.

{"question":"What are the reading trends among young people in Ghana, and how has mobile technology changed access to books in developing countries?","answer":"In Ghana, young readers historically had limited access to local literature, mainly reading foreign works like Enid Blyton, Nancy Drew, and Mill and Boon novels. There was a particular scarcity of African young adult literature. However, mobile technology has revolutionized reading access in developing countries, including Ghana. According to UNESCO research, 62% of people are reading more thanks to mobile phones, with readers citing convenience, affordability, and lack of access to physical books as key reasons. Mobile reading has become particularly impactful in areas where traditional books are scarce and expensive - for instance, while a paperback bestseller in Zimbabwe costs around $12, reading a book on mobile costs only 5-6 cents.","context":["Ask a Ghanaian (adult) reader what books she read in her teens and she will list books by Enid Blyton, the Nancy Drew mysteries and Mill and Boon romance novels. Oh, and Tintin comics. What you will not hear are books by Ghanaian and African writers. There were very few books written for Ghanaian/African teenagers and young adults when I was growing up. So, I skipped that crucial stage in my reading life and proceeded straight to “serious” African literature, since there were plenty of those books in my household. The dearth of African YA literature persists. But, the publication of Between Sisters (2010) mollifies our screams for redress.\nThis is the story of Gloria Bampo, a teenager who lives with her parents and sister, Effie, in a suburb of Accra. The novel begins on the fateful day that Gloria will receive her Junior Secondary School (JSS) examination results. Like numerous Ghanaian teenagers, these results will likely decide her entire future.\n“Nii Tetteh, Kofi Andah, Gloria Bampo…” she (her teacher) called, checking our names off a list.\nWe made a single fine and walked up the corridor toward the office. In our school we filed for everything!\nWe crowded around the notice board searching for our names. I held back, almost too afraid to look.\nThere was my name, third on the list. I was the first to fail. Out of fifteen subjects I had failed thirteen, passing only needlework and art.\nGloria’s father has been unemployed for two years and her ailing mother supports the family on meager profits earned from selling medicinal herbs. They cannot afford to pay for Gloria to re-take the JSS exams nor can they afford to enroll her in any vocational training. It is decided, without any input from Gloria, that she will work as a nanny and a housekeeper for Christine, a medical doctor. The set-up is presented as a living arrangement between ‘sisters’ even though there is no discernible relationship between Gloria and Christine. Effie, always the bold and outspoken sibling, will not be fooled and says “only the poor give away their daughters like this”.\nGloria handles her duties well and adapts to Christine’s middle-class community of doctors and nurses. She is amiable and very quickly befriends some of the other teens in the community. Her new BFF is Bea, a smart and ambitious girl who is neglected by her doctor father. Gloria and Simon, an older teen, form a youth band and a budding romance begins between the two. What happens to Gloria is nothing out of the ordinary. Except she and Bea are attractive girls and older men begin to show interest in them; older men who are quite skilled in spotting a likely teenage prey. In West Africa, we call these predators sugar daddies. Their arsenal are their wealth and prestige. It was alarming to watch a sugar daddy prey on Gloria but also heartening to see how she negotiates her life through this particular mess. Gloria is a strong and an amazing young woman. She is very perceptive and brave. Her ability to understand and articulate what is happening to her and around her is extraordinary.\nIt is clear that the author, Adwoa Badoe, intends for the reader to always question how a young girl such as Gloria ends up as a nanny and housekeeper. Such an interrogation leads us back to Gloria’s education. Gloria is a functional illiterate after spending nine years in Ghana’s educational system. No one has bothered to read to or with this child; not her teachers and certainly not her parents. She was promoted year after year till she failed the first mandated national examinations. This happens to thousands of Ghanaian children every year who if they are to further their education, will need an extraordinary intervention. For Gloria, this intervention is Christine when the latter discovers Gloria’s problem. Most children in Gloria’s situation are not so lucky.\nThe book is also critical of the practice of unpaid housekeeping work when it is performed by young girls. Christine is to pay for Gloria’s vocational training and in gratitude, Gloria works for free. Christine admits to her husband that:\nI don’t pay her. I’ve taken over her upkeep and future education.\nHer husband is not pleased with the arrangement but Christine defends herself, saying “we are like a family”. To which her husband replies: “The operative word here is like, Christine.”\nI could go on about all the issues that are interrogated in this short book. But I will stop here. Adwoa Badoe, at the Accra launch of the West African edition of Between Sisters, admitted to using her writing to address social issues. And she has done that perfectly in this book. We , in Ghana, are quite familiar with Gloria’s journey. Most of us are either related to or we employed a girl like Gloria. Adwoa Badoe is imploring us to do right by them. To respect and uphold their human rights, especially their right to both a quality education and a protected and safe childhood.\nSo, is the book entertaining? Absolutely. It is well-written. The language is simple but its meaning profound. Urban Ghanaian life, with its sounds, sights and smells comes alive in this book. You will be crying and laughing with Gloria, who has a great voice and a strong point of view. I am proud of this Ghanaian girl. Now, all we need to do is get this book into the hands of young readers and of course, write more YA literature. We have readers to grow!\nBetween Sisters is highly recommended.\n(Review copy of book given to me by Smartline, the publishers of the West African edition.

One in three said they read to children from their mobile phones, and 90% of respondents said they would be spending more time reading on their mobile phones in the next year.\nThe study, says Unesco in its report, found that “people read more when they read on mobile devices, that they enjoy reading more, and that people commonly read books and stories to children from mobile devices”.\n“The study shows that mobile reading represents a promising, if still underutilised, pathway to text,” says the report, for which Unesco partnered with Worldreader – a global not-for-profit organisation that works to bring digital books to readers around the world – and Nokia. “It is not hyperbole to suggest that if every person on the planet understood that his or her mobile phone could be transformed – easily and cheaply – into a library brimming with books, access to text would cease to be such a daunting hurdle to literacy.”\nThe report’s author Mark West said that the key conclusion from the study was that “mobile devices can help people develop, sustain and enhance their literacy skills”.\n“This is important because literacy opens the door to life-changing opportunities and benefits”.\nReasons given by respondents for reading on mobiles were convenience, affordability and lack of access to books. In Zimbabwe, for example, Unesco said the cost of reading a book on a mobile was between 5 and 6 cents, while a paperback bestseller would cost around $12 (£7); in Nigeria, a mobile book would cost around 1 or 2 cents, based on a mobile broadband rate of $13 per 500 MB of data, while a child’s book would cost between $1 and $5.\nUnesco pointed to data from the UN, which shows that of the seven billion people on earth, more than six billion now have access to a working mobile phone. “Collectively, mobile devices are the most ubiquitous information and communication technology in history,” says Unesco. “More to the point, they are plentiful in places where books are scarce.”\nThe most popular genre for readers was romance, the survey found, with the “romance” icon on Worldreader Mobile receiving 17% of all 730,787 clicks during the research period. Nineteen of the top 40 books read during the study period were romance novels, with Ravinder Singh’s Can Love Happen Twice? the most popular book, followed by the Mills & Boon title The Price of Royal Duty in second, and the Bible in third.\nKwame Nkrumah’s The Great African and Nnedi Okorafor’s The Girl with the Magic Hands were also among the most read books between April and June 2013, with the most popular search terms over the period “sex”, “Bible” and “biology”. Chinua Achebe came in fourth, with “Things fall apart”, ahead of “love” in fifth. Religion was the second most popular genre, said Unesco.\nThe survey also found that mobile reading is a “huge tool of empowerment for women”, said Worldreader’s Nadja Borovac. While 77% of mobile readers in developing countries are male, women spend an average of 207 minutes per month reading on their mobile phones, compared to men’s 33 minutes. Unesco’s report points out that in sub-Saharan Africa, a woman is 23% less likely to own a mobile phone than a man, with the gap widening in the case of data-enabled phones. “Men use mobiles for reading most, but the most active readers are women,” said Borovac.\nAlmost two-thirds (60%) of respondents cited lack of content as the primary barrier to mobile reading, and a third said they were keen to read to their children from their mobiles if there were more child-friendly material available.\nOne respondent, Charles, a teacher in Zimbabwe, said he reads to his class from his mobile, and cited lack of printed content as his main reason for turning to his phone. “We live in a remote area where there are no libraries, and the books I have in my own small library are the ones which I have already read. So this is now giving me a chance to choose from a variety of fiction titles,” he said.\nBorovac said that mobile reading was “not a future phenomenon, but something which is happening today”.\n“It can really change people’s lives,” she said. “We work in countries where there is a serious shortage of books but where cell phones are plentiful … We are hoping people will realise the potential of mobile reading [as a result of the report], and that governments and partners will get behind not only us but other organisations using mobile technology to help provide learning and books, and help improve literacy skills.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:63c0be23-aefa-455b-82ce-82d3f102e8c6>","<urn:uuid:67b555ec-b2f3-4bc0-ab80-92800d5fca05>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying digestion - which takes longer to digest: root vegetables like carrots or proteins in the duodenum?","answer":"Root vegetables and protein digestion occur in different parts of the digestive system. In the duodenum, proteins undergo chemical digestion as part of the initial digestive process. Root vegetables like carrots specifically take about 50 minutes for complete digestion. However, these processes aren't directly comparable since protein digestion is just one step in the overall digestive process that takes between 24 and 72 hours total.","context":["The human digestive system\nFood must be digested because the molecules are insoluble and too big to cross membranes and be asborbed into the blood. They're also polymers and must be converted to their monomers so they can be rebuilt into molecules needed by body cells.\nDigestion and absorption occur in the gut, a long, hollow, muscular tube. It allows movement of its contents in one direction only. Each selection is specialised and performs certain steps in the processes of mechanical and chemical digestion and absorption. The food is propelled along the gut by peristalis (a wave of muscular contraction).\nFunctions of the gut\nThe human gut performs four main functions. These are:\n- Ingestion: taking food into the body through the mouth\n- Digestion: the breakdown of large insoluble molecules into soluble molecules that are small enough to be absorbed into the blood. Mechanical digestion is the cutting and crushing by teeth and muscle contractions of the gut wall, increases the surface area over which enzymes can act. Chemical digestion is by the secretion of digestive enzymes. Bile and stomach acid contribute to chemical digestion.\n- Absorption: the passage of molecules and ions through the gut wall into the blood\n- Egestion: the elimination of waste not made by the body, including food that can't be digested, e.g. cellulose\nFunctions of parts of the digestive system\n- Mouth - ingestion; digestion of starch\n- Oesophagus - carriage of food to the stomach\n- Stomach - digestion of protein\n- Duodenum - digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins\n- Ileum - digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins; Absorption of digested food\n- Colon - absorption of water\n- Rectum - storage of faeces\n- Anus - egestion\nThe structure of the gut wall\nThe gut wall consists of four tissue layers surrounding a cavity, the lumen of the gut. The proportions of the different layers in the gut vary depending on the function.\nThe outermost layer, the serosa, is tough connective tissue protecting the gut wall. The gut moves while processing food and the serosa reduces friction with other abdominal organs.\nThe muscle compromises two layers in different directions, the inner circular muscles and the outer longitudinal muscles. They make coordinated waves of contractions, peristalsis. Behind the ball of food, circular muscles contract and longitudinal muscles relax, pushing the food along.\nThe submucosa is connective tissue containing blood and lymph vessels, which remove the absorbed products of digestion, and nerves that co-ordinate perstalsis.\nThe mucosa is the innermost layer and lines the gut wall. Its epithelium secretes mucus, lubricating and protecting the mucosa. In some regions of the gut it secretes digestive juices and in others, absorbs digested food.\nAbsorption of nutrients by gut epithelial cells is only possible if the macromolecules are first digested into smaller molecules. Different enzymes digest different food molecules, more than one type is needed for the complete digestion of a particular food.\n- Carbohydrates -polysacharrides are digested into disaccharides and then monosaccharides. Amylase hydrolyses starch…","Digestion Time Of Various Foods\nDr. Michael Klaper believes inside every person, there's an innate force that wants to be healthy.Digestion time is basically a process of breaking down big food particles into individual molecules, tiny enough to squeeze through the intestinal lining into the bloodstream.\nYour body uses mechanical and chemical means to digest food and it varies depending on the individual according to Michael Picco, M.D With Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.\nThe digestion process takes between 24 and 72 hours, six to eight hours to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Then the food enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion and absorption of water. Elimination of undigested food residue usually begins after 24 hours. Complete elimination from the body may take several days.\"\nWater: when stomach is empty, leaves immediately and goes into intestines.\nJuices: Fruit vegetables, vegetable broth - 15 to 20 minutes.\nSemi-liquid: Blended salad, vegetables or fruits) - 20 to 30 min.\nFruits: Watermelon - 20 min.digestion time. Other melons - Cantaloupe, Cranshaw, Honeydew, etc. - 30 min. Oranges, grapefruit, grapes - 30 min. Apples, pears, peaches, cherries, etc. - digest in 40 min.\nVegetables: Raw tossed salad vegetables - tomato, lettuces, cucumber, celery, red or green pepper, other succulent vegetables - 30 to 40 min. digestion. - Steamed or cooked vegetables Leafy vegetables - escarole, spinach, kale, collards etc. - 40 min. - Zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, string beans, yellow squash, corn on cob - all 45 min. digestion time Root vegetables - carrots, beets, parsnips, turnips etc. - 50 min.\nSemi-Concentrated Carbohydrates - Starches.

Seeds - Sunflower, pumpkin, pepita, sesame - Digestive time approx. 2 hours. Nuts - Almonds, filberts, peanuts (raw), cashews, Brazil, walnuts, pecans etc. - 2 1/2 to 3 hours to digest.\nDairy: Skim milk, cottage or low fat pot cheese or ricotta - approx. 90 min. digestion time whole milk cottage cheese - 120 min. digestion whole milk hard cheese - 4 to 5 hours digestion time\nAnimal proteins: Egg yolk - 30 min. digestion time Whole egg - 45 min. Fish - cod, scrod, flounder, sole seafood - 30 min. digestion time Fish - salmon, salmon trout, herring, (more fatty fish) - 45 min. to 60 digestion time Chicken - 11/2 to 2 hours digestion time (without skin) Turkey - 2 to 2 1/4 hours digestion time (without skin) Beef, lamb - 3 to 4 hours digestion time Pork - 41/2 to 5 hours.\nTop Tips for Good Digestion\nHere are the time sequences for different food groups:\nIce cold drinks can slow down the digestive process, think of it as putting ice on a muscle. The muscle stiffens and does not function as well. Warm or room temperature water, juice, or decaf tea will encourage proper digestion. (Just remember the traffic jam – drink liquids prior to meals)\nIt is important to be regular with what you eat and the times of day you eat. Eating similar food groups and at similar times each day has a regulating effect on your digestive system. Regular in means regular out.\nOver consumption is the number one cause of indigestion. Our brain signals the feeling of fullness about ten minutes after we're actually full. So stop eating before you are full. Odds are you'll feel full ten minutes later!\nIncomplete chewing and talking while eating can cause premature swallowing. Our digestive systems are not designed to digest large pieces of food, when we put large pieces in our stomachs it can lead to incomplete digestion (aka: digestive discomfort).\nEating when you are rushed increases your stress and slows down the digestive process. Create a nice calming atmosphere when eating and make sure you can devote time to eating.\nWhen you slouch or hunch over extra pressure is put on the digestive organs in your abdomen. This extra pressure can cause poor digestion. You should practice sitting with your shoulders back and your chin tucked in. This will allow more room for the digestive organs and will help improve digestion.\nOur bodies, including our digestive system, slow down in the evening hours as it gets ready to rest and rejuvenate. When we put food into our stomachs at these late hours there are not enough digestive enzymes to properly digest it. This undigested food sits in your stomach and will often disturb your sleep.\nForget about not be active for 30 minutes after each meal. Increased physical activity actually helps jump start your digestive system and increases the production of digestive enzymes. This will lead to more complete digestion of your food and less digestive discomfort!\nSpinal twists allow excess toxins in the digestive system to be released, which has a calming effect. While in a cross legged sitting position, slowly turn to the right and hold while taking 5 deep breathes then repeat this process on the left side.

{"question":"What is the standard composition ratio of black powder used in fireworks, and how has this ratio evolved over time?","answer":"Modern black powder has a specific weight ratio of 75:15:10 for saltpetre to charcoal to sulfur respectively. This ratio has remained unchanged since around 1781. The original discovery was made by Chinese alchemists who used honey instead of charcoal, combined with sulfur and saltpetre (potassium nitrate). Later, charcoal replaced honey in the mixture, where sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while potassium nitrate serves as an oxidising agent.","context":["The colours in fireworks stem from a wide variety of metal compounds – particularly metal salts. ‘Salt’ as a word conjures up images of the normal table salt you probably use every day; whilst this is one type of salt (sodium chloride), in chemistry ‘salt’ refers to any compound that contains metal and non-metal atoms ionically bonded together. So, how do these compounds give the huge range of colours, and what else is needed to produce fireworks?\nThe most important component of a firework is, of course, the gunpowder, or ‘black powder’ as it is also known. It was discovered by chance by Chinese alchemists, who were in actuality more concerned with discovering the elixir of life than blowing things up; they found that a combination of honey, sulfur and saltpetre (potassium nitrate) would suddenly erupt into flame upon heating.\nThe combination of sulfur and potassium nitrate was later joined by charcoal in the place of honey – the sulfur and charcoal act as fuels in the reaction, whilst the potassium nitrate works as an oxidising agent. Modern black powder has a saltpetre to charcoal to sulfur weight ratio of 75:15:10; this ratio has remained unchanged since around 1781.\nThe combustion of black powder doesn’t take place as a single reaction and so the products can be rather complicated. The closest thing to a representative equation for the process is shown below, with charcoal referred to by its empirical formula:\n6 KNO3 + C7H4O + 2 S → K2CO3 + K2SO4 + K2S + 4 CO2 + 2 CO + 2 H2O + 3 N2\nVariation in pellet size of the gunpowder and the amount of moisture can be used to significantly increase the burning time for the purposes of pyrotechnics.\nAs well as gunpowder, fireworks will contain a ‘binder’ – used to hold the components together, and also to reduce the sensitivity to both shock and impact. Generally they will take the form of an organic compound, often dextrin, which can then act as a fuel after ignition. An oxidising agent is also necessary to produce the oxygen required to burn the mixture; these are usually nitrate, chlorates, or perchlorates.\nThe ‘stars’ contained within the rocket body contain the metal powders or salts that give the firework its colour. They will often be coated in gunpowder to aid in ignition. The heat given off by the combustion reaction causes electrons in the metal atoms to be excited to higher energy levels. These excited states are unstable, so the electron quickly returns to its original energy (or ground state), emitting excess energy as light. Different metals will have a different energy gap between their ground and excited states, leading to the emission of different colours. This is the exact same reason that different metals give different flame tests, allowing us to distinguish between them. The colours emitted by different metals are shown in the graphic at the top of the page.\nIt’s the metal atom present in the compound that’s important, then – but some compounds are better than others. Hygroscopic compounds (those that attract and hold water) aren’t much use in fireworks, as they can render the mixture damp and hard to burn. Some colours are also notoriously hard to produce. The copper containing compounds tend to be unstable at higher temperatures, and if it reaches these temperatures, it breaks apart, preventing the blue colouration from being exhibited. For this reason, it’s often said that you can judge the quality of a fireworks display on the quality of the blue fireworks! Purple is also quite hard to produce, as it involves the use of blue-causing compounds in combination with red-causing ones.\nIf a more thorough analysis with a much more detailed overview of the chemistry involved is the kind of thing that you think you might be into, then you could check out Michael S Russel’s ‘The Chemistry of Fireworks’, an RSC publication which can be read for free, in parts, on Google Books.\n(Note: you can still reach the previous, older version of this graphic in PDF format by clicking here).\nReferences & Further Reading"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9285d1d3-cce3-49a5-b30b-dea2f21db781>"],"error":null}

Turning your own pizza cutter handle as a tool for this task adds a touch of class to the occasion.\nYou won’t need much wood for this project — which, it should go without saying, makes a great gift idea. Glue up your scraps to make a blank, or take advantage of the opportunity to purchase an inexpensive turning blank and try a material new to you. We recommend that the blank you choose can produce 1″ minimum diameter finished size — but the length and the shape are up to your imagination and sense of style.\nYou’ll find the actual slicing blade, plus a 5/16″ threaded insert, available as the Pizza Cutter Turning Kit at www.rockler.com (item 34913 for chrome finish; item 55423 for pewter). You’ll also need a threaded mandrel with a 1″ shoulder and 5/16-18 threads (item 43469, also available at rockler.com).\nYour first step for the pizza cutter handle blank is to drill a 1/2″ hole into one end. Mark the center of your blank to determine the location of this hole, and bore the hole using either a drill press or a handheld drill.\nIf you have a Jacobs chuck for your lathe, put it in the headstock. If you don’t have one, go ahead and start turning the handle between centers. If using a Jacobs chuck, screw the threaded insert that came with your Pizza Cutter Kit into the hole you just drilled now, using an Allen wrench. A few drops of CA glue will help the insert stay put for the short and long term. (And, if you’re using acrylics for your handle blank, heating the threaded insert first will make for easier installation.)\nNext, you’ll want to mount the threaded mandrel onto your lathe, using a Jacobs chuck (about a $60 accessory). Mount the blank onto the mandrel, and move the tailstock over to make contact with the handle blank. You’ll need to make sure your blank can spin clear of the tool-rest.\nNow it’s time for turning your pizza cutter handle to your desired shape. This is an opportunity for creativity, as you can choose a shape that’s attractive to you and feels comfortable in your hand. Stop turning every so often and check the “feel” of your handle to see if it’s what you want. You could also add some decorative elements, such as lines cut into your handle with a parting tool.\nSince the mandrel’s 1″ shoulder matches the diameter of your hardware, you have a visual guide to know when the blank is turned down to the size you need to correctly match your handle to the hardware.\nAt the point when your blank is a size, shape and feel you like, stop turning and start sanding. Sand through the grits, up to at least 220-grit.\nYou can also apply finish on the lathe. Wipe-on shellac would be one option, as would a CA glue with accelerator.\nYour final step in creating your pizza cutter is to use the threaded portion attached to the blade and spin it into the grooves of the threaded insert mounted into your blank. (Insert it now if you didn’t earlier.) Be careful when assembling the parts — that 4″ pizza slicing blade is sharp!\nYou now have an attractive accessory for your pizza — any way you slice it.\nLooking for a place to store your pizza cutters?

US Patent Number US11639700B2 protects for close to 20 years some key features of an “Airframe integrated scramjet with fixed geometry and shape transition for hypersonic operation over a large Mach number range”. The air breathing and self-igniting scramjet engine invented by one of Hypersonix’s co-founders, Michael Smart, is able to accelerate between Mach 5 and Mach 12, depending on the selection of materials and manufacturing process chosen. This patent grows Hypersonix’s portfolio of patents to three, the other two being Australian innovation patents. Other features will also be covered as work progresses on our family of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.\nHypersonix’s unique design is fuelled by hydrogen, which has a higher ISP than other fuels used in Aerospace such as RP1 Kerosene. Apart from the Zero CO2 emissions non-polluting to the Earth’s atmosphere, clean burning hydrogen allows the engine to switch on and off several times during the flight, enabling a non-ballistic trajectory that cannot be achieved with conventional rockets, and also offers a longer range than other scramjets.\nSPARTAN’s fixed geometry is another unique feature which lends itself to rapid advanced manufacturing techniques. The first SPARTAN prototype was 3D printed in high temperature alloy material in December 2021 as part of an Accelerating Commercialisation Australia (ACA) grant awarded to Hypersonix.\nHypersonix also recently announced the completion of a manufacturing demonstrator using ceramic matrix composite (CMC) material for the SPARTAN engine which will allow the engine to withstand the higher temperatures expected at its top speed of Mach 12.\nHigh cadence flight and reusability are important aspects of the Hypersonix strategy. Hydrogen fuel is making this a reality as it burns cleanly, unlike other fuels such as Kerosene that leave residue, making it difficult to reuse quickly if at all. Whilst reusability is not a priority for other scramjet-powered hypersonic systems, it is a cornerstone of the Hypersonix product strategy.\nHypersonix’s ambition is to provide commercial solutions to the market for access to space and high-speed travel. Along the way Hypersonix has capitalised on the significant interest shown by Defence circles for the DART AE demonstrator flight vehicle in providing an advanced hypersonic test platform for collecting valuable data at hypersonic speeds.\nThanks to the SPARTAN design and the advanced manufacturing techniques and materials it uses, Hypersonix was selected for the Hypersonic & High-Cadence Airborne Test program (HyCAT), a solicitation by the Defense Innovation Unit in the US, part of the US Department of Defense (DoD) to deliver the DART AE flight vehicle.\nWhilst working with Defence as the first customer for Hypersonix, the company will pursue their commercial vision to apply their scramjet technology to develop a low cost and high cadence access to space solution for small satellites using green hydrogen, and in the longer term a hyperliner that may transport cargo and passengers from Sydney to New York City in just a few hours.\nDavid Waterhouse, Managing Director, Hypersonix added: “We are grateful for the DIU’s confidence in Hypersonix as our first customer so early in our history. Many technologies have found their first success in the Defence market before getting applied in the commercial world. And if there is one way for Hypersonix to grow the team faster in the current environment, the answer has to be to provide US Defence with unique capabilities.”\nMichael Smart said:” We are thrilled to have our original ideas recognised by a US patent for our SPARTAN scramjet design. Our team has already integrated my inventions and fresh ideas into various additional features that cement our technological leadership in hypersonic propulsion and flight.”\nHypersonix manufactures and operates hydrogen fuelled scramjet powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

{"question":"When preparing poultry and pork for cooking, what are the key differences in fat handling techniques between spatchcocking a turkey and preparing a pork roast?","answer":"For spatchcocking a turkey, the focus is on removing the backbone and breaking the breastbone to lay the bird flat for even cooking. The fat handling isn't emphasized in this process. In contrast, with pork roast preparation, fat handling is crucial - you should keep up to ¼ inch layer of fat on the surface, and always position the fat side up during cooking so it can melt and baste the meat, keeping it moist and flavorful. The melting fat will drip down into the roast during cooking, which helps prevent the meat from becoming dry.","context":["At Leaning 7 Farms, we love sharing cooking techniques and recipes that help our friends and neighbors prepare their pasture raised chickens and pasture raised turkeys. In this post, I'll use one of our pasture raised turkeys to demonstrate how to spatchcock a bird for the grill or smoker.\nWhat is \"spatchcock\"?\nSpatchcock, also called butterfly, is a technique to prepare poultry like whole turkeys and chickens to cook quickly and evenly on a grill or smoker. The idea and execution of this technique are straightforward. Simply remove the backbone and break breastbone to allow the bird to lay flat. In this post, I'll show you how to spatchcock a turkey, but the technique is the same for a chicken or other poultry species.\nWhy would one spatchcock a turkey?\nBy laying the bird flat on the grill, the different cuts of meat receive more uniform heat than they would if the bird were whole, which places the upper side (usually the breast) a considerable distance farther from the heat than the lower side placed on the grill. With a whole bird, the difference in heat applied from top to bottom can make it challenging to cook all of the cuts to the proper temperature without over-cooking some cuts, especially those on the bottom. Over direct coals, this is particularly an issue. However, spatchcocked turkeys will cook faster and more evenly even with indirect heating methods.\nHow to Spatchcock a Turkey\nStep 1: Place the bird breast side down on a cutting board.\nStep 2: With a boning knife, start at the neck and follow the spine to the first rib. Feel for the joint between the rib and the spine and use the knife to separate the joint so that the rib bone separates from the backbone. You want to separate the joint rather than breaking the bone or trying to cut through the bone.\nStep 3: Continue separating the ribs from the backbone working your way to the tail of the bird until you reach the pelvic joint where the thigh bone attaches to the pelvis and spine. Here, you will want to press down on the bird to separate the hip joint, freeing the thigh from the connection with the backbone.\nStep 4: Once you have the hip joint free, finish cutting down the backbone to extend your cut past the tail so that one half of the turkey is disconnected from the backbone.\nStep 5: Repeat steps 2-4 for the opposite side.\nStep 6: Break the breastbone. Place one hand on one side of the rib cage and press down while pressing down and away on the opposite side of the rib cage. You are trying to rotate the two sides of the rib cage away from each other enough to break the breast bone between the breasts.\nStep 7: Flip the bird breast side up and lay it out flat. That's it! Now the bird should lay flat with the cavity down as shown in the picture above.\nDon't forget to save the backbone along with the neck to make stock!","That fat is going to keep the pork loin moist and flavorful. When the time comes to put the roast into the pan, you’re always going to want to place the fat side up. This is so when the meat cooks, the fat melts off and drips down into the roast, infusing it with flavor.\nDo you take fat off pork before slow cooking?\nThe bottom side of the roast will have a cap of fat all over it – don’t remove that, it gives the pork some great flavor and keeps it from drying out while you cook it. Put the pork roast into the slow cooker with the fatty side up then as it cooks the fat will drip down basting the roast all during the cooking.\nShould I trim fat off pork roast?\nAny cut that is going to be roasted can have up to ¼ inch layer of fat left on the surface to prevent the meat from becoming too dry. … Trim Tenderloin – When preparing a pork tenderloin, trim off any excess fat that is surrounding the meat. Once the excess fat has been trimmed off, the silverskin must be removed.\nShould you cook meat fat side up or down?\nBesides not actually braising the brisket, cooking fat-side poses a risk: The melting fat cap will drip down the meat, potentially washing away the seasoning on the beef. 3. An additional disadvantage of cooking fat-side up is poor presentation.\nCan you overcook pork in a slow cooker?\nCan You Overcook Pork Shoulder in a Slow Cooker? If you keep your slow cooker set to “LOW”, it’s almost impossible to overcook it, as the pork shoulder self-bastes and stays moist. But the “HIGH” setting will boil the meat and you can overcook it if you cook it for too longer.\nCan you put raw pork in a slow cooker?\nYou can place raw pork directly into the slow cooker, but for a deeper, richer flavor without much added fat, first brown all sides of the cut briefly in heated olive oil. … Pour water, broth, juice, a sauce like tomato sauce, wine or a combination into the skillet, bring the mixture to a boil and pour it over the pork.\nDo you cook a pork tenderloin fat side up or down?\nPlace your pork loin fat side up in your roasting pan. By having the fat on top, you’re allowing the fat layer to baste the roast as it cooks. This is the step that keeps the pork from becoming dry and tough!\nDo you have to remove the silverskin from pork tenderloin?\nSilverskin is an extremely tough connective tissue commonly found on beef and pork tenderloins. Here’s how to remove it. Because it’s tough, chewy, and doesn’t melt during cooking like fat does, silverskin must be removed before cooking.\nShould I remove fat from pork shoulder?\nWhen it comes to barbecuing pork shoulder, you need to trim the surface fat to let the seasonings penetrate the meat, but leave enough to give the finished dish flavor. To do so, the website recommends first removing as much of the thick layer of fat that typically covers one side of a pork shoulder cut as possible.\nShould brisket be wrapped in foil?\nWrap Brisket in Butcher Paper\nAnd wrapping with butcher paper really does take practice to get right. … While cooking with butcher paper should help you avoid the stall, using foil is more of a guarantee. And because the butcher paper isn’t as tight a wrap as foil, the cooking time will be a little longer.\nShould I flip my pork shoulder in slow cooker?\nThe pork shoulder tends to float, and you want to make sure it is evenly cooked. Except for the temperature change and flipping the pork shoulder there is not a lot to do, and in all honesty, you could just set it on low and cook for 8–10 hours and be fine (especially if you needed to head to work for the day).\nDo you cover a pork roast in the oven?\nBaking Your Pork Roast\nThe first way is to cover the pork roast with aluminum foil or your baking pan cover. Depending on your oven temperature, covering pork roast helps preserve its juicy flavors and also reduces shrinkage.\nIs it better to slow cook on low or high?\nThe LOW setting takes longer than the HIGH setting. Once that temperature is hit, the appliance stabilizes at that temperature to allow for the ingredients to be cooked. This means most recipes can be cooked on either setting. … Or if a recipe calls for eight hours on HIGH, it can be cooked for up to 12 hours on LOW.\nHow long does pork take in slow cooker on high?\n1 – 2 hours, cook it for 3 – 4 hours on High or 6 – 8 hours on Low.\nHow do you know when a pork roast is done in slow cooker?\nThe good ‘ol Joy of Cooking, 1997 edition, concurs that a pork roast should have a “pale pink blush and lots of clear juice” when done. But it advises cooking a pork loin “until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat registers 155 to 160 degrees….”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d89a57fe-cb2c-4f88-a650-5ea9680be503>","<urn:uuid:def65633-9005-451d-8060-f2450ce7231c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the physical examination methods for detecting counterfeit coins, and how do natural environmental changes impact the discovery of maritime artifacts?","answer":"Physical examination methods for counterfeit detection include inspecting the edge for casting seams, checking reed density and sharpness, examining surface features for proper relief and detail, and looking for signs of date or mintmark alterations. The coin's alignment, font consistency, and surface characteristics like the 'cartwheel effect' are also important indicators. Regarding maritime artifacts, natural environmental changes play a dual role - coastal erosion and extreme weather patterns can reveal previously unknown wreck sites and artifacts, while also potentially damaging known sites. The coastline undergoes continuous change through processes like erosion and silting, which can either expose new archaeological findings or threaten existing maritime heritage sites by removing protective coverings and exposing materials to degradation.","context":["This is part 2 of a 6 part series:\nAlthough laws are being proposed to help combat the problem, you should take the time to examine the coin, especially if you question its authenticity. Remember, none of these tests are fool proof and failing any one does not mean you have a counterfeit coin. You have to take all the evidence in its entirety to determine if the coin is real or not.\nBefore you look at the coin, you should be very familiar with the type or have a version of the coin you know to be authentic to compare with it. Although it would be easier of the coin was not in a grading service holder for visual comparison, at least you have a reasonable certainty that an encapsulated coin is authentic.\nIt helps to have a good magnifier to use to inspect your coin and cotton gloves to prevent the oils from your skin sticking to your prized collectibles.\nAs you look at the coin, flip it over and look at both the obverse and reverse. How is the alignment of the coin? If you are looking at United States coins, you should be able turn it over and the reverse are in the opposite direction of the obverse. This is called “coin alignment.” Some countries produce coins in what is called “medal alignment” where the top of the obverse and reverse designs are in the same direction.\nJust because a coin’s alignment is off does not mean the coin is a counterfeit. It is possible that the coin is genuine but was struck by misaligned dies to cause this error. Otherwise, keep the information in the back of your mind as you examine the rest of the coin.\nExamining the Edge\nThe edge of the coin is also known as the coin’s third side and the most underestimated area to look. Check the edge for a possible seam that could be the sign of a counterfeit that was cast in a mold rather than struck by a press. Also look for filing or other marks that would suggest the seams were smoothed.What does the edge look like? Is the coin supposed to have reeds? While it may not be practical to count the reeds, you can check the formation against a similar coin. Usually, the reeds are not as sharp on a counterfeit, they appear more rounded, and the overall density of reeds may be less than on a genuine coin. While mistakes happen, the number of reeds created by the collar in the coining press during the striking process is standard for each coin. If there is something wrong or the coin does not have reeds although it is supposed to be reeded, the coin is likely to be counterfeit.\nWith the recent rash of counterfeit British £1 coins, we learned that an easy way to tell the fakes from the real coins is to check the edge. If the coin’s edge does not include lettering, the coin is likely a counterfeit.\nAnother clue to look for is if there seems to be a surface added to a coin. It will appear like someone put a veneer on top of a metal core. Coins should appear to be solid disks of metal. Even bimetallic coins look and feel like solid coins, even though they are made of two different parts. If you see this veneer-like effect, it is likely that the coin is a counterfeit.\nDoes the coin supposed to have edge lettering? Remember, some early varieties have coins that have edge lettering, while a later variety has reeds. Make sure you know which version of the coin you are examining and if the lettering on the edge matches the style of a genuine example. Collectors of Presidential dollars know that the lack of edge lettering can be an error by the U.S. Mint and not the sign of a counterfeit.\nSome foreign coins have small tooth-like extensions on the surface near the coin’s edge called denticles. While the look of denticles could be different as the die wears, denticles on genuine coins have a sharp, consistent design. Denticles on counterfeit coins may be rounder, more inconsistent, and less dense on the coin—similar to reeded edges. This is where having a good knowledge of the coin you are examining will help you tell the difference between worn denticles produced by worn dies and a counterfeit coin.\nExamine the legends and other features of the coin. Do the fonts look right? Is the image proper? Are these elements in the right places? While mistakes happen, it is extremely rare, if not impossible, for many of these elements to be off because of the way all mints make the dies. If the features are consistently incorrect, then the coin is likely to be a counterfeit.\nWhat does the surface look like? Is it dull or have a dull appearance even though the coin is supposed to be of a higher grade? Are the features sharp or do they look rounded? Does the relief of the design look right or is it too flat? If the coin is supposed to be of a higher grade, the sharpness of the detail is important. Although there are coins that were not struck very well, called weak strikes, they will have sharper details than most counterfeit coins.It is also important to understand how a coin wears to know whether the appearance is dull from being circulated or counterfeit. All coins show a specific pattern of wear, and it is important to understand your coin’s wearing patterns. There are several visual reference guides that can help you in this area including PCGS Photograde which is available online and via an app for your mobile device.\nOn some coins you can see the evidence of the metal flow from the striking process. For some coins, it gives the coin a distinct look—like large silver dollars whose surface gives what is described as a “cartwheel effect” when examined under bright light. Be careful with this test because a lower grade coin has had its surface worn and will not show the cartwheel effect.\nIf the coin is a cast counterfeit, the surface may look bubbly. While there are examples of planchet (the coin blank) errors where the surface may bubble, these are usually in a small area and looks like small pimples on the coin. A bubbly surface from a cast coin may look similar to the gelatin mold you made where air became trapped inside.\nAnother sign of a counterfeit coin would be the showing of a different metal under a worn area. If the coin is supposed to be silver but a different color is showing through on a worn area, then it is likely that the coin was plated to give the appearance of silver but was made of a less expensive metal.\nCheck for Alterations\nFinally, check for date and mintmark altering. On a genuine coin, the date and the mint mark looks like it is part of the coin and appears to be “growing” out of the surface. On a counterfeit coin, there are many ways to alter these elements by carving the date, called tooling, or physically cutting the elements from another coin and attaching it to a real coin. This type of alteration is common to change or add a mintmark to a coin.\nUse your magnifier to look carefully at the date and mintmark. If there are too many sharp edges or looks damaged from being cut, I would be wary of the coin. Look at the mintmark and the potential grime around it. Does the placement of that grime look like it could have been accumulated over the years of circulation? Or does the pattern of grime not look natural and could be covering up a possible alteration?\nAlso, know the difference between altered coins and genuine coins where the date was altered in the dies or the mintmark was repunched. Before express travel and fast package shipments, there were times when a branch mint needed to alter dies from another mint or alter dates on the dies so they can continue to strike coins. Rather than filling the die and punching the new date, the coiner would use a punch with the proper number and try to strike it in a way to eliminate most of the previous date. Repunched dates, also called over dates, were more common for coins struck outside of Philadelphia, but have happened in Philadelphia. When you see a catalog listing about a coin with a repunched date, it is written as the date of the coin followed by a forward slash followed by the digits that was previously on the coin. For example, in 1942, the Philadelphia Mint accidentally pressed a 1942 hub with 1941 dies creating the 1942/1 over date that were used in Philadelphia and Denver. Finding one in the lowest grade is worth a lot of money giving counterfeiters a good reason for counterfeiters to try to make one.\nIf you find a coin that looks like one mintmark is on top of another, or a mintmark looks doubled or tripled, it may be because it is a repunched mintmark. In addition to branch mint sharing dies, dies were shipped from Philadelphia without mintmarks. It was the job of the chief coiner in each branch mint to punch the mintmark into the dies. Sometimes the punch moves when struck giving it a doubled or tripled look. Other times a mintmark filled on the dies and another mintmark is punched over. Re-punched mintmarks are written the same as over dates in the catalogs.\nOne of the more famous re-punched mintmarks is the 1900-O/CC Morgan dollar. In this case, after the Carson City Mint was closed (CC mintmark), the reverse dies were shipped to the New Orleans Mint (O mintmark). The dies were filed and filled so that the “O” mintmark could be punched on the reverse but whoever did the work did not completely remove the “CC” mintmark. Looking under magnification, you can see the shadow of the original “CC” mintmark that was on the die.\nRe-punched dates and mintmarks occurred more often than the U.S. Mint would like to admit. If the coin you are examining has one of these errors, check a reference to see if the it is known. While not finding it in a reference does not mean the coin is counterfeit, it is enough evidence to question whether the coin is genuine of counterfeit.\nIn the next installment, we discuss what to look for in weight and measurements.","Opportunities and Threats to the Maritime Environment\nThis section discusses how natural changes to the maritime environment and changes in human exploitation and understanding of the sea, allow greater opportunities to understand and study maritime heritage than ever before, but by the same token also pose greater threats to its integrity.\nThe marine and inter-tidal zones are dynamic and have always undergone natural environmental change and changing patterns of use and exploitation which are nothing new.\nThe coastline has always been subject to change, whether settlements and harbours have been eroded and lost to the sea, as at Dunwich in Suffolk, or have silted up and are now located inland, for example on the Sussex coast.\nThis process is continuous and is also affected by patterns of extreme weather which can reveal new wreck archaeology, result in damage to known wreck sites, or even create new forms of wreck.\nCoastal surveys and the techniques of marine archaeology lead to a greater understanding of the character of the local marine historic environment and how it is affected by these processes.\nResponding to the unexpected\nThe patterns of changing exploitation of the seabed create new opportunities for discovery. For example, the wreck of the London (1665) was located and identified through archaeological assessment in advance of the London Gateway project which deepened the navigational channels in the Thames, resulting in the designation of the wreck and its continuing investigation.\nIn the marine planning system, new forms of construction at sea in the form of offshore renewables (windfarms) have the potential to impact on archaeology, but by the same token, can bring to light new archaeology and increase our understanding of what lies beneath the sea.\nIn a similar vein, individual climate events such as continuing storms of early 2014 can have an impact on local beaches, revealing wrecks that have rarely or never been seen before. These are often reported by members of the public, allowing us to enhance our records and identify wrecks for further research or potential protection.\nSuch wrecks, or other historic seabed or shoreline features such as submerged forests, can also come under threat. These threats may be environmental, for example, the erosion of a protective sand cover also exposes ship timbers on a wreck to the same forces of erosion.\nDespite the positive impacts of public enthusiasm for maritime heritage, there are negative sides to human interest in shipwreck. Human impacts, from vandalism to theft of artefacts or the non-disclosure of removed artefacts from a shipwreck, are also a threat.\nIf objects are removed from shipwrecks without proper archaeological recording their context is lost and this lessens our understanding of these wrecks, while less is left for visiting divers to enjoy. These constitute heritage crimes and Historic England works closely with the Receiver of Wreck in order to educate and inform the public on maritime heritage issues.\nWhat we can do\nWe can care for maritime archaeology in a number of ways. At Historic England we vary our approach according to the needs of each site that are clearly identified in a site- specific Conservation Management Plan.\nBesides coastal survey and marine environmental assessments, photographic and documentary recording allows us to monitor changes to local archaeology and to identify individual sites or forms of archaeology which might need further investigation, research, recording, or protection, including an in situ approach.\nThis includes continual enhancement of the National Record of the Historic Environment (NRHE) database or commissioning strategic reviews that prioritise particular types of vessel for investigation and protection, such as the Ships and Boats pre-1840 review. As a result a number of vessels such as the Daresbury, a rare survival of an 18th century Mersey flat, have been protected.\nArchaeological protocols for commercial activity mean that finds from the dredging, fishing and offshore renewables industries are now routinely reported and recorded in the NRHE database and also reveal new patterns from the past such as clusters of cannonballs which may indicate concentrations of naval or privateering activity and may potentially be matched with particular battles.\nWe are also looking at new ways of engaging the public through developing dive trails, by community engagement and raising awareness through the latest technology, allowing non-divers and non-specialists to access information on maritime heritage.\nWe also welcome reports from members of the public and leisure divers of anything they have seen or researched, which in turn is recorded and made accessible to the public through the NRHE database or through formal archaeological investigation.\nIt becomes a dynamic ‘virtuous circle’ of increasing understanding of the maritime heritage environment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d5a56ba-65e8-4479-ac2b-f878dce53150>","<urn:uuid:9ba8f652-91fb-4554-96ad-8fda81dc210c>"],"error":null}
