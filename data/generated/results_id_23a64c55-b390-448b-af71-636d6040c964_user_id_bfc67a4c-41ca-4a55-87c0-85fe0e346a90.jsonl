{"question":"What are the commercial applications of next-generation paper in tourism, and how can its electronic elements be sustainably managed?","answer":"Next-generation paper has significant commercial applications in tourism, where it connects paper-based materials like tourist brochures and guides with mobile apps, digital photography, and online booking systems. It enables tourist publications to integrate web content, enhancing the tourist experience through augmented reality features. For sustainable management of its electronic elements, the technology requires proper recycling through authorized collection centers, which allows for the recovery of valuable materials like aluminum, copper, and precious metals. This recycling process helps conserve natural resources, reduces pollution, and prevents toxic materials from contaminating the environment while saving landfill space.","context":["Next generation paper: Connecting paper to the web\nThis multidisciplinary project aims to explore the future of paper and its connection to the web. It will do so in the domain of travel and tourism where paper and screen-based information are already used together in the tourist experience.\nThe project proposal was in response to a call on ‘Content creation and consumption in the digital economy’. It aims to create new technology and business opportunities in the publishing and tourism industries. It will do this by using augmented reality and printed electronics to connect paper to the web, in what the team call second generation (2G) and third generation paper (3G).\nIf today’s ordinary paper is considered first generation (1G) paper, then 2G paper will be optically recognised with a camera, triggering associated digital information to be played or displayed on a nearby device.\n3G paper will dispense with the camera and contain tiny sensors printed or embedded in the fibres of the paper itself. This will trigger the same kind of associations around it. In this way, paper documents and books could have hotlinks to webpages, audio, video clips and so on that could play on speakers or screens around them. The team will be looking at how this could change and connect the use of paper and screen-based information in tourism, where tourist brochures and guides already co-exist with mobile apps, digital photography and online booking systems.\nMore information is available in this press release.\nA key feature of the project is that it will be investigating new business models for next generation paper, alongside building and testing the technology itself. This means that we will be working closely with our industrial partners on options for commercialisation and establishing industry standards.\nThe project team\nThis includes five groups at Surrey and one at the Open University.

In order to conserve natural resources and the energy needed to produce new electronic equipment from virgin resources, electronic equipment can be refurbished, reused, and recycled instead of being land filled.\nE-waste also contains toxic and hazardous materials including mercury, lead, cadmium, beryllium, chromium, and chemical flame retardants, which have the potential to leach into our soil and water.\nBenefit of recycling of E-waste:\n- E-waste contains many valuable, recoverable materials such as aluminum, copper, gold, silver, plastics, and ferrous metals. In order to conserve natural resources and the energy needed to produce new electronic equipment from virgin resources, electronic equipment can be refurbished, reused, and recycled instead of being landfilled.\n- E-waste also contains toxic and hazardous materials including mercury, lead, cadmium, beryllium, chromium, and chemical flame retardants, which have the potential to leach into our soil and water.\n- Protects your surroundings- Safe recycling of outdated electronics promotes sound management of toxic chemicals such as lead and mercury.\n- Conserves natural resources– Recycling recovers valuable materials from old electronics that can be used to make new products. As a result, we save energy, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save resources by extracting fewer raw materials from the earth.\n- Helps others – Donating your used electronics benefits your community by passing on ready-to-use or refurbished equipment to those who need it.\n- Saves landfill space – E-waste is a growing waste stream. By recycling these items, landfill space is conserved.\nRecycling of E-waste:\nThe company has tied -up with the E-waste Recyclers India for collection of all our E-waste on PAN India and disposes the same at their plant at E-50, UPSIDC Industrial Area, 98 Km Stone, NH 2, KosiKotawanDistt Mathura, U.P., and India.

{"question":"How long does a coronary CTA examination take and what happens during the procedure?","answer":"The complete coronary CTA examination takes about 30 minutes. During the procedure, the patient changes into an examination gown and removes metallic objects. A small needle is placed in the arm for medication to stabilize heart rate and inject contrast medium. The patient lies on the CT table which moves slowly into the gantry. Patients must remain still and hold their breath when instructed. After the scan, normal daily activities can be resumed immediately.","context":["How is Coronary CTA different from other heart tests?\nOne of the common heart tests is the coronary angiogram. This test is invasive. In an invasive coronary angigram, a catheter is usually inserted into a blood vessel in the upper thigh, then maneuvered up to the coronary arteries.

{"question":"As someone familiar with construction, I want to know how soil conditions affect the choice between floating decks and bell-shaped footings for deck construction?","answer":"Soil conditions are crucial in determining whether to use floating decks or bell-shaped footings. Floating decks are particularly suitable for areas with tree roots, as they can be installed above grade without disturbing significant roots. However, they must be built on stable, compacted ground. Bell-shaped or spread-base footings are specifically designed for soil bearing capacity concerns and are necessary when dealing with unstable soil conditions. The size of these footings is determined by both the weight of the deck and the soil's bearing capacity. While building codes have conservative standards for soil-bearing capacity, in compacted clay soil, simpler footings may be sufficient without requiring spread-base designs.","context":["Adding a deck to the backyard giving a level platform to set up a few chairs to enjoy the sun and maybe grill some burgers seems like a good idea. But what type of deck? Should you dig frost footings, or is a floating deck a good idea? When is it better to build a floating deck? What are the pros of a floating deck? What are the cons of a floating deck?\nA floating deck is a good idea for a low ground level deck, less than 24″ (600mm) above grade. A floating deck is beneficial for around a tree as not to disturb the tree’s roots. Building a floating deck is a good idea, with it’s reduced costs compared to a fixed deck.\nA floating deck is not all good. There are some cons to a floating deck. But let’s cover why and when a floating deck is a good idea but then also the cons. Reason why a floating deck may not be a good idea.\nReasons a Floating Deck is a Good Idea\nThe primary reason a floating deck is a good idea is during construction. The most significant difference between a floating deck and a fixed deck is the footings.\nA floating deck does not have footings below the frost level but floats on deck blocks installed at grade. Where a fixed deck requires footings installed below the frost level. Where in places like Texas, the frost level is between zero and 12″ (300mm). But jumping countries and city to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where the frost level is 72″ (1.8m).\nRegardless of where you are located, a floating deck will require less digging and cost less.\nFloating Deck A Good Idea Costing Less\nFirst, you will save money with a floating deck. There are three ways you will save money.\n- Comparing Floating Footing Material Costs to Frost Footings. How much varies by the footing requirements but using Calgary as an example. In Calgary, requiring footings 10″ (250mm) diameter footings, 4′ (1.2m) deep will cost $60 in material. For the concrete, forms and post saddle. A floating deck block will only cost $15 for the deck block and base material like gravel under the deck block. Saving you $45 per footing. With a floating deck saving you a minimum of $200 compared to a fixed deck in material.\n- Floating Decks Take Less Time to Build. How deep and how hard the ground is will impact how much time savings. But on average, in Calgary, where I build decks, you will save around two hours per footing. With a small deck, only requiring four footings, that is the difference between framing in the afternoon or spending all day digging holes and mixing concrete. The larger the deck, the more time you will save with a floating deck instead of a fixed deck.\n- Less Dirt to Dispose of With a Floating Deck. Yes, you can rake it out under the deck. Or like my neighbour did pile it up around his house’s foundation. But you need to do something with all the extra dirt from the footing holes.\nThe challenge with dirt from footings holes is it is mostly clay. Which is not good for your yard and grass. As nothing will grow in it. Even if you use it to fill holes or low spots in the yard, you will need to buy loam to cover the clay for the grass to grow in.\nIf you decide that wrecking your yard is not a good idea, you have to haul the dirt away. This can be as simple as loading up a few buckets and driving to the landfill. But often, this includes dumping fees or waste bins to haul away the dirt. All added up to paying a few hundred dollars more for fixed deck footings than a floating deck.\nThese three reasons alone make a floating deck a good idea. But there are more.\nFloating Deck a Good Idea for Certain Locations.\nAs I mention in cost, the first is where the frost level is so deep that extensive excavation is required for frost footings. Making a floating deck a great idea. But also were in the yard the deck is located.\nIt may be a good idea for a yard with many trees to build a floating deck instead of a fixed deck. With the many challenges involved with building a deck over tree roots. Not only is it time-consuming digging among tree roots. As they slow down digging, often requiring reaching into the hole with a saw to cut roots. But it also can be bad for the tree. Larger roots close to the tree trunk are critical for tree strength and water. Cutting these roots on a tree while building a deck can kill the varied tree you are trying to design your deck around.\nA floating deck disturbs tree roots less. As the deck blocks can be installed above grade, away from significant roots. Making a floating deck a good idea around or close to a tree in your yard.\nFloating Deck’s Don’t Require Permits?\nBefore discussing when a floating deck is not a good idea, I just want to clear up a common misconception, permits.\nIt is often mentioned that a floating deck does not require a building permit. This is not true but is a problem of causation and collation.\nAs required by International Building Code, a floating deck must be less than 30″ (762mm) from the ground. Slightly lower in Canada at 24″ (600mm) above grade.\nChecking many cities deck permitting requirements, it’s the height of the deck that requires permitting, not the footings.\n“You need a construction permit to build a deck that is more than 18 inches above the ground”Government of Seattle\nUsing Seattle as an example, but this is common in many cities. In fact, I didn’t find any cities that differ between footings type for the requirement of permits. When pulling a deck permit, they will often have footing requirements. It’s not the footing that demands permit but the permit that demands footings.\nIn short, whether or not a floating deck is a good idea, the permit requirements have little impact. Floating decks don’t require permits because they are low to the ground, not because they are floating.\nReasons a Floating Deck is a Bad Idea\nThere are times and reasons when building a floating deck is a bad idea.\nPrimarily, just as we discussed with permits.\nA High Floating Deck is a Bad Idea\nAny deck above 30″ (762mm) in the States and 24″ (600mm) in Canada need frost fixed footings. A deck of that height requires the stability of footings installed below the frost level. A floating deck moving with the ground can have serious consequences. Causing the deck to collapse with the potential of injury from the height of the fall.\nA ground-level floating deck may sink in spring, but the potential for injury is low. Falling two feet is a lot less dangerous than falling six. Making a tall floating deck a bad idea.\nA Floating Deck Connect to the House Is a Bad Idea\nA low freestanding deck beside a house can have many advantages. But the deck cannot be attached to the house if floating.\nA floating deck will cause stress and possibly failure of the house’s foundation. As the deck moves with the ground, the deck will pull or push the foundation. The house’s foundation is not designed for this level of lateral load, increasing failure potential. Making a floating deck connected to a house a bad idea.\nConclusion, Is a Floating Deck a Good Idea?\nYes, a floating deck is a good idea if the deck is low, not attached to the house or built close to trees. A floating deck will save you both time and money during construction.\nBut a floating deck is a bad idea if the deck is tall or is attached to the house. The movement of a floating deck do not work well when connected or at heights. These situations require a fixed deck supported by footings below the frost level.\nDo you know what a good idea is? A deck in the backyard to enjoy the outdoors.",", South Windsor, CT\nI’m having a builder put an attached deck on my house. To save money on the project, I’ll be digging the holes for the footings. On TV and in magazines, I’ve noticed what seems to be a transition toward using a bell-shaped attachment at the bottom of each pier when building a deck or other similar project. Are these wider footing bases necessary only in some situations and for some projects, or are they now considered the standard best practice? My builder says they aren’t necessary for my project, and I’m not inclined to dig extrawide, 4-ft. frost-depth holes in my compacted clay soil for these footing bases unless there is good reason.\nPhoto by: Dan Thornton\nEditorial adviser Mike Guertin replies: Footings need to be large enough to distribute the deck load they carry to the soil below, so their size is determined by the weight of the deck and the bearing capacity of the soil it’s built upon. The idea of a spread-base footing is that it allows you either to carry the same deck with fewer piers or to save on concrete by using a narrower column that rises to grade level. Spread-base footings also may be necessary if your soil is unstable.\nBuilding-code standards for soil-bearing capacity are conservative, so there’s no great benefit to using footings larger than what you need. I agree with you that there’s no point in digging more than you have to, especially if you’re doing it by hand.\nIf the footings are larger than 20 in. dia., I usually dig with a backhoe or small excavator, so it’s not much extra work to make an oversize hole for a standard rigid-plastic spread-base form. From there, I can use a standard 10-in. or 12-in. cardboard footing tube to bring the pier up to grade. Footings smaller than 20 in., though, I usually dig by hand, so making holes large enough for a wider footing form can be a lot of extra work.\nI typically don’t bother with spread-base forms if the required footing diameter is 12 in. or less. If the footings are between 12 in. dia. and 20 in. dia., I make my own spreadbase footings. The idea is to dig a 10-in.-dia. or 12-in.-dia. hole and to hollow the bottom 12 in. or so into a bell-shaped area of the needed size. Then I cut a standard builder’s tube about 8 in. shy of the hole depth, tape a garbage bag at the bottom, and drop the assembly into the hole. When the footing form is filled partway with concrete, the bag expands to fill the bottom of the hole without climbing up the outside of the form.\nIf you do use a spread-base form, it’s worth considering the diameter of the footing tube you bring to grade. In many cases, a 6-in. or 8 in. tube may technically be adequate, but the small savings in concrete may not offset the other potential headaches. If you are just slightly off with the location of a 6-in. footing tube, a 4x4 deck post may overhang the edge of the concrete pier. For the small amount of extra concrete, a 10-in.-dia. or 12-in.-dia. form gives you a bigger target area."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:839ff530-714e-44ec-8102-db2fca7f905e>","<urn:uuid:5e408a3e-6541-47fc-a278-c83374030f17>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the key differences between medieval tapestries and samplers in terms of their social status and production?","answer":"Medieval tapestries and samplers served different social purposes and had distinct production methods. Tapestries were exclusively owned by the wealthiest nobility and royalty, as they were among the most expensive consumer goods in the late middle ages (1350-1550). They were professionally woven, not stitched, and were used to demonstrate power, status, and wealth in luxurious chambers. In contrast, samplers emerged as demonstrations of embroidery skills, initially created by English nuns and needlework professionals. While still indicating wealth due to the cost of materials like silk thread, samplers were more accessible and could be created by amateur needlewomen. They evolved into educational tools for schoolgirls and became common in households for reference and practice.","context":["Ruth Singer creates detailed and intriguing textile artworks inspired by…\nShe also writes books on textiles and sewing and teaches in her own studio as well as freelance.\nI can’t be the only one here who sighs (and maybe even comments) when people say ‘tapestry’ when they mean needlepoint. The confusion between the terms is hardly surprising though – the technicalities of construction method of different textiles is quite a challenge.\nReal tapestry is woven, although not in the same way as cloth, and needlepoint (as I am sure I don’t need to tell readers of Mr X Stitch, but just in case) is stitched. Needlepoint had a period of huge popularity in the 17th century and in many ways copied the style of traditional, woven, tapestry – most often used for wall hangings in large houses. The critical factor in the use of needlepoint on chair covers, hanging and table coverings is that it could be (although wasn’t always) made in the home and could easily be worked in small scale. Tapestry is another thing entirely, and not really suitable for domestic production.\nThis post, and the second one next month, aim to give you a basic background on Medieval and later tapestry, of the type you see in stately homes around the UK and in museums in many parts of the world. I hope that you will be able to put right those that comment on the beautiful ‘stitching’ (it is WOVEN) and the leisured ladies that made it (they DIDN’T). We’ll start with looking at the context for tapestries.\nThe reason that tapestries appear in posh houses and museums is that they were owned by the very wealthiest of society. The reason they were owned by noblemen and royalty is because they were the only people who could afford them. Woven wall hangings, depicting religious scenes, legends and myths or courtly activities, were amongst the most expensive consumer goods available in the late middle ages (by which I mean about 1350-1550ish). Like decorating your walls with the most expensive paintings today, pretty much, although much warmer.\nThey certainly did act as insulation in stone buildings, but they were not hanging up in dusty, draughty castles with bare stone walls and holes for windows, they were hanging in highly-decorated, luxuriously furnished, plastered and painted chambers with massive fireplaces and windows within castles. They could also be taken down, rolled up and moved to your other residences when your household travelled, which you couldn’t do with wall paintings (which the less wealthy might have on their walls instead).\nSo we know that rich people owned them – but why? Having tapestries in your home showed that you had loads of money which was a necessary part of showing your status in society, your power and your influence, all of which were vital if you were to make the most of your noble birth and social standing. Being rich enough to commission a tapestry was a big deal and the subject matter you chose was also important to send out a message about your world, your intentions and your superiority to those visiting your home such as officials, fellow nobles or churchmen.\nMedieval people understood about imagery and symbolism, particularly religious scenes. You might choose a tapestry of the life of a particular saint that reflected how you wanted people to see you – humble, merciful, pious or generous. Battle scenes could help to reinforce your power and invincibility. Romantic or courtly scenes would give an impression of what a fine gentleman you are.\nAlongside the major scenic tapestries, there were plenty that were of a more general subject matter such as pasture or flowers on a plain background, known as verdure. These could be purchased quickly, off the peg, rather than needing lengthy commission lead-in times. Many of these survive in houses and museum collections but are usually more battered, patchworked, repaired and generally bodged about as they were inevitably less valuable than those which a nobleman might have commissioned especially for their new wing.\nIn my next post, I’ll explore how they were made, where, who by and with what materials. If you want a little homework before then I can highly recommend The Lady and the Unicorn by Tracey Chevalier which has very accurate descriptions of the commissioning and social context around the making of a 15th century tapestry – and it is a good read!

This fine art arose in the late Middle Ages when English nuns and needlework professionals created exquisite, gold and silver-gilt embroidered ecclesiastical and secular textiles. From about 1350, however, their quality declined. Materials became less lavish, techniques became less complex, and appliquéd motifs replaced allover designs.\nOrnamental needlework flourished anew from around 1534, when Henry VIII, on dissolving ties with the Catholic Church, appropriated its luxurious, embroidered chasubles, copes, and altar hangings, as his own. As this elaborate style became fashionable at court, men and women, professionals and amateurs alike, adorned vests, sleeves, gowns, handkerchiefs, pockets, pin pillows, linens, and table carpets with arrays of colorful embroidered stitchery. Their craft was not simply a pleasant pastime, however. Due to the exorbitant cost of fine linen and silk thread, it also indicated wealth and social status.\nWith the expansion of international trade, exotic silk and metallic threads from faraway lands, as well as embroidered garments, reached English shores. These were not only highly fashionable but greatly admired. If a particularly attractive Hungarian pattern, say, caught a needlewoman’s eye, she might deftly work a sample across a long, narrow linen band kept rolled, like a diploma, in her sewing basket.\nOver time, dizzying arrays of Holbein, Florentine, satin, cross, couched, bouillon, spider web, and Ceylon patterns covered every available inch—often worked in green, blue, and salmon. Later, when embellishing needle cases, shoes, gloves, stomachers, and the like, women sourced these bands for ideas and inspiration.\nSince they also shared prized patterns and stitches among themselves, these band samplers, as they became known, continued to evolve throughout their lifetimes – and longer still. Some, included in household inventories, were apparently willed from mother to daughter. Though surviving examples are rarely signed or dated, they are more than a compendium of popular 16th century stitches. Each preserves their creators’ personal preferences for posterity.\nAs amateur needlewomen became more proficient at their art, some commissioned elaborate motifs from professional workshop draftsmen. Others copied or adapted designs depicted in rare, expensive German, French, English, or Italian printed pattern books. Since plagiarism was common, however, identical floral and geometric designs appeared time and again across Europe.\nOther embroiderers, inspired by woodcuts and engravings in Tudor emblem books, bestiaries, and herbals, scattered flora and fauna motifs at random over linen foundations. Since some appear incomplete – and were rarely signed, many believe that these spot samplers, like band samplers, were created for reference. Others wonder if they were stitched as practice before attempting costly needlework projects. In any case, many consider them the liveliest, most vivid, imaginative samplers ever created.\nTrends & Expansion\nAlthough samplers appeared in British household records from 1502, the earliest known surviving one was worked by Jane Bostock in 1598. In addition to squares of complex geometrical and floral repeating patterns, it depicts a randomly placed owl in a tree, a chained and muzzled bear, a crouching hind, a number of dogs, a spray of cowslips, and a heraldic lion, symbol of strength and courage. Most are worked in silk cross stitch enhanced with seed pearls and beads. In addition, observes the Victoria and Albert Museum of Art and Design Internet site, three motifs, appearing to be “a castle on an elephant, a squirrel cracking a nut, and a raven,” have been “unpicked.” Could unpicking stitches have been a teaching tool?\nThrough the 1600s, band samplers, though still worked horizontally, incorporated increasingly complex techniques and sophisticated designs. Stump work, for example, featured raised, padded, pictorial motifs. Cut-and-drawn threadwork featured background linen threads which, when carefully cut away, revealed intricate, multi-colored patterns beneath. And there was a dizzying choice of stitches.\nFor Tent-worke, Raisd-worke, Laid worke, Frost-worke, net-worke,\nMost curious Purles, or rare Italian cut-worke,\nFine Ferne-stitch, Fisher stitch, Irish-stitch, and Queen-stitch,\nThe Spanish-stitch, Kesemary-stitch, and Mowse-stitch,\nThe smarting-Whip-stitch, Back-stitch, and the Cros-stitch.\nAll these [stitches] are good, and these we must allow,\nAnd these are every where in practice now.\n– from The Needle’s Excellency, John Taylor, 1631\nBy the 1700s, samplers had become shorter, symmetrical, and more stylized.\nIn addition to alphabets, repeating patterns, and scrolled, vined borders, many accommodated lush pastoral visions of grazing sheep, stags, and does frolicking beneath budding trees—and rarely, outlandish images of Bedouin tents or flocks of camels. Unlike earlier, practical, rolled samplers, these were unique works of art, displayed like portraits and paintings.\nBecause households commonly marked their linens with embroidered initials or numerals, sampler work also became an integral part of an English schoolgirl’s education. In addition to simply worked, central, or bordering alphabets, many depict a charming bird, fruit, flower, thistle, peas-in-a-pod, or cherub-like “boxer” motifs, evoking Italian Renaissance putti.\nThrough this era, many samplers also featured inspirational verses pondering life or extolling piety, duty, or feminine virtue. In 1719, for example, Martha Salkeld, in addition to multiple alphabets, decorative bands, and verse from the Book of Matthew and Ecclesiastes, cross-stitched\n“let no man’s mind on earthly things be bent\nbut having food and raiment be content”\nBy mid-century, many samplers also depicted mansion motifs personalized with images of local sights, family members and beloved pets. Others commemorated christenings, weddings, or deaths. Yet to family researchers, genealogical samplers, whether matching names to relevant dates or burdening leafy trees with factual abundance, may be the most valuable of all.\nSkills as Necessity\nSchoolgirls also stitched almanac chart, mathematics table, and geographic linen samplers. Though their outlines of Wales or the world, for instance, might be none-too- accurate, these taught them the basic lay of the land.\nThrough the 1800s, household servants were required to mark linens with embroidered numbers or initials. So girls in asylums and charity schools stitched practical samplers to prove their marking, mending, and sewing skills. Students at the Bristol, England orphanage stitched particularly dense creations, with multiple rows of alphabets, numerals, and border patterns worked in red or black cotton thread. Though to some, these appear identical, additions of biblical motifs, moral verses, groups of initials (possibly of fellow students), and the occasional image of a small, single elephant, distinguish one from the next.\nBecause British stitchery was so popular, a relatively large number of samplers, tucked away in trunks, chests, or beneath the eaves of old garrets, have survived intact.\nStudents attending Colonial American “dame schools,” some as young as six, struggled to coax crude woolen thread into simple cross stitches across homespun, a fabric more suited to youthful hands than linen. So their samplers often featured uneven corners, lopsided images, and crooked borders. Spelling errors were common as well. Furthermore, some pieces were left at loose ends – unfinished.\nSince schoolmarms often favored particular motifs, chose designs, sketched them, then supervised their creation, there was little room left for girlish imagination. As a result, all samplers from a particular school, in Newport, Rhode Island, or Newburyport, Massachusetts for example, might exhibit identical stitchery and content. Seen as a whole, they illuminate the lives of early American schoolgirls. Studied individually, however, they may reveal local customs, mores, as well as personal family histories.\nPennsylvania’s Westtown Quaker School, like its British counterparts, also embraced the sampler tradition. Very plain, practical marking and alphabet samplers were most common. Yet from the early 1800s, many students, like eleven-year-old Rebecca Marsh, rendered restrained, distinctive designs, featuring symmetrical floral spot motifs and classmates’ initials, with admirable precision. In fact, these Quaker school graduates became some of the best needlewomen of the 19th century. Since American samplers are far rarer than English ones, they are generally more valuable. Since most were made along the Atlantic Seaboard and throughout New England, those from Southern states are most collectible.\nAround 1850, as the craze for garish Berlin wool work and canvas needlework, combined with the advent of machine-made products, the age of samplers drew to a close.\nWhat To Look For\nAmerican and English samplers dating from the 1600s are generally held in private collections or museums. Later ones, however, still surface in flea markets, antique stores, at auction, and in estate sales.\nA sampler’s age, however, may be less critical than its condition, detail, and design.\nVibrantly hued, pictorial ones are more collectible, for example, than those featuring simple numbers or alphabets, even if they are intricately stitched. Clear, charming, recognizable motifs—especially ones that are unusual—also add value. So does stitching that reveals the age and name of their creators, along with their locations and dates of completion. Samplers that feature personalized inscriptions are particularly endearing. And a having personal connection to a sampler, of course, enhances its value in the eyes of its beholder.\nThough many consider undated, anonymous samplers less desirable, their styles and designs, if researched at local libraries, genealogical, and historic societies, may reveal their origins.\nMoreover, peeks at their reverse sides may, through their degrees of neatness and quality of stitches, offer tantalizing hints about their creators. These too give voice to lives once lived."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b9179a1d-da54-4169-a5cf-9fb7561ad442>","<urn:uuid:9fee884b-beb7-4f20-b396-d87ab3305abf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Does cork flooring have unique properties for kitchen use?","answer":"Yes, cork flooring contains air pockets which give it a springiness that makes it comfortable to stand on, especially barefoot. This makes it suitable for kitchens where people stand for long periods. Cork also has high durability, considerable water resistance, and comes treated to be resistant to rot, moisture, and fire.","context":["The classification of trees falls into two broad categories – hardwood and softwood, according to their seed structure. Although most hardwoods are hard, softwoods aren’t always soft. In fact, some hardwoods are softer than softwoods. Many softwoods are so named because they are more prone to dents and scratches.\nBecause hardwoods have better abrasion resistance, they are the preferred choice for wooden flooring. This is particularly apparent in high-traffic rooms in homes where there are kids and pets. But there are some situations where homeowners prefer softwood flooring thanks to its rustic look and affordability.\nPine, spruce, fir, cypress, cedar, and redwood are a few of the popular varieties used for flooring. In this post, we discuss the various aspects of softwood flooring.\nWhere Not to Use Softwood Flooring\nSoftwood flooring looks attractive, and it costs considerably less than hardwood flooring. However, because it is less durable, there are certain situations where softwood flooring should not be used. For instance, high-traffic areas, where there is a high chance of scratches and dents, should not have softwood flooring. Further, rooms with heavy furniture shouldn’t have softwood floors, and it isn’t suitable for kitchen and dining areas where there is a high chance of spills.\nThe Case for Softwood Flooring\nSome softwoods like yew can be harder than hardwoods, and some hardwoods like balsa can be softer than many softwoods. That said, there are specific scenarios where softwood makes suitable flooring.\nThe prime consideration for using softwood flooring is the cost factor. You can save quite a lot of money by installing softwood flooring. Another factor in softwood’s favor is that of sustainability. If you are concerned about using sustainable wood, then it is a good option because of the faster rate of growth of softwood trees.\nFurthermore, most softwoods, and spruce, in particular, exhibit soundproof properties. They dampen the sound, making it a good option for using for the flooring of sound recording studios. Hence, if you have a room with softwood flooring and perhaps some softwood paneling on the walls, you would have a room that absorbs sound to make it very silent and peaceful.\nA final case for softwood is that some people prefer it because of the distressed look it develops in time. The scratches and dents become a kind of fashion statement.\nWith so much going for softwood flooring, let’s take a close look at some of the popular types of wood that we use to make softwood flooring:\nTypes of Softwood Flooring\nPine is a cheap, lightweight wood that has a yellowish or whitish coloration. You will usually get pine with numerous dark-colored knots which add to the charm of the wood, imparting a rustic appearance to the wood. It is easy to stain or paint pinewood, and it takes on a pleasant patina as it ages. Pine has a fair degree of resistance to swelling or shrinking. The downside of this wood is that it dents and scratches easily.\nFir, also known as hemlock, provides a suitable option for flooring that is has a fair degree of resistance to rot and insect attack. It is also easy to work with and has a uniform texture with a pleasant-looking grain. Fir exhibits a high level of stability when thoroughly dried, and will not twist and warp easily, adding to the list of advantages as a flooring material. When finished, fir also imparts a rustic look to the flooring.\nYou will find cedar at almost all places in the southern United States and South America. Cedar is a knotty wood with light and reddish-brown streaks in its grain. It exudes a pleasant aroma and possesses moth-repellent characteristics, making it a favored species of wood for making drawers and closets. You will find it easy to work with cedar but be aware that it is a brittle wood, so it is prone to chipping and should not be used for flooring in places of heavy footfall or in high-impact areas.\nThe rich red color of redwood makes for beautiful softwood flooring. The best quality wood comes from the heartwood, which has the maximum resistance to the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. It also has a significant resistance to moisture and insects. Redwood trees grow to a great height, some up to 300 feet tall. It enables you to get some really long boards and planks without joints, which is a handy feature for flooring material.\nThe straight grain and light shade of spruce makes it a popular choice for using in flooring. If the trees are allowed to mature entirely before harvesting, the wood is acoustically sound, making it suitable for making musical instruments. This feature of spruce also makes it a material that is conducive to soundproofing.\nHence, we also use spruce for flooring and paneling of sound recording studios. A downside of this wood is that it is susceptible to rot, warps easily, and is the least fireproof of all the other types of softwoods that we use for flooring.\nCypress is the right choice if you are looking for light-colored wood for your flooring with character. Dark knots regularly interrupt the wood grain, giving it a natural, rustic appearance. It will not darken over time like some other species of wood. Cypress is harder than red oak.\nCypress exhibits natural resistance to termites and can be used for flooring in all rooms of a home except bathrooms and kitchens where spills occur, and there is the possibility of standing water. You need to maintain cypress regularly by cleaning up the spills immediately and avoiding placing heavy furniture or using high heels on it. You can use mats and rugs in doorways and high traffic areas to protect your beautiful cypress floors from abrasion.\nYou can get some attractive colors and unusual patterns with cork flooring, giving the floor a unique look that will go well with your existing furniture. Cork contains air pockets which give it a springiness that makes it feel good to stand on, especially if you are barefoot. This property of cork makes a suitable choice for using in a kitchen where you are likely to be standing for a long time.\nAlthough you may feel that cork to be a bit too soft for use as flooring, it is not. This wood possesses high durability and exhibits a considerable degree of water resistance. You can get cork in boards and planks of different sizes, and the material is treated to be resistant to rot, moisture, and fire. It comes in glue or no glue installation systems.\nIt can surprise many people that softwood flooring can have so many advantages. It has its own level of resiliency. But you have to keep in mind the downsides of using softwood flooring for your home, be aware that it has its limitations. The information that we have provided here should be able to help you decide whether or not to use softwood flooring in your home or office.\nAlthough there are some advantages to using softwood flooring, hardwood flooring remains a preferred option to most woodworkers and homeowners. You can still use softwood flooring if you are aware of where you can use it and where you cannot."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b308ff9-0907-4eab-9aab-b0c750283b09>"],"error":null}

Sharkskin is made with a simple 2/2 twill using a 2-color warp and fill rotation, creating a shimmering effect that's particularly popular in sophisticated suits worn by executives and lawyers. Herringbone, on the other hand, consists of even stripes of broken twill that alternate between left and right-handed patterns. While herringbone is commonly used in suits, it's particularly popular in overcoats and dress shirts, especially for autumn and winter wear due to its thicker feel compared to other dress shirts.

But as I get older I feel more like dressing like an adult and I’m taking an interest in wearing woven tailored clothing that actually fits, rather than the over sized potato sacks I’ve been known to wear.\nNeedless to say, this new found interest in clothing affords me the opportunity to take a look at some of the simple and inventive wovens that are the world of men’s suiting. As a designer, its a term that I hear thrown around often in reference to what kind of trend the customer is looking for. “Men’s suiting” is their shorthand for a sophisticated woven classy textile in understated colors. “Men’s suiting” is woven fabric that does more with less, where the weave is simple and the yarn does the heavy lifting; that is materially and functionally rich without being obnoxious or overstated, unless you’re Herb Tarlek.\nThe other jumping off point for this article is a recent look at innovations from sharkskin where I only had a cursory look at the original sharkskin textile, the grand daddy of them all, the fabric that is the foundation of many swanky suits. I speak of course of woven sharkskin. Between that and the occasion to wear a suit recently, I thought I’d take a look at simple weaves from men’s suiting that have animal names. Here are three of them: Sharkskin, Herringbone, and Houndstooth:\nSharkskin suits are the domain of lawyers, executives, Mad Men, and the Rat Pack. Done right it can be sophisticated and classy. Amp it up a bit and you’ve got a 2 week run in Vegas. Either way, its achieved a legendary status in suits. This fabric is also known as “Pick/Pick” in England.\nThis fabric is surprisingly simple in structure. It is a simple 2/2 twill with a 2 color warp and 2 color fill rotation, which I’ll explain in a second. It gets its quality from its use of a fine worsted wool or mohair, sometimes with rayon or acetate. It often exhibits a ‘shimmering’ effect from the yarn’s fineness combined with the color effect, finish and/or addition of other yarn types.\nSo what the heck is a 2/2 twill? To oversimplify, its a fabric where 2 ends of warp are up for every two ends of warp down, in a stair step configuration.\nIts the same structure as most denim used in Jeans. [Denim structure is a 3/1 warp face twill. -seth] Here are some diagrams:\nHere’s how it works for the non weavers: black means warp is up, white means fill is up. This is not what the fabric looks like, this is what the loom is being instructed to do.\nAbove is how the yarns are actually interacting on the face of the fabric, with white being the weft and black the warp.\nThis is what it looks like repeated out, zoomed in. Always use a strong contrast between the two colors for best effect.\nA final note on sharkskin: Disregard the entry at Wikipedia for sharkskin at this point in time, as it is completely and utterly wrong, and unfortunately looks to be spreading around various forums on the internet. Also worth noting is that textile terms are elusive and ever changing. In researching this article, I’ve noticed many textiles being called ‘sharkskin’ that are something else. In my own career, I’ve been constantly annoyed by patterns that are named after weaving terms that have nothing to do with that term whatsoever, like a flat woven pattern named ‘mattelasse’…\nThis one’s pretty straightforward and is more about the weave itself than the quality of the end fabric. A Herringbone is simply a series of even stripes of broken twill that are alternately left and right handed. Again, this one has seen its day in men’s suiting, especially in overcoats and hats.\nAs far as weaving setup, what you see is what you get. Warp and fill are solid contrasting colors, often warp is black, fill is white. Commonly its woven with thicker yarns that pronounce the pattern. Here’s the setup:\nThat’s it. Thats all it is. The twill reverses and steps down to ‘break’. Apply the yarns to the weave and it looks like this:\nAnd here it is in repeat:\nHoundstooth is the textile with the coolest name ever. Its also an excellent example of how to do more with less. This is a bit bolder, a bit more active, but can still manage to be classy. It can also manage to be obnoxious. Choose wisely.\nThe weave structure is the same as the Sharkskin; a 2/2 twill.\nAs the yarns lie; still the same as Sharkskin, but now for the addition of the color:\nThe pattern is created from a rotation of 4 dark and 4 light picks with a rotation of 4 dark warps and 4 light warps. The way the dark and light yarns interact with the twill create the ‘tooth’. Variations on color patterning and stripe width can create diverse variations but I prefer the even and simple balanced checkered look.\nNote that the current trend toward super sized houndstooth looks are abominations that I do not and will not consider houndstooth, just out of principle.\nThat concludes our look at classic men’s suiting. Class dismissed.","Dress shirts come in a bewildering array of patterns and textured as well as materials and designs. Knowing the size and fit of shirt you need is the first step. But deciding what type of material and type of weave is the second. And if the answer to this is cotton then which cotton? One to consider is the herringbone dress shirt.\nWhat is herringbone weave?\nThe herringbone pattern is often said to have its name because it looks like the bones in the herring fish. But there is another explanation that comes from the pattern’s other use – in paving. Back in Roman times, when road building was huge, there was a pattern called Opus Spiactum. Meaning ‘spiked work’ it was an interlocking pattern of criss-crossing chevrons that made the road strong.\nThe Egyptians took the pattern and began using it to weave wool in a variant of twill. The reversing of the twill changes the diagonal wale and makes those chevrons. From there the pattern began to travel around Europe. One of the oldest examples of it was found in Ireland and dated from 600BC. It is also the material used in a famous piece of cloth, the Shroud of Turin.\nForward to the 20th century and the pattern was once again popular with famous actors such as Clark Gable and Ronald Reagan. Today it is popular in both dress shirts and in suits.\nCharacteristics of a Herringbone dress shirt\nHerringbone dress shirts are a class of twill shirts because they take the twill weave and alter it a bit to create the prominent pattern. It is still more popular for suits than for shirts but there is definitely a movement towards them. The wave looks good when used on a solid coloured shirt as the intricate detail of the weave shows up.\nThis detail also makes for a shirt that has the image of a fine and meticulous finish. It feels thicker than an Oxford shirt so it often used in autumn and winter. It is also dressier in appearance than the Oxford dress shirt due to the fine detail of the weave. An added benefit is that, like other twill fabrics, it is quite water resistant.\nWhen choosing a dress shirt, a key indicator as to how fine and silky it will feel is the yarn number. This refers to the thickness of the yarn used. Lower numbers indicate a thicker yarn while higher numbers correspond to a finer yarn. The higher the number, therefore, the finer the shirt will feel and look. As well as pure cotton, shirts are also available in blended materials that use man made fabric or a combination of natural and man made. These may not feel as rich but can be easier to maintain with less ironing needed.\nHerringbone country tweed\nAs well as its use in fine dress shirts, the herringbone pattern also makes its way into the casual arena. Here it is often referred to as country tweed. This is often seen as a rustic or country look and the shirts made with a wool blend tend to be warm for cooler times of the year.\nSo when will you wear yours?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4eb61c90-78aa-495d-91b7-515db121a72e>","<urn:uuid:80848359-7392-4105-8640-0bb631aa14dc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Porter's Diamond Model's approach to competitive advantage compare to the historical perspective on understanding modern developments?","answer":"While Porter's Diamond Model suggests that current competitive advantage comes from analyzing specific factors like home demand conditions and related industries, the historical perspective argues that understanding modern developments requires looking at deeper historical processes. The documents show that Porter's model focuses on immediate factors in global markets, while historical analysis suggests that examining only contemporary events and immediate causes may blind rather than illuminate understanding. The historical view emphasizes that studying long-term historical continuity provides better insight into modern developments than focusing solely on recent events and immediate factors.","context":["French Rural History\nApproaches to the History of Spain\nFrankish Institutions under Charlemagne\nMasters, Princes and Merchants\nThe Twelfth Century Renaissance in this review, are listed in footnotes at the appropriate places)\nWhat are we to do about medieval history? No serious person would question its importance. What is nearest to us in time is not necessarily most relevant. The traditional Europe of our history books—the Europe of Napoleon and Bismarck, even the Europe of Hitler and Mussolini—is as dead as that of Charles the Great or Frederick Barbarossa, and we may disabuse our minds of the illusion that there is any immediate profit, from the point of view of contemporary affairs, in studying the deflated celebrities of the day before yesterday.\nPeople treat the recent past as though it were the den from which the lion that is going to devour them is going to spring. In reality it nearly always jumps out unobserved from behind their backs. They might be better equipped to meet contemporary developments if (as Herbert Butterfield once observed) “they had studied in ancient history the deeper processes that political bodies have been observed to undergo over long periods.” For anyone who believes in the “relevance” or actuality of history, there is less to be gained, in the present world, from scrutinizing anxiously the origins of the Second World War than from studying Caesar and the Roman revolution, a revolution which may be paralleled sooner than we think in our own society.\nMuch the same may be said of medieval history. Those of us who study it do so not because it is medieval, but because we believe that knowledge of immediate causes and contemporary events may blind, and not illuminate, unless it is counter-balanced by a deeper understanding of the continuity of history and its underlying currents. Indeed, the very concept of “the Middle Ages” is misleading (as well as doubtfully valid), in so far as it cuts them off as a remote and separate period which has little bearing on our lives and fortunes. In reality, this was not only the time when the foundations of European civilization, as it exists today in east and west, were being laid; it was also the time when some of our stubbornest beliefs and prejudices took root, as well as ideals we would fight and die for. If (as I once wrote) we understood it better, not as medieval history, but as modern history—very modern history, in the sense that all history which means anything is contemporary history—we might understand ourselves better, as well as our problems and potentialities.\nAnd yet no one surveying the scene today—particularly no one with the interests of medieval history at heart—can be entirely satisfied with the present state of medieval studies. During the past ten or a dozen years a great ferment has been going on in the historical world—a ferment expressed in the search for a new and more sophisticated methodology. Like all previous revolutions in historical thought and practice it has proceeded by absorbing and assimilating the achievements of cognate sciences.

After reading you will understand the basics of this powerful strategy and competitive advantage analysis tool.\nWhat is the Porter Diamond Model?\nThe American strategy professor Michael Porter developed an economic diamond model for (small-sized) businesses to help them understand their competitive position in global markets. This Porter Diamond Model, also known as the Porter Diamond theory of National Advantage or Porters double diamond model, has been given this name because all factors that are important in global business competition resemble the points of a diamond. Michael Porter assumes that the competitiveness of businesses is related to the performance of other businesses. Furthermore, other factors are tied together in the value-added chain in a long distance relation or a local or regional context.\nPorter Diamond Model clusters\nMichael Porter uses the concept of clusters of identical product groups in which there is considerable competitive pressure. Businesses within clusters usually stimulate each other to increase productivity, foster innovation and improve business results. Companies operating in such clusters work according to Porter Diamond Model.\nIn addition, they have the advantage that they can move very well on the international market and that they can maintain their presence and handle international competition. Examples of large clusters are the Swiss watch industry and the Hollywood film industry.\nOrganisations can use the Porter’s Diamond Model to establish how they can translate national advantages into international advantages. The Porter Diamond Model suggests that the national home base of an organization plays an important role in the creation of advantages on a global scale. This home base provides basic factors that support an organization, including government support but they can also hinder it from building advantages in global competition. The determinants that Michael Porter distinguishes are:\n1. Factor Conditions\nThis is the situation in a country relating to production factors like knowledge and infrastructure. These are relevant factors for competitiveness in particular industries. These factors can be grouped into material resources- human resources (labour costs, qualifications and commitment) – knowledge resources and infrastructure. But they also include factors like quality of research or liquidity on stock markets and natural resources like climate, minerals, oil and these could be reasons for creating an international competitive position.\n2. Related and supporting Industries\nThe success of a market also depends on the presence of suppliers and related industries within a region. Competitive suppliers reinforce innovation and internationalization. Besides suppliers, related organizations are of importance too. If an organization is successful this could be beneficial for related or supporting organizations. They can benefit from each other’s know-how and encourage each other by producing complementary products.\n3. Home Demand Conditions\nIn this determinant the key question is: What reasons are there for a successful market? What is the nature of the market and what is the market size? There always exists an interaction between economies of scale, transportation costs and the size of the home market. If a producer can realize sufficient economies of scale, this will offer advantages to other companies to service the market from a single location. In addition the question can be asked: what impact does this have on the pace and direction of innovation and product development?\n4. Strategy, Structure and Rivalry\nThis factor is related to the way in which an organization is organized and managed, its corporate objectives and the measure of rivalry within its own organizational culture. The Furthermore, it focuses on the conditions in a country that determine where a company will be established. Cultural aspects play an important role in this. Regions, provinces and countries may differ greatly from one another and factors like management, working morale and interactions between companies are shaped differently in different cultures. This could provide both advantages and disadvantages for companies in a certain situation when setting up a company in another country. According to Michael Porter domestic rivalry and the continuous search for competitive advantage within a nation can help organizations achieve advantages on an international scale. In addition to the above-mentioned determinants Michael Porter also mentions factors like Government and chance events that influence competition between companies.\nGovernments can play a powerful role in encouraging the development of industries and companies both at home and abroad. Governments finance and construct infrastructure (roads, airports) and invest in education and healthcare. Moreover, they can encourage companies to use alternative energy or alternative environmental systems that affect production. This can be effected by granting subsidies or other financial incentives.\n6. Chance events\nMichael Porter also indicates that in most markets chance plays an important role. This provides opportunities for innovative companies that are not afraid to start up new operations. Entrepreneurs usually start their companies in their homeland, without this having any economic advantages, whereas a similar start abroad would provide more opportunities.\nPorter Diamond Model example\nA few business analysts set-up a case about Mobile telecommunication.\n- Evolving mobile possibilities in relation with Internet.\n- Growing number of mobile owners. Mobile usage becomes cheaper and cheaper so it accessible for everybody.\n- Upcoming online businesses including App builders.\n- Government of county x stimulates Mobile Market regulation.\n- Government of county x puts continuous efforts in IT policies.\n- IT Workforce is developing and growing.\n- Level of Education on mobile and Internet technology is high.\n- County x has geographical IT advantages.\nRelated and supporting industry\n- This country is leading in the microchip market.\n- There are two countries that are trading partners.\n- The government is planning to invest in Mobile R&D and IT development.\n- County x is leading in all Mobile & IT related production.\nFirm strategy and structure\n- Venture firms with high IT technology.\n- Firm and small and medium size IT business companies.\n- Market competition in Mobile telecommunication.\n- Target niche market by continuous development and improvement of Mobile technology.\nBy using the Porter Diamond Model, an organization may identify what factors can build advantages at a national level. The Porter Diamond Model is therefore often used during internationalisation efforts. Michael Porter is of the opinion that all factors are decisive for the competitiveness of a company with respect to their foreign competitors. By considering these factors a company will be better able to formulate a strategic goal.\nPorter Diamond Model template\nIt’s Your Turn\nWhat do you think?

{"question":"What are the fundamental principles for selecting which content to include when taking notes during interpretation? How does one determine what to write down versus what to omit?","answer":"The fundamental principles for content selection in interpretation note-taking are: 1) Note the essence of meaning rather than actual words, 2) Begin taking notes as soon as the speech starts, 3) Only note what is necessary for interpretation, omitting obvious information and content clear from context, 4) Always note names, dates, and numbers as they are essential, 5) Record keywords as they are the pillars of meaning, 6) Use omission techniques like gaps or reference arrows for previously defined elements to save energy and streamline notes without compromising accuracy, 7) Only note attributes when they are not clear from context or are meaning-critical, and 8) Note comparatives and superlatives when they are meaning-critical and not obvious from context.","context":["The following is a translation/summary of pages 220-224 of Matyssek’s…\nHandbuch der Notizentechnik fuer Dolmetscher, Heinz Matyssek\nTHe numbering is Matyssek’s.

You can find Matyssek’s Symbols basics here:\n(Bear in mind that Matyssek worked and taught in the combination DE-EN and some of the points below are quite specific to that language combination).\nNote-taking basics, Matyssek\n1. Note the essence of meaning (tragenden Essenz), not the words and pass that on to your audience\n2. Start taking notes as soon as the speech begins\n3. Only note what is necessary to in order to interpret. Don’t note the obvious, that which is clear from context and that which can be remembered.\n4. Names, dates and numbers are an essential part of notes.\n5. Keywords are the pillars on which meaning is built and are therefore noted.\n6. Verticality is an essential part of note-taking. Verticality makes it possible to organise ideas logically and give the correct weight to each part and to quickly and thoroughly get across the speakers line of argument.\nVerticality is essential for lists. It also makes it possible to note a gap.\n7. Margin : by varying the distance from the margin indicates main and subordinate elements are distinguished. “Hierarchisation” of elements is thus visible on the page. This basic skeleton of the speeches meaning aids memorisation of other elements.\n8. Horizontal line from the margin between parts of the message (Sinnschritte) prevents ithese parts merging [unintentionally]. It also makes it possible to jump to other iparts of the message if asked to summarise a speech.\n9. Omission – leaving gaps or using the link line, or derivation line (aka reference arrow) – means not noting something already used or defined and leaving a gap in its place or by running a line or an arrow from the first mention to that place. This means less work is involved in taking the notes, saves energy and makes the notes themselves streamlines the notes without compromising accuracy.\n10. What language to take notes in – over and above the language non-specific symbols – is an issue that divides expert opinion. This decision should be left up to each individual interpreter. Long experience suggests note-taking in, or into, the mother tongue is the right way to go.\n11. Noting words makes abbreviation essential. Note the beginning and the end of each word. There will be occassional exceptions to this rule.\n12. Fixed rules for the position of noted elements on the page are found in the literature but are rejected here. Meaning-based, thus syntactical, hierarchisation is essential. Generally this is Subject Predicate, Object\n13. Transmission elements in the chain of thought should be noted at the left of the pad so they stand out.\n14. Tenses and moods are almost always essential to meaning and so should be noted.\n15. Number [singular or plural] and if necessary gender are meaning-critical and should be noted.\n16. Refuting or confirming, emphasis or down-playing are meaning-critical elements and must be carefully recorded in staggered notation.\n17. Prepositions should only be noted where absolutely necessary.\n18. A slash between to elements in the notes to denote the Genitive – often meaning-critical – seems essential.\n19. Pronouns are only noted when they serve to clarify contextual meaning.\nDemonstrative pronouns are noted when they are meaning-critical for part, or all, or the message.\nInterrogative pronouns are to be noted as required.\nPersonal pronouns – where they define the Subject or change thereof – are to be noted in the margin at the left of the pad.\nPossessive pronouns are generally unnecessary.\nRelative pronouns can generally be deduced from context and don’t need to be noted.\n20) Attributes are only noted when a) not clear from context or b) are meaning-critical\n21) Comparatives and superlatives are meaning-critical and should be noted, if they are not already obvious from context.\n22) Short-hand does not work as a means for note-taking and should be rejected. However selected borrowings from short-hand are possible.\n22) The note-pad should be small and manageable.

Much of my recent work helps advance a set of quantitative tools to anticipate how novel environmental variation regimes and biological invasions will alter the persistence of the higher levels of biological organization (communities, metacommunities, and food webs) in both lotic and lentic systems.\nI earned my PhD with the Research Group on Ecology of Inland Waters of the University of Girona (Catalonia, Spain) after research stays at the Linnaeus University, Sweden, and at the University of Georgia in Athens. My Ph.D. research evaluated successional trajectories of invertebrate communities in newly created aquatic habitats. Since the PhD, my research interests have been focused on quantifying the impacts of global change on the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems, with a special emphasis on hydrologic alteration and invasion. In September 2013, after a postdoc position at the Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA), I joined John Sabo’s lab at Arizona State University in a large collaborative, NSF project funded under the ‘Water Sustainability and Climate’ program to compare and contrast human influences on hydrologic and ecological systems in the U.S. Southwest and Southeast. In this role, I focused on quantifying the impacts of climate and hydrologic change on riverine fish communities via time series modeling (Fourier, autoregressive models) of streamflow and community data. While participating in WSC research I also contributed to a collaborative venture between ASU and the University of Alaska to study the effects of hydrologic regime shifts on riverine food webs.\nMy Postdoctoral Fellowship in SESYNC focuses on dams and water scarcity. Dams are a paramount driver of hydro-ecological alteration in the U.S., but also provide a range of socio-economic benefits and increase human resilience against climate change. Under scenarios of water scarcity due to increasing climate variability and over-allocation of freshwater resources, examining how dams can provide engineered resilience in social-ecological systems is a question of crucial importance. My project asks two questions: (i) Where are the ‘battlegrounds’ of water scarcity in the U.S., defined as basins where dams have a disproportionately high impact on hydrological and ecological alteration, and thus where modifying dam operations could offer particularly high benefits?, and (ii) How can we identify optimal trade-offs between maximizing water conservation in reservoirs (to increase human resilience to water scarcity) and securing as much biodiversity insurance as possible? I plan to answer these questions applying recent advances in time-series methods on long-term physical, ecological, and socio-economic data, in collaboration with Julian Olden (University of Washington).\nRuhí, A., Muñoz, I., Tornés, E., Batalla, R.J., Vericat, D., Ponsatí, L., Acuña, V., von Schiller, D., Marcé, R., Bussi, G., Francés, F. & S.

Medical ethics emphasizes individual patient autonomy and justice, requiring physicians to respect personal reproductive choices without imposing environmental values, while ensuring fair treatment regardless of demographics - especially given the historical context of coercive population control programs. In contrast, environmental modeling takes a broader systems approach, using integrated energy-economy-environment models to analyze population impacts on climate change, energy demand and emissions at national and global scales.

I’m concerned about contributing to overpopulation and the risk it poses to my and others’ children. I know one baby doesn’t make a big difference in the world population,” Emily says, “but if everyone has three kids, we’d be in big trouble. We are already. I don’t want to add to the problem.”\nConcerns such as Emily’s—about the relationship between family planning decisions, climate change, and the well-being of her family and the greater society—are not new. In the past, such concerns have led both researchers and clinicians to advocate for population control [1, 2]. In this paper, we will review some of the history of coercive family planning programs and of movements that have linked environmental and contraceptive concerns. We will then explore the ethical tensions between environmental policy and bedside contraceptive decision making. Finally, we will conclude with some examples of how a clinician can work to clarify patient needs and values in order to ensure ethical contraception counseling.\nHistorical Overview of Population Control Programs\nConcerns about population growth have often been conflated with concerns about the increasing demographic influence of specific feared or marginalized groups, leading to subsequent unjust treatment of those targeted populations [1, 2]. Unfortunately, physicians, acting in accordance with government policies or independently, have been active participants in these harmful programs. One of the most striking domestic examples of this trend is the chilling history of coercive sterilization of women of color and people with mental illness in the United States. By the mid-1970s, it was estimated that physicians working for the federal government forcibly or surreptitiously sterilized between 100,000 and 150,000 persons annually . Sadly, these unjust practices are not limited to the past. Between 2005 and 2013, 144 female inmates in California prisons were sterilized. Twenty-seven percent of these cases lacked adequate informed consent . Such unethical programs have harmed patients directly and continue to engender distrust of the medical system in some communities .\nFears about the detrimental environmental impact of rampant population growth can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s. Stanford professor Paul R. Ehrlich’s well-known book, The Population Bomb, published in 1968, extrapolated from high population growth rates to argue that within the coming decades, the world’s demand for food would outstrip supply and mass starvation would take hold across the globe . One potential intervention he offered would be a combination of voluntary and heavy-handed means to tamp down fertility. Ehrlich himself went so far as to say in a 2015 interview that “Allowing women to have as many babies as they [want] … is akin to letting everyone ‘throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor’s backyard as they want’”[7, 8]. Such attitudes had dangerous implications, especially for the developing world, whose high birth rates raised concerns in the US about national security and access to natural resources, leading policymakers to encourage sterilization and contraceptive use . Perhaps the most infamous example of this trend, China’s one-child policy, though no longer in effect, evolved in response to Communist Party leaders’ fears about overpopulation and its effect on living standards and the economy .\nIn the ensuing years, however, the population bomb has not proven to be the disaster Ehrlich once feared, thanks to subsequent demographic shifts in the developing world. Indeed, the world population growth rate has decreased steadily since the 1980s . The United Nations and the academic community more broadly now project that population growth will continue to slow over the coming decades .\nAs the case in question here suggests, however, contemporary environmental concerns have now come to overshadow concerns about sheer population size. The more pressing question today is how family size—and the added consumption that a large family implies—might impact global warming. Fertility control is seen by groups such as Population Action International as one aspect of a holistic approach to mitigating the effects of climate change in the short term and slowing the rate of global warming in the long term . Individual patients (such as Emily) might also feel varying levels of personal responsibility for the impact of their families on a changing planet or fear the way global warming might affect the health of their children [13, 14].\nUsing Ethical Principles to Resolve Tensions between Policy and the Bedside\nAlthough concerns about global trends might inform public policy, at the bedside, we are acting not as administrators of policy but as professionals caring for the patient in front of us. In doing so, our clinical decisions and actions are guided by the four key principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice . While no framework can capture every nuance of a clinical scenario, this four-principle approach proves helpful to tease out the competing interests at play in this case.\nRespect for patient autonomy is often upheld as the most important precept [15, 16]—if there is uncertainty about whether a course of action is ethical after balancing the four principles, we frequently defer to the patient’s decision or to that of her surrogate. With regard to Dr. Stuart’s response to Emily’s concerns, respect for her autonomy requires that Dr. Stuart elicit Emily’s values about having another pregnancy, including her thoughts about population growth and her responsibility to minimize her family’s ecological footprint. While no physician can be an expert on all factors that could affect a patient’s decision, physicians should be able to elicit such concerns and seek out additional information or expertise to best support a patient’s decision. In this scenario, if Emily needs more information about contraception and the environment to make a choice, Dr. Stuart should be willing to facilitate this research process. If Emily feels strongly that she cannot, in good conscience, have another child at this time because of that person’s impact on the environment, that might be reason enough for her to defer childbearing.\nWith regard to beneficence, Emily herself will not suffer obviously different effects from climate change based on whether she does or does not have another child at this moment, nor will having one additional person in the world appreciably shift the course of global warming. However, helping Emily explore and resolve the emotional distress that she is experiencing as she considers the potential environmental impact of a subsequent pregnancy and whether it is acceptable to bring a new child into the world at this time is in accordance with the principle of beneficence. Conversely, not acknowledging and addressing Emily’s deeply held concern would go against the principle of nonmaleficence.\nThe principle of justice also bears on this case. Upholding justice means treating patients fairly in spite of differences such as race, religion, sexual orientation, country of origin, or gender. As described above, people of color, the poor, and residents of the developing world historically have suffered most from population control programs mandating sterilization and contraception under the auspices of addressing environmental, social, and economic fears. Especially when such nonbiological concerns bear on a doctor-patient discussion, as they do in any case of contraception counseling, it is important for the physician to be self-reflective. Although Dr. Stuart happily has a reputation as a nonjudgmental clinician, she must still work to ensure that she is treating Emily in a similar fashion to her other patients. Dr. Stuart must be sure not to single out any patient for differential treatment because of race, age, or other demographic factors, given the fraught history of coercive sterilization of women of color and women with disabilities under the pretense of social or environmental concerns.\nStrategies for Responding to Patient Values\nTo summarize the above analysis, Dr. Stuart should not preemptively impose her personal beliefs on Emily about the impact of population growth on climate change. If Emily raises such concerns, however, Dr. Stuart should strive to address them in a patient-centered manner. This case, therefore, underscores an important aspect of patient counseling: clinicians must be ready to receive and address difficult questions and to respond to patients’ values. When patients raise challenging questions or potentially controversial topics, clinicians can benefit from having some approaches they can fall back on. Shared decision making (SDM) and motivational interviewing (MI) are two such approaches. Both of these counseling methods rely on a balance between providing concrete factual information and eliciting patient preferences to reach a patient-centered conclusion, although in a case such as Emily’s, SDM is likely most appropriate .\nSDM is ideal for helping patients choose between two or more medically appropriate options. In such situations (choosing a contraceptive method, for example), SDM techniques focus on eliciting patient preferences, providing relevant medical information, and facilitating access to the patient’s preferred option . In such encounters, the patient might note values that are firmly biomedical (e.g., efficacy of the method) and others that are more social (e.g., impact of family planning decisions on the environment). The clinician’s job is to reflect these values back to the patient, help her to prioritize them, and assist her in choosing a treatment course that meets her top priorities as best as possible. Physicians should recognize, however, that there are times when patient ambivalence makes it impossible to select a single option that aligns perfectly with all of the patient’s values.\nMI comes originally from the substance abuse literature and is intended for use when there is a clear treatment choice that maximizes health but to which the patient is not currently adherent (e.g., abstaining from cocaine) . It is still a patient-centered approach inasmuch as MI involves eliciting patient preferences and values concerning the decisions in question. Instead of becoming confrontational when the patient resists recommended behavior changes, the clinician taking an MI approach works with the patient to help uncover discrepancies between the patient’s values and behavior as a path toward adoption of healthier practices. For example, in working with the cocaine user, a motivational interviewer might uncover the fact that the patient wishes to be present for his daughter’s graduation and might encourage the patient to think about how ongoing cocaine use raises the risk that he will not be able to attend that event due to illness or death.\nUltimately, either of these approaches involves eliciting the patient’s preferences, which, in Emily’s case, might include not only the efficacy and side effects of contraception but also noncontraceptive benefits such as the social value of contraception and, potentially, the environmental impact of a large family. In a case such as Emily’s, the physician’s responsibility is to elicit and try to understand the patient’s preferences and then to offer treatment choices that align with those values. Dr. Stuart should counsel Emily with a shared decision-making approach. It is not appropriate for Dr. Stuart to impose environmental protection values on Emily’s reproductive decision making, as this risks undermining her autonomy as well as perpetuating injustice.\nBenjamin P.

{"question":"I'm researching institutional racism - how do the challenges faced by minority librarians compare to those experienced by indigenous communities in scientific research?","answer":"Minority librarians often face tokenization, being treated as statistics, having their photos used for diversity displays, and being 'cold called' for minority perspectives. They deal with assumptions based on their names and appearance, reflecting ongoing racism rather than just historical discrimination. Similarly, indigenous communities face systemic discrimination in scientific research, as demonstrated by the IRD case where indigenous communities in French Guiana had their traditional knowledge about the Quassia amara plant appropriated without proper consent or recognition. In both cases, there's a pattern of dominant institutions exploiting and marginalizing minority groups while claiming to serve them, though the indigenous communities face the additional challenge of having their very existence legally unrecognized in some contexts.","context":["The American Library Association (ALA) annual conference Sunday morning panel, “In Visibility: Race and Libraries” was a crash course in sociology and libraries, taught by Todd Honma PhD, assistant professor of Asian American Studies at Pitzer College and a former ALA Spectrum Scholar. Sponsored by ALA’s Office for Diversity and the Spectrum Scholars Program, the discussion asked the question: “Where do we locate race in relation to librarianship?”\nBeginning with the concept that race is a social construction, Honma explained what that meant in relation to libraries and librarianship. “Race,” he explained, “is a classification system—a way of classifying human bodies. It’s dynamic, not static.” He outlined how race operates at many levels, both personal (e.g., when white people ask an American person of color “where they are from,” and are disappointed if the answer is Sacramento) and institutional (legally mandated segregation). Race also operates ideologically, for instance when it is used to explain social phenomena.“ As many people in here who are catalogers know,” Honma added, “there is a kind of power and privilege to assigning names.”\nHe discussed whiteness as a perceived neutral classification, quoting sociologist George Lipsitz as having said that, “Whiteness is an unmarked category against which difference in constructed, whiteness never has to speak its name, never has to acknowledge its role as an organizing principle” in society and culture. Honma also touched on intersectionality—how multiple systems of oppression work in concert with each other—for instance sexism, homophobia, classism, ableism, and more.\nMoving on to how race has shaped libraries, Honma explained that the mission of American public libraries in the 19th century was to assimilate European immigrants into white (Anglo) U.S. society. This Americanization project was a two-part process of English instruction and preparation for citizenship, making libraries “complicit in the construction of the United States as a white republic.”\nHonma added that the phrase “making room at the table” is often heard in conversations about diversity, but asked, “Whose table? And do we really want an invitation?”\nQuoting Angela Davis, he said, “a multiculturalism that does not acknowledge the political character of culture will not, I am sure, lead towards the dismantling of racist, sexist, homophobic, economically exploitative institutions.” “Librarians use the term [multicultural] in many ways,” wrote L. Peterson in a 1995 LJ article titled “Multiculturalism: Affirmative or Negative Action?,” which Honma also quoted. “From our literature one cannot tell whether multicultural refers to racial minorities, concerns marginalization and equity, or merely celebrates differences as exotic.”\nHe concluded his talk by asking, “Is it just that we want to insert bodies of color into already existing structures / institutions? Or do we want to transform the structures themselves?” before turning over the discussion to the groups sitting at tables throughout the room—the majority of which occupied by Spectrum Scholars and program alumni.\nDEEPER CONVERSATIONS; FAMILIAR THREADS\n“I feel like this is one of these things where I’m like, ‘Hi, I’m Monica, I’m a Latina,’” said Monica Lagares, a Spectrum Scholar getting her library degree from the University of Maryland, which got a round of knowing laughs from her table.\nThe conversation deepened as it continued, though. Vivienne Layne, a scholar studying at McGill University, reflected “I’m mostly Chinese, but I’m from the Anglophone West Indies, so culturally we are really in line with Angloconformity. My dad knows how many pounds there are in a shilling—that’s like something out of a Dickens novel!”\nEmily Chan, a 2013 ALA Emerging Leader from Oakland, said, “As a kid, I grew up with a lot of Spanish around me.…In some ways, I identify more with the Latinos in my neighborhood, because we had the same socioeconomic background.”\n“I think I’m privileged because I’ve gone to college,” explained Beverly Coleman, a retired librarian and now a member of the Board of Trustees at Matteson P.L. in Illinois. “On a personal side, I’m privileged because I grew up with parents who were very strong minded and who believed in education.”\n“Because I’m older, I’ve seen the gamut of racism. My parents grew up in the South. Many times when I was a child and a teenager, I had gone to places in the South were they wouldn’t serve us.”\nWhen the discussion opened up across the room, many familiar threads emerged: feeling like a statistic, like a token, like they exist to have their photo put on the website. Many complained about being “cold called on minority perspectives” because of their appearance, about how their names prompt assumptions, about how people’s perception changes because of something as simple as hair. “It’s something you can’t even control,” one Scholar said.\n“What do we do then?” Honma asked. “There’s no pat answer, I’m afraid.” While few solutions were offered, the conversation raised several important points.\n“Black history month at many libraries is treated as a very historical thing,” one audience member said, “Racism exists now.”\nOne librarian, who grew up during the civil rights era and was the second black person to attend her otherwise all-white school, argued, “We are not educating our children. It has to start at a school level. We don’t teach American Indian history. We don’t teach black history. We don’t teach Hispanic history. I don’t know how to say this nicely. There was a time where black people could not even go into the library in the area where I live. White co-workers are so shocked.”\nAnother audience member asked, “Everyone chose to be here. How do you get to people who don’t go to these meetings?”\nHonma urged them not to give up hope, concluding with, “Don’t forget that you all have power to change things.”","Over the past ten years, there has been a steady rise in cases of cultural appropriation and the problems which ensue. The feminist theorist bell hooks used the term cultural appropriation in the late 1980s to describe the simultaneous fetishisation and cannibalisation of the black body in advertising, music and film. This term unravelled an invisible construction within the social and institutional fabric of the United States and the entire globalized Western world. By relating this unconscious mechanism of desire in mass culture to racist white supremacy, bell hooks made visible a kind of “imperialist nostalgia” that locates the primitive spirit” in the “non-white body of the other”.\nThe growing space for discussion about cultural appropriation has been fuelled by “Black Lives Matter” movement in 2013 or the debate underway since 2017, inspired by Bénédicte Savoy and Felwine Sarr, about restitution of African cultural objects contained in Western museums.\nIn an open letter in 2017, Hanna Black spoke out against exhibiting a work by Dana Schutz at the New York Whitney Biennial art exhibition. The painting by the American artist of European descent is inspired by a photograph showing the disfigured body of Emmett Till, an African-American boy who was brutally lynched by two white men in 1955 in Money, Mississippi. In a contemporary nod to bell hooks' analyses, Hanna Black highlighted that “ongoing debates on the appropriation of Black culture by non-Black artists have highlighted the relation of these appropriations to the systematic oppression of Black communities in the US and worldwide, and, in a wider historical view, to the capitalist appropriation of the lives and bodies of Black people with which our present era began.” Hanna Black's letter is part of a global resistance movement against an ideological construction, whose racist, sexist and ableist foundation has accompanied the emergence of modernity.\nWith reference to the slavery that turns millions of men, women and children into “movable goods”, Hanna Black takes us to the heart of what Annibal Quijano calls the “coloniality of power”. For the Peruvian sociologist, race is “the first modern category, because it makes it possible to classify the population on the basis of phenotypic distinguishing features, especially skin colour, so that the differentiation and the subordinate social position of certain groups appears as the effect of a natural process”. The colonial structure of power has thus produced social differences, which in a second step have been codified as racial, ethnic and national differences. These constructions have been transformed into “supposedly objective, scientific categories without taking their historical dimensions into account. They became natural phenomena, seemingly completely detached from the history of power”. Annibal Quijano's theory reveals how racism and capitalism are firmly intertwined.\nHe also shows the birth of a Eurocentric approach that denies the legitimacy of all forms of knowledge, except those produced by modern Western science. Cultural appropriation can be viewed as a step in the course of a wider process of domination through the annexation and classification of living beings. This cuts to the heart of the project of modernity, which has also left its mark on the current discussions on biopiracy.\nTake, for example, a particular biopiracy case about the plant Quassia amara which is currently in the hands of the European Patent Office (EPO) between the indigenous community of French Guiana (a French overseas department in South America) and the Institut de Récherche pour le Développement (IRD), the French research institute for development.\nScientists have relied on a policy of domination over colonised people as well as annexed territories\nIf one trusts the Carl von Linné system, the discovery of the quassia amara species dates to the 18th century and is attributed to the botanist Kwasimukamba, also called Granman Quassi. In his childhood he was taken as a slave and was uprooted from Ghana to the Dutch colony Surinam. As an adult he was given back his freedom - on the one hand because he mediated between the Saramaka people and the Dutch army during the Maroon Wars of the 18th century and, on the other, because of his knowledge of natural remedies. It is highly likely he made a bitter tea brew from the extract of quassia amara, the bright green plant with red flowers which grows in the Amazon basin. The current scandal about the plant, which is called “couachi” by the indigenous communities of Guiana, began in 2002, when the World Health Organization commissioned an epidemiological study on malaria to find out how the indigenous population treats it. Initially, this meant evaluating traditional remedies for the protection and treatment of malaria. The plants used for this purpose were then documented. The organization in charge of this data collection for French Guiana is the IRD, an institution founded in 1935. Back then, its remit included organizing “colonial sciences”.\nSince the beginning of the colonial process, English, French or German scientists have relied on a policy of domination over colonised people as well as annexed territories in Africa, South America or Asia, in order to develop extensive prophylactic campaigns against yellow fever, malaria and sleeping sickness under the guise of philanthropy. These campaigns enabled scientists to develop new tests and find new results, while expanding their laboratories in colonised areas. As a result, tropical medicine was created with the support of the colonial administration and formed an essential cog in the bigger machine.\nIn 2002, the IRD detailed the research: 117 persons from different population groups, Creoles, Galibis, Palikur, Hmong and others, were randomly selected and interviewed. For ethical reasons, such a survey should never have been carried out without informing each and every individual and the respective authority (their chief or religious leader) on site: The researchers had to concede that they had not asked for permission to use the results. The Couachi plant was identified as one of the plants used by the interviewees as a remedy against malaria.\nFrom 2000 to 2009, the researchers analysed the plant's effect and in 2009 the IRD applied for a first patent protecting the use of the active ingredient Simalikalactone E for the treatment of malaria. The patent was recognized in 2015. A second patent protecting the use of Simalikalactone E molecule as an active ingredient against cancer was confirmed in 2017.\nThe term “biopiracy” as it is used at present was first used by Pat Roy Mooney in 1993, following the 1992 World Summit in Rio de Janeiro. There, at a convention on biological biodiversity, a total of 182 states set three treaty objectives: the conservation of biological diversity, its sustainable use and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from its genetic resources. The two patents filed by the IRD went against all the intentions of this treaty by earmarking researchers as the discoverers of the molecule, thus giving the IRD a monopoly on its use for at least twenty years.\nThe Couachi plant was identified as one of the plants used by the indigenous as a remedy against malaria\nFrench law, meanwhile, does not recognize the existence of the indigenous communities of French Guiana, meaning that the IRD can prohibit anyone from using a malaria or cancer remedy which contains quassia amara , including the indigenous population, who not only contributed to the Institute's research, but also had a long tradition of using the couachi plant as a remedy for malaria. The indigenous community has been robbed of its own knowledge as well as its own history. Alexis Tiouka, a specialist lawyer for indigenous peoples, writes: “It is important to distinguish between the recognition of indigenous peoples under international law and the recognition of much older peoples and their own legal system, as seen from the view point of indigenous peoples. (...) International law cannot be the only binding legal reference for indigenous people.”\nAs a result of the complaint filed by NGOs against the IRD, the European Patent Office declared: “The use of the invention is neither contrary to morality nor to public policy” and thus completely overlooked the existence of ancient knowledge and the use of these plants in the traditional remedies. Alexis Tiouka summarised this: “You are saying that the indigenous communities are not familiar with the molecule (...) This is also how it relates to the appropriation of land: you do not name it, you do not occupy it, so the coloniser can appropriate it. The EPA and the IRD rely on the 'Terra nullius' theory to secure the rights to this molecule.”\nThe term 'decolonisation' has often been used in recent years, a call to rethink the unequal relations that Western institutions have with the dominated and/or racialised indigenous communities. It deconstructs the appropriation of knowledge and the material and immaterial heritage of the communities. To give old knowledge and traditional practices a new foundation, we must recognise that decolonisation is “not a metaphor,” as Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang argue. “When metaphor invades decolonisation, it kills the very possibility of decolonisation; it recenters whiteness, it resettles theory.”\nAlthough it is difficult to find a common strategy to envisage a future emancipated from colonial rule - especially in the so-called French Guiana - the conclusions of Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang point us towards an “an ethic of incommensurability” that does not try to balance the existence of colonialists and indigenous communities. On the contrary, they appeal to that ethic so that the “future indigenous” can be born as soon as the nation of the colonialists has disappeared: “Decolonisation offers a different perspective to human and civil rights based approaches to justice, an unsettling one, rather than a complementary one. Decolonisation is not an “and”. It is an elsewhere.”.\nTranslated by Bärbel Brands and Jess Smee"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5168d748-87db-488b-9d41-63eb5d61e713>","<urn:uuid:aaaed1ca-193c-44c7-880a-60cb083308a3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Were both the 2012 Arctic cyclone and Hurricane Sandy monitored using VIIRS satellite imagery?","answer":"Yes, both storms were monitored using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi NPP satellite. VIIRS captured views of the Arctic cyclone on August 7, 2012, while for Hurricane Sandy, VIIRS provided 'night-time visible' imagery on October 29, 2012, showing the storm's compact convective core east of Cape Hatteras.","context":["An unusually large, long-lasting, and powerful cyclone was churning over the Arctic in early August 2012. Two smaller systems merged on August 5 to form the storm, which at the time occupied much of the Beaufort-Chukchi Sea and Canadian Basin. On average, Arctic cyclones last about 40 hours; as of August 9, 2012, this storm had lasted more than five days.\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi NPP captured this view of the storm on August 7, 2012. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua captured a natural-color image of the storm as well.\nArctic cyclones are more common during the summer than winter; however, summer cyclones tend to be weaker than the storms that batter the region during the winter. This cyclone’s central sea level pressure reached about 964 millibars on August 6, 2012—a number more typical of a winter cyclone. That pressure puts it within the lowest 3 percent of all minimum daily sea level pressures recorded north of 70 degrees latitude, noted Stephen Vavrus, an atmospheric scientist based at the University of Wisconsin.\nThe number of cyclones affecting the Arctic appears to be increasing. According to a study of long-term Arctic cyclone trends authored by a team led by John Walsh and Xiangdong Zhang of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the number and intensity of Arctic cyclones has increased during the second half of the twentieth century, particularly during the summer.\nThe cause of the increase is an open question, but climate change may be affecting Arctic cyclones. One study published in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters, concluded that the total number of exratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere would decline as the climate changed, but that the Arctic Ocean and adjacent areas would see slightly more and stronger summer storms.\nOne way climate change may affect Arctic cyclones is by changing the sea ice and ocean temperature. Climate change has caused sea ice to retreat markedly in recent decades and has also warmed Arctic Ocean temperatures. Such changes may be providing more energy and moisture to support cyclone development and persistence, Zhang explained.\nHowever, scientists who study extratropical storms emphasize that pinning down how exactly climate change is affecting the size, frequency, or tracks of Arctic storms remains an important but unresolved question. “This past week’s storm was exceptional, and the occurrence of Arctic storms of extreme intensity is a topic deserving closer investigation,” noted Walsh. “With reduced ice cover and warmer sea surfaces, the occurrence of more intense storms is certainly a plausible scenario. The limitation at present is the small sample size of exceptional events, but that may change in the future.”\n- NASA. (2008, October 6).

A comparison of AWIPS images of Suomi NPP VIIRS 0.7 µm Day/Night Band and 11.45 µm IR data from shortly after 06 UTC or 2 AM EDT (above) showed the compact convective core of Hurricane Sandy east of Cape Hatteras, near the South Wall of the Gulf Stream. Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean Heat Content products from the CIMSS Tropical Cyclones site (below) indicated that later in the morning (around 12 UTC) the center of Sandy was crossing the axis of the Gulf Stream.\nSea Surface Temperature and Ocean Heat Content products\nGOES-13 10.7 µm imagery (Click image to play animation)\nGOES-13 was placed into in Rapid Scan Operations (RSO) mode to monitor Sandy, and 10.7 µm IR images (above; click image to play animation) showed several noteworthy aspects to the storm. The sheer size of the storm is quite evident. The cirrus shield of the storm was pushing west through lower Michigan into Wisconsin during the 16-hour time period of the animation. The IR images also showed the pulsing development of convection near the center of the storm, and the northwest motion of the entire system. The cyclonic circulation in the low-level wind field over the ocean and the anticyclonic circulation of the higher level clouds over the eastern United States was also apparent.\nA morning overpass of the Metop-A satellite provided Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds around Sandy (below) — there were a number of wind vectors having speeds of 50 knots or higher (within the area of red wind vectors) in the southern quadrant of the storm.\nPOES AVHRR 0.86 µm visible channel image + ASCAT surface scatterometer winds\nSuomi NP VIIRS 11.45 µm, MODIS 11.0 µm, and POES AVHRR 12.0 µm IR images (click image to play animation)\nA sequence of 1-km resolution Suomi NPP VIIRS 11.45 µm, MODIS 11.0 µm, and POES AVHRR 12.0 µm IR images (above; click image to play animation) showed the structure of Hurricane Sandy at various times as it curved northwestward toward the US East Coast. Such an animation also serves to underscore the potential value of having access to high spatial resolution polar-orbiting satellite imagery in AWIPS, in the event of an outage of the GOES-East satellite (such as the one that occurred on 23 September 2012).

{"question":"What are the research initiatives and technical challenges in geothermal exploration?","answer":"Research initiatives include the BAGUS project between ITB and Kyoto University, which focuses on steam spot exploration, sustainable development, and resource maximization. The project has installed modern laboratory equipment worth JPY 282.5 million for geothermal research. However, technical challenges persist in geothermal exploration, including high investment and operational costs, problems with drilling wells, component failure due to high reservoir temperatures, and the aggressive nature of geofluids. Several projects are addressing these challenges, such as GeoCoat developing corrosion-resistant coatings, and Geo-Drill working on reducing drilling costs through innovative technologies targeting depths of 5 km and temperatures above 250°C.","context":["ITB and Kyoto University Strengthen Collaboration on Geothermal Exploration Technology Development\nBANDUNG, itb.ac.id--Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) and Kyoto University, Japan, strengthen research collaboration on geothermal exploration technology development through a project called BAGUS, or Beneficial and Advanced Geothermal Use System.\nDuring 24 April 2015 to 24 April 2020, ITB and Kyoto University have collaborated in a research project named “Beneficial and Advanced Geothermal Use System” (BAGUS) which was under the scheme of Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS). The research project was funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for ITB and by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) for Kyoto University. The project was co-partnered by three parties, i.e. Center for Mineral, Coal, and Geothermal Resources (CMCGR) - Geological Agency, Star Energy Geothermal (Wayang Windu) Ltd., and PT Geo Dipa Energi (Persero).\nThis project was motivated by some global issues such as the manifestation of phenomena suggesting “Global Warming”, the need for enhanced use of renewable energy resources, the cost problem in geothermal resource exploration & development, and the vulnerability of geothermal resource. There are three aims of the project, known as 3S, i.e. (i) Detection of steam spots (Steam-Spot Exploration), (ii) Minimization of environmental load (Sustainable Development), and (iii) Maximization of resource and plant uses (Survivability).\nBy this project, JICA has installed some modern laboratory equipment and software with total budget JPY 282.5 million or equivalent to about IDR 36 billion. All equipment and software were installed in Laboratory of Hydrogeology and Hydrogeochemistry FTTM ITB. The list of equipment are: Automated multipurpose XRD, WD-XRF, Ion Chromatography, Gas Chromatography, Field Spectrometer, Ultra-Micro Balance, Scanning Electron Microscope – EDS, Ultra-Pure Water Purifier System, ICP – MS, Water Stable Isotope, GC-EA Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry, Radon and Mercury measurement equipment, ENVI software for remote sensing analysis (installed in Study Program of Geology FITB), and TOUGH software for reservoir modelling (installed in Study Program of Geothermal FTTM). Apart from the BAGUS Project, the equipment is also provided for community services within ITB and other universities and institution e.g. Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Indonesian National Narcotics Agency, National Agency of Drug and Food Control, Forensic Laboratory Center - Indonesian National Police, PT Biofarma (Persero), PT Len Industri (Persero), Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing of Republic of Indonesia, etc. The current laboratory’s activity can be seen in: https://lab.fttm.itb.ac.id/hidro/.\nBeside those laboratory facilities, these five years project has also produced some extensive outcomes as follows:\n• Publication in international proceedings and journals (> 20 papers).\n• Final project for Bachelor program (± 20 students) at ITB, Master thesis (± 15 students) at ITB, and PhD dissertation (4 students) at Kyoto University.\n• Short-term training program in geothermal science and technology at Kyoto University which was held for four batches and participated by ± 40 junior researcher (master students) of ITB, ± 5 research assistants of ITB, ± 6 scientist/engineer/staff of CMCGR (Geological Agency) and geothermal companies.\n• Development on the new geothermal sites at Wayang Windu and Patuha geothermal fields, Bandung Regency, West Java.\nThis year (April 2020 to March 2021) Kyoto University extends the new research collaboration under the scheme of Accelerating Social Implementation for SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) Achievement or called as aXis Project which is funded by JST. This new project is the implementation of BAGUS Project at Patuha geothermal field with total budget about USD 800 thousand. The title of project is “Accuracy Improvement and Demonstration by Boring Survey of Steam-Spot Detection Technology for Locating Drilling Sites of Geothermal Production Wells”. In this project, additional radon and mercury monitoring points and some geophysical surveys such as Audio-Magnetotelluric (AMT) and Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) methods are planned. Moreover, shallow core drilling for thermal gradient measurement and geochemical analysis of core and fluids samples is planned for one well with total depth about 600 m within PT Geo Dipa Energi (Persero)’s working area.\nThe general activities of BAGUS project can be checked at: http://bagus-satreps.fttm.itb.ac.id/","Geothermal energy — energy right beneath our feet ― has an enormous potential with a proven reliability to meet heating, cooling and flexible electricity generation demands. With a low carbon footprint, this largely untapped natural and renewable energy resource has the capacity for a sustainable and clean energy future.\nDespite the power generating opportunities offered, exploitation of geothermal resources continues to remain a challenge relative to the conventional sources, often due to the high investment and operational costs of geothermal power plants. These issues stem from the techno-economic and environmental impacts of drilling wells to geothermal reservoirs, component failure due to the uncertainty of geothermal formations, including high reservoir temperatures, and the aggressive nature of geofluids.\nBuilding on its expertise and knowledge in coatings, material properties and performance, plant management, and joining technologies, TWI pioneers geothermal energy research by providing solutions to help improve flexibility and efficiency of geothermal systems, while reducing plant operational costs, including provision of holistic approaches for cheap and efficient drilling solutions.\nTWI is working on a number of geothermal power projects, these include:\nGeoCoat: Developing Next Generation Coatings for Geothermal Power Plant\nLed by TWI, the project aims to develop novel high performance, specialised corrosion- and erosion-resistant coatings for exceptionally harsh environments. These high performance corrosion and erosion resistant coatings are based on selected high entropy alloys (HEAs) and ceramic/metal mixtures (Cermets) to be applied through high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) thermal spray, electro spark deposition (ESD), electroless plating, and laser cladding.\nAlthough originally designed to target the key failure points within geothermal power plants, the coatings developed have cross sector benefits and can potentially be applied to other sectors, such as glass, paper, oil and gas, food and drink, etc.\nGeo-Drill: Holistic Drilling Solutions for Cheaper Geothermal Power\nThe project aims to reduce the high costs associated with drilling by addressing the materials challenges associated with the wear and fracture of drilling components. The Geo-Drill concept is based on three technology pillars:\n- Reduced drilling cost through hydraulic DownTheHolefluid/mud hammer\n- Advanced drill monitoring through low-cost and robust 3D printed sensors\n- Improved component life through advanced materials and coatings\nThe strength of these technologies will be combined to meet the unified objective of developing novel drilling technologies that will significantly reduce the cost of deep geothermal drilling, with a targeted depth of 5 km and high temperatures of 250°C and above.\nGeoSmart: Towards Flexible and Efficient Geothermal Systems\nGeothermal energy is currently engineered as an \"always on\" baseload supply in power generation, due to the limited flexibility to throttle the well without scaling and liner fatigue problems, and is engineered for maximal efficiency at this output level. Project GeoSmart, aims to address the strategic flexibility required from European geothermal installations, as they become significant energy sources over the next 20-30 years, replacing decommissioned fossil fuel plants.\nGeoSmart aims to optimise and demonstrate innovations to improve the flexibility and efficiency of geothermal heat and power systems, by developing a suite of equipment and tools including:\n- Energy storage and power block management innovations to provide daily flexibility\n- Integration of more flexible Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems that can cope with variations in needs in the electricity markets\n- Combined Heat and Power (CHP) supplier to extract more heat from the post-generator (\"waste\" heat) brine outflows when required for increased heating supply during colder weather\nGeoHEX: Developing High Performance Heat Exchangers for Geothermal Energy\nGeoHex relies on the use low cost carbon steel as base material for heat exchangers. Through modification of the surfaces with nano porous coatings and controlling the surface chemistry, GeoHex aims to significantly improve the heat transfer performance of single phase and phase change heat transfer process respectively. The project relies on the use of Ni-P/Ni-P-PTFE duplex and amorphous metal glass coatings to attribute the anti-scaling and anti-corrosion properties to the low-cost carbon steel substrate.\nGEOPRO: Understanding and Modelling Geofluid Characteristics\nThe chemical and physical properties of the geothermal fluids are crucial in exploration, prediction and utilisation of novel geothermal technologies. An improved understanding of the properties of these fluids is considered important to optimise site developments and operation of geothermal systems. Project GEOPRO, is designed to generate targeted advances in the understanding and modelling of geofluid characteristics, to support geothermal users by:\n- Supporting improved design efficiency – knowledge-based design of wellbore, pipework, heat exchangers;\n- For optimal conversion of the primary energy into electrical power;\n- Enabling knowledge-based design activities for best control of the constraining fluid phenomena (such as scale formation, outgassing, cavitation during changes in temperature and pressure), maximising uptime and operational effectiveness of the plant;\n- Providing underpinning knowledge for the future exploration and exploitation of supercritical systems through improved “vectors to ore” arising from the ability to better use fluid chemistry to predict deep subterranean conditions.\nS4CE: A Well-established Interdisciplinary Network of Scientists to Trust the Environmental Safety of Geo-energy Operations\nThe Horizon 2020 project S4CE aims to develop, test and implement technologies needed for successfully detecting, quantifying and mitigating the risks connected with geo-energy operations in the sub-surface.\nThe project, which is led by UCL, includes 23 partners representing academic institutions, industry energy operators, industrial partners and research institutes.\nS4CE’s ambition is to develop and implement state-of-the-art technologies to assess the environmental footprint of geo-energy sub-surface operations in EU. The project promotes the benefits of a multi-sensor approach in managing sub-surface operations.\nThe project is deploying advanced instrumentation in three existing field sites in Europe; the CarbFix site in Iceland, one geothermal operation in Cornwall and a water-gas well in St. Gallen, Switzerland.\nTWI is leading work related to the implementation of novel technologies in these three European field sites."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:adcfb247-9826-4a76-b774-020e4684204b>","<urn:uuid:c88ba713-bca1-4902-9e47-05fd21f4085d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the three main types of Caspian Sea caviar and how do they differ in terms of egg size and color?","answer":"The three main types are Beluga, Osetra, and Sevruga. Beluga produces the largest eggs that range from gray to black in color. Osetra eggs range from yellowish gray to dark brown, with gold Osetra being the rarest. Sevruga has the smallest eggs, ranging from medium gray to black.","context":["Caviar – More Than Just Sturgeon Eggs\nYou either love or hate the idea of eating caviar. Basically you are eating the eggs (roe) of sturgeon, a fish found in various parts of the world but most notably in the Caspian Sea near Russia. This is where you find the largest and highest quality caviar and the most expensive.\nYou can also find Chinese and American caviar but they are smaller and don’t have the quality or flavor of caviar coming from the Caspian Sea.\nThe eggs are harvested from sturgeon and sold with very little processing except for the addition of salt. The flavor is fishy and sometimes described as briny and can be an acquired taste. I remember my first experience with caviar was much like Tom Hanks in the movie Big but now I love it.\n3 Main Types of Caviar\nThe three most popular types of caviar come from three different sturgeons thus creating a common grading system for buying these highly prized eggs. Each has its own unique qualities but which one you like depends on your own personal tastes.\nBeluga – the most expensive of the three and also the largest. Beluga sturgeon can reach 19 feet in length and weigh more than one ton. They produce the largest eggs that are a range from gray to black in color. They are also the most rare of the three adding to the expense and are not related in any way to the Beluga whale.\nOsetra – another large sturgeon reaching an average 7 feet in length and weighing in at over 500 pounds. The eggs from the Osetra sturgeon range in color from yellowish gray to dark brown with the gold Osetra, also know as “royal caviar” being the rarest . Osetra caviar is known for having a stronger flavor than Beluga most likely because it swims in deeper, colder waters providing a different diet.\nSevruga – the smallest with the briniest flavor. Not as expensive as the other two, the roe ranges in color from medium gray to black. It is the most abundant and can weigh up to 150 pounds.\nOther Types of Caviar\nJust to confuse things more, other types of fish including salmon, lumpfish and whitefish call their eggs caviar. You often see them used in sushi bars and in supermarkets. They are inexpensive compared to Caspian Sea caviar and expect for cooking purposes should be avoided. Those small black eggs from lumpfish you find in every supermarket may look like the real thing, but they don’t have the flavor.\nHow to Buy Caviar\nCaviar is processed by straining and sorting the eggs by size and color. A mild salt (Malossol) is added to the eggs to prevent freezing. The eggs are then packed in 4 pound tins containers and exported.\nAn importer repackages the caviar into smaller tins or jars that you can purchase at high end markets. The typical size is 1 ounce containers.\nIMPORTANT – Beluga caviar always comes in blue tins, Osetra in yellow tins and Sevruga caviar in red tins.\n- IMPORTANT: The US Fish and Wildlife has stopped the import of Beluga caviar into the United States to help rebuild the diminishing stocks in the Caspian Sea. If you find any Beluga caviar being sold here, it was harvested before the fall of 2005 or brought in by poacher illegally. Fresh Beluga is not currently available.\n- Do Your Homework – This stuff is expensive so learn everything you can about the various types of caviar and their different grades. Find a distributor of imported caviar you trust and don’t be afraid to ask questions based on what you’ve learned. If they don’t want to answer your questions, find some place else to spend your money.\n- Buy Only Fresh Caviar – Because caviar is extremely perishable, once it is imported and repackaged, the shelf life is only about 3 to 4 weeks unopened. Once opened, it’s good for about three days and that’s if refrigerated at an ideal temperature of 30 degrees F. So ask about dates.\n- Only Buy As Much As You Are Going To Serve – There is basically no shelf life on expensive caviar, two or three days so plan to plan accordingly.\n- Don’t Buy Caviar in a Supermarket – In general, most caviar sold in supermarkets is not what you are looking for. You must go to a high end gourmet store or establishment that specializes in caviar. Lucky for us, many of these stores like Amazon.com now sell online. Either way, make sure the person you are dealing with is very knowledgeable about caviar.\n- Look for the term “Malossol” – it means lightly salted and is a good indication that the caviar is high-end.\n- Taste Before Buying – Not always possible, especially over the Internet, but some top dealers will allow you to sample before purchasing.\n- Look for Discounts – The holidays is a big caviar buying time of the year and you often find caviar on sale. Just be careful you are not buying old or inferior product.\n- Don’t Buy Black Market Caviar – there is more and more illegal caviar on the market today and it may eventually ruin the availability of sturgeon caviar sometime in the near future. Be sure to ask your supplier if the caviar you are buying is legally imported.\nWhat’s It Going To Cost\nPrices will vary depending on they type you buy, where you buy it & how much you buy. Most likely you will be buying it in the popular 1 ounce jar or tin and here’s what you can expect to pay:\n- Beluga Caviar – not currently available according to the US Fish and Wildlife\n- Osetra Caviar – Ranges from $90 to $140 per ounce\n- Sevruga Caviar – Ranges from $95 to $ $125 per ounce\nStoring Fresh Caviar\nCaviar does not have a very long shelf life. Once opened, you only have 3-4 days, max, before your expensive caviar is no longer edible. The ideal temperature for storing caviar is about 30 degrees F. My refrigerator is set for about 33 degrees F so I would need to store caviar in the coldest section. Even so, I try to only buy as much as I will need for my party.\nSome experts suggest wrapping opened tins in plastic wrap to reduce the chance of oxidation. My suggestion is to buy only what you will eat in one day, so you won’t even have to worry about getting out the plastic wrap.\nDo not freeze caviar except for domestic Golden Whitefish caviar and Salmon caviar. These two types freeze well but all others will not. Freezing destroys their delicate texture, leaving your caviar mushy and without the “pop” that you expect when you eat high-quality, fresh caviar.\n- How Much To Serve – really depends on who you are serving it to but figure on 1 ounce per person if serving alone and 1/2 ounce person if serving on top of hors d’oeuvres or garnishes for canapes.\n- How to Serve It – Keep it simple and let the caviar do the talking. Placing the tin in a bed of crushed ice not only looks elegant, it helps keep the fragile eggs fresh.\n- Mother-of Pearl Spoons – I have read you should only use natural materials for serving caviar like mother-of pearl, bone, horn because metal will oxidize the caviar when it comes in contact with it. I’m not sure how that can be possible especially since caviar is stored in metal tins.\n- I have also read that this is only true with sterling silver. Either way, the spoons are not that expensive especially when you consider the cost of the caviar. Plus they look great next to the tin of caviar.\n- What to Serve – The classic accompaniments are toast points, potatoes & blini (small pancakes). Sometimes you will find creme fraiche served too. I suggest “less is more”. Let the natural briny flavors of the expensive caviar assault your taste buds. Don’t cover them up with a bunch of distractions.\n- What to Drink – The classic drink with fresh caviar is ice-cold vodka because of its neutral taste. Some people enjoy a glass of champagne with their caviar. It’s up to your personal preferences. Try to avoid any drink that will alter or overwhelm the clean flavors of the caviar.\nWhere to Buy Online\nAmazon.com – what doesn’t Amazon sell? They have a good selection of caviar including these brands:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dcf5794c-ff20-4ced-990a-f5633809cc71>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do signal-to-noise ratio and index of dispersion differ in their measurement of variability?","answer":"The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measures signal quality by comparing the average power of the desired signal to noise power, while the index of dispersion (VMR) measures dispersion by comparing variance to mean. In signal processing, SNR is calculated by subtracting the noise from the signal strength, while VMR equals 1 for a Poisson distribution, is greater than 1 for over-dispersed data (clustered patterns), and less than 1 for under-dispersed data (regular patterns). While both are statistical measures, they serve different purposes - SNR evaluates signal quality versus interference, while VMR assesses distribution patterns.","context":["- Index of dispersion\nIn probability theory and statistics, the index of dispersion, dispersion index, coefficient of dispersion, or variance-to-mean ratio (VMR), like the coefficient of variation, is a normalized measure of the dispersion of a probability distribution: it is a measure used to quantify whether a set of observed occurrences are clustered or dispersed compared to a standard statistical model.\nIt is also known as the Fano factor, though this term is sometimes reserved for windowed data (the mean and variance are computed over a subpopulation), where the index of dispersion is the special case where the window is infinite. Windowing data is frequently done: the VMR is frequently computed over various intervals in time or small regions in space, which may be called \"windows\", and the resulting statistic called the Fano factor.\nIt is only defined when the mean μ is non-zero, and is generally only used for positive statistics, such as count data or time between events, or where the underlying distribution is assumed to be the exponential distribution or Poisson distribution.\nIn this context, the observed dataset may consist of the times of occurrence of predefined events, such as earthquakes in a given region over a given magnitude, or of the locations in geographical space of plants of a given species. Details of such occurrences are first converted into counts of the numbers of events or occurrences in each of a set of equal-sized time- or space-regions.\nThe above defines a dispersion index for counts. A different definition applies for a dispersion index for intervals, where the quantities treated are the lengths of the time-intervals between the events, and where the index is equivalent to the square of the coefficient of variation of the interval lengths. Common usage is that \"index of dispersion\" means the dispersion index for counts.\nThe Poisson distribution has equal variance and mean, giving it a VMR = 1. The geometric distribution and the negative binomial distribution have VMR > 1, while the binomial distribution has VMR < 1, and the constant random variable has VMR = 0. This yields the following table:\nDistribution VMR constant random variable VMR = 0 not dispersed binomial distribution 0 < VMR < 1 under-dispersed Poisson distribution VMR = 1 negative binomial distribution VMR > 1 over-dispersed\nWhen the coefficient of dispersion is less than 1, a dataset is said to be \"under-dispersed\": this condition can relate to patterns of occurrence that are more regular than the randomness associated with a Poisson process. For instance, points spread uniformly in space or regular, periodic events will be under-dispersed.\nIf the index of dispersion is larger than 1, a dataset is said to be over-dispersed: this can correspond to the existence of clusters of occurrences. Clumped, concentrated data is over-dispersed.\nIn terms of the interval-counts, over-dispersion corresponds to there being more intervals with low counts and more intervals with high counts, compared to a Poisson distribution: in contrast, under-dispersion is characterised by there being more intervals having counts close to the mean count, compared to a Poisson distribution.\nThe relevance of the index of dispersion is that it has a value of one when the probability distribution of the number of occurrences in an interval is a Poisson distribution. Thus the measure can be used to assess whether observed data can be modeled using a Poisson process.\nA sample-based estimate of the dispersion index can be used to construct a formal statistical hypothesis test for the adequacy of the model that a series of counts follow a Poisson distribution.\nThe VMR is a good measure of the degree of randomness of a given phenomenon. This technique is also commonly used in currency management.\nFor randomly diffusing particles (Brownian motion), the distribution of the number of particle inside a given volume is poissonian, i.e. VMR=1. Therefore, to assess if a given spatial pattern (assuming you have a way to measure it) is due purely to diffusion or if some particle-particle interaction is involved : divide the space into patches, Quadrats or Sample Units (SU), count the number of individuals in each patch or SU, and compute the VMR. VMRs significantly higher than 1 denote a clustered distribution, where random walk is not enough to smother the attractive inter-particle potential.\n- Coefficient of variation, σ / μ\n- Standardized moment, μk / σk\n- Fano factor, (windowed VMR)\n- Signal to noise ratio, μ / σ (in signal processing)\n- Cox, D.

Therefore, to ascertain the signal to noise ratio, one must find the quantifiable difference between the desired signal strength and the unwanted noise by subtracting the noise value from the signal strength value.\nHow do you calculate noise signal SNR?\nSNR Calculation – Simple If your signal and noise measurements are already in dB form, simply subtract the noise figure from the main signal: S – N. Because when you subtract logarithms, it is the same as dividing normal numbers. The difference of the numbers is the SNR.\nWhat is NMR noise?\nNoise in the signal also reduces the sensitivity of the measuring instrument. From the point of view of results, there is no significant difference between noise and interference. The results served to test the quality of the hardware used for NMR experiments.\nWhat is acquisition time NMR?\nDefinition. Within all methods that work via the detection of a signal, the time necessary to record the signal is called acquisition time. In the context of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, the acquisition time is the time interval during which the free induction decay (FID) is recorded.\nHow is noise figure calculated?\nNoise figure formula & calculation Alternatively if the signal to noise ratios are expressed in decibels then it is quite easy to calculate the noise figure simply by subtracting one from another because two numbers are divided by subtracting their logarithms.\nWhat is signal-to-noise ratio in radiography?\nSignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a generic term which, in radiology, is a measure of true signal (i.e. reflecting actual anatomy) to noise (e.g. random quantum mottle). A lower signal-to-noise ratio generally results in a grainy appearance to images.\nHow do you calculate signal to noise ratio chromatography?\nNext, measure the signal, S, from the middle of the baseline noise vertically to the top of the peak of interest. My measurements are N = 66 and S = 367 (arbitrary units). Most workers calculate S/N just as the ratio of the signal to the noise, so S/N = 367/66 = 5.56 in this example.\nHow do you calculate frequency in NMR?\nThe photon frequency required is given by f = gB, g = 2μz/h . For a proton, the constant g = 42.58 MHz/T. (Tesla (T) is the SI unit for the magnetic field.) In NMR and MRI, the quantity f is called the resonance frequency.\nWhat is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)?\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) provides a measure of the signal quality. The SNR compares the average power available in the signal to the average power contained in the noise, which includes any signal from sources other than the target signal source.\nHow can I improve signal-to-noise (S/N) in NMR spectroscopy?\nNMR spectroscopy, unfortunately, suffers from low S/N. Acquiring more scans is the most straightforward, if rather time-consuming means of improving S/N (S/N increases as the square root to the number of scans. i.e. S/N ~√nt). An alternative approach is to apply a weighting function to the FID to improve Signal-to-Noise.\nHow does a spectrometer detect noise?\nIn a spectrometer, the desired signal consists of the optical power at a given wavelength directed by the diffraction grating (and by the DMD, in a DLP-based system) to the detector. The noise signal arises from a number of sources, both electrical and optical.\nWhat is the frequency range of a typical NMR spectrum?\nFor 1H on a 500 MHz spectrum, this equates to ~5000 Hz. A typical 90°pulse is around 10 µs, which gives a RF field of 25000 Hz. This easily covers the chemical shift range seen in typical NMR experiments (~10 ppm for 1H and ~250 ppm for 13C)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f9872ad9-98a2-47e4-b95a-51e6445fca76>","<urn:uuid:40340dde-95dc-4993-bb6d-a295dc673b49>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Hi! I'm interested in the early sound film era - how did The Blue Angel and Ninotchka handle language and performance challenges differently?","answer":"The Blue Angel (1930) and Ninotchka (1939) handled language and performance challenges in distinct ways during the early sound era. The Blue Angel was shot simultaneously in German and English versions, requiring actors to perform their scenes twice in different languages due to dubbing limitations of the time. In contrast, by 1939 when Ninotchka was made, such dual-language filming wasn't necessary. However, Ninotchka faced its own performance challenges - notably in the famous laughing scene, where Garbo's inhibitions and discomfort with performing in front of extras led to her laughter being dubbed by another actor.","context":["Old Hollywood Films Tumblr page recently reached a milestone of 20,000 followers. The good folks over there love GIFs, so I thought I would celebrate by creating a GIF/article series featuring some of old Hollywood's most memorable moments. First up is an iconic moment in the 1939 film Ninotchka starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas (pictured above, holding a map of Paris).\nThe film: Ninotchka (1939)\nThe studio: MGM\nThe genre: Romantic comedy\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\nThe stars: Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas\n|A lovely publicity still of Greta Garbo in one of her Adrian-designed costumes for Ninotchka (1939).|\nThe moment: Leon and Ninotchka meet for lunch where he tries to make her laugh by telling silly stories (clip below).\nThe Backstory: Garbo was one of MGM's brightest stars throughout the 1930s, but audiences changing tastes -- the melodramas and costume pictures that were Garbo's bread-and-butter were no longer popular -- and Garbo's own boredom with Hollywood, meant that the studio badly needed to find a new way to present the Swedish star to the public.\nEnter director Ernst Lubitsch. His signature Lubitsch touch, a sophisticated style of film-making that combined witty comedy with scintillating romance, had already revived the flagging career of Marlene Dietrich, and studio chief Louis B. Mayer hoped he could work the same magic with Garbo.\nHow the moment happened: Garbo had successfully played comedic roles in Sweden, but she was also an exceptionally reserved person; the famous \"I want to be left alone\" business wasn't merely the concoction of MGM's publicity department. In fact, the demands required by the script proved almost too much for her too handle, although Lubitsch did all he could to charm and cajole a performance out of Garbo.\nIn an interview quoted in John Bainbridge's Garbo biography, Lubitsch remembered Garbo as possessing no acting techniques; instead she had to \"feel\" a scene to play it successfully. \"She is probably the most inhibited person I ever worked with. When you finally break through the inhibitions and she really feels a scene, she's wonderful.\"\nGarbo liked to work on a closed set with only a few trusted associates. The laughing scene required the presence of several extras, which made the actress extremely anxious. She eventually came around and performed the scene beautifully, although she couldn't bring herself to laugh out loud during the scene so her guffaws were dubbed by another actor.\nWhy the moment matters: In films like Anna Christie (1930) and Camille (1936) Garbo proved herself as one of the screen's great tragedians, but the laughing scene in Ninotchka shows there was more to the Divine Swede then endless suffering. Garbo's ace comic timing is in evidence throughout the scene, especially when she keeps slurping her soup and uttering a casual \"nope\" while Leon tells her silly stories.\nThe aftermath: MGM's publicity department had a field day with the tagline \"Garbo laughs\" and the film was a substantial box-office and critical hit with many reviewers comparing Ninotchka's deadpan stare to Buster Keaton. Garbo earned her final best actress Academy Award nomination although she lost to Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind (1939).Garbo made one more film, the 1941 romantic comedy Two-Faced Woman (tagline: \"Go Gay with Garbo\") before retiring from films at age 36.\nHow you can watch it: TCM is airing Ninotchka at 10 pm ET April 5, 2019. Warner Archive recently re-released Ninotchka on DVD and the film is available on video on demand.\nIf you enjoyed Ninotchka, try: Composer Cole Porter's re-imagining of Ninotchka, Silk Stockings (1957). Starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, this is one of the last of the great old Hollywood musicals. For more of the lighter side of Garbo, try the pre-code drama Queen Christina (1933) in which Garbo does indeed laugh. Another great Douglas rom-com is the screwball Theodora Goes Wild in which he romances a dazzling Irene Dunne. Also, Marlene Dietrich and Douglas both sparkle in the Lubitsch-directed romance Angel (1937).","The Blue Angel\nBlue Angel director Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969) was born under the name of Jonas Sternberg to an impoverished Orthodox Jewish family in Vienna. When his father moved to the United States for several years, the rest of the family later joined him for three years before returning to Vienna. Sternberg moved permanently to the U.S. when he was fourteen, acquired a spotty education (much of it self-taught) and worked at various odd jobs before getting his start in the film industry. By the time of The Blue Angel (1930), he had established himself as one of Paramount's most talented, if not always bankable, directors with films such as the popular gangster movie Underworld (1927), The Docks of New York (1928) and The Last Command (1928). The latter earned Emil Jannings an Academy Award for Best Actor. Erich Pommer of UFA then invited Sternberg to Berlin to make a sound film about Rasputin. \"This failed to interest me,\" Sternberg wrote in his memoirs, Fun in a Chinese Laundry, \"as I had no intention of treading on anyone's historical toes, nor did I wish to film a story which permitted no speculation about its outcome.\" Instead, he proposed an adaptation of the book Professor Unrath by Heinrich Mann. The original 1905 novel was a trenchant critique of German middle-class hypocrisy; in the process of adapting the film for the screen, the entire second half of the book (in which Professer Rath takes his revenge on society) was jettisoned and a new tragic ending was created.\nAlthough Emil Jannings was nominally the lead, Sternberg's real interests lay in the role of the callous seductress Lola-Lola. Sternberg wrote, \"Without the electricity of a new and exciting female, the film would have been no more than an essay reflecting on the stupidity of a school tyrant.\" Various candidates for the role included Heinrich Mann's friend Trude Hesterberg, Brigitte Helm, singer Lucie Mannheim, and Kathe Haack. The latter was already signed up for the role when Sternberg met Marlene Dietrich through Karl Vollmoeller; out of this began one of the most remarkable - and emotionally complex - collaborations between actress and director in the annals of Hollywood.\nBecause of Dietrich's limited vocal range, composer Friedrich Hollander wrote songs specifically to accommodate her voice; Dietrich's unique, much-parodied performance style became the basis of a second career as a concert singer, which lasted long after she retired from the screen. Hollander's songs, especially \"Ich Bin Von Kopf Bis Fuss Auf Liebe Eingestellt\" (\"Falling in Love Again\"), became standards in their own right. Inspired partly by the erotic drawings of Belgian artist Felicien Rops, Sternberg decked out his heroine in silk stockings, high-heeled shoes and a top hat. The combination of actress, costume, music and Sternberg's legendary lighting skills created an icon which resonates even today. Jannings, who still imagined himself star of the film, became jealous of the intimate relationship between Sternberg and Dietrich and the cinematic attention lavished upon her, throwing tantrums on the set and at one point threatening to strangle the leading lady. Although Jannings continued to act in films through the Nazi era (which brought him shame after World War II), The Blue Angel marks his last great moment as an actor; surely his jealousy arose in part because he knew he was being eclipsed.\nOn March 31, 1930, the night of the film's triumphant premiere in Berlin, Sternberg and Dietrich sailed to New York together to pursue a career in Hollywood. Sternberg's wife, Riza Royce von Sternberg, who had sensed his growing affections for his star, had returned to America earlier. She met Sternberg and Dietrich at the dock with her lawyer, serving Dietrich with papers for a lawsuit alleging libel and \"alienation of affection.\" A few months later Sternberg and his wife divorced.\nOne of the first sound films of UFA (Universum Film Aktien Gesellschaft, or Universe Film Company Limited), The Blue Angel was also one of its last great productions. Established partly with state money in 1917, UFA rapidly became one of the leading studios in the world with films such as Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari (1919); Ernst Lubitsch's Madame Dubarry (1919); F. W. Murnau's The Last Laugh (1924); and the profligate, visionary Metropolis (1927), which nearly bankrupted the studio and resulted in the right-wing financier Alfred Hugenberg gaining a controlling share. Many of UFA's greatest talents - among them Fritz Lang, Murnau, Lubitsch, the cinematographer Karl Freund - eventually left for Hollywood. After World War II, the defunct UFA's massive soundstages at Neubabelsberg wound up on East German territory; they were used to establish DEFA, the East German studio.\nThe Blue Angel was shot simultaneously in German and English language versions, making it necessary for the actors to read their lines in two different languages. During the early sound era such practices were not uncommon, since existing sound technology made dubbing difficult and studios wanted to create films that could sell to an international market. Another notable example is Tod Browning's Dracula (1931), for which an altogether different cast and director was used to film the Spanish-language version, shot at night on the same sets as the better-known English-language version. The English-language version of The Blue Angel is still exhibited occasionally, though for obvious reasons the German-language version is generally preferred.\nOver the years The Blue Angel has been shown in various public-domain prints, many of which have been cut. The version shown on TCM this month is the full-length German-language version, distributed by Kino International and licensed from the Murnau Foundation in Germany. A new print was struck from the best surviving materials and a new translation of the dialogue was commissioned. During the film's recent theatrical re-release the results were described by Michael Atkinson of the Village Voice as \"the best print anyone has seen in 70 years.\"\nProducer: Erich Pommer\nDirector: Josef von Sternberg\nScreenplay: Carl Zuckmayer, Karl Vollmoeller and Robert Liebmann; based on the novel Professor Unrath by Heinrich Mann\nCinematographer: Gunther Rittau and Hans Schneeberger\nEditor: Sam Winston\nMusic: Friedrich Hollander; lyrics by Robert Liebmann\nSet Design: Otto Hunte, Emil Hasler\nPrincipal Cast: Emil Jannings (Immanuel Rath), Marlene Dietrich (Lola Frolich), Rosa Valetti (Guste), Hans Albers (Mazeppa), Kurt Gerron (Kiepert), Karl Huszar-Puffy (Proprietor), Reinhold Bernt (Clown), Roland Varno (Lohmann).\nIn German with English subtitles\nby James Steffen"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ce1e19a1-8da5-4a0b-9fa0-e39487e7455b>","<urn:uuid:14c6b1d4-8ed2-45f7-908f-b951b78565bf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How have recent global earthquakes and scientific research influenced the assessment of the Cascadia Subduction Zone's risk potential, and what specific magnitude changes were determined?","answer":"Recent global earthquakes, particularly the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake in 2011 and the 8.2-magnitude quake off Chile's coast in 2014, along with evidence from deep-sea cores showing earthquake-generated mudflows, have led to increased risk assessments for the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Scientists now believe southern Cascadia could experience an earthquake as powerful as magnitude 9.3, which is higher than previous estimates. This revised assessment was specifically influenced by data gathered from these recent subduction zone earthquakes, as they occurred in zones similar to the Pacific Northwest zone.","context":["Earthquake risk assessments can seem pretty abstract at first glance, with their “percent probabilities” and “peak ground accelerations.” But the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS’s) national hazard maps, updated periodically, pack a powerful punch: Insurance companies and city planners rely heavily on the maps, which influence billions of dollars in construction every year. Today, USGS scientists released the most recent earthquake hazard assessments for the country. Although the picture hasn’t changed much on a national scale since the last report in 2008, the devil is in the details, the report’s authors say—and some areas in the country are now considered to be at higher risk for powerful quakes than once thought.\nThe best-known earthquake zones—California, the Pacific Northwest, and the Intermountain West—still dominate the hazard picture. Farther east, hot spots around the New Madrid Seismic Zone in the center of the country and Charleston, South Carolina, reflect the memory of powerful historical quakes (in 1811 to 1812 and 1886, respectively). But, in fact, all 50 states have the potential for earthquakes, and damaging ground shaking could happen in 42 of the 50 states within 50 years, the new report suggests. Of those, 16 states, all of which have had earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in historical times, are considered highly likely to experience damaging ground shaking.\nTo assess the risk of where and how often future earthquakes will occur, and how hard the ground will shake, scientists are constantly seeking new data from these regions and using them to develop new ways of modeling ground motion, says Mark Petersen, a seismologist at USGS in Golden, Colorado, and the lead author of the new report. Among the latest temblors incorporated into the assessment is the 2011 5.8-magnitude Virginia earthquake, which “helped us understand better ground shaking in the central and eastern United States,” Petersen says. New data also came from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which in 2010 published its own risk assessment for earthquake damage to its power plants in the central and eastern United States. These all suggest the region has the potential to experience an even more powerful quake.\nModern earthquake risk in the New Madrid Seismic Zone—which experienced three powerful quakes 200 years ago but nothing on that order since—remains a bone of contention. Some seismologists—most notably Seth Stein of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois—contend that ongoing quakes in the region are aftershocks of the three big ones, not signs of new seismic activity, and that USGS is overestimating the risk there. However, others dispute this; a paper published in Science earlier this year suggested that the region is still very much alive. All of this makes for a headache for those trying to sort out appropriate building codes and engineering designs; to try to bring some harmony to the dispute, the latest hazard assessment incorporated a model that followed some of Stein’s ideas, including using GPS to detect tectonic strain in the region, as well as the data from NRC. The result—though unlikely to settle the debate anytime soon—was “a broader range of [earthquake] magnitudes and recurrence rates for New Madrid than we had before,” Petersen says.\nIn California, the 2014 assessment has been significantly adjusted, thanks in large part to the brand-new Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast model, which allows scientists to come up with rupture scenarios that are “plausible” for the state’s complex network of faults, Petersen says. That changed the hazards on a highly local basis, but also extended the potential for damage farther across the state.\nSome of the biggest change in earthquake risk is in the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which extends from British Columbia down to northern California. The powerful shaking from several recent subduction zone earthquakes around the world—notably the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake in 2011 and the 8.2-magnitude quake off the coast of Chile in 2014—and geologic evidence from deep-sea cores of powerful quakes in the past now suggest that southern Cascadia could experience an earthquake as powerful as magnitude 9.3.\nOne thing the new report doesn’t include is hazard due to induced seismicity—earthquakes related to human activities, such as reintroducing wastewater into injection wells. That’s a layer that USGS plans to include, Petersen says—but right now, it’s not quite clear how to do it. “We basically want to treat them separately from the other earthquakes,” he adds, because mapping the hazards from human activities requires “a different logic tree.” USGS is now planning regional workshops to discuss how to incorporate the hazard into its next generation of maps.\nThere is indeed a growing sense of urgency to the question. “I think it’s incredibly striking what’s happened the last few years with the increase of seismicity in the eastern and central U.S.,” says Emily Brodsky, a seismologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It really changes the story and the hazard implications. We’re dealing with places that historically have not thought a lot about earthquakes.”\nIt’s still an open question whether human-induced earthquakes will actually rupture in similar ways to natural quakes, Brodsky adds. “That is the question we really need to assess—whether or not anything is different physically, or whether they’ll interact, have connected ruptures.” And that’s one of the big general innovations in the new report, she adds—incorporating the way ruptures will actually connect and interact with one another, potentially creating a much larger and more catastrophic event than would occur from an individual rupture. Modeling rupture connectivity doesn’t just apply to California’s complicated network of faults—it can also have implications for the hazard assessed from induced quakes, she says.","To help make the best decisions to protect communities from earthquakes, new USGS maps display how intense ground shaking could be across the nation.\nThe USGS recently updated their U.S. National Seismic Hazard Maps, which reflect the best and most current understanding of where future earthquakes will occur, how often they will occur, and how hard the ground will likely shake as a result.\n42 States at Risk; 16 States at High Risk\nWhile all states have some potential for earthquakes, 42 of the 50 states have a reasonable chance of experiencing damaging ground shaking from an earthquake in 50 years (the typical lifetime of a building). Scientists also conclude that 16 states have a relatively high likelihood of experiencing damaging ground shaking. These states have historically experienced earthquakes with a magnitude 6 or greater.\nThe hazard is especially high along the west coast, intermountain west, and in several active regions of the central and eastern U.S., such as near New Madrid, MO, and near Charleston, SC. The 16 states at highest risk are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\nWhile these overarching conclusions of the national-level hazard are similar to those of the previous maps released in 2008, details and estimates differ for many cities and states. Several areas have been identified as being capable of having the potential for larger and more powerful earthquakes than previously thought due to more data and updated earthquake models. The most prominent changes are discussed below.\nInformed Decisions Based on the Maps\nWith an understanding of potential ground shaking levels, various risk analyses can be calculated by considering factors like population levels, building exposure, and building construction practices. This is used for establishing building codes, and in the analysis of seismic risk for key structures. This can also help in determining insurance rates, emergency preparedness plans, and private property decisions such as re-evaluating one’s home and making it more resilient.\nThese maps are part of USGS contributions to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which is a congressionally-established partnership of four federal agencies with the purpose of reducing risks to life and property in the U.S. that result from earthquakes. The contributing agencies are the USGS, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Institute of Standards and Technology, and National Science Foundation (NSF). As an example of the collaboration, the hazards identified in the USGS maps underlie FEMA-sponsored seismic design provisions that are incorporated into building codes adopted by states and localities. The maps also reflect investments in research by academic and other scientists supported by grants from the USGS and the NSF.\n“The standards for seismic safety in building codes are directly based upon USGS assessments of potential ground shaking from earthquakes, and have been for years,” said Jim Harris, a member and former chair of the Provisions Update Committee of the Building Seismic Safety Council.\n“The committees preparing those standards welcome this updated USGS information as a basis for making decisions and continuing to ensure the most stable and secure construction.”\nThe eastern U.S. has the potential for larger and more damaging earthquakes than considered in previous maps and assessments. As one example, scientists learned a lot following the magnitude 5.8 earthquake that struck Virginia in 2011. It was among the largest earthquakes to occur along the east coast in the last century, and helped determine that even larger events are possible. Estimates of earthquake hazards near Charleston, SC, have also gone up due to the assessment of earthquakes in the state.\nIn New York City, the maps indicate a slightly lower hazard for tall buildings than previously thought (but still a hazard nonetheless). Scientists estimated a lower likelihood for slow shaking from an earthquake near the city. Slow shaking is likely to cause more damage to tall structures in contrast, compared to fast shaking which is more likely to impact shorter structures.\nThe New Madrid Seismic Zone has been identified to have a larger range of potential earthquake magnitudes and locations than previously identified. This is a result of a range of new research, part of which was recently compiled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nIn California, earthquake hazard extends over a wider area than previously thought. Most notably, faults were recently discovered, raising earthquake hazard estimates for San Jose, Vallejo and San Diego. On the other hand, new insights on faults and rupture processes reduced earthquake hazard estimates for Irvine, Santa Barbara and Oakland. Hazard increased in some parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles region and decreased in other parts. These updates were from the new Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast Model, which incorporates many more potential fault ruptures than did previous assessments. Recent earthquakes in Alaska, Mexico and New Zealand taught scientists more about complex ruptures and how faults can link together. This insight was applied to California for which approximately 250,000 potential complex ruptures were modeled.\nNew research on the Cascadia Subduction Zone resulted in increased estimates of earthquake magnitude up to magnitude 9.3. Deep-sea cores were collected that show evidence within the sea-floor sediments of large earthquake-generated mudflows. Earthquake shaking estimates were also increased following abundant data gathered from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake in Tohoku, Japan in 2011 and the magnitude 8.2 earthquake offshore of Chile in 2014, as those events ruptured along subduction zones similar to the Pacific Northwest zone.\nIn Washington, scientists incorporated new knowledge of the Tacoma Fault into the maps and identified changes to the geometry of the Whidbey Island fault in the northern Puget Sound. Earthquake hazard also increased for Las Vegas because of new science. In Utah, scientists dug trenches to study prehistoric earthquakes along the Wasatch Fault. While the overall seismic hazard didn’t change significantly, detailed changes were made to the fault models in this region and robust data were acquired to hone the assessments. This is valuable since approximately 75% of Utah’s population, including the residents of Salt Lake City, lives near this fault.\nThe magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Wenchuan, China in 2008 provided many new records of shaking that are very similar to anticipated future earthquakes in the western U.S., as the fault structures are similar. Previously, scientists did not have nearly as many shaking records from earthquakes of this size.\nInduced Earthquakes … Research Underway\nSome states have experienced increased seismicity in the past few years that may be associated with human activities such as the disposal of wastewater in deep wells.\nOne specific focus for the future is including an additional layer to these earthquake hazard maps to account for recent potentially triggered earthquakes that occur near some wastewater disposal wells. Injection-induced earthquakes are challenging to incorporate into hazard models because they may not behave like natural earthquakes and their rates change based on man-made activities.\nYou Can’t Plan If …\n“USGS earthquake science is vital because you can’t plan for earthquakes if you don’t know what you are planning for,” said Mark Petersen, Chief of the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project. “Our nation’s population and exposure to large earthquakes has grown tremendously in recent years. The cost of inaction in planning for future earthquakes and other natural disasters can be very high, as demonstrated by several recent damaging events across the globe. It is important to understand the threat you face from earthquakes at home and the hazards for the places you might visit. The USGS is dedicated to applying the best available science in developing reliable products useful for reducing the earthquake risk across the U.S.”\nStart with USGS Science\nThe USGS is the only federal agency with responsibility for recording and reporting earthquake activity nationwide and providing a seismic hazard assessment. The USGS regularly updates the national seismic hazard models and maps, typically every 6 years, in sync with the building code updates. The 2014 update focuses on the conterminous U.S. Maps are also available for Alaska (last updated in 2007); Hawaii (1998); Puerto Rico (2003); Guam and Marianna Islands (2012); and American Samoa (2012).\nView the maps online at: here\nReceive news and updates:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0aa0ae56-e232-4796-aab3-9851e2799a01>","<urn:uuid:edd5a3f1-f4bc-47d6-b47c-0fa91b01f141>"],"error":null}

For more data about universal travel as a LPR, and returning occupant outsider visas, visit our Returning Resident page.\nThe First Step toward an Immigrant Visa: Filing a Petition\nAs the initial step, a supporting relative must document a Petition for Alien Relative, Form I-130 with the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\nIn specific conditions, a U.S. resident living abroad can record a settler visa appeal to outside the United States. Survey Filing Immigrant Petitions Outside the United States to find out additional.\nU.S. Support Minimum Age Requirement\nU.S. residents must be age 21 or more seasoned to document petitions for kin or guardians. There is no base age for a support to record petitions for every other classification of family based foreigner visas. Notwithstanding, a U.S. native or legal changeless inhabitant (LPR) must be something like 18 years old and have a living arrangement (residence) in the United States previously the individual in question can sign an Affidavit of Support, Form I-864 or I-864-EZ. This shape is required for a worker visa for a companion and different relatives of U.S. supports.\nIs Residence in the U.S. Required for the U.S. Support?\nIndeed. As a U.S. support/candidate, you should keep up your essential living arrangement (additionally called home) in the United States, which is the place you intend to live for a long time to come. Living in the U.S. is required for a U.S. support to document the Affidavit of Support, with couple of exemptions. To find out additional, survey the Affidavit of Support (I-864 or I-864EZ) Instructions.\nOn the off chance that You Were a LPR and Are Now a U.S. Resident\nOn the off chance that you recorded a request of for your life partner or potentially youngsters when you were a legal perpetual occupant (LPR) and you are currently a U.S. national, the sort of foreigner visa that your relatives can get will change. Snap here for directions on the best way to submit verification of naturalization to the National Visa Center (NVC).\nImpact on life partners and minor youngsters: If you documented an appeal to for your companion or minor kids (under age 21 and unmarried) while you were a LPR, the visa class was family second inclination (F2A). When you turn into a U.S. resident, NVC will update the request of to a close relative (IR) visa class. This advantages your moving family member(s) on the grounds that there are no restrictions on the quantity of visas that can be issued every year in the IR classes.\nEssential: If the family second inclination (F2A) appeal to that you petitioned for your mate incorporated your minor kids, since you are a U.S. native you should document new and separate petitions for every tyke. This is on the grounds that kids can't be incorporated as \"subordinate candidates\" on a parent's close relative (IR) visa or appeal. (This is not the same as the family second inclination (F2A) request, which enables minor youngsters to be incorporated into their parent's F2A appeal.)\nKids brought into the world abroad after you turned into a U.S. native may meet all requirements for U.S. citizenship. They ought to apply for U.S. visas. The consular officer will decide if your youngster is a U.S. native and can have an international ID. On the off chance that the consular officer decides your kid isn't a U.S. national, the tyke must apply for a migrant visa on the off chance that he/she needs to live in the United States.\nImpact on grown-up kids: If you recorded an appeal to for your unmarried grown-up youngsters (age 21 or more established) when you were a LPR, NVC will change the visa class from family second inclination (F2B) to family first inclination (F1). Be that as it may, under a government law called the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), visa candidates can \"quit\" of transformation to the F1 visa class and stay as a F2B visa candidate. This might be helpful in light of the fact that occasionally the hanging tight time for a F2B visa is shorter than the sitting tight time for a F1 visa. When you naturalize and turn into a U.S. native, you should check the Visa Bulletin to check whether it would be useful for your grown-up unmarried youngster to stay in the F2B classification. (Candidates keep the need date of their F2B appeal to regardless of whether it changes over to the F1 visa classification.) Applicants who need to quit the F1 class must present a demand utilizing these rules:\nCandidates whose case is at NVC ought to submit demands utilizing NVC's online request frame. NVC will forward the demand to USCIS and change the visa classification back to endless supply of USCIS's endorsement.\nCandidates whose case is at a U.S. Government office or Consulate abroad ought to request that the international safe haven present a demand for their sake. The consular officer will forward the demand and arbitrate the visa application in the F2B class endless supply of USCIS's endorsement.\nSubsequent stages - Fees, Affidavit of Support, and Visa Application\nAfter USCIS favors the appeal, it is sent to the National Visa Center (NVC). When gotten, the NVC will allocate a case number for the appeal. For family inclination worker visa cases, when a candidate's need date meets the latest passing date, the NVC will educate the candidate to finish Form DS-261, Choice of Address and Agent. (NOTE: If you as of now have a lawyer, the NVC won't teach you to finish Form DS-261.) The NVC will start pre-preparing the candidate's case by furnishing the candidate and applicant with guidelines to present the proper charges. After the suitable expenses are paid, the NVC will ask for that the candidate present the essential migrant visa reports, including the Affidavit of Support, application shapes, common archives, and the sky is the limit from there. Become familiar with National Visa Center visa case preparing.\nCan My Family Members additionally Receive Immigrant Visas?\nIn light of your affirmed appeal, your companion and minor unmarried kids, more youthful than 21, may apply for worker visas with you. Like you, they should likewise round out required application shapes, get required common archives, pay the required charges, and experience therapeutic examinations. Same-sex life partners of U.S. nationals and Lawful Permanent Residents(LPRs), alongside their minor youngsters, are presently qualified for a similar movement benefits as inverse sex life partners. Consular officers at U.S. International safe havens and Consulates will mediate their foreigner visa endless supply of an affirmed I-130 or I-140 request of from USCIS. For additional data, it would be ideal if you see our FAQ's.\nAll classifications of family inclination migrant visas are issued in the sequential request in which the petitions were recorded until as far as possible for the class is come to.

{"question":"What are the traditional genetic engineering tools used for gene therapy, and how does CRISPR-Cas9 compare to them in terms of cost and accessibility?","answer":"Traditional gene therapy involves delivering functional genes into cells to treat diseases, as demonstrated in the 1990 treatment of a 4-year-old girl with adenosine deaminase deficiency. Before CRISPR, tools like zinc finger nucleases were used for genome editing, but these were difficult to engineer and cost around $5,000 USD. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers much greater flexibility in targeting specific DNA sections while being significantly more cost-effective at approximately $30 USD, making it a more accessible tool for genetic modification and potential therapeutic applications.","context":["CBSE Class 12 Biology\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\nBiotechnology deals with industrial scale production of biopharmaceuticals and biological using genetically modified microbes, fungi, plants and animals. It application includes therapeutics, diagnostics, genetically modified crops for agriculture, processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment and energy production. The main three critical research areas of biotechnology includes -\nProviding the best catalyst in the form of improved organism usually a microbes or pure enzyme.\nCreating optimal conditions through engineering for a catalyst to act.\nDownstream processing technologies to purify the protein or organic compounds. Biotechnological Applications in Agriculture- food production can be increased by\nAgro-chemical based agriculture\nGenetically engineered crop-based agriculture.\nGreen revolution successfully increased the food production many folds by using better management practices and use of agrochemicals, fertilizers and pesticides. Further increase in production is not possible by using these methods. To overcome this genetically modified crop is used.\nPlants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). GM plants have many applications-\nMade crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses\nReduced reliance on chemical pesticides\nHelped to reduce post harvest losses\nIncreased efficiency of mineral usage by plants\nEnhanced nutritional value of food, eg., Vitamin ‘A’ enriched rice.\nApplication of Biotechnology in production of pest resistant plants-\nPest resistant plants decrease the amount of pesticides used. Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis.Bt toxin gene has been cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide resistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a bio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean etc\nBt cotton- Bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill certain insects like lepidopterens, colepterans (beetels) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes).\nB. thuringiensisproduce crystals that contain a toxic insecticidal protein. This toxic protein present in bacterium as inactive protoxins but as soon as insect ingest the inactive form due to alkaline pH of gut, it converted into an active form of toxin and bind to surface of midgut epithelial cells and create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually death of insect.\nThe gene from B. thuringiensishas been incorporated into several crop plants like cotton, maize, rice etc. The toxin is coded by a gene named cry. The protein coded by the genes crylAb and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms, crylAb controls\nPest Resistant Plants\nNematodes like Meloidegyne incognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes reduction in yield. The infestation of these nematodes can be prevented by the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is present in all eukaryotic organisms as cellular defence by silencing of specific mRNA due to complementary dsRNA molecules that bind to and prevents translation of the mRNA.\nThe source of complementary dsRNA may be from an infection by viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements that replicate through RNA intermediate.\nNematode specific genes were introduced into host plant using Agrobacterium vectors. The parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.\nBiotechnological Applications in Medicine\nThe rDNA technological processes have made immense impact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more effective therapeutic drugs. At present, about 30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human use the world over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed.\nGenetically Engineered Insulin\nAdult -onset diabetes can be controlled by taking insulin at regular intervals. The main source of this insulin was isolation of insulin from animals. Now a day’s insulin can be obtained from bacterium using techniques of biotechnology.\nInsulin was earlier extracted from pancreas of slaughtered cattle and pigs but insulin from these sources develops allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign protein.\nInsulin consists of two short polypeptide chains- chain A and chain B, that are linked together by disulphide bridges.\nIn humans, insulin is synthesised as a prohormone, which contains an extra stretch called C peptide, which is absent in mature insulin. The main challenge for production of insulin using rDNA technique was getting insulin assembled into a mature form.\nAn American company, Eli Lilly in 1983 prepared two DNA sequence corresponding to A and B chain of human insulin and introduced them in plasmids of E.coli to produce insulin chain. Chain A and Chain B were produced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulphide bonds to form human insulin.\nIt is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect that has been diagnosed in a child or embryo. This method is applied in a person with a hereditary disease. In this method, genes are inserted into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease.\nThe correction of gene defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate for non-functional gene.\nThe first clinical gene therapy was done in 1990 to a 4 year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase that is essential for immune system to function. This defect can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection or bone marrow transplant.\nIn gene therapy method lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in culture medium outside the body. A functional ADA cDNA is then introduced into these lymphocystes and returned to the patient. In this method periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes is needed. If gene isolated from bone marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure.\nConventional method of diagnosis such as serum or urine analysis is not able to early detection of disease causing pathogens or virus. Following methods can be used to diagnosed earlier-\nRecombinant DNA technology\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nEnzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA).\n• Symptoms of disease appear only when the concentration of pathogen get increased significantly. Low concentration of bacteria and virus can be detected by\namplification of nucleic acid by PCR. It detects the mutation in the gene in cancer patient. PCR is routinely used to detect the HIV in suspected AIDS patients. Genetic disorder can be also detected by using PCR technique.\nA single stranded DNA or RNA having radioactive molecule is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the mutated gene will not appear on the photographic film.\nELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens like proteins, glycoproteins etc. or by detecting the antibodies synthesised against the pathogen.\nAnimals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express a foreign gene are known as transgenic animals. Transgenic mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced. Common reasons for development of transgenic animals-\nNormal physiology and development- they are designed to allow the study of gene regulation, their effect on normal function of body. By introducing genes from other species that alter the formation of this factor and studying eh biological affects that results.\nStudy of disease- a number of transgenic animals are designed to increase our understanding of how genes contribute to the development of disease. Transgenic model has been developed for disease like cancer, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease etc.\nBiological products- .Transgenic animals that produce useful biological products can be created by the introduction of the portion of DNA (gene) which codes for a particular product such as human protein (alpha - 1-antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. The first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced human protein-enriched milk (alpha-lactalbumin - 2.4 gm / litre).\nVaccine safety- transgenic mice are developed for used in testing the safety of vaccine before they are used on human. Polio vaccine was tested on transgenic mice and then on monkey.\nChemical safety testing- transgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals. It gives us the results in less time.\n• Ethical Issues:\nThe Indian Government has set up organizations such as GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of introducing GM-organisms for public services.\nA patent is the right granted by a government to an inventor to prevent others from making commercial use of his invention. Now, patents are granted for biological entities and for products derived from biological resources.\nIt is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organizations without proper authorization from the countries and people concerned without compensatory payment.\nIn 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Office. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new variety of Basmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had actually been derived from Indian farmer’s varieties. Indian Basmati was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty.\nSeveral attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines, e.g., turmeric and neem.","BY ANNELIESE MOLL\nFor the UAS Whalesong\nEarlier this semester, I wrote a brief article about GMOs. Within it, I mentioned that humans have been slowly modifying organisms for thousands of years. Since the discovery of DNA, the technology and methods used to understand and edit DNA have changed and improved. CRISPR, or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, are segments of prokaryotic DNA that have short repetitions of base sequences. Cas9 is an associated enzyme.\nIn December of 1987, CRISPR sequences were found, but not characterized, in E. coli. Eight years later these sequences are found in other microbes. Jump to 2007: a Danish food company called Danisco found that these sequences are part of a bacterial defense against viruses. In 2011 several biotech companies started to utilize this new technology, focusing on agriculture, therapeutics, and more research. The following year it is reported that scientists are able to use CRISPR to edit genomes. More energy is placed on researching therapeutics in several locations worldwide, and CRISPR has begun to be heavily used with mouse and human cells. During March of 2015 the first report of the CRISPR gene drive that is able to spread a modified gene rapidly. Earlier this year a group of researchers edited human embryos.\nCRISPR-Cas9 is not the first of its kind though. Another example of a technology that was able to made edits within a genome is called zinc finger nucleases. It consists of synthetic proteins made from engineered zinc finger DNA-binding domain fused to the cleavage domain of a specific restriction endonuclease, in other words it is an artificially engineered section of DNA that binds with an enzyme in a specific section where the natural DNA has been cut. This was supposedly going to be able to edit DNA accurately and efficiently. However, it ended up being difficult to engineer and very expensive. Zinc finger nucleases cost at least $5,000 USD whereas CRISPR-Cas9 is highly flexible while still able to target specific sections of DNA, which allows for it to be easily manipulated, and this technology costs about $30 USD. This is what makes CRISPR so amazing.\nWith more research and knowledge CRISPR could rapidly become a life saving technology because of its ability to precisely delete and insert genes into the genome of an organism. People with genetic diseases may finally be able to receive effective help through gene therapy. Gene therapy is when a person with a non-functional gene has a normal (functional) gene inserted into their cells. This is currently an experimental technique that still has many risks involved, but for some patients where medications or surgery is not an option this could be a powerful tool. However, while this technology has the ability to become another tool for treating disease many people worry that this could also be used to modify human embryos, and that those modifications are be passed down other generations. One of the large questions out there is about what would happen if and when these modified genes mutate.\nUltimately, this technology is going to require us to have some long and difficult conversations about the moral and ethical uses as well as having more research and understanding about the affects this could have on our world.\nBY ANNELIESE MOLL"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:56d10f9a-3738-442e-8e01-8cfad5f83b25>","<urn:uuid:52834c3c-69df-474b-a301-a27b06b5ba36>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do truffles play in both high-end cuisine and forest ecology, and how does their availability differ between restaurant settings and natural environments?","answer":"In high-end cuisine, truffles are considered one of the most expensive and luxurious ingredients, prized for their distinctive and intense aroma. They're used to create indulgent dishes like truffle rigatoni, where even a small amount (1 teaspoon of truffle oil) can provide rich, earthy, and nutty flavors. In forest ecology, truffles serve as a crucial food source for wildlife, particularly in Pacific Northwest forests. The standing crop of underground truffles provides a more consistent year-round food source for animals compared to above-ground mushrooms, which are more seasonal. While restaurants can access truffles year-round through various products like truffle oil, in natural environments their availability varies significantly by season and forest age. Natural-mature and old-growth forests maintain high truffle biomass throughout the year, while managed-young stands have much lower quantities, particularly in winter when animal consumption (0.64 kg/ha) can exceed the available standing crop (0.36 kg/ha).","context":["Truffle rigatoni is a rich and indulgent pasta dish featuring rigatoni noodles tossed in a creamy truffle-infused sauce made from scratch. It's easy to make in less than 30 minutes. Enjoy this decadent dish any night of the week.Jump to Recipe\nTruffle is a flavor unlike any other. It's rich, earthy, oaky, and nutty. A little bit of truffle goes a long way. You'll notice this recipe only calls for 1 teaspoon of truffle oil and that's because this oil can quickly overpower a dish. It's just enough to where all the ingredients work together cohesively.\nWhat is a Truffle?\nA truffle is a type of edible fungi that grows underground close to the roots of certain trees, particularly oak, beech, and hazelnut trees. Truffles are highly prized for their distinctive and intense aroma. They are a delicacy in many cuisines around the world.\nTruffle mushrooms come in various species and types, with the most sought-after being the black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) and the white truffle (Tuber magnatum). These truffle varieties are found in different regions and have slightly different flavors and aromas.\nTruffles are harvested by specially trained dogs or pigs. Their scent can lead to their location beneath the soil. Once unearthed, truffles are cleaned and carefully handled due to their delicate nature.\nTruffles are shaved or grated over dishes to infuse their unique aroma and taste. Truffle oil and truffle-infused products are also popular. Due to their rarity and labor-intensive harvesting process, truffles are considered one of the most expensive and luxurious ingredients in the culinary world.\nWhy You'll Love Truffle Rigatoni\nIndulgent Flavor: Truffle rigatoni has an indulgent and luxurious flavor profile due to the intense aroma and taste of truffles.

Above- and belowground fungal fruiting bodies (epigeous and hypogeous sporocarps) were sampled for 46 mo in managed-young, natural-mature, and old-growth western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) stands in Washington State. Screen exclosures were placed over the surface of half of the sample plots to prevent aboveground predation of sporocarps. Standing crop of epigeous sporocarps was low in most seasons and then increased 30-fold to a mean of 2.28 kg/ha in the fall. Epigeous biomass varied little between stand types, and animal consumption of these sporocarps was low. Standing crop of hypogeous sporocarps was 0.78 kg/ha in managed-young stands, compared to 4.51 and 4.02 kg/ha in natural-mature and old-growth stands. In all stands, standing crop peaked in the summer and was lowest in the winter. Mean animal consumption of hypogeous sporocarps was 0.64 kg/ha, a value that exceeded the available standing crop quantity of 0.36 kg/ha in managed-young stands during the winter. In natural-mature and old-growth stands, truffle biomass remained high year-round and exceeded consumption in all seasons. Low hypogeous sporocarp biomass in the managed-young stands resulted from the general absence of large clusters of Elaphomyces granulatus, which made up .90% of the biomass in older stands. This absence in managed-young stands may be associated with the thin organic layer that has developed following harvest and burning 60 yr ago. The consistent level of animal consumption indicates that truffles may be an important and readily available year-round food source, compared to the ephemeral fruiting of epigeous sporocarps. Changes in forest composition and age due to natural disturbance or human management influence fungal sporocarp productivity and diversity and, consequently, affect food availability for animals dependent on hypogeous sporocarps.\n- You may send email to firstname.lastname@example.org to request a hard copy of this publication.\n- (Please specify exactly which publication you are requesting and your mailing address.)\n- We recommend that you also print this page and attach it to the printout of the article, to retain the full citation information.\n- This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employees on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.\nCitationNorth, Malcolm; Trappe, James; Franklin, Jerry. 1997.

{"question":"What is the key difference between temperature requirements for making sorbets versus hard candies like lollipops?","answer":"While sorbets require careful temperature control to maintain proper sugar content (ideally 25-35%) to avoid freezing too hard or not freezing properly, hard candies like lollipops need to reach much higher temperatures - specifically the hard-crack stage at around 300 degrees F. Sorbets are made at freezing temperatures, while lollipops require heating the sugar syrup mixture to this high temperature and then letting it cool to about 275 degrees F before adding flavoring and coloring.","context":["How to make Sorbets\nSorbets are typically made of simple syrup (water and sugar) and suitable flavouring. As with other ice creams, air also needs to be incorporated in the base mixture to avoid rock-solid end results. Sorbets normally do not contain any dairy products, and without the fat these contain, the challenge is usually to keep down the size of the ice crystals. As with ordinary ice cream, large ice crystals will affect the texture negatively, away from the desired “smooth” and closer to the undesired “icy”. We will also take a quick look at sorbets made only with fruit purée and sugar (no simple sugar).\nThe main keys to success? Enough, but not too much, sugar, and fast freezing!\nThe overall sugar content and the basic sugar syrup\nSince sorbets can be made on many different things (sweet fruits, more sour fruits, wines of differing sweetness …), some serious makers would insist on matching the proportions (sugar/water-ratio) to the specific fruit (or other flavouring) to be used. For that reason, it is difficult to give one “universal” sorbet recipe: just the sugar in the sugar syrup will typically not be enough, and adjustments will depend on what kind of sorbet you are making: dates have a natural sugar content of about 65 %, limes one of about 3 % = why you ideally should find a way to measure the overall sugar content of your sorbet base, which in the end ideally should contain about 25-35 % overall sugar.\nSerious sorbet-making should therefore preferably use a special instrument to check the sugar content of the syrup. One such instrument is the refractometer, which measures the level of sweetness on a so-called Brix (°Bx) scale. Also used is the density measuring Baumé hydrometer, using the so-called Baumé scale. As per the above, a sorbet mixture (at least fruit-based ones) should keep about 17-18 °Baumé / 30-31 °Brix.\nWhy? If the sorbet mixture is too sweet, the level of sugar will prevent the sorbet from freezing properly. If the level of sugar is too low, however, the sorbet will freeze too hard, and the flavour is likely to taste “watered down”. Also with regard to the flavour, remember that the un-frozen base should taste somewhat sweeter than you would like, since the cold will dull the sensation of sweetness experienced in the final sorbet.\nA mix of equal parts of water and sugar will give you a basic simple syrup to start with.\nThat said, I have seen some who have suggested a 65 % sugar/35 % water simple sugar syrup, which – I suppose – probably is intended to bring the sugar content closer to the final overall one, since most fruit sorbets will require more than what the sugar syrup alone can provide. What matters in the end is, however, the overall sugar content of the sorbet.\nIf you would like to minimise experimentation but still want to be serious about sugar levels (but not serious, or rich, enough to buy special instruments to check it), I will pass on an old kitchen trick: the Egg test.\nAn alternative take on making sorbets: Sorbets made with fruit purée and no sugar syrup\nWhile this post focuses on “classic” sorbets made out of flavour and sugar syrup, there are other ways to make sorbet:\nIt is possible to make sorbets without any sugar syrup if the water content of the rest of the ingredients is high enough and sugar is added to the fruit purée: fruit sorbets are prime examples – go here for a delicious Strawberry sorbet made with this method!\nSorbets made this way – basically by mixing fruit purée and sugar – tend to melt quicker than “traditional” sorbet (since they contain less water), but often make up for this by offering fuller and rich(er) flavour experience. Just keep in mind that you still need to add sugar in case you want to have a sorbet, rather than just a chunk of frozen fruit purée.\nThe Egg test – estimate sugar levels without using special instruments\nThis test only requires a fresh egg. On the web, I have seen it well explained by Jenni Field. Basically, you drop the fresh egg (wash it first!) into the mixture. Watch carefully how much of the egg is showing up above the surface once it has resurfaced. If the egg remains submerged, or if less than about 2 1/2 cm is showing above the surface, add more sugar. Likewise, if more than 2 1/2 cm is showing up, add more juice, fruit puree or water to the mixture.\nWhen the “ideal” 2 1/2 cm elevation is achieved, this translates into the likewise ideal 17-18 °Baumé!\n(Why use fresh eggs? When eggs become older, they begin to contain more and more air. Eventually, an old egg would begin to float almost regardless of sugar content, which would render the Egg test rather worthless)\nHow to actually create the simple sugar syrup\nThere are basically two ways of preparing simple sugar syrup.\nCooking the water and sugar together seems to be the traditional, generally suggested option in most ice cream literature I have come across. Simmering the water and sugar for about five minutes is usually enough to create the viscous blend you want (see below for a chemical explanation of why sugar syrup is something more than just an uncomplicated mixture of water and sugar …).\nHowever, there is also the much speedier way (let us call it the Hurried bartender’s method) which also tend to work quite well, and which does not require any cooling down: Simply mix water and sugar together without any heating. Whisk/stir/shake until all the sugar has dissolved. Voilà – ready to use! Obviously, if you do not find this solution ‘syrupy’ enough, do simmer the mixture!\nExtra reading – Sugar syrup chemistry\nWhat happens when sugar mixes with water? Chemically speaking, the sucrose (a disaccharide) splits into the simple sugars glucose and fructose (monosaccharides). At the same time, strong hydrogen bonds are created between the water and the sugar molecules. This is actually very good for sorbets, as the increased amount of sugar molecules not only increases the syrup’s capacity to bind water (obviously super-important for avoiding unwanted iciness and improving texture), lowers the freezing point (increases scoopability) and increases the shelf life. The general sweetness is also increased with about a third (and then in a somewhat “fresher” way, since most of the ‘new’ sweetness comes from the fructose). This process is greatly speeded up by heating, which is probably why boiling sugar syrup has come to be the traditionally preferred method.\nA syrup, once made, can be stored in a bottle or closed jar in the refrigerator for about 2-3 weeks. When the syrup starts to become cloudy, it is about to begin to mold and should be discarded.\nBase recipe – Sorbet\n- Prepare a simple sugar syrup with equal parts water and sugar, like 500 ml (2 cups) water and 500 ml (2 cups) sugar. Since the sugar will dissolve, this should net you about 800 ml (about 3.4 cups) of simple sugar syrup.\n- [If you would like to try the “sugar-elevated” 65/35 simple syrup instead, mix 525 ml (2,2 cups) sugar and 275 ml (1.16 cup) water.]\n- If you cook the syrup (about 5 minutes of simmering, or less, should do), let it cool down before proceeding further.\n- Mix the cooled down syrup with an equal volume of berries- or fruit purée/fruit juice + the specific additional sugar to match these and reach the desired overall sugar content for sorbets.\n- In order to avoid an otherwise overly sweet sorbet, consider adding the juice of 1 lemon to the base.\n- Freeze according to the instructions of your ice cream machine. If you do not have an ice cream machine, still-freeze in your freezer (go here for more exact instructions).\n- Before freezing the mixture, possibly add just a little alcohol (or some inverted sugar, such as corn syrup, agave nectar, glucose syrup or honey), in order to ensure that the sorbet won’t freeze too solid. Just go careful with the alcohol, otherwise the mixture might never freeze.\nUPDATE: For MORE WAYS TO IMPROVE SORBETS not covered above, check out this general post on various ways to make them better and last longer in the freezer, this post devoted to the particular, classic method of adding so-called Italian meringue and the more modern method of adding Aquafaba meringue: both methods guaranteed to take your sorbets to new heights 😉","The keys to success when making candy is temperature, attention, and patience. Candy thermometers give you an edge because — in addition to degrees — they actually list the different stages of candy.For example, if you are making fudge, a soft candy, you want the temperature to reach and stay in the soft-ball range. If you are making lollipops, a hard candy, you know that your candy temperature needs to reach the hard-crack stage.While you are cooking your sugary sweet concoctions, keep an eye on the thermometer to make sure you reach the right temperatures, not above or below. If you have never made candy before, be patient, it is a matter of getting familiar with technique.The following recipes give you a variety of candies to hone your candy-making skills.\nMakes 2 poundsIngredients:\n3 (1-ounce each) squares unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped\n3 cups sugar\n1 cup half-and-half\n1 tablespoon corn syrup\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons butter\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 cup chopped walnutsDirections:\n1. Butter the bottom of an 8-inch square pan.\n2. Combine the chocolate, sugar, half-and-half, corn syrup, and salt in a large saucepot fitted with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring continually with a wooden spoon until the chocolate melts and the mixture boils.\n3. Let the mixture cook, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 235 to 240 degrees F. If sugar crystals stick to the side, use a pastry brush dipped in water to brush down.\n5. Take the pot off the heat and let mixture cool to 110 degrees F. This can take a few minutes.\n6. When the mixture is cooled, stir in vanilla and butter, using a wooden spoon. Add the nuts. Continue to stir the fudge for about 15 minutes or until it sets and the color lightens. The appearance of the fudge will go from glossy to dull.\n7. When the fudge is set, pour it into the prepared pan and smooth it out with a spatula. Let cool for a few hours then invert the pan onto a cutting board. Cut into 1-inch squares and store in an airtight container layered with wax paper.\nMakes 1 poundIngredients:\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 cup sugar\n1/2 cup corn syrup\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n4 tablespoons butter, plus extra for greasing\n1/2 teaspoon vanillaDirections:\n1. Butter the bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish.\n2. Combine the heavy cream, sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a large saucepot fitted with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium heat, stirring continually with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved.\n3. Mix in the butter and stir until it melts and is fully incorporated.\n4. Let the mixture cook, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 245 to 250 degrees F. If sugar crystals stick to the side, use a pastry brush dipped in water to brush down.\n5. Stir in the vanilla and then pour the mixture into the prepared pan.\n6. Let the caramel cool completely then invert onto a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut into 1-inch squares.\n7. Store the caramels in an airtight container between layers of wax paper.\nMakes 50 piecesIngredients:\n2 cups sugar\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 cup light corn syrup\n2 teaspoons glycerin (optional)\n3/4 cup water\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 to 1 teaspoon flavoring (such as vanilla, lemon, maple, or mint)\n3 drops food coloring (optional)Directions:\n1. Combine sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepot fitted with the candy thermometer. Add corn syrup, glycerin, water, butter, and salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.\n2. Bring mixture to a boil and cook, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 270 degrees F.\n3. Take the pot off the heat and stir in the food coloring and flavoring. Pour onto a greased cookie sheet and let cool.\n4. When the taffy is cool enough to handle, grease your hands with oil or butter and pull until the color lightens and has a glossy sheen. This will take about 10 minutes.\n5. Roll the taffy into a long rope and cut it with scissors into bite sized pieces. Let the pieces rest for an hour then wrap in plastic wrap or wax paper. Store in a cool, dry place.\n1 cup sugar\n1/3 cup corn syrup\n1/2 cup water\n1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar\n1/4 to 1 teaspoon flavoring\nLiquid food coloring\n1 to 2 teaspoons citric acid (optional)Directions:\n1. Prepare an upside-down cookie sheet by covering it with parchment paper and spraying it with oil. If you're using molds, spray with oil. Place them on a cookie sheet and place the lollipop sticks in molds.\n2. In a large saucepot over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, and cream of tartar and stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar crystals dissolve.\n3. Continue to stir until the syrup boils. Use a pastry brush damp with warm water and brush down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan.\n4. Clip the candy thermometer to the side of the pan, being careful not to let it touch the bottom or sides, and let the syrup boil without stirring until the thermometer reaches 300 degrees F.\n5. Take the pan off the heat and let the syrup cool to about 275 degrees F. before adding the flavor, color, and citric acid, if using.\n6. Working quickly, pour small (2-inch) circles onto the prepared cookie sheet and place a lollipop sticks in each one, twisting the sticks to be sure they are covered with candy. If using molds, pour the syrup into the prepared molds, twisting the sticks to coat.\n7. Let the lollipops cool for at least 10 minutes or until they are hard. When completely cooled, wrap individually in plastic wrap or wax paper and seal with tape or twist ties. Store in a cool, dry place.\nMakes about 1 1/2 cupsIngredients:\n1/4 cup sugar\n1/4 cup brown sugar\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 cup slivered almondsDirections:\n1. Heat sugars and cream over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until sugars dissolve. Bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat to medium. Cook until softball stage (238 degrees F.).\n2. Mix in the almonds and cook to hardball stage (248 degrees F.). Pour onto a cookie sheet to cool. Pull apart any large clumps of almonds.

{"question":"How do environmental NGOs' demands differ between banks that fund fossil fuels and the proposed ocean conservation funding reforms?","answer":"Environmental NGOs have distinctly different demands for these two sectors. For banks funding fossil fuels, they specifically call for immediate steps including ceasing all new lending to coal-fired power generation, disclosure of financial exposure to carbon-intensive industries, and alignment with Paris Agreement goals. In contrast, the proposed ocean conservation funding reforms are more systemic, calling for fundamental changes like implementing wealth taxes on the super-rich, eliminating corporate subsidies, pursuing tax fraud, and using debt swap tools for conservation. The NGOs' approach to banks appears more focused on specific operational changes, while ocean conservation funding reforms target broader structural financial changes.","context":["How to Fund Ocean Conservation\nFive suggested strategies to fund the global climate crisis\nAs proposed by Karl Burkart’s “Show Me the Money: a New Slogan for the Climate Movement”\nOur premise here is that climate change, the over-arching global challenge of the moment, is a function of the ocean. Every problem we face — emissions, acidification, waste, pollution, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and so much more — connects directly or indirectly, from mountain-top to coast to the ocean floor, through the water cycle freshwater/saltwater continuum. I’ve said it often before: The Sea Connects All Things.\nPublic awareness, through media coverage and first hand experience of climate change, is high, and there is much concern and conversation about solutions — policy and law, regulation and enforcement, innovation and capital investment, and anecdotal evidence of change in the form of some government initiative, some alternative technology, some venture support, exists but is clearly inadequate to the urgency and cost. How, then, do we fund, at appropriate scale, the necessary action? How do we amass and focus the capital required to make this transformational change through effective monetary policy and investment? Is there a way forward?\nIn a recent article by Karl Burkhart, Deputy Director of One Earth, and former Director of Media, Science & Technology at the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, lists several strategies by which to create the funds required through significant financial reforms and reallocation of existing resources to meet this urgent global need.\nFirst, understand that we have nowhere enough capital available even to address successfully just one part of the problem. Estimates of funds required to meet the 1.5 degree Centimeter goal of the Paris Climate Agreement exceed $1.5 trillion per year, about one third of which has been committed, not all of which has gone to such critical needs as alternative energy and infrastructure that address the problem at its core.\nContext: understand that governments globally have allocated $16 trillion to the Covid crisis, saving millions of lives in the short-term but prolonging the investment in other strategies to protect many millions more. To meet the IPCC goal then, existing investments would have to triple at a time when all available assets are under critical stress.\nSecond, given this circumstance, to advance is to increase the available funds through taxes, always a controversial challenge to governments heavily committed to the status quo. Various options have been suggested: a return to more equitable income tax rates, aggressive collection of unpaid taxes, pursuit and enforcement of tax fraud, increase in corporate taxes, elimination of corporate subsidies, and a wealth tax for the super-rich.\nContext: according to the 2021 Credit Swiss Wealth Report, the richest 2.5 million individuals on earth (the top .03%) hold a staggering $100 trillion in assets, much of which is sheltered. A 1.5% wealth tax on this group is estimated to generate enough available capital to fund the entire climate transition.\nThird, de-fund the polluters. We are subsidizing our demise through policy that can be changed, an action with double value: the removal of incentives to pollute and the added value of pollution reduced and no longer inserted into the atmosphere or water cycle.\nFourth, swap the debt. This financial tool has been used to address unpayable national debt, forgiven in exchange for major land conservation actions in areas of wilderness — forests and streams — as designated conservation zones protected from further industrial development. This has worked in South America especially, and is working now in the Caribbean where small island nations have exchanged debt for large defined marine protected areas to sustain marine resources including coastal habitats, mangrove forests, coral reefs, and villages that derive their sustenance from the sea.\nFifth, boycott the banks that are the primary tools for this mis-investment. A recent Climate Chaos Report, prepared by the Rainforest Action Network, asserts that in the years since the Paris Agreement, “the world’s 60 biggest banks have financed fossil fuels to the tune of $3.8 trillion,” the investment of our deposits and mortgage payments into the most destructive , anti-social climate factor of all. And, even more recently, under the guise of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) principles, these banks, and the receiving corporate entities, are included in recommended investments for high net worth individuals, endowments, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and the banks themselves as “acceptable” alternatives to traditional strategies proven bankrupt. A wave of greenwash of almost tsunami scale.\nThese five changes can be made, but only with the comparable change in political will and dedicated investment in a future that is equitable for all. The ocean may seem indifferent to this monetary policy, but it is not. It pays the price for this every day everywhere. It used to be invisible, but no more. It used to be immune, but no more. It used to seem impossible to destroy, but no more. If there was nothing to be done, we might despair. There are powerful tools available, only as useful and effective as those who wield them.\nPETER NEILL is founder and director of the World Ocean Observatory, a web-based place of exchange for information and educational services about the health of the world ocean.

World Ocean Radio celebrates 12 years this year, with more than 600 episodes produced to date.","Rainforest Action Network\nJune 21, 2018 Tokyo, Japan — On June 18, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) announced its “policy towards financing businesses with potentially significant adverse environmental and/or social impact” including coal-fired power, palm oil plantation developments and deforestation.\nEnvironmental groups ー 350.org Japan, Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society (JACSES), Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Kiko Network, Friends of the Earth Japan and Greenpeace Japan ー issued the following statement on SMBC’s new policies.\n“We had high hopes for SMBC being the last of the major Japanese financial groups to announce an update of their social and environmental policy (1), following Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group. However we are very disappointed to see the visible loopholes in SMBC’s coal-fired power sector policy, which may defeat the purpose of the policy itself. There is also a lack of clarity around specific actions that the company will take on deforestation. While we welcome the fact that SMBC has shown a willingness to restrict coal financing and address deforestation, this announcement does not come even close to addressing the climate action needed in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nThe decision that SMBC should have made here is to announce a stop to any new financing for domestic and foreign coal-fired power projects and companies involved in such projects, with a clear strategy and timeline. (2) SMBC’s recent decision in April 2018 to finance the Nghi Son 2 coal-fired power plant in Vietnam, which will utilize sub-critical coal technology and has been challenged by local groups for apparent violations of the Equator Principles, highlights the potential loopholes of its coal policy.\nOn deforestation, SMBC should have laid out clear criteria for halting deforestation and protecting carbon-intensive peatlands. Its mere reliance on weak certification systems and national laws is clearly not enough.\nSMBC states that they are committed to the Paris Agreement and the SDG goal of “tak[ing] urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.” We urge SMBC to step up their game by making immediate steps towards divesting from coal and strengthening their policies on deforestation.”\nThe NGOs also provide the following detailed analysis of the policy which reveals glaring inconsistencies:\n“In the document, SMBC states that it will limit lending to coal-fired power plants that “use ultra-supercritical or more advanced technologies which are considered highly efficient.” Firstly, the policy’s inclusion of financing for any type of coal-fired power is insufficient when research endorsed by the United Nations Environment Programme clearly indicates there is no space to build any more new coal-fired power plants – no matter how efficient – in order to keep global temperature rise well below 2 degrees. More worrisome is the fact that SMBC states it will make exemptions for projects that [they have] already committed support […] or where the Japanese government or Multilateral Development Banks support.” This is a major loophole that will likely nullify the limitation that is set in the first place.\nSMBC, like Mizuho Financial Group, also references palm oil and logging, which are significant causes of deforestation, which in turn contributes to climate change. However, for palm oil, mere reliance on the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or equivalent certification systems is not sufficient to address deforestation, management of carbon-intensive peatlands or human rights, and additional measures are necessary, including use of the High Carbon Stock Approach. Additionally, SMBC’s policy to prohibit financing to businesses involved in illegal logging and illegal land clearance activities is a good start, but not sufficient to achieve zero deforestation by 2020 as stipulated in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15. ”\nNotes to the editor\n- Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation: Establishment of policy for businesses associated with Environmental and Social risk\n- 350.org Japan and supporting NGOs are currently running a global petition calling upon Japan’s three biggest financial institutions — Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group — to: i) disclose financial exposure to carbon intensive industries in line with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); ii) outline business strategies and clear targets and metrics to align their finance policies with the Paris Agreement; iii) cease all new lending to coal fired power generation and coal extraction projects and companies involved in such projects.\nKiko Network （https://www.kikonet.org）Tokyo Office: TEL. +81-3-3263-9210 E-mail. email@example.com\n350.org Japan: +81(3)070-2793-3648 Shin Furuno E-mail. firstname.lastname@example.org"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6773dfe0-6f21-494e-8933-d5703c726a0b>","<urn:uuid:1db33558-c533-429b-8423-9d2675978740>"],"error":null}

How often should air filters be cleaned or replaced?\nA. Generally, they should be replaced or cleaned once every month depending on how often your equipment runs, how many pets and people are in the home, and the particular design of the filter.Many new systems are equipped with permanent filters. These should be cleaned according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer or the contractor that installed the original equipment. When replacing disposable filters, match the type and size of the original filter.\nTip: Every time you pay your electric bill, change your\nQ. If an outdoor unit needs replacing, should the indoor unit be replaced, too?\nA. YES, It is not only a good idea to replace the entire system when an air handler or condenser needs to be replaced, ITS THE LAW in NC! The efficiency rating is based on the entire system. To gain the maximum benefit of new, highly efficient technology, the entire system should be replaced together. This ensures the system is reliable and achieving its true efficiency rating. (AHRI Matched)\nQ. How do you know what size system a house needs?\nA. There are many variables to be considered before determining which system is best for you, such as size of the house, climate at the location, the number and type of windows, insulation of the house, number of people in the house, etc. A quality contractor will consider all factors, by performing heat and cooling loads, based on The Manual J and obtaining energy use calculations for any home before making any size recommendations.\nQ. What do SEER rating numbers mean?\nA. To help consumers make informed choices, the U.S. government requires an efficiency rating of all air conditioning and heating equipment. The rating is meant to reflect the percentage of energy used efficiently. A high rating indicates high efficiency. There are various names for the efficiency ratings of varying types of equipment. Air conditioning equipment is rated by the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating, or SEER. Heat pump equipment is rated by the Heating Seasonal Performance Factor, or HSPF. Gas furnaces are rated according to their Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency, or AFUE.\nTo learn more about efficiency ratings on heating and air conditioning equipment in your home or business, please visit the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Consumer's Guide website.\nQ. Should outdoor units be covered in winter?\nA. Air conditioners that operate seasonally are built to withstand an outdoor environment. There is no advantage to covering an air conditioning unit during off seasons. In fact, rain helps to keep the unit clean.\nQ. Should a thermostat be set to “auto” or “on”?\nA. When the thermostat is set to “auto,” the fan operates only when the temperature requires it. This is the most used setting. However, there are advantages to using the “on” setting. First of all, the air in the house is constantly filtered through the unit’s air filter. Secondly, the constantly circulating air results in an even temperature throughout the house. However, the \"on\" position will result in higher humidity since air is being blown over wet coils after the condenser shuts off.\nQ. Can shrubs and flowers be planted around an outdoor unit?\nA. Yes. However, we recommend that plants be no closer than 18 inches from the unit. This allows plenty of room for air circulation in and out of the unit. Without this room for air circulation, the unit could overheat, resulting in a premature need for service."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:03e83ed2-b53d-44df-bfdb-7a194d36086a>","<urn:uuid:61ad1c13-529a-4d1d-b778-1c660c387f3a>"],"error":null}

[Definition] Types of Frameworks\nTable of Contents\nAs a programmer, you don’t need to start from scratch when you have tools designed to help you with your projects. Frameworks are software that are developed and used by developers to build applications.\nWhat is a Framework?\nSince they are often built, tested, and optimized by several experienced software engineers and programmers, software frameworks are versatile, robust, and efficient.\nUsing a software framework to develop applications lets you focus on the high-level functionality of the application. This is because any low-level functionality is taken care of by the framework itself.\nWhy do we use Frameworks?\nDeveloping software is a complex process. It necessitates a plethora of tasks, including coding, designing, and testing. For only the coding part, programmers had to take care of the syntax, declarations, garbage collection, statements, exceptions, and more.\nSoftware frameworks make life easier for developers by allowing them to take control of the entire software development process, or most of it, from a single platform.\nAdvantages of using a software framework:\n- Assists in establishing better programming practices and fitting use of design patterns\n- Code is more secure\n- Duplicate and redundant code can be avoided\n- Helps consistent developing code with fewer bugs\n- Makes it easier to work on sophisticated technologies\n- One could create their software framework or contribute to open-source frameworks. Hence, there is a continuous improvement in the functionality\n- Several code segments and functionalities are pre-built and pre-tested. This makes applications more reliable\n- Testing and debugging the code is a lot easier and can be done even by developers who do not own the code\n- The time required to develop an application is reduced significantly\nWhat goes in a Framework?\nWhen you install a software framework, the first thing that you need to take care of is the system requirements. Once a framework is installed and configured, it creates a directory structure.\nFor example, fig. (i) illustrates the directory structure of the Laravel Framework. Each of these folders could have additional directories. Directories can further have files, classes, test routines, templates, and more.\nDifference between a Library and a Framework\nSome may assume that a software framework is a collection of libraries just as libraries are a collection of precompiled routines. However, this is not true as not all software frameworks use or depend on libraries.\nThe difference between a library and a framework is that the latter calls the code. Opposite to this, the code calls the software library. Let us understand this with an example:\ncurl is a library in PHP. When you use one of the curl functions, the PHP code calls that particular function in the curl library. Your code is the caller, and the library code is the callee.\nWhen you use a PHP framework, such as Laravel, the relationship gets inverted, and so the software framework calls the application code written in the framework. This is technically known as Inversion of Control (IoC).\nProgramming language vs Frameworks\nA programming language tells the computer what it should do. Every programming language features a syntax and a particular set of rules, which need to be followed every time the code is written.\nA software framework is built on top of a programming language. For example,\nRails, also known as Ruby on Rails, is a web framework built on top of the Ruby programming language.\nTypes of Frameworks\nAs a developer, you should be on the lookout for frameworks that best suit your needs. Whether it is working on a website, data science, database management, or mobile applications, software frameworks exist for all genres of software programming.\nThere are many types of software frameworks to make it easier for developing applications for a wide range of application development domains. Let us dive into some of the software frameworks that are in vogue today:\nWeb Application Frameworks\nAngular is a typescript-based, open-source JS framework that makes it easy to build applications on the web. Angular solves application development challenges by combining declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and much more.\nAngular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, and desktop.\nSome popular websites developed using AngularJS are:\nDjango is a free and open-source web application framework written in Python. Built by a team of experienced developers, Django takes care of web development so that developers can focus on writing applications without reinventing the wheel.\nLarge organizations actively use Django in its development. Some popular websites developed using Django are:\nLaravel is a PHP-based web application framework with an expressive, elegant syntax. The open-source framework and follows a model-view-controller design pattern that is robust and easy to understand.\nAccording to Google Trends, Laravel has secured the position for the most powerful PHP framework, which offers a standardized and feature-packed platform for high-performing PHP web application development.\nSome popular websites developed using Laravel are:\n- Neighborhood Lender\n- World Walking\n1. Apache Spark\nApache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. You can write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL using the Apache Spark.\nOver 3,000 companies are using Apache Spark, including top players like:\nPyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that accelerates the process from research and prototyping to production deployment.\nPrimarily developed by Facebook’s AI research group, PyTorch can be used with Python as well as C++. PyTorch is used for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Some popular websites developed using PyTorch are:\nTensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source framework for machine learning (ML). It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers dive in ML, and developers quickly build and deploy ML-powered applications.\nThree typical applications for TensorFlow are-\n- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition and processing.\n- Large-scale linear models for data analysis and simple behavioral predictions.\n- Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models for human language-related features.\nCheck out these best data science tutorials and courses.\nMobile Development Frameworks\nIonic is a free, open-source mobile UI toolkit for developing high-quality, cross-platform native applications for Android, iOS, and the Web—all from a single codebase.\nIonic is a development platform for the entire application lifecycle that allows teams to build better and faster applications. Some of the popular applications developed using Ionic are:\n- McDonald's Türkiye\nXamarin is a free, open-source application development platform for building Android, iOS applications with .NET, and C#. Xamarin is part of the .NET platform that has an active community of over 60,000 contributors from more than 3,700 companies.\nSome of the popular applications developed using Xamarin are:\n- Alaska airlines customer applications\n- CA Mobile for mobile banking\n- Novarum DX, a medical app\nFlutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It has an expressive and flexible UI and gives a native performance on iOS and Android platforms.\nSome of the popular applications developed using Flutter are:\n- Alibaba (eCommerce)\n- Google Ads(utility)\nA Word of Advice Before Starting with Software Frameworks\nIt is a good idea to learn and develop coding skills by learning the nuances of a programming language before using frameworks for application development. If not, you might miss out on a valuable experience with the underlying technology that exists in a framework.\nIf you’re not already an expert programmer, then it is essential to understand the code which powers the framework. This knowledge would make it easier when you run into complex challenges and would make you an overall skilled developer.\nMany front-end developers contribute to open-source frameworks to support the entire community of developers. For example, developers at Google build AngularJS and Polymer, both of which are freely available to all front-end developers.\nMany developers support the front-end community by contributing to open-source libraries as well.\nThe bottom line suggestion for programmers who want to use software frameworks for application development is to learn a new framework or a programming language based on the need for the applications that are to be developed.\nFurther, analyze areas such as front-end, back-end, cloud management, and mobile technology, the potential market share of the technology, sustainability, and more, and understand the technology features before deciding to sign up with one.","A well-developed mobile application is an important pillar that supports the growth of businesses. It can help you engage your current customers, open doors to new ones and even provide you with an opportunity to exploit a completely new market.\nCross platform apps are those that can run on multiple platforms. The rise in competition and the trend of Bring Your Own Device to work has done nothing but fuel the demand of this category of apps. Cross platform apps are also great for startups entering the market.\nOnce the call has been made to develop a cross platform app, the next question that arises is about the framework to use to build the app. There are a lot of options in the market that could do well.But our vote has been set on Xamarin. It is considered one of the best framework for cross platform mobile app development by a majority of agencies. It has been used widely since its launch in 2011.\nLet’s have a brief look at what Xamarin is:\nWhat is Xamarin?\nXamarin is a framework created using C# that is popularly used to create cross platform mobile apps. Xamarin works on a single language i.e. C# and offers a runtime that works on three major mobile platform (Android, iOS and Windows). This allows the mobile app to look and feel like a native one on the respective platforms.\nXamarin was founded by Miguel de Icaza, Nat Friedman and Joseph Hill in May 2011. These were the same engineers that had also created Mon, Mono for Android and MonoTouch. In February 2016, Microsoft acquired Xamarin and has been a Microsoft owned company ever since.\nXamarin was built to provide a very unique function i.e. the ability to make cross platform apps easily whilst providing the apps a native feel and look depending on the platform. The core logic is written in C# while having the flexibility to design native user interface specifically for each platform.\nUnder the UI layer of code which is specific to each platform, lies the shared application logic. This needs to be written just once and it works across all platforms similarly. Developers can share as much as 75% of the code across platforms depending on the UI.\nAdvantages of Xamarin for Cross Platform App Developmen\nFew reasons why Xamarin stands ahead of all other frameworks in cross platform app development are as follows:\n1. Native Interface: The most preferred solution for the development of any application is to be able to provide a native interface to its users. This where Xamarin’s unique approach gains leverage. The comprehensive Integrated Development Environment of Xamarin provides a way for each C# code to be able to access device-specific features and provide a native UI and performance.\n2. Faster Development: Writing more code takes more time and money. But Xamarin allows us to code application logic once and then share it across the iOS, Android and Windows platform. With up to 75% of the code required to write only once, a lot of time and resources can be saved and the app can be launched more quickly.\n3. Perfect Quality Assurance: Any app needs to be tested under various circumstances in order to make sure that the app functions as desired in all of them. The Xamarin Test Cloud provides testers this capability. Testers can perform their tests across a number of real devices of different models and makes to ensure that the app is perfect.\n4. Fewer Bugs: C# is a simple, general purpose, type safe and object oriented language. When you Hire a C# developer to write your code, the type safety will help him/her prevent typing errors that could result in flawed program behavior. Another reason for this is the fact that since most of the code is shared, the code is not exceptionally long for all platforms. Lesser code also leads to a less chance of bugs.\n5. Cost Saving: Although it seems a little obvious, however, the immense cost saving is a crucial advantage of using Xamarin that cannot be left out. Making use of Xamarin help you drastically cut costs on manpower and resources.\nFirstly, since only a developer skilled in C# is required for developing apps on Xamarin, you save on developer costs.\nSecondly, since majority of the app logic needs to be coded only once, the development lifecycle is reduced significantly and hence you save on development costs.\nThirdly, the Xamarin Test cloud is an effective and inexpensive option for testing your app. It also provides a lot more real devices (up to 1000) to test on than the others which provides a more practical result. Hence, you can save a lot on app testing.\nLastly, since your app is cross platform, you can launch it on all platforms at once and gain monetary value of your app from a much larger market quickly rather than having a small audience of just one platform. Hence, you save on product launch costs.\nThese are just a few of the benefits of employing Xamarin for your app project.\nIt is important to appeal users from different platforms to ensure complete satisfaction across different devices. The last thing you want is to develop an app for a particular platform just to realize that you need to target another platform. It is abundantly clear that multiple platforms are here to stay and you need a strategy to deliver applications in a high demand scenario.

{"question":"How do modern industrial livestock farming methods compare to traditional pastoral approaches in terms of environmental impact?","answer":"Industrial livestock farming through concentrated animal feed lots (CAFOs) has significant negative environmental impacts through methane emissions, land degradation, and water pollution. In contrast, traditional pastoral approaches, as seen in both historical and modern examples like the Wadi Mujib region, can actually benefit the environment. Traditional grazing helps maintain grasslands, improves soil carbon sequestration, and when done properly can reverse desertification. For example, in Jordan's Wadi Mujib area, new technologies like green fodder units have helped reduce overgrazing pressure while supporting traditional pastoral lifestyles, demonstrating how modern solutions can enhance sustainable traditional practices.","context":["Follow CEPF Med:\nNew technology helps vulnerable villagers whilst protecting natural reserve\nSmall shrubs pepper an arid landscape of steep, sandy mountain slopes, where water is scarce and the sandy soil barren. On the edge of the Wadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve in Jordan, people live a traditional pastoral lifestyle below the poverty line. With livestock-keeping their main, or only, source of income, the conditions mean the 8,000 villagers of Faqou struggle to give their sheep the nutrition they need. Their care of their livestock leads to overgrazing in the Reserve, which supports a surprising variety of plant species including rare orchids, and several highly-adapted mammals including a threatened large wild mountain goat, the Nubian Ibex.\nImagine, then, a solution that allows people to grow cheap fresh green feed for their livestock in just seven days, all year round. Is there an innovative agricultural solution that takes little space, uses water efficiently, does not degrade the soil, uses no pesticides, improves food security, adjusts to climate change, improves people’s livelihoods and relieves pressure on nearby reserves so nature can flourish too?

Electricity for lights is provided by solar panels on the roof of the unit.\nA pilot green fodder unit was installed by SDAR working with the sheep farmers of Faqou’s Agricultural Cooperative Association, and has proved very successful. The ownership of the unit was transferred to the association, and, despite difficult early stages where locals were hesitant to buy fodder produced by this new technology, sheep farmers continue to purchase the green fodder rather than grazing on the reserve.\nPilot green fodder unit produces 0.5 ton of green fodder per round, sufficient to feed 200-220 goats using only 100 litres of water per month (recycled for a period of one month).\nIt is estimated that this saves up to 10 hectares of grazing land on the reserve in the first year.\n› Hydroponic green fodder unit installed, which produces fodder reliably throughout the year with very low running costs.\n› The unit consumes minimal water, generates minimal pollution, and saves soil degradation.\n› Green fodder production saves vertical space.\n› Workshops were held to ensure local people fully understood the benefits and were on board with the project, so sheep farmers bought this fodder.\n› Ownership of the unit transferred to the local cooperative, so they sell green fodder at a price beneficial to the sheep farmers, and improving income and living conditions.\n› Fodder of high nutritional quality produced, allowing for increase numbers of livestock per family, so better production of meat, milk and other products.\n› Grazing pressure on the reserve relieved, and minimal impact on biodiversity, as opposed to traditional fodder production.\nAs well as promoting ‘community management’ of a new resource, the project has also raised villagers’ awareness of Wadi Mujib and its unique nature, and the impacts of the different choices they can make when feeding their livestock.\n“Now people realise the importance of the flora and fauna around them, and we see this technology expanding to other sensitive areas in the Middle East.”\nRami El-Akhras, SDAR\nRami El-Akhras | firstname.lastname@example.org | email@example.com\nSign up to the CEPF Med quarterly newsletter\nThe Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) is a joint initiative of l’Agence Française de Développement (AFD), Conservation International (CI), the European Union, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Government of Japan, the John D. and Catherine T.

He lives on a heavily forested farm in southern Sweden, with some cattle and a pair of Belgian horses. Bo has developed a thesis on nitrogen fixation and nitrogen transfer of legumes, and he runs a small lab producing commercial rhizobia cultures. He is fond of carpentry, wood handicraft, and folkdance.\n“Then she also gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel became a shepherd of a flock, but Cain cultivated the land. In the course of time Cain presented some of the land’s produce as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also presented an offering — some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he was downcast” (The Book of Genesis, Hebrew Bible, via Wiki).\n“Howard [T. Odum], through his work in Puerto Rico and with the White House Panel on World Food Supply, had become increasingly convinced that developing nations’ agricultural systems were poorly understood and might contain hidden efficiencies unknown to American experts. In particular, Howard was struck by the stability of millennial old cattle raising practices in Uganda and monsoon agriculture in India. Never one to evade a telling catch phrase, Howard quoted Gandhi’s statement that in India “cows are sacred because they are necessary” to frame his own analysis about the protein and manure returns provided by cattle in India. While experts were just beginning to study the systems of agriculture in the developing world, both Odums felt that the American agricultural system had also been largely unexamined from an energy perspective and had been widely misunderstood as a result” (Madison, Potatoes made of oil; Eugene and Howard Odum and the Origins and Limits of American Agroecology, 1997).\nNothing is as it seems when viewed through an energy lens. Sweden is heavily reliant on nonrenewable resources for economic function and for growing food. This becomes increasingly problematic when fossil fuel production declines past peak. What services do wild and domesticated ruminants give to the land? How can we improve the quality of the land while also returning our relationship with cows from an industrial model to an agroecological one?\nThe engine of unsustainable farming has been fossil fuels with high net energy. Increasingly difficult extraction is lowering the net of fossil fuels. For example, oil extraction in Norway is in permanent decline. With less profit the oil companies and governments have increased their borrowing, leading to financial bubbles. Companies cut their investments and loans collapse in the economy as a result. We will not be able to maintain industrial agriculture or our society as a whole when the net emergy of fossil fuels gets too low.\nCoal cannot rescue us either since less than one-fourth of coal globally is now exported (BP Statistical Review, 2013, via Energy Export Databrowser). As exports wane, countries and oil companies have less leverage and leeway to support global trade. Financial bubbles of epic proportions develop in response to ever-increasing extraction of real resources, propped by fossil fuel subsidies. This situation cannot persist for very long. This means that our society’s global trade engine is slowing and may some day stop working.\nAgriculture is also dependent on subsidies of money, which translates into a broad footprint of imported fossil fuels and heavy use of resources, such as fertilizer from natural gas and topsoil from nature. Our global industrial agriculture system applies four times the nitrogen that the earth can withstand (Galloway et al., 2003). Phosphorus application has similar issues of poor availability in soils and nutrient runoff and pollution with industrial scale application to crops. The emergy basis of modern industrial agriculture is unsustainable even now with the current fossil fuel inputs seen below, and becomes rapidly unworkable as fossil fuel production wanes.\nRestoring an agroecological approach\nAgroecology is the cooperative pairing of nature and agriculture, using a systems ecology approach and less nonrenewable energy, by using the work of nature in promotion of the health of both nature and man.\nWithout fossil fuels, we would not be able to use tractors or afford to produce fertilizer-nitrogen, which makes the large-scale cultivation of cereals and oilseeds very difficult. Without natural gas to make fertilizers, we will need to switch to the cultivation of grasses and to rely instead on nitrogen-fixing legumes to provide enough nitrogen for crops. At that point we will probably also need to return to relying on draft animals for farm work, and to subsidize nitrogen through manure. We have understood the importance of manures and guanos since the very earliest days of agriculture–Cato the Elder suggested that the Romans should “save carefully goat, sheep, cattle, and all other dung” as fertilizers (Kolbert, 2013). Recycling of manure nutrients is important for a number of reasons, including the recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus.\nIn agroecology, everything needs to fit together, and everything needs to be recycled. Cultivation can provide hay and pasture for cows. With more grasslands, we can extend grazing periods and save hay. Fertility can be restored through manure. Cultivation is easier when lands are allowed to be fallow periodically. Draft animals can be used for ley cropping, which means, alternating growing grain or hay with legumes for winter fodder which does not need that much tilling, or being allowed to lay fallow. For example, Timothy and Alsike clovers only need plowing and tillage when renewing the crop every third year or so, which also creates less mineralization of the humus. Reserve areas for grazing are also available in forests, meadows and mountains. These processes would improve fertility in soils. Appropriate limits to the size of herds could be based on local production of winter fodder and available mobile grazing space need to be calculated and applied.\nHorses would also work as draft animals, but they need more inputs and we have very few draft horses in the world. We have cows and oxen, but breeds have become much larger over time, too large, perhaps, to be sustainable. Sustainable breeds will need to become smaller. Wild herds of ruminants also need to be protected and fostered to recover grasslands.\nCows as the villains—destroyers of worlds\nIndustrial animal farming using concentrated animal feed lots (CAFOs) have been villainized as destroyers of worlds in terms of carbon release through methane, and damage to the environment through various forms of serious land and water pollution. Yet traditional peoples relied on grazing animals in all cultures for food and other resources for daily life. Every continent except Antarctica featured prominent, large, migratory herds of ruminants grazing and controlling the grasslands. South America had llamas, North America had buffalo, deer, elk, moose, caribou, and musk ox while Asia had camels, yaks and others, and Europe had various types of deer, elk, reindeer, bison, and aurochs. Africa had giraffes, buffalo, eland, oryx, and others, while Australia had kangaroo. Historically large herds of these ruminants migrated across the grasslands, tilling the soil with their hooves and digesting grass and depositing manure and urine that improved the soil, and provided early high quality food for humans. Migrations of these herds created optimal pulsing conditions for maintaining the grasslands. Eventually domesticated sheep, goats, and cattle replaced some of these herds, with less and less mobility.\nTwo thirds of the land surface of the earth is arid, with sporadic rainfall. Desertification can result in these areas from overgrazing and exposure of the topsoil. Allan Savory has shown that desert formation can be effectively and quickly reversed by grazing livestock in a holistic way, by moving enough big grazing herds quickly, thus increasing active root systems for grasslands and improving the carbon sequestration in the soil, via grazed, actively growing vegetation. Savory states, “But when you range animals correctly, the land starts returning. The only thing that can do it is a heavy herbivore with a wet gut.” It is the industrial, non-migratory version of ranching that is the villain. Modern ranching maintains large herds in one place without any rest for the land.\nWhen we grow cereals and oil crops, soil carbon is released by tilling and nitrogen fertilization. Soil erosion with cereal crop production can be at the level of 10 tons per ton of cereal produced (Savory, 2013, Sharda et al., 2010). More grazing animals can improve the carbon sequestration in the soil of those areas that we are currently farming in a far from renewable way. Grazing livestock could aid in sequestering carbon in soil by restoring grasslands, while also providing food for society.\nWe now have about 1.5 billion cattle and 1 billion sheep on earth. Converting conventional agriculture to more grazing and ley cropping while reducing industrial feed lots of cows, pigs, and poultry could expand the reasonable number of grazing animals while reestablishing grasslands on desertified areas. Ideally, expanding traditional wild ruminants or historically adapted cattle would help in\nrestoring traditional ecosystems. As one example of adaptation, the Ankole-Watusi and Texas Longhorns tolerate hot climates by way of a cooling system of blood vessels in their horns. Each biome has ruminants with specific adaptations to their ecosystems. With more grazing ruminants we would also be able to feed many people although we would need to create completely different societies, with different inputs at different concentrations over different time scales. Using the self-organizing potential of grazing livestock could make a real difference in restoration of grasslands.\n“The fat was considered very valuable in the past; everything was used” (Erik Falk, born in 1920)\nAnother reason for transition to agroecology is better health through lower intake of carbohydrates, while also lowering intake of pesticides and other toxins. In both ruminants and humans, too many carbohydrates in the diet makes us fat and diminishes the amount of fat in the milk. Eating oils derived from plants may be less healthy than the animal fat that we are genetically adapted to, according to paleo diet theories. When we eat a smaller proportion of grain and oilseeds, we avoid substandard food both directly and indirectly through pork and poultry products. Oilseeds have shortened omega-3 chains, reactive double bonds and metabolically unnecessarily long carbon chains. There is a difference in the omega fatty proportions of grazing animals such as cattle compared to pigs and birds reared on cereals and oilseeds. Chicken eggs and cows milk from free range grazing cows has much higher content of Omega-3 fatty acids and other fat-soluble nutrients, and a better ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 for animals raised with a free-range diet. As long as hens eat cereal, the egg nutrients will be imbalanced, and without cereal there will be fewer eggs, even if they are also out free-ranging.\n“The cows were not home, they had to walk in the woods” (Gustav Ström born in 1900)\nGrazing cows in the woods is a long-standing tradition in northern Europe. With the help of kids, horns and kulning (a loud falsetto voice call), families handled animals at long distances. Forest, pasture, and mountain pasture used to receive more grazing during the summer so that production on farms could go to the harvest of hay to a greater extent. For this reason, the animals were kept away from farms far into the autumn, and in some parts of Sweden winter heather grazing is also significant.\nEspecially in mountain pastures, cows avoided parasites such as ticks by grazing further and further up the mountain slopes. The cows that grazed on the fresh pasture became well-fed and healthy. These cool, high mountain meadows created good fat which in turn boosted the animal’s own omega fat, which will deteriorate if the animal is fed concentrated cereals and oilseeds.\nThere is almost ten times more forest land than arable land in Sweden, so using forests sustainably for grazing is a part of an agroecological system. Grasslands also exist on mountains above the tree line. Grazing in forests might improve nutrient circulation in soils, fertility and diversity and it could help to control brushy under-stories. Growing forests without clear-cuts are especially suited to grazing where there is no urgency with plant growth. Cows will do some damage in forests. It also becomes a matter of judgment when grazing is not proper, for example if the forest is becoming excessively damaged or needs to be protected for other uses such as the production of blueberries.\nSpecial consideration is needed for predators. Avoid keeping sheep in the forest and keep the calves at home when the cows are out in the woods and pastures. Some species such as water buffalo and musk oxen that stay in denser, more protective flocks could be useful in situations with predators about.\nWe need to repair our relationships with bovines and ruminants. Prehistoric aurochs roamed the woodlands and grasslands of Eurasia, India, and North Africa. How can we return culturally to an era when aurochs thrived and was a part of the diversity of our grasslands and forest? A larger respect for the commons and a more cooperative perspective about land ownership in general will have to be part of any large-scale solution, but fences with openings and more cooperative communication between ranchers is a beginning, as described in the video at the end of this post.\nI am more optimistic about the future than I used to be. The idea of restoration of desertified areas, along with subsistence agriculture, more ley cropping and the potential use of forests, meadows and mountains makes me hopeful. At the same time there is so much feedback—Gaia, our oasis in space will eventually emerge as something completely different.\nTo me, it is mind-boggling that we have such an enormous solution to so many problems, where so many things fit together like a hand in glove. Yet this is the same ecological system that has evolved naturally over a long period as humans developed agriculture. We need to return to agriculture that fits into nature, and works by using available, renewable energies appropriately and not overrunning them, to live within the limits of the land. We need more grazing animals in sustainable situations to help solve the problem of agriculture. The cow and other traditional ruminants can be the foundation of a new culture and we can create a new rich cultural heritage as shepherds. Thanks to the cow and other grazing animals, we could still feed many people through agroecological practices. This is a much more holistic way of farming that respects nature by localizing inputs. Through pastoral farming we can understand the metaphor that God had a high regard for Abel, the shepherd. With proper stewardship of the land using cows and other ruminants, we can return to being of better service to our grasslands, forests, and our biosphere."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f9e0ed6e-0c7e-4207-9f3e-f4d7f4b4ec43>","<urn:uuid:f28ec629-0010-4b90-ae16-3f707c9c52a2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do early identification patterns compare between eating disorders and gender diversity in children?","answer":"Early identification patterns differ between these conditions. For gender diversity, children typically begin expressing their gender identity around 2-3 years old through their self-expression, clothing choices, and behavior, though some may start expressing it later in primary school or puberty. In contrast, eating disorders often go unrecognized, particularly in marginalized groups, with only about 1 in 10 people receiving treatment. Early recognition is crucial for both conditions, as early intervention is essential for better outcomes in eating disorders, and early gender expression support can help prevent the development of psychological distress.","context":["Of Papyrus and Pottery: Learning to Listen to the Marginalized Voice\nBy Norman H. Kim, PhD\nNational Director for Program Development Reasons Eating Disorder Center and Center for Change\nWe have a growing understanding as a field that eating disorders do not discriminate based on ethnicity, color, nationality, gender identity, sexuality, age, or size. Nevertheless, there remains a tremendous disparity in who receives services and, unfortunately, who remains under-identified by professionals and is, therefore, not receiving much-needed, and much-deserved, treatment and care.\nUsing data from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Studies (CPES), Marques and colleagues (2011) found a) no significant differences in rates of Anorexia across all ethnic groups, b) significantly higher rates of Bulimia in Latino and African-American groups, and c) significantly higher rates of Binge Eating for all ethnic groups studied. Despite the fact that prevalence rates of eating disorders were similar or greater, people in ethnic minority groups with a lifetime history of any eating disorders were significantly less likely to utilize mental-health services than non-Latino whites.\nSimilar patterns can be seen in rates of eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors in the LGBTQ community. LGBTQ-identifying high school students appear to be at significantly elevated risk of engaging in disordered eating behaviors (Austin et al., 2013), and overall rates of eating disorders in the LGBTQ community are similar or higher than among heterosexual women and men (Feldman & Meyer, 2007). One of the few large investigations of eating disorders in the transgender population (Diemer et al., 2015) found alarmingly high rates of eating disorders among college students identifying as transgender.\nWhile the presumptive truth of who can be affected by an eating disorder is relatively clear, these disparities remain, in part owing to larger societal prejudices, which result in discrimination and marginalization. More directly in the health care community, these disparities are also reflective of an ontologic question regarding the nature of eating disorders. If they are psychologically driven by wanting to look a certain way (which they are not), then thinking some groups might be protected from such pressures might make some sense. However, if eating disorders are instead psychologically rooted in a profound sense of being lesser-than, being inadequate, being broken (which they are), in the wake of genetic vulnerability and predisposition, it makes little sense to presume anyone immune.\nEating disorders are disorders of shame, isolation, and fear. One not only loses one’s voice, but feels bereft of the right to have a voice in the first place. When this occurs in the context of already being marginalized and feeling powerless because of the color of your skin, your gender identity, your sexual orientation, or any other prejudice, the suffering of struggling with an eating disorder can be compounded.\nIn thinking about trying to alleviate some of the tremendous suffering that comes with struggling with an eating disorder, nothing is more urgent than earlier recognition and identification of those at risk. Early intervention is essential to a better prognosis for those affected. And nowhere is this more important than in those struggling with eating disorders who are further marginalized by virtue of not “looking” like the typical someone with an eating disorder. Which brings us, maybe not so obviously, to papyrus.\nOne of the first known attempts at connecting symptoms to prognosis and treatment is also one of the oldest written documents in existence, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, one of the first medical treatises of the ancient world, dating from 1600 BCE in ancient Egypt. Papyrus is also part of the history of ostracizing people. The word ostracize comes from ancient Greece and refers to the shards of broken pottery, ostraka, that were used as tokens when citizens were voting on whether someone should be banished from Athens, a meaning that lives on in our current use of the word. Pottery was used because it was virtually free and considered OK to “throw away,” and Egyptian papyrus was too valuable to be used for this purpose.\nThere is a clear parallel in the connection between this sense of lack of worth and ostracizing or marginalizing someone, depriving them of full participation in society. This connection is all too real and present for those struggling with eating disorders who feel additionally marginalized and voiceless.\nTo be marginalized is to be relegated to the fringes. It is the experience of exclusion from the opportunities and resources available to others because of some “difference.” It is the state of being disenfranchised and results in a prolonged sense of “I’m not as important”; “It’s OK for me to be thrown away”; “I deserve to be ostracized.”\nWe still hear and see certain myths about who suffers from eating disorders (and who doesn’t …), even among professionals and specialists. Most people still think about eating disorders as being a disorder of thin, privileged, largely white young women. That’s the picture that accompanies magazine articles about eating disorders because it’s the picture that sells and is now what pops into most people’s heads when they hear the term “eating disorder.”\nBut people of color, our brothers and sisters in the LGBTQ community, men, older people, and people struggling with Binge Eating all share the pain, fear, shame, and loneliness that are core to all eating disorders. And, especially when you are already part of a minority or disenfranchised group and spend every day feeling like the perpetual “other,” the additional stigma and feeling of “not belonging” even to the community of people struggling with the same illness can magnify the feeling of being marginalized and pushed to the fringes, an exile among exiles.\nEven though the rates of eating disorders across all these groups are significantly higher than previously thought, most of these groups do not use mental-health services nearly as much, and many of these groups face significant barriers to accessing health care services even when they need them. Only about 1 in 10 people with eating disorders receive treatment, and only a third of those receive treatment from specialists. The rates are even lower for people in these marginalized groups.\nBefore treatment can even begin, people struggling with this illness must be recognized and identified. Imagine suffering from the tremendous fear, pain, and isolation that lie underneath the eating disorder behaviors and being told that you “don’t look sick” or that you shouldn’t have an eating disorder because of your age, weight, or skin color. Even worse is not being acknowledged at all for what you are struggling with.\nNow imagine if we could recognize this struggle earlier. Even early, subthreshold presentations of eating disorders can be associated with health impairments and physiological complications, as well as psychological distress and impairments in functioning. Failing to recognize or consider a diagnosis of an eating disorder because it might be presenting in a person who doesn’t fit the mold can lead to serious consequences and a worse outcome.\nI have great hope that with proper education and advocacy, we can do better about recognizing these struggles earlier in all people who are suffering. Just by opening up our minds a little and challenging some of these myths, all of us on the front lines can effect a great deal of change in trying to alleviate some of the suffering that occurs when someone is struggling with an eating disorder.\nThere is a wonderful creation myth from the Kabbalah that I like to use that, like the origin of ostracizing, also involves broken pottery. The myth of the “Shattering of the Vessels” says that in the beginning of time, all the light of the universe was contained in 10 vessels, which broke open, scattering the broken pieces everywhere. Unlike ostraka, the worthless pieces of broken pottery, these broken pieces are the souls of the world and are priceless.\nThe most important role that caregivers, loved ones, and professionals can have is to be the holders of hope for someone who is struggling with an eating disorder, from whom hope has been taken. For those who are further marginalized and who might feel especially voiceless, we all have some responsibility in working to recognize the universality of eating disorders, and remembering the sublime value of “broken” things.\nAbout the author:\nDr. Norman Kim completed his B.A. at Yale and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at UCLA.

It can be seen as an umbrella term that is used to describe gender identities that demonstrate a diversity in expression, beyond the binary framework of male and female.\nHow children and teenagers express gender?\nGender expression is how your child shows their gender. This might be through their name, clothes, behaviours, hairstyle and voice. Almost all children begin expressing their gender identity from around 2 to 3 years old. They do this in the way they talk about themselves and through the clothes they choose. Children can be very firm about their gender from an early age.\nMany gender diverse children also express their gender identity around the same age and can be very firm and get upset, angry or annoyed, when people refer to them as a boy or a girl. They may refuse to wear particular clothes and say they are a different gender. But as everyone is different, some children may start talking about their gender in primary school, at puberty… There is no rule.\nWhat is Gender Diversity?\nGender diversity refers to gender non-conformity with or without gender dysphoria and includes aspects of gender identity, expression or behaviour that do not conform to societal gender expectations based on birth anatomy.\nWhat is Gender Dysphoria?\nGender dysphoria is ‘’a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of a least 6 months duration’’. In children, the desire to be of the other gender must be present, verbalised and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nGender dysphoria is not a psychiatric disorder/diagnosis. However, it is frequently associated with psychological distress such as anxiety, depression etc. Gender dysphoria is when a child feels distressed (the level of distress can range from manageable to debilitating) because their gender identity differs from their sex given at birth. Not all gender diverse people have gender dysphoria.\nGender diversity is not a psychiatric disorder. It is not pathological.\nStatistics on Gender Diversity and Mental Health\nHere are some mental health statistics from a 2017 Australian study with young people aged 14 to 25 and identifying as trans or gender diverse: (you will find more information by clicking on this link trans-pathways-report.pdf (telethonkids.org.au)\nStrauss, P., Cook, A., Winter, S., Watson, V., Wright Toussaint, D., Lin, A.

Six months later, they had a baby named Susanna, and two years later, they produced twins, Hamnet and Judith Shakespeare\nSusanna, Judith, and Hamnet\nHis first daughter, Susanna, married John Hall, producing Elizabeth Hall, and Judith married Thomas Quiney, resulting in three children named Shakespeare, Richard, and Thomas Quiney.\nHistorians do not know the exact day of his death, but\nit is known that he died on his birthday. What a coincidence!\nHe was buried at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford- Upon- Avon\nJohn Shakespeare was a successful wool merchant, farmer, alderman, tradesman,\nglove and other leather goods maker. As a result, it's only inevitable for his son to learn at ann arduous school.\n\"A Stage for his Brilliance\"\nShakespeare was a brilliant businessman, and most of his money had been derived from the Globe. The Globe theater was built in the autumn of 1599 for Lord Chamberlein's Men, and the lease for the land where it stood was shared among Burbage and Robert, and a group of actors: William Shakespeare, Will Kemp, Augustine Philips, John Heminges, and Thomas Pope.\nShakespeare left his family and during 1585-1592, he joined an acting company, Lord Chamberlein's Men, as both playwright and performer, where he also began to write some of his renowned plays.\nShakespeare had acted in a multitude of his plays, bringing forth the liveliness and plot, along with\nHenry Condell, Richard Burbage, and\nThe Hope, the Swan, the Rose theater were other theaters along with the Globe.\nDue to exceeding the 21 lease period, the constructors had to dismantle the original theater built in 1576 and construct it again in Southwark, on the south bank of Thames, known as Bankside.\nThe roof of the Globe had been destroyed when a cannon misfired during the play,\nHenry the Eight! Consequently, the whole theater collapsed on itself, suggesting a new theater. The new theater was built in 1614, and stayed healthy until 1644.\nHis Astounding Work\nWilliam Shakespeare was known throughout London and Great Britain for his magnificent works.

He used his own experiences and situations from that time period, and began his playwright career with the play, Henry VI, in 1590. In addition to his personal experiences, he had to devote crucial amounts of time to read and muster information about mythology, history, emperors, etc.\nHis knowledge and plays brought him lots of fame and was loved throughout the nation. His plays grasped the attention of the audience, and with many plays brought stashes of money to his business.\nJulius Caesar can be considered as both a Tragedy and History\nAs a Poet\nNot only was Shakespeare exempt at fabricating plays, but also showed his talent at poetry. Along with the 37 plays he wrote, he also wrote 154 sonnets. Shakespeare often stuck to sonnets, 14 line poem with ten syllable in each line and an accent falling on every second syllable. Ten syllables in each line and the accent falling on every second syllable is the definition of his style, Iambic Pentameter. Sonnets originated in Italy and were introduced in England in the Tudor period, and Shakespeare had adapted to its style. Along with sonnets, he also wrote five long narrative poems. Shakespeare surely must've written more than 159 poems, but his extra work would've most likely been lost.\nHis poems were utterly dedicated to conveying many forms of love and beauty. Most of his poems, however, address his patron and sponsor, Henry Wriothesly. Moreover, Shakespeare wrote his riveting poems between 1593 and 1601.\nWhen the theater closed due to the plague, he wrote two long narrative poems:\nBecause Shakespeare needed more income,and saw many others exceeding in poetry, he began composing poems.\nThe History of his Poems\nVenus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece\nOther long poems:\nA Lover's Complaint, The Pheonix and the Turtle\nOne of his many sonnets:\nDid You Know?\nSome of Shakespeare's 400 year old plays have been adapted into modern movies\nRomeo and Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet\nTaming of the Shrew\nTaming of the Shrew\nHis Influence Upon The World\nShakespeare had invented approximately 1700 words, leaving our language a huge favor.\nMany authors such as Charles Dickens were influenced by Shakespeare's behemoth work, leaving his words and phrases resounding in the current world.\nHis works have been adapted and are being performed more often than those of other playwrights.\nWithout Shakespeare, our beautiful language would have failed to flourish, and the simple human themes he expressed would have tragically been lost in a dark oblivion..\nA Brief Summary:\n“Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.”","Ingram Frizer (// freezer; died August 1627) was an English gentleman and businessman of the late 16th and early 17th centuries who is notable for his reported killing of playwright Christopher Marlowe in the home of Eleanor Bull on 30 May 1593. He has been described as \"a property speculator, a commodity broker, a fixer for gentlemen of good worship\" and a confidence trickster gulling \"young fools\" out of their money.\nThere is no definite information regarding Frizer's origins, but he may have been born in or near Kingsclere in Hampshire, and the not always reliable International Genealogical Index does in fact show the baptism there of a female child called Ingram Frysar on 26 September 1561. Parish records for Kingsclere held at Hampshire Record Office show an Ingram Frizer, son of Stephen, christened 26 September 1561 in Kingsclere, Hampshire.\nSurviving legal records show Frizer to have been a fairly well-to-do business man profiting from buying and selling property. At the time of Marlowe's death the landowner Thomas Walsingham was Frizer's \"master\", but this does not imply that Frizer was a servant. As well as acting on his own behalf, Frizer appears to have been Walsingham's business agent. Walsingham was a young relative of Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State, Sir Francis Walsingham; both Walsinghams had been heavily involved with intelligence work a few years earlier but there is no evidence that Frizer ever had any connection with it.\nNot all of Frizer's business dealings were honest. In 1593, collaborating with Nicholas Skeres (who was also present at Marlowe's killing), he was involved in lending money to one Drew Woodleff. Woodleff signed a bond for £60 in exchange for some guns that Frizer supposedly had in storage. Frizer then claimed to have sold them on Woodleff's behalf, but for only £30. The effect of this was that Frizer, who had never offered any guns for sale, had made Woodleff a loan of £30, to be repaid by the redemption of the £60 bond, an interest rate of 100%. Woodleff later signed a bond for £200 in favour of Thomas Walsingham, agreeing the forfeit of land to him in default of payment, to extricate himself from his bond to Frizer.\nA few years later, when King James ascended the throne, Frizer received numerous benefices from the crown, through the action of Audrey Walsingham (Thomas's wife and a friend of James's Queen, Anne of Denmark). He moved to Eltham, about three miles from the by then Sir Thomas Walsingham's estate at Scadbury. He became a churchwarden in 1605 and a parish tax assessor in 1611. There was a daughter named Alice Dixon, who lived in London, and another who married a man called John Banks. A \"Mrs. Ingeram\" who was buried at Eltham on 25 August 1616 may perhaps have been his wife, and he remained there apparently in genteel respectability until his death, being buried in the church there on 14 August 1627.\nFor several years before his death Marlowe had been employed in some intelligence capacity on behalf of the government. In the Spring of 1593 he appears to have been staying at Thomas Walsingham's home at Scadbury, near Chislehust in Kent, and had been invited by Frizer to a \"feast\" in Deptford, a township on the river Thames some seven miles to the north, at the house of Eleanor Bull, the widow of a local official. The status of Dame Bull's establishment is unclear, but it was probably a private victualling house, rather than a public tavern. Also in attendance were Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley, both of whom had been associated with Sir Francis Walsingham's intelligence operation. In fact Poley still was working for the Privy Council at the time.\nComplete details of Marlowe's killing on 30 May 1593, as contained in an inquest run by the Coroner of the Queen's Household two days later, were discovered by Leslie Hotson in 1925. According to this report, based upon accounts from the three men present, Poley, Frizer, Skeres and Marlowe were in a private room, having had dinner. Poley, Frizer and Skeres were all seated facing a table with Frizer in the middle. Marlowe was lounging on a bed just behind them when Frizer and he got into an argument over \"the reckyninge\" (the bill). Marlowe suddenly jumped up, seized Frizer's dagger, which Frizer was wearing \"at his back\", and with it struck him twice on the head, leaving wounds two inches long and a quarter deep. Frizer, his freedom of movement restricted between Poley and Skeres, struggled to defend himself and in doing so stabbed Marlowe above the right eye, killing him immediately.\nAlthough some contend the \"self defence\" evidence offered at Marlowe's inquest was quite in keeping with the victim's alleged propensity for sudden violence, this has been brought into question by Charles Nicholl, who notes that Marlowe's supposed previous history of violence has been somewhat exaggerated. The tendency, particularly by Park Honan, to portray Marlowe as violent is also challenged by Rosalind Barber in her essay ‘Was Marlowe a Violent Man?’.\nIt has been suggested Frizer could have had other motives. Park Honan proposes that Marlowe's presence at Scadbury was a threat to Walsingham's reputation and influence, and thus threatened Frizer's interests also: The Privy Council certainly suspected Marlowe of atheism and heresy, and yet he was a regular and welcome house-guest of one of Elizabeth's former spymasters. At the start of 1593 it was upheld in Parliament that heresy was tantamount to the greatest crime of all—treason. Honan considers it possible that, given the circumstances, it was Thomas Walsingham himself, accustomed \"not to look far into Frizer's…trickery\", who initiated the deed by making his agent aware that Marlowe was becoming a liability to them both, and so indirectly securing his former friend's death.\nAnother theory suggests that Marlowe, as a supposed member of \"The School of Night\", became aware of Essex's plots against Raleigh, and Skeres was sent to warn him to keep silence. It was only when Marlowe refused to heed the warning was the unpremeditated decision taken to silence him in a more certain and final way. In this surmise Frizer is no more than one of Skeres's associates, and not the principal player.\nThe Marlovian theory suggests that Frizer took part in the faking of Marlowe's death to allow him to escape trial and almost certain execution for his subversively atheistic activities. This theory further suggests that Marlowe went into exile, and wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare.\n- Nicholl, Charles (1993).

{"question":"As a museum enthusiast interested in public engagement, I'm curious how the Deutsches Museum and Muncy Heritage Park compare in terms of their approaches to hands-on visitor participation?","answer":"Both sites emphasize hands-on visitor engagement but in different ways. At Muncy Heritage Park, public participation centered around archaeological digs where visitors ages 3 to 85 could actively excavate artifacts, though this was balanced with initial work by college students to preserve data accuracy. At the Deutsches Museum, interactivity focuses on scientific experiments and exhibits - visitors can touch displays, press buttons, observe ship wave patterns, and conduct chemical reaction demonstrations. Both approaches serve educational purposes, with Muncy using hands-on archaeology to connect people with local heritage, while the Deutsches Museum uses interactive exhibits to help visitors understand scientific and technological concepts.","context":["Muncy Heritage Park and Nature Trail\nBy Robin Van Auken\nCEO of Hands on Heritage\nBill Poulton knew the old well was near the defunct canal, but after decades of neglect, tiger lilies, poison ivy, and oak trees had overgrown the small patch of land. He pounded an iron bar into the ground.\n“It’s right about here,” he said. Then the bar struck something solid.\nMy Lycoming College archaeology students swarmed the spot and fell to their knees. Eager to reveal the treasure, they used their bare hands to yank the grass and roots, then swept away the soil. Soon, they revealed a large concrete pad.\nI traced the etched surface and read aloud the date: “Oct 22 1928.”\nA bit more digging and a lot of heavy lifting and the well cover was removed. We revealed the stone well that had served Lock No. 28 on the West Branch Canal.\nHidden from sight for more than 75 years, the drinking well that once provided fresh, clean drinking water to thousands of canal travelers became the first archaeological artifact recovered and recorded at Muncy Heritage Park and Nature Trail.\nPoulton, president of Muncy Historical Society, and his wife, Linda, editor of Now and Then, the society’s journal, are the driving forces behind the society’s creation of the park. Carved out of an 11-acre parcel that Betty Fisher donated to the society, the Heritage Park commemorates the historic role of Muncy and the 19th Century West Branch Canal.\nPoulton invited Lycoming College to help him locate the lock tender’s well and house foundation. So began a partnership that has spanned a decade.\nThe 2005 archaeology field school was the first to explore and excavate at the Heritage Park. The task of completing the excavation fell on the shoulders of the community.\nWe issued the invitation, and people volunteered. During the next four years, thousands of people, from Pennsylvania and beyond, visited the park to try their hand at archaeology, learning about local history as they carefully uncovered brick, nails, pottery, glass, and more at the historical site. Some people even planned vacations around a park visit, having learned of the Public Archaeology Dig from the Conde Nast publication, Cookie, and an airline magazine.\nMost archaeology site locations are not promoted, but at Muncy, publicity was encouraged. The concept of a Public Archaeology Dig is to invite the community to volunteer and support our shared cultural heritage.\nPeople ages 3 years to 85 years participated in the dig. Younger volunteers attended with parents or teachers, and were closely monitored. Often, the younger workers preferred digging worms and beetles.\nThere’s a tradeoff with every archaeology dig. Archaeology is 100 percent destructive. We dig a big hole and remove every particle of soil, sifting it through a mesh screen. What remains behind, if it’s an artifact, goes into a bag and leaves the site. What goes through is pushed back into the hole when we’re done.\nIf we don’t record every action and location of every item, then this data is lost and the story doesn’t get told.\nWhen a trained college student or adult performs the task, most of the information can be saved. When a 6-year-old wields a trowel, all bets are off.\nThat’s why it was important to begin each archaeology season with a field school, with college students collecting data with accuracy, before allowing the public to damage the site.\nThe tradeoff pays out when that 6-year-old grows up and recalls that moment of rapture when she discovered an ancient bit of broken glass, as precious as a gem, and she is committed to preserving, protecting, and supporting future archaeological investigations. We will lose provenience of a few artifacts, but we may save our cultural heritage.\nBeing the first person to join the project means I am witness to all the improvements made since May 9, 2005, our first day.\nEach new season, we watched as Poulton and his volunteers transformed the park around us. Workers cleared fields and removed dead trees. They built trails and installed interpretive panels. They erected pavilions and placed benches in strategic locations. Boy Scouts developed projects there, building bird blinds and bridges. New trees and a wildflower garden adorned the new park, attracting birds and butterflies.\nI’ve always known the hidden, buried beauty of Muncy Heritage Park, but soon others noticed. People began walking the paths and fishing at the river. Bird watchers planned outings, and amateur astronomers set their telescopes up at night. Muncy Heritage Park is an outstanding example of inspired leadership, and I’m thrilled to have been a part of the project from its inception. To this day, I continue to support the park, and volunteer for events such as the Youth Fishing Derby, the Arch in the Park, and Night Sky telescope viewings. I continue to take college students to the park for the grandiose tours Poulton gives, and I admire his vision and perseverance. He tells the story of how he used to mow the grass there more than 40 years ago, and would daydream of what it could be.\nNow, with the support of scores of volunteers and generous grants and endowments, Poulton has realized that dream. With his inspired leadership, we have created a legacy for generations to come.","The German Museum or as it is officially known as – the Deutsches Museum of Masterpieces of Science and Technology is the largest museums of the world dedicated to science and technology. Deutsches Museum is located in the German city of Munich.\nToday, the museum houses more than 18,000 objects representing approximately 50 different fields of science and arts. Annually the museum receives a massive footfall of over 1.5 million individuals. The museum is open for public viewing along with being in association with the Leibniz Association for research and associated purposes.\nIf you think museums are big and boring well then the Deutsches Museum will put you to think again. It is not only one of the oldest but also the biggest museum which is dedicated to science and technology in the whole world. Both, the young and the old can have a great time at the most fascinating and interactive museum located in Munich. The museum is quite centrally located, on the Museumsinsel or the Museum Island in the river Isar. Along with housing the myriad exhibits, it also hosts many exhibitions concerning science, industrial production, energy, transport, communication, environment and much more. It is unlike any other museum in the world. The museum provides you with an interactive experience that is the visitors can touch and experience and also do as per the directions. They can also observe the different shapes of ships and learn as to how they create more or less waves in the water. Also be able to understand how the different chemical reacts when they come in contact with other materials and elements. As far as the younger lot is concerned, their fascination towards pressing the buttons is encouraged. For the older folks and students detailed information is also provided on the boards both in English and German for each and every experiment.\nThere is also a transportation exhibit towards which the young male population is attracted generally. The Deutsches Museum also house a complete submarine along with an airplane in all kinds of shapes and sizes and also a sailing ship among other things. Probably the most fascinating exhibit is the environment exhibit. When you enter the building the opening site is that of a huge transparent column filled with garbage. It symbolically represents the amount of garbage produced by one individual within a period of one year. There is also detailed information available on as to how this amount of waste is reduced, recycled and treated. Along with this there is also a module which descriptively elaborates upon facts and history of farming, water, air, climate, growth and pollution.\nAltamira Cave is often regarded as the most unique feature of the German Museum. Originally the Altamira Cave is located in Spain which house the Stone Age paintings of animals. This site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to this very reason the caves began to experience decoration because of the many visitors and thereon they had to be closed shut for visitors.\nIt is also true that one day in any case is not enough to visit each of the exhibits. Visitors can therefore choose their desired and interest worthy sections at the entrance of the building and then make a move. Also, another matter of interest could be the two subsidiaries of the museum. They are: Verkehrszentrum or the transport centre at Theresienhöhe – here you can enjoy the many exhibitions associated with cars and trains, and Flugwerft Schleissheim which is a former Airfield located in Oberschleissheim – here you can watch and learn more about aircrafts.\nThe concept behind Deutsches Museum\nDeutsches Museum operates with the declared vision through which they aim at bringing forth the vivid colours of various scientific and technology based endeavours to the common individual. In the same regard it begins with the historicity behind all forms of developments associated with science and technology along with its impact on the technical and social development. The museum also provides a collection of studies comprising of approximately 94,000 objects. For this purpose there is also a dedicated library which houses volumes and archival materials numbering over 850,000 along with a number of original documentations.\nThe Research Institute of Science and Technology History wing of the Deutsches Museum works in constant association with the Ludwig Maximilian University and the Technical University. This association began in 1963 under the leadership of Otto Meyer with the establishment of the Institute of the History of the Exact Science and art. There were also courses offered through another association which was with the Kerschensteiner Kolleg. They brought forward programs for both teachers and students concerning the history of the sciences and arts.\nThe many symbols of the Deutsches Museum\nThe History of the Museum’s Construction: The most important individual associated with the museum is its founding father Oskar von Miller. He conceived the construction of this museum in the year 1903. Since at that time no substitute building was available for the housing purposes of all the exhibits the requirement of formal building emerged and thus in the due course Deutsches Museum emerged. Temporary exhibits were conducted while this building was under construction in the vacant rooms of the Old National Museum. The German Museum was opened for public viewing in the year 1906 in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm II and at the same time the foundation stone for a new museum building was laid. For this purpose the city of Munich freed up a particular part of the Coal Islands which is in the river Isar.\nThe ingenious planners and builders had envisioned an engineering marvel, a masterpiece none like any other. Therefore, for this very purpose many of the newly introduced construction materials such as concrete and reinforced concrete cement were used. Upon its completion, Deutsches Museum became the largest reinforced concrete construction in Germany at the time. Interestingly enough, the museum tower itself was erected by using the latest compressed concrete process. The foundation of the museum building is supported by one hundred and twenty three columns whose lengths vary between six and nine metres. These pillars were rammed directly into the ground so that adequate support could be created. The actual foundation of this building consists of a 1.5 metre thick reinforced concrete slab.\nAs far as the new museum building is concerned, its plans were drawn at the hands of the Munich based architect Gabriel von Seidl. He and his team members conducted a preliminary study and then Gabriel von Seidl himself took over the actual structural planning. At the time when the first draft of the plans came through they became a matter of instant dispute between the numerous architects who were working in association with Gabriel von Seidl. Moreover, the focus of this controversy was primarily the façade and the shape of the pinnacle. However, a consensus was reached in the due course after many lengthy discussions. It took a while but the shell of the tower was finished by 1911-1912. In the following years with the arousing tensions of the World War sprouting up the completion of the museum building was conducted in batches, however the opening of the building could only happen in 1925.\nMuseum Tower: The Museum Tower is an integral symbol of the Deutsches Museum. Plans of this tower were deliberate and it was built with respect to the vision of the founder – Oskar von Miller. You can see large meteorological instruments on the very façade of the tower. This marked to further the aims of the museum society which was to instigate a matter of interest of the population towards the field of meteorology.\nThe Meteorological Instruments on the Tower: The many instrumental elements on the façade of the tower such as: the barometer, thermometer, hydrometer and anemometer mark the characteristic features of the building along with the aims of the museum as a whole. Work on these instruments was commenced in the year 1917 and for this purpose the museum staffs was in constant conversation with the many leading manufacturers of meteorological instruments. The idea was to source the best of the best instruments.\nMost amount of difficulty was faced with respect to the transmission mechanism. The aim in this regard was to create a precise and sensitive measuring instrument which through large displays could present visible measurements from afar. The development of this mechanism was a matter of great challenge because the readings from these instruments were to be converted into the movement of the large sized arms on the very façade of the building. Thus, the contracts were given to the company of G. Lufft in Stuttgart for the barometer and also to the company of W. Lambrecht in Göttingen for the hygrometer. These companies donated the instruments that they made to the museum and regarded their achievements to be of great proportions. Thus they began to advertise using the museum tower. All the work on the instruments was also completed on time and presented before the opening exhibition of 1925. The thermometer was the only instrument which took a while to be completed and could only be put to operation in 1928.\nSnippets from History\nBefore the beginning and also during the Second World War the control of the German Museum came into the hands of the Nazi Party. Moreover, the Nazi Party used the museum and its resources to further their propaganda causes through films and exhibits. At one point in time Russian labourers were housed here and it also functioned as a post office.\nIn the year 1944 when the war was nearing its end, the museum building was hit by the numerous airstrikes. As a result 80 % of the structure was destroyed along with damaging over 20% of the exhibits.\nFollowing is a list of the permanent exhibits that can be seen at the German Museum:\n- Altamira Cave, reproduction of a Spanish cave with stone-age paintings\n- Amateur Radio\n- Bridge Building\n- Digital Imaging (under construction as of 2006)\n- Electrical Power\n- Energy Technology\n- History of the Deutsches Museum\n- Hydraulic Engineering\n- Machine Components\n- Machine Tools\n- Marine Navigation\n- Mining (Historical and Modern)\n- Mineral Oil and Natural Gas\n- Power Machinery\n- Scientific Instruments\n- Technical Toys\n- Textile Technology\n- Tunnel Construction\n- Weights and Measures\nThe English speaking population during their visit will indeed feel right at home because at the German Museum you have access to English speaking tour guides. These guides are not only well versed in the language but also hold considerable amount of knowledge pertaining to the various exhibits. At the museum visitors can also indulge in the specialised workshops and also attend the many public lectures which are open to individuals of age groups."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:98ad2ef8-c907-409c-b647-a44cf82c2ab0>","<urn:uuid:48427cb3-7149-4ea6-83a1-4620ea249447>"],"error":null}

Maximizing efficiency with custom filters makes working with large datasets easier.\nEffectively Using Your Custom Filters for Maximum Efficiency\nWhen it comes to filtering data in Excel, custom filters can be a real game-changer. Using custom filters for maximum efficiency involves different techniques. Here are five points to remember:\n- Understand the types of filters available: text, number and date filters.\n- Create and save your own filter views.\n- Use wildcard characters in your filter criteria: asterisks (*) and question marks (?).\n- Clean up your data before filtering.\n- Combine multiple criteria with logical operators: AND, OR and NOT.\nUnderstanding the filters helps select the best one for the data type. Saved views help save time and effort. Wildcards assist in searching for specific terms. Cleaning up data prevents inaccurate results. Logical operators help combine criteria for complex filtering.\nThis will increase efficiency significantly. For example, filtering out customers with negative balances can be used to review bad debtors. This list can be saved as a view and applied each time it’s needed.\nUsing custom filters is nothing new. Excel has been a fundamental tool since 1985. As Microsoft updates, its functionality improves – filtering is no exception.\nFAQs about How To Use Filters In Excel: A Step-By-Step Guide With Shortcuts\nWhat are filters in Excel and how can I use them?\nFilters in Excel allow you to sort and analyze data in a table based on certain criteria or conditions. By using filters, you can easily sort through a large set of data to find specific information. To use filters in Excel, select the data range you want to filter, click on the “Data” tab, and choose the “Filter” option.\nWhat are the different types of filters in Excel?\nThere are three types of filters in Excel: the basic filter, the advanced filter, and the slicer filter. The basic filter allows you to filter data by a single criterion, such as a specific date or value. The advanced filter allows you to filter data using multiple criteria. The slicer filter allows you to create visual representations of your data and filter it by clicking on the appropriate buttons.\nHow can I use shortcuts to make using filters in Excel easier?\nExcel provides several shortcuts that can make it faster and easier to use filters. For example, you can toggle filters on and off using the “Ctrl+Shift+L” shortcut, or you can clear filters using “Alt+D+F+F”. To display the filter drop-down arrow for a specific column, you can use “Alt+Down Arrow”.\nCan filters be applied to multiple columns in Excel?\nYes, you can apply filters to multiple columns in Excel. To do this, select the columns you want to apply filters to, and then click on the “Filter” button in the “Data” tab. Excel will create a drop-down filter for each selected column, allowing you to filter the data in each column using different criteria.\nHow do I create a custom filter in Excel?\nTo create a custom filter in Excel, click on the “Filter” button in the “Data” tab, and choose the “Custom” option. This will open the “Custom AutoFilter” dialog box, where you can specify the criteria for your filter. You can create custom filters based on specific dates, values, text, or even cell colors.\nHow do I remove filters from an Excel worksheet?\nTo remove filters from an Excel worksheet, click on the “Filter” button in the “Data” tab, and choose the “Clear” option. This will remove all filters from the worksheet. Alternatively, you can select the filtered data range, right-click on it, and choose the “Clear Filter” option.\nNick Bilton is a British-American journalist, author, and coder. He is currently a special correspondent at Vanity Fair.","Computers can perform repetitive tasks faster and with fewer mistakes than humans, so the first few years of computers being used in the business world were concentrated on automating a wide range of industrial processes.\nThe statistics speak for themselves: Worker productivity in the United States had been increasing at an annual rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent since the early 1970s, but the productivity rate started to increase dramatically in the mid-1990s, and averaged 2.9 percent from 1995 to 2000. Many economists, noted that this rise in productivity occurred during the same period when computers became common in workplaces, and credit computer-related information technology for the increase.\nWhy Ergonomics Matters\nErgonomics is a science that helps align products to users and jobs to workers. The word ergonomics comes from a combination of two Greek words: ergon, which means “work,” and nomos, which means “natural laws.” Sometimes ergonomics can be referred to as human engineering, biotechnology, or human factors.\nNot only does ergonomics cover items that improve working conditions, it also includes how the products you use in your daily life are designed. But ergonomics can refer not only to the way objects are designed, but also the way they are arranged for optimum use.\nIt’s easy to look at ergonomics as an expense rather than an investment. But think about it this way: many people choose a car for its safety features, believing those features are worth the cost of protecting themselves and their families. Businesses who purchase ergonomic products for their employees demonstrate their commitment to their health and well-being. More and more organizations are beginning to realize the importance of helping their people prevent injuries that can be more costly down the line, when weighed against the costs for sick time, short- or long-term disability, and insurance premiums.\nOne of the most important employee perks is workplace ergonomics, which fosters a safety and health culture as a core value. People recognize the value of walking into a safe workplace; with the knowledge that their employer wants to keep their team healthy, employees are likely to be happier at work. Reducing ergonomic problems leads to fewer sick days, fewer injuries, and can reduce long-term, cumulative issues that can shorten a worker’s career. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says office workers can help prevent back pain by standing at least once every hour to move around—at least stretch, if not walk around a little.\nErgonomics and Computer Workstations\nA lot of early ergonomics research was directed toward industrial professions. For example, the risks of musculoskeletal disorders for someone who operates a jackhammer may be high, that doesn’t negate the risk for office workers; however, risks to office workers wasn’t immediately recognized. In more recent years, experts have learned that ergonomic products are important in all types of workplaces.\nRepetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome can occur when workers are improperly positioned or uncomfortable while working. Musculoskeletal problems can occur in workers in all industries, from the assembly line to the office. And the latest research demonstrates that too much sitting can be detrimental to your overall health.\nMore and more companies are creating ergonomic products for the workplace, like electric adjustable desks and under-desk keyboard trays. These products can help you work more comfortably, which translates into working more safely. Improving your workstation’s ergonomics can help you improve your posture, which in turn helps reduce fatigue, stiffness, and soreness.\nWhether you want to modernize your home office or your workplace, ergonomic products are the way to go—especially electric height adjustable computer workstations. These desks not only have the latest features, they’re ergonomically friendly and will blend perfectly with your modern design."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f5f6ffa1-a3ed-40df-9418-8e35cf3b7a1c>","<urn:uuid:102397f4-0955-41cb-80e5-b678cb44e4a1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a pediatric physiotherapist, I'm curious about the relationship between growth plate injuries and pediatric flatfoot in terms of their treatment approaches. Can you compare the non-surgical treatment options for these two conditions?","answer":"The non-surgical treatment approaches for growth plate injuries and pediatric flatfoot share some similarities but have distinct elements. For growth plate injuries, treatment typically involves immobilization through casts or splints, limiting activity that puts pressure on the injured area, and applying ice. After healing, strengthening and range-of-motion exercises may be recommended. For pediatric flatfoot, non-surgical treatments include activity modifications to decrease pain-causing activities, custom orthotic devices to support foot structure, physical therapy with stretching exercises, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and inflammation, and shoe modifications. Both conditions may require long-term follow-up to monitor the child's progress, though growth plate injuries specifically need periodic X-rays at three- to six-month intervals for at least two years to ensure proper healing and growth.","context":["GROWTH PLATE INJURIES\nGrowth Plate Injuries\nWhat is the growth plate?\nThe growth plate, also known as the physis, is the area of developing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. When growth is complete-sometime during adolescence-the growth plates are replaced by solid bone.\nWho gets growth plate injuries?\nThese injuries occur in children and adolescents. The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton, weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons that connect bones to other bones and muscles. In a growing child, a serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage a growth plate than the ligaments that stabilize the joint. An injury that would cause a sprain in an adult can be a potentially serious growth plate injury in a young child.\nMost injuries to the growth plate are fractures. Growth plate fractures comprise 15 to 30 percent of all childhood fractures. They occur twice as often in boys as in girls, with the greatest incidence among 14-year-old boys and 11- to 12-year-old girls. Older girls experience these fractures less often because their bodies mature at an earlier age than boys'. As a result, their bones finish growing sooner, and growth plates are replaced by stronger, solid bone.\nGrowth plate fractures occur most often in the long bones of the fingers (phalanges), followed by the outer bone of the forearm (radius) at the wrist. These injuries also occur frequently in the lower bones of the leg: the tibia and fibula. They can also occur in the upper leg bone (femur) or in the ankle, foot, or hip bone.\nWhat causes growth plate injuries?\nWhile growth plate injuries can be caused by an acute event, such as a fall or a blow to the body, they can also result from overuse. For example, a gymnast who practices for hours on the uneven bars, a long-distance runner, or a baseball pitcher perfecting his curve ball can all have growth plate injuries.\nIn one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while running or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for only a small percentage of fractures.\nWhether an injury is acute or due to overuse, a child who has pain that persists or affects athletic performance or the ability to move or put pressure on a limb should be examined by a doctor. A child should never be allowed or expected to \"work through the pain.\"\nHow to prevent sports injuries*\n- Be in proper physical condition to play a sport.\n- Know and abide by the rules of the sport.\n- Wear appropriate protective gear (for example, shin guards for soccer, a hard-shell helmet when facing a baseball pitcher, a helmet and body padding for ice hockey).\n- Know how to use athletic equipment (for example, correctly adjust the bindings on snow skis).\n- Always warm up before playing.\n- Avoid playing when very tired or in pain.\n* Reprinted from Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes, with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\nChildren who participate in athletic activity often experience some discomfort as their bones and muscles grow and they practice new movements. Some aches and pains can be expected, but a child's complaints always deserve careful attention. Some injuries, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage and interfere with proper physical growth.\nAlthough many growth plate injuries are caused by accidents that occur during play or athletic activity, growth plates are also susceptible to other types of injury, infection, and diseases that can alter their normal growth and development.\nAdditional reasons for growth plate injuries\nChild abuse can result in skeletal injuries. These more often occur in very young children, who still have years of bone growth ahead of them. One study reported that half of all fractures due to child abuse were found in children younger than age one, whereas only two percent of accidental fractures occurred in this age group.\n- Injury from cold or frostbite can also damage the growth plate in children and result in short, stubby fingers or premature degenerative arthritis.\n- Radiation, which is used to treat certain cancers in children, can damage the growth plate. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that chemotherapy given for childhood cancers may also negatively affect bone growth.\n- Children with certain neurological disorders that result in sensory deficit, muscular imbalance, or looseness in the ligaments are prone to growth plate fractures, especially at the ankle and knee. Similar types of injury are seen in children who are born with insensitivity to pain.\n- The growth plates are the site of many inherited disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes involved in skeletal formation, growth, and development. This new information is raising hopes for improving treatment of children who are born with poorly formed or improperly functioning growth plates.\nSigns that require a visit to the doctor*\n- Inability to play following an acute or sudden injury.\n- Decreased ability to play because of long-term complications following an injury.\n- Visible deformity of the child's arms or legs.\n- Severe pain from acute injuries that prevent the use of an arm or leg.\n* Reprinted from Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\nHow are growth plate fractures diagnosed?\nAfter learning how the injury occurred and examining the child, the doctor will probably use X rays to determine the type of fracture and decide on a treatment plan. Because growth plates have not yet hardened into solid bone, they don't show on X rays. Instead, they appear as gaps between the shaft of a long bone, called the metaphysis, and the end of the bone, called the epiphysis. Because injuries to the growth plate may be hard to see on X ray, an X ray of the noninjured side of the body may be taken so the two sides can be compared. In some cases, other diagnostic tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound, will be used.\nSince the 1960's, the Salter-Harris classification, which divides most growth plate fractures into five categories based on the type of damage, has been the standard. The categories are as follows:\n* Adapted from Disorders and Injuries of the Musculoskeletal System, 3rd Edition, Robert B. Salter, Baltimore, Williams and Wilkins, 1999. Used with the author's permission.\nThe epiphysis is completely separated from the end of the bone, or the metaphysis. The vital portions of the growth plate remain attached to the epiphysis. Only rarely will the doctor have to put the fracture back into place, but all type I injuries generally require a cast to keep the fracture in place as it heals. Unless there is damage to the blood supply, the likelihood that the bone will grow normally is excellent.\nThis is the most common type of growth plate fracture. The epiphysis, together with the growth plate, is partially separated from the metaphysis, which is cracked. Unlike type I fractures, type II fractures typically have to be put back into place and immobilized for normal growth to continue. Because these fractures usually return to their normal shape during growth, sometimes the doctor does not have to manipulate this fracture back into position.\nThis fracture occurs only rarely, usually at the lower end of the tibia, one of the long bones of the lower leg. It happens when a fracture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery is sometimes necessary to restore the joint surface to normal. The outlook or prognosis for growth is good if the blood supply to the separated portion of the epiphysis is still intact, if the fracture is not displaced, and if a bridge of new bone has not formed at the site of the fracture.\nThis fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. Surgery is needed to restore the joint surface to normal and to perfectly align the growth plate. Unless perfect alignment is achieved and maintained during healing, prognosis for growth is poor. This injury occurs most commonly at the end of the humerus (the upper arm bone) near the elbow.\nThis uncommon injury occurs when the end of the bone is crushed and the growth plate is compressed. It is most likely to occur at the knee or ankle. Prognosis is poor, since premature stunting of growth is almost inevitable.\nA newer classification, called the Peterson classification, adds a type VI fracture, in which a portion of the epiphysis, growth plate, and metaphysis is missing. This usually occurs with an open wound or compound fracture, often involving lawnmowers, farm machinery, snowmobiles, or gunshot wounds. All type VI fractures require surgery, and most will require later reconstructive or corrective surgery. Bone growth is almost always stunted.\nWhat kind of doctor treats growth plate injuries?\nFor all but the simplest injuries, the doctor may recommend that the injury be treated by an orthopaedic surgeon, a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults. Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children.\nHow are growth plate injuries treated?\nAs indicated in the previous section, treatment depends on the type of fracture. Treatment, which should be started as soon as possible after injury, generally involves a mix of the following:\nImmobilization: The affected limb is often put in a cast or splint, and the child is told to limit any activity that puts pressure on the injured area. The doctor may also suggest that ice be applied to the area.\nManipulation or Surgery: In about one out of 10 cases, the doctor will have to put the bones or joints back in their correct positions, either by using his or her hands (called manipulation) or by performing surgery. After the procedure, the bone will be set in place so it can heal without moving. This is usually done with a cast that encloses the injured growth plate and the joints on both sides of it. The cast is left in place until the injury heals, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months for serious injuries. The need for manipulation or surgery depends on the location and extent of the injury, its effect on nearby nerves and blood vessels, and the child's age.\nStrengthening and Range-of-Motion Exercises: These treatments may also be recommended after the fracture is healed.\nLong-Term Followup: Long-term follow-up is usually necessary to monitor the child's recuperation and growth. Evaluation may include X rays of matching limbs at three- to six-month intervals for at least two years. Some fractures require periodic evaluations until the child's bones have finished growing. Sometimes a growth arrest line may appear as a marker of the injury. Continued bone growth away from that line may mean that there will not be a long-term problem, and the doctor may decide to stop following the patient.\nWhat is the prognosis for a child with a growth plate injury?\nMost growth plate fractures heal without any lasting harm. Whether long-term damage occurs depends on the following factors, in descending order of importance:\n- Severity of the injury. If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, a bony bridge is more likely to form and the risk of growth retardation is higher. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.\n- Age of the child. In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed.\n- Which growth plate is injured. Some growth plates are more responsible for extensive bone growth than others.\n- Type of growth plate fracture. The five fracture types are described in the section, How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed?\nThe treatment depends on the above factors and also bears on the prognosis.The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may be crooked.\nGrowth plate injuries at the knee are at greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth.\nWhat are researchers trying to learn about growth plate injuries?\nResearchers continue to develop methods to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of growth plate injuries and to improve patient outcomes. Examples of such work include\n- Removal of a growth-blocking \"bridge\" or bar of bone that can form across a growth plate following a fracture. After the bridge is removed, fat, cartilage, or other materials are inserted in its place to prevent the bridge from forming again.\n- Use of distraction osteogenesis, a procedure in which a bone that is prematurely shortened is surgically cut and gradually lengthened.\n- Development of methods to regenerate musculoskeletal tissue by using principles of tissue engineering.\nTo improve the early diagnosis of growth plate injuries, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculosketetal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is supporting a study to evaluate the use of MRI to visualize young bones and enable prompt, appropriate treatment. In May 1997, the NIAMS, together with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), and the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation, supported a conference on skeletal growth and development. The resulting publication, Skeletal Growth and Development: Clinical Issues and Basic Science Advances, can be obtained from the AAOS at the address listed below.The NIAMS is working with the NICHD, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to support a research initiative in the area of skeletal growth and development. The purpose of the initiative is to stimulate research to identify and understand the action of the genes that regulate skeletal development;\n- Evaluate factors that affect growth plate function;\n- Develop animal models to study disturbances in skeletal growth and development; and\n- Find new ways to correct musculoskeletal deformities.\nWhere can people find more information about growth plate injuries?American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons\n6300 North River Road\nRosemont, IL 60018-4262\nFax on Demand: 800/999-2939\nThe academy provides education and practice management services for orthopaedic surgeons and allied health professionals.

When this deformity occurs in children, it is referred to as “pediatric flatfoot,” a term that actually includes several types of flatfoot. Although there are differences between the various forms of flatfoot, they all share one characteristic — partial or total collapse of the arch.\nMost children with flatfoot have no symptoms, but some children have one or more symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they vary according to the type of flatfoot. Some signs and symptoms may include:\n- Pain, tenderness, or cramping in the foot, leg, and knee\n- Outward tilting of the heel\n- Awkwardness or changes in walking\n- Difficulty with shoes\n- Reduced energy when participating in physical activities\n- Voluntary withdrawal from physical activities\nFlatfoot can be apparent at birth or it may not show up until years later, depending on the type of flatfoot. Some forms of flatfoot occur in one foot only, while others may affect both feet.\nTypes of Pediatric Flatfoot\nVarious terms are used to describe the different types of flatfoot. For example, flatfoot is either asymptomatic (without symptoms) or symptomatic (with symptoms). As mentioned earlier, the majority of children with flatfoot have an asymptomatic condition.\nSymptomatic flatfoot is further described as being either flexible or rigid. “Flexible” means that the foot is flat when standing (weight-bearing), but the arch returns when not standing. “Rigid” means the arch is always stiff and flat, whether standing on the foot or not.\nSeveral types of flatfoot are categorized as rigid. The most common are:\n- Tarsal coalition. This is a congenital (existing at birth) condition. It involves an abnormal joining of two or more bones in the foot. Tarsal coalition may or may not produce pain. When pain does occur, it usually starts in preadolescence or adolescence.\n- Congenital vertical talus. Because of the foot’s rigid “rocker bottom” appearance that occurs with congenital vertical talus, this condition is apparent in the newborn. Symptoms begin at walking age, since it is difficult for the child to bear weight and wear shoes.\nThere are other types of pediatric flatfoot, such as those caused by injury or some diseases.\nIn diagnosing flatfoot, the foot and ankle surgeon examines the foot and observes how it looks when the child stands and sits. The surgeon also observes how the child walks and evaluates the range of motion of the foot. Because flatfoot is sometimes related to problems in the leg, the surgeon may also examine the knee and hip.\nX-rays are often taken to determine the severity of the deformity. Sometimes an MRI study, CT scan, and blood tests are ordered.\nTreatment: Non-surgical Approaches\nIf a child’s flatfoot is asymptomatic, treatment is often not required. Instead, the condition will be observed and re-evaluated periodically by the foot and ankle surgeon. Custom orthotic devices may be considered for some cases of asymptomatic flatfoot.\nIn symptomatic pediatric flatfoot, treatment is required. The foot and ankle surgeon may select one or more approaches, depending on the child’s particular case. Some examples of non-surgical options include:\n- Activity modifications. The child needs to temporarily decrease activities that bring pain as well as avoid prolonged walking or standing.\n- Orthotic devices. The foot and ankle surgeon can provide custom orthotic devices that fit inside the shoe to support the structure of the foot and improve function.\n- Physical therapy. Stretching exercises, supervised by the foot and ankle surgeon or a physical therapist, provide relief in some cases of flatfoot.\n- Medications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, may be recommended to help reduce pain and inflammation.\n- Shoe modifications. The foot and ankle surgeon will advise you on footwear characteristics that are important for the child with flatfoot.\nWhen Is Surgery Needed?\nIn some cases, surgery is necessary to relieve the symptoms and improve foot function. Foot and ankle surgeons perform a variety of techniques to treat the different types of pediatric flatfoot. The surgical procedure or combination of procedures selected for your child will depend on his or her particular type of flatfoot and degree of deformity.\nThis information has been prepared by the Consumer Education Committee of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons, a professional society of 5,700 podiatric foot and ankle surgeons. Members of the College are Doctors of Podiatric Medicine who have received additional training through surgical residency programs. The mission of the College is to promote superior care of foot and ankle surgical patients through education, research and the promotion of the highest professional standards.

{"question":"How do Datalab and Tech Mahindra's solutions help reduce environmental impact in agriculture?","answer":"Datalab's Pantheon Farming reduces environmental impact by optimizing spraying through meteorological and pest data analysis, potentially reducing sprays by half, and enabling efficient fertilizer use through soil nutrient analysis. It also promotes efficient raw material exchange and monitors phosphorus content in dung and feedstock. Tech Mahindra's Farm-to-Fork solution helps reduce environmental impact by preventing food waste through real-time monitoring of produce quality during transportation and enabling predictive corrective actions to avoid quality deterioration, addressing the global issue where up to one-third of all food is spoiled before consumption according to the FAO.","context":["The Slovene company Datalab has developed a modular IT farm optimization tool that allows the farmer to have all the necessary information always on what is going on in fields, in the stable, or in the orchard.\n\"Our key contribution to the circular economy in agriculture is to bring the information about all the processes within the farm into circulation, thus enabling the optimization of operations while at the same time significantly reducing the negative impacts on the environment.\" Said Andrej Mertelj, CEO of Datalab.\nComputerization and optimization of farms is possible and yields positive results in all segments: from optimization of spraying, drawing up a feeding plan, management of vineyards and cellars, optimization of utilization of working machines on large farms, design of crop rotation plans, etc. Pantheon Farming supports all these processes and more: the principles of a circular economy can be introduced with materials (eg nitrate cycle: cow-dung-field-food) as well as in processes, by creating information retrieval loops that enable the complete capture of data.\nA typical example is spraying, where in addition to the very needs of plants, the meteorology and quantity of pests are connected to the information loop, which enables the farmer, the fruit farmer or the wine grower to use the spray only when it is necessary. With such an approach, each farm, while optimizing its business, greatly reduces negative environmental impacts. The environmental aspect is one of the more important for the European Commission and is included in the package of measures for the circular economy, which was presented in December last year.\nIt is also very important that the farmer discerns whether the hectare yield under optimal conditions is really such that the cultivation of a particular plant on a given land under given conditions is economically justified.\nThe Pantheon Farming program promotes the introduction of the principles of circular economy, as it solves a whole range of problems that arise in the production of food and greatly burdens the environment.\n1. It promotes the efficient use and exchange of raw materials. Based on the data collected in the support system, a farmer calculates, in advance, how much feed or dung, and at what time intervals he needs it, how much he / she will produce and how much he / she can sell. Another farmer knows when to additionally buy feed or dung.\n2. Analyzing the phosphorus content in dung and feedstock growth increases the quality of the product, and thus the price of both. Not so long ago, this was not possible because there was no appropriate technology - especially sensors and traceability systems - and a system for collecting and processing all key data.\n3. The analysis of the current quantities of nutrients in the soil with the help of a mathematical model predicts how much fertilization and at what time intervals in concrete weather conditions is necessary for the plant to be optimally fertilized.\n4. The orchard module based on photographs of insect traps analyzes and determines whether insects are injurious insects and in which developmental phase they are. These results correlate with the weather forecast and warn when the crop protection in the form of spraying is needed and when not. In this way, the number of needed sprays can be reduced by half.\n5. A solution containing feeding plans in conjunction with feeding robots allows accurate monitoring of how feeding with a particular feed is reflected on the weight of the animal and whether \"only\" quantities of manure grow, which are, for example, also too rich in phosphates.\nIn Switzerland, the authorities implement a good policy example. Less than a farmer brings unnecessary phosphates into the field, the higher is the subsidy for agricultural land. Farmers decide therefore whether a greater quantity of crops resulting from more intensive fertilization really outweighs the deduction they receive at the expense of the land tax. In this way, in Switzerland, the fertilization of agricultural land has also been reduced by up to 30%, since the fertilization according to the principle \"better to be surely sufficiently fertilized\" is well known to have impact in the farmer's wallet.","The food ingredients of the average meal in the U.S. travels over 1,500 miles to get to a plate. RTInsights Editorial Director Suzanne Kattau discusses how real-time sensor technology helps shippers track that meal’s ingredients through each mile.\nThere are now real-time traceability and monitoring systems for agricultural products based on wireless sensor networks. GlobeRanger Corp. and Tech Mahindra Ltd. are two companies offering real-time, sensor-based systems for the food industry to track ingredients over many food miles.\nWhat is a food mile? A food mile is defined as the distance food travels from where it is grown or raised to where it is ultimately purchased by the consumer or end user, according to The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, a research and education center on the campus of Iowa State University. The food ingredients of the average meal in the U.S. travels over 1,500 miles to get to a plate according to “Food, Fuel, and Freeways: An Iowa perspective on how far food travels, fuel usage, and greenhouse gas emissions,” a report on a study conducted by Rich Pirog, Associate Director of the Leopold Center at the time.\nWhat’s more, the food industry can now optimize across the agricultural value chain the information to drive great decisions on-the-ground and in real-time, according to John Corbett, Ph.D., an agricultural climatologist and the cofounder and CEO of aWhere, Inc., a real-time Agricultural Intelligence (AI) software provider based in Broomfield, Colorado.\n“We now have the capacity to create a real-time, localized, agricultural production tracking and monitoring system—a food/nutrient security information system,” wrote Corbett in a World Bank blog post on May 26, 2015. “What Big Data does to optimize our morning commutes in cities can also be done to monitor agriculture.”\nGlobeRanger: Tracking Food in Real-Time\nGlobeRanger Corp., a Fujitsu company and provider of sensor-based solutions, says they have created “an information processing infrastructure at the edge of the enterprise” which enables companies to harness data that is generated “outside traditional IT environments to improve their business processes and move closer to being real-time organizations.”\nFounded in 1999, Texas-based GlobeRanger is helping to solve food-tracking problems within the food industry, in part, by monitoring real-time data about products, their environment and their movement. According to the company:\n“Within the food industry, GlobeRanger solutions provide real-time track and trace capabilities to enable food companies to monitor the complete harvest-to-market process. RFID-tagged harvest bins, pallets, shipping containers and any other types of containers are automatically tracked with fixed or handheld RFID readers and the data is collected by the iMotion system in real-time. This identification and tracking data can be enhanced with sensor input regarding temperature, sanitation, humidity, speed tilt, tampering and other criteria to provide comprehensive documentation of conditions.”\nOne key feature and/or benefit about GlobeRanger’s asset tracking solution is, according to the company, that it improves product environment integrity with real-time data. Users can monitor a product’s environment in real-time based on “user-defined rules concerning temperature, humidity, shock/shake and/or dwell time.” Users can also be automatically sent alerts “using customer preferred formats from email notifications to beeps and visual display.”\nTech Mahindra: From Farm to Fork in Real-Time\nDigital transformation, consulting and business re-engineering solutions provider Tech Mahindra offers “Farm-to-Fork,” an end-to-end supply chain visibility solution for fresh produce, meat and frozen foods, milk and dairy products, package foods, and beverages and confectioneries. Farm-to-Fork helps companies in the food industry transport produce and meat grown at farms hundreds of miles away and deliver it as fresh as if it were locally grown.\nTech Mahindra’s Farm-to-Fork service combines machine data with enterprise data “to orchestrate the supply chain” by improving visibility and enabling real-time decision making, which ensures that perishable items” freshness is maintained during the journey from farm to grocery store. According to the company,\n“the Farm-to-Fork service integrates the power of telematics, sensors and various telecommunications technologies to provide a comprehensive solution where mission-critical data is captured and sent to business analytics servers. The solution enables real-time alerts/notifications on threshold violations. It also monitors the real-time position of the vehicle. All of this ensures that quality of produce is monitored across its journey from the farm to the fork, and corrective actions are taken on a predictive basis to avoid quality deterioration. If and when quality deterioration occurs, the solution provides traceability and audit data that prevents the re-occurrence of such events.”\nWatch the video below for more information about Tech Mahindra’s Farm-to-Fork service:\nPutting It All into Perspective\nUp to one third of all food is spoiled or squandered before it is consumed by people according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “Food loss and food waste refer to the decrease of food in subsequent stages of the food supply chain intended for human consumption,” the FAO states on their website. “Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain, from initial production down to final household consumption. The decrease may be accidental or intentional, but ultimately leads to less food available for all.”\nThe Institute of Mechanical Engineers puts that figure higher, estimating that half of all food is wasted worldwide in their 2013 report, “Waste Not, Want Not.” With current practices “wasting up to 50 percent of all food produced,” the report states, “engineers need to act now and promote sustainable ways to reduce waste from the farm to the supermarket and to the consumer.”\nNow, real-time traceability and monitoring systems for agricultural products that are based on wireless sensor networks—like the ones offered by GlobeRanger, Tech Mahindra Ltd.—are in the position to help reduce the amount of food spoiled worldwide by helping the food industry track food in real-time, from the farm right to your breakfast, lunch or dinner plate.\nWant more on this topic?\nResearch from Gartner: Real-Time Analytics with the Internet of Things\nFrom the Center to the Edge: The IoT Decentralizes Computing\nFor Manufacturers, IoT Means the ‘Internet of Tools’\nBecoming an ‘Always On’ Smart Business\nLiked this article?

{"question":"How is bamboo being used as a sustainable alternative in modern construction across Southeast Asia?","answer":"Bamboo is growing in popularity as a construction material across Southeast Asia, particularly due to its availability and inherent strength. It comes from the grass family and is resistant to tensile stress, with a hollow stem (culm) that can bend extremely without breaking, making it superior to timber and comparable to steel. It has been successfully used in large structures like the award-winning Panyaden Bamboo Sports Hall in Chiang Mai. Bamboo strengthens local value chains in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, costs less than steel by weight, and can provide affordable infrastructure. While it has some weaknesses like vulnerability to fungus and swelling, these can be overcome with coating and treatments. The material can be used in both residential and commercial buildings as an accenting material or main structural component.","context":["The world has 11 years left, as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to beef up its efforts to reduce global temperatures before it crosses the threshold leading to climate catastrophe. While ASEAN countries have expressed their joint commitment through national pledges to take action and fight climate change, they are also focusing on developing their nations as well. GlobalData’s lead economist for Construction Industry, Danny Richards, said that construction output among ASEAN member states will grow six percent annually over the next five years.\nHowever, the building sector accounts for 39 percent of global carbon emissions, where 28 percent is from building operations (heating, cooling, lighting, etc.) and 11 percent is attributed to embodied-carbon emission which refers to carbon that is released during the construction process and material manufacturing. Cement and steel emit eight percent and nine percent, respectively of the total amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world.\nDirector of the World Green Building Council (World GBC), James Drinkwater, says that once a building of high-embodied-carbon emission is constructed, those emissions add to the total amount of carbon in the air. The construction sector can reduce carbon emission by using materials with low or no embodied carbon.\nArchitects too can play a part in this process with their creative designs. They can limit the environmental impact of the buildings they design by reducing GHG emissions. This can be done by innovating with technology and influencing the choice of materials used.\nBamboo as a mitigation strategy\nThe International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation (INBAR) suggests that bamboo can play a significant role in helping countries meet the United Nations’ (UN) sustainable development goals or SDGs and help combat the effects of climate change. Across Southeast Asia, bamboo architecture is growing in popularity and bamboo is fast becoming the material of choice for architects. Vo Trong Nghia, a Vietnamese architect has pledged to bring nature back into the urban environment through the use of sustainable materials, notably bamboo. Architecture is defining a new regional and local identity through projects using bamboo to demonstrate a sensitivity to the land, environment and culture.\nThe preference for bamboo is perhaps due to its availability and inherent strength. Bamboo comes from the botanical family of grasses that is resistant to tensile stress. The culm, a term for its thin and hollow stem and the tension resistant fibre within makes it easy to bend in extreme ways without breaking; making the material superior to timber and even comparable to steel. It grows faster than wood and under favourable conditions can have healthier, stronger and flexible culm. Though bamboo is designated as a material for low load bearing structures, it has the potential to replace steel in construction as evidenced by the construction of big span, multi-purpose halls and schools. In Chiang Mai, the Panyaden Bamboo Sports Hall has won multiple awards for the use of bamboo as a modern structural material.\nThe bamboo market strengthens local value chains in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. It also costs less than steel by weight and can provide affordable, resilient infrastructure to communities in the region.\nHowever, bamboo does have a few weaknesses including vulnerability to attacks by fungus, swelling and shrinking behaviour, all of which can be overcome with coating and treatments. Bamboo fibre can be extracted and combined with other materials to create a composite. It can also be used in residential and commercial buildings, as either an accenting material or main structural component. Unfortunately, in some countries like Malaysia, its usage in urban areas still proves to be a challenge as local building codes and standards do not recognise bamboo as a proper building material, especially with regards to fire safety.\nBamboo’s capacity to absorb carbon emission from the atmosphere makes it a viable material of choice to reduce global warming. Unfortunately, the construction industry currently prefers using glass, steel and stone for materials instead. In the few years left for mankind to slow down global warming, choosing sustainable alternatives for construction materials could be critical."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8eafab9f-73f8-4888-801f-910119a48f49>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Supreme Court's 1922 Simmons Co. v. Grier Bros. Co. case impact the interpretation of patent validity in pending litigation?","answer":"The Simmons case established that district courts must apply intervening legal developments affecting patent validity, even if an appeals court had previously decided the validity issue differently. The Supreme Court held that as long as a case was still pending and lacked a final decree that fully resolved all issues, intervening decisions affecting patent validity must be considered. This was because there can only be one final decree in a suit in equity, defined as one that completely adjudicates all merits with nothing left except execution.","context":["Re-exam result dooms Baxter\nFrom the beginning of FRESENIUS v. Baxter\nWhile the litigation was pending on remand, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) completed a reexamination of the ’434 patent and determined that all asserted claims were invalid. We affirmed the PTO’s determination in the reexamination proceeding, and our mandate issued. Meanwhile the district court entered judgment against Fresenius in the pending infringement proceedings. Both parties appealed. In light of the cancellation of the asserted claims of the ’434 patent, and the fact that the infringement suit remains pending before this court, Fresenius argues that Baxter no longer has a cause of action. We agree. We accordingly vacate the district court’s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss.\nThe legal issue before the CAFC:\nThe issue in this case is whether the cancellation of the asserted claims of the ’434 patent by the PTO, pursuant to the agency’s statutory reexamination authority, must be given effect in this pending infringement litigation.\nPart of the long history involved JMOL:\nHowever, in February of 2007 the district court granted Baxter’s motion for judgment as a matter of law (“JMOL”), finding that Fresenius had presented insufficient evidence to support the jury’s invalidity verdict, and that Fresenius had therefore not proven that the claims of the patents were invalid. Id. at *2, *8–13. In October of 2007, the district court proceeded to a jury trial on damages. The jury awarded $14.266 million to Baxter for infringement of the three asserted patents. In April of 2008, the district court entered a permanent injunction, which it stayed, and awarded Baxter ongoing post-verdict royalties on infringing machines and related disposables sold by Fresenius. Both parties appealed to this court.\nIn January of 2006, the PTO agreed that a substantial new question of patentability had been raised in light of new prior art, and granted the request for reexamination. The reexamination proceeded in parallel with the district court litigation. In December 2006, less than a year before the damages trial, the PTO examiner reached an initial determination that the claims would have been obvious. In December of 2007, the PTO examiner reached a final determination rejecting claims 26–31 of the ’434 patent. The examiner concluded, inter alia, that all structures required by claim 26, including the “means for delivering the dialysate,” were present in the prior art, and that the claim would have been obvious. See Ex parte Baxter Int’l, Inc., No. 2009-006493, 2010 WL 1048980, at *5–6, *8–9, *14 (B.P.A.I. Mar. 18, 2010). The examiner reached this conclusion by relying in part on Lichtenstein, a reference that was not before the PTO during the initial examination.3 The examiner also determined that claim 30 would have been obvious over a combination of refer- ences including Lichtenstein and Thompson. Like Lich- tenstein, Thompson was not before the PTO during the initial examination. Ex parte Baxter, 2010 WL 1048980, at *15, *17. Thus, as we stated in In re Baxter, “in this case, the patent examiner relied on new prior art that had not been raised [in the initial examination or] in the prior district court proceeding.” 678 F.3d at 1365.4\nIn March of 2010, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the examiner’s determination that the relevant claims would have been obvious in light of prior art overlooked in the initial examination, including Lichtenstein and Thompson. See Ex parte Baxter, 2010 WL 1048980. Baxter challenged the examiner’s analysis of the prior art, but as the Board noted, Baxter never argued in the reexamination proceeding that Lichtenstein failed to teach the “means for delivering the dialysate” required by claim 26, id. at *14, nor that Thompson failed to teach claim 30’s “means for delivering an anticoagu- lant,” id. at *15, even though those were the very elements of the claims that Baxter had successfully argued were missing from the prior art in the district court infringement litigation.\nBaxter wisely agrees that in general, when a claim is cancelled, the patentee loses any cause of action based on that claim, and any pending litigation in which the claims are asserted becomes moot. However, Baxter argues that the cancellation of the asserted claims cannot be given effect at this point in the present litigation, because the validity of the ’434 patent and Fresenius’ liability for infringement of that patent were conclusively decided in 2007. Baxter argues that the district court’s 2007 judgment is “final” and “binding” on the parties in this case, and therefore has res judicata effect within the pending litigation: “the liability determination and Past Damages Award are now final and Fresenius is precluded from relitigating those issues.” Appellee’s Br. 19.\nA 1922 case was invoked:\nNor does the existence of an interim appellate deci- sion on invalidity change the basic rule. The Supreme Court’s decision in Simmons Co. v. Grier Bros. Co., 258 U.S. 82 (1922), demonstrates that the district court must apply intervening legal developments affecting the as- serted patent’s validity, even if the court of appeals al- ready decided the validity issue the other way. There, the Third Circuit reversed a district court finding of infringe- ment. Id. at 84. The Third Circuit held that the patent- ee’s claim was invalid because it had been improperly broadened on reissue. Id. The appellate mandate in- structed the district court to modify its decree in accord- ance with the decision on appeal, and to award costs to the infringer. Id. The suit remained pending in the district court for an accounting of damages for unfair competition. While the case was pending, the Supreme Court held in another case involving the same patent, “in direct opposition to the decision of the [Third] Circuit,” that the reissued claim was not invalid, because it had not been broadened on reissue. Id. at 85. In light of this intervening decision, the district court vacated the inva- lidity judgment it had entered based on the Third Cir- cuit’s decision and awarded the patentee damages and an injunction. Id. at 86. But the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the intervening Supreme Court decision did not affect the patentee’s rights. Id. at 87. The Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit, holding that the Third Circuit had no basis for refusing to give effect to its inter-\nvening decision on the claim’s validity, because the appel- late mandate had not ended the case. Id. at 91. The Supreme Court explained,\n[t]he decree entered pursuant to the decision of the appellate court . . . evidenced a quasi- definitive decision adverse to plaintiffs, which, if nothing occurred to prevent, would in due course be carried into the final decree. But . . . there was nothing to take the case out of the ordinary rule that there can be but one final decree in a suit in equity.\nId. at 89. “[A] final decree [is] one that finally adjudicates upon the entire merits, leaving nothing further to be done except the execution of it.” Id. at 88. Because “[t]he suit was still pending . . . [i]t was eminently proper that the decree in the present suit should be made to conform to [the intervening Supreme Court] decision.” Id. at 91; see also Marconi Wireless Tel. Co. v. United States, 320 U.S. 1, 47–48 (1943) (“Although the interlocutory decision of [the trial court] on the question of validity and infringe- ment was appealable, . . . the decision was not final until the conclusion of the accounting. Hence the court did not lack power at any time prior to entry of its final judgment at the close of the accounting to reconsider any portion of its decision and reopen any part of the case.” (internal citations omitted)). Thus, in Simmons, even though there had been an appellate decision entirely resolving the patent infringement claims, because there had not yet been a final judgment on the unfair competition claims, the Supreme Court’s intervening decision was binding as to the infringement claims.\nAnother argument by Baxter:\nBaxter next argues that under Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995), allowing a PTO determination to control the outcome of pending litigation is unconstitutional, because it offends the separation of powers. But Plaut lends no support to such an assertion where, as here, the suit is not over and there has been no final judgment.\nPlaut thus recognized “[t]he general rule . . . that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,” Thorpe v. Hous. Auth. of the City of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 281 (1969), which is the principle that controls here.\nOur decisions giving effect to the PTO’s cancellation of claims asserted in pending suits are fully consistent with our duty to “apply the law in effect at the time [we] render[ a] decision.” Bradley, 416 U.S. at 711.\nOf Judge Newman's dissent:\nIn closing, it is appropriate to say a few words about the dissent, which reiterates a view, expressed by Judge Newman in various other cases, that PTO reexamination cannot affect pending infringement suits. The dissent candidly acknowledges that this position has been consistently rejected.\nThe outcome of the CAFC:\nIn light of the cancellation of Baxter’s remaining claims, Baxter no longer has a viable cause of action against Fresenius. Therefore, the pending litigation is moot. We vacate the district court’s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss.\nJudge Newman's dissent begins:\nThe court today authorizes the Patent and Trademark Office, an administrative agency within the Department of Commerce, to override and void the final judgment of a federal Article III Court of Appeals. The panel majority holds that the entirety of these judicial proceedings can be ignored and superseded by an executive agency’s later ruling.\nJudge Newman later observes:\nThe loser in this tactical game of commercial advantage and expensive harassment is the innovator and the public, for it is now notorious that any invention of commercial value is ripe for not only protracted litigation but consecutive reexamination until the patent falls, or the patent or the patentee expires.\nThe last words of the dissent:\nThe court’s ruling that PTO reexamination overrides the prior adjudication of patent validity is contrary to the legislative purposes of reexamination, offensive to princi- ples of litigation finality and repose, and violative of the Constitution. The judicial decision of patent validity is not available for review, revision, or annulment by the PTO. When the issue of patent validity has been litigated and finally decided in the courts, this binds not only other courts, the parties, and the public; it binds the other branches of government. From the court’s contrary decision, I respectfully dissent."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a28c3927-3054-4f64-acf5-ac1f19a60118>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain the standard progression of treatment levels for methamphetamine addiction recovery?","answer":"Treatment for methamphetamine addiction typically begins with a detox program under medical supervision. After detox, patients progress to a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), which involves treatment 5 days a week for 6 hours per day. Following PHP, patients move to either an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) or standard Outpatient Program (OP), where they attend treatment less frequently while learning skills to reenter society. These programs include individual therapy, group therapy, relapse prevention, and case management.","context":["How Methamphetamine Affects Your Brain and Body\nMethamphetamine, most commonly referred to as “meth,” is a highly addictive recreational drug that is abused by people of all ages.\nIt goes by many different street names, including ice, glass, crank, speed, and chalk. People with meth abuse issues often smoke, snort, or inject the drug intravenously. It usually comes in the form of small crystal-like rocks and can be blue or white in color.\nMeth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system. Because it’s so concentrated, meth users feel an immediate, long-lasting euphoric effect. Meth users often explain feeling more motivated, more confident, and even more intelligent when they’re high on the drug.\nHowever, meth use—short term or long term—can lead to extensive damage in the brain and body. In addition to the mental and physical effects, prolonged meth use can even increase a user’s risk for certain health conditions, like stroke, heart attack, HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis.\nStatistics on Meth Use\nOverdose is possible after a large dose of meth. In 2017, roughly 15% of all drug overdose deaths involved a substance in the methamphetamine category. Meth overdoses can be fatal because the drug affects the heart, brain, and other vital organs. Meth overdoses cannot be reversed with another substance like an opioid overdose can be.\nAlthough meth can be found in all parts of the country, it’s one of the only illegal drugs that has a strong regional concentration. Meth abuse is most often found in the western and midwestern states, including California, Nevada, Nebraska and Oklahoma. One survey found that over 70% of local law enforcement agencies from several pacific and west central regions said meth was the biggest drug threat to their area.\nIf you are considering treatment for yourself or a loved one, call us today.\nSymptoms of Meth Abuse\n- Rapid heart rate\n- High blood pressure\n- Frequent mood swings\n- Loss of appetite\n- Tremors or convulsions\n- Change in sleeping patterns\n- Significant weight loss\n- Erratic behavior\nUsing meth consistently also changes a person’s physical appearance. Some of the noticeable physical ailments include:\n- Skin sores\n- Tooth decay\n- Gum disease\n- Weight loss\n- Thinning/patchy hair\n- Dry/cracked skin\nThe physical symptoms of meth use are significant. However, meth also has a profound impact on the brain, which can lead to mental health disorders. Data shows that roughly 40% of adults who use amphetamines have a lifetime history of depression. Over 75% of meth users say they have symptoms of anxiety, and 46% of regular meth users report experiencing psychosis. Hallucinations, aggressiveness, and paranoia are also long-term side effects of meth.\nWithdrawal from Meth\nThe symptoms of meth use typically subside when the drug is fully out of the body.\nMany meth users also experience “tweaking” from time to time. Tweaking is essentially an episode where a person will feel intense cravings and feelings of extreme mental distress. Some users experience delusions, as well as severe depression and anxiety. Tweaking can be followed by crashing, where a person deals with even more significant mental health effects, as well as exhaustion and lack of appetite.\nEven one missed dose of meth can cause an addict to experience extreme physical and mental side effects. As a result, it’s recommended that meth addicts seek professional treatment when withdrawing from the drug. Many substance abuse recovery centers offer inpatient detox programs that are overseen by a medical professional. It’s never recommended for a meth addict to quit the drug cold turkey because of the life-threatening side effects.\nTreatment for Meth Addiction\nIt can be difficult to overcome meth addiction, but with the right treatment, many people make a full recovery. Most people with a severe meth addiction start treatment in a detox program, where they are treated by a medical professional. Doctors may administer mild stimulants to reduce physical side effects, or SSRIs to manage the person’s mental health symptoms.\nOnce the detox process is complete, recovering addicts move onto a partial hospitalization program (PHP), this is the highest level of outpatient care and can often be accompanied by a sober living home. In the PHP level of care clients attend treatment at the facility 5 days a week for 6 hours per day. These programs rely heavily on individual therapy, group therapy, accountability, health and nutrition, and relapse prevention. The next step is to enroll in an intensive outpatient program (IOP) or outpatient drug rehab program (OP) where recovering addicts learn the skills they need to reenter society. Continuing with individual and group therapies, relapse prevention, case management and more, clients attend treatment fewer days per week. IOP and OP treatment help bridge the gap between more intensive inpatient our PHP treatment and re-entering society independently. This phase is crucial in long-term recovery and success for many in recovery from methamphetamine addiction.\nAt Nexus Recovery, we treat individuals who have a history of meth addiction. Every treatment program is personalized to the individual client based on their unique needs. Our team is trained in a variety of therapy modalities, as well as holistic services, case management, and medication management, to treat the addiction from multiple angles.\nIn addition to partial hospitalization, we offer an intensive outpatient program, a standard outpatient program, and an aftercare program. Our facility also has gender-specific treatment programs that employ different treatment modalities for men and women. You can see what our past clients have said about their time at Nexus Recovery on our testimonials page.\nMethamphetamine addiction is a serious disorder, and it can be fatal if it goes untreated.

{"question":"Did Louis XIV influence both furniture and fashion design?","answer":"Yes, Louis XIV influenced both domains significantly. In fashion, he promoted French trade through textile production, formed a dressmakers' guild, and made France the leader in fashion by throwing lavish balls and attracting designers. In furniture, he commissioned highly ornate and dramatic pieces reflecting divine monarchy, with chairs featuring gilded finishes, high backs, and rigid construction that matched the grandeur of Versailles.","context":["17th Century Costumes and Fashion\nThe world of fashion has always had its influencers, people who set the style trends for the rest of society. Before there were Kardashians, there were royals and nobles whose taste and dress influenced not only the fashion of their eras but the looks to be found on modern runways. In the 17th century, these influencers included Elizabeth I, Henrietta Maria, Charles II, and Louis XIV.\nThe first half of the 17th century saw looks very similar to the fashions of the century before. In accordance with the stiffness and formality of the Elizabethan court, many of the fashions of the time were padded and rigid. This trend continued into the beginning of the 1600s, featuring high collars, low waistlines, and tight, constrictive corsets for the ladies. This lasted until the reign of Charles I and his marriage to Henrietta Maria of France.\nHenrietta Maria was a child of Europe, with heritage and lineage from all over the continent. Aside from being the sister of Louis the XIII and aunt of Louis XIV as well as a princess in her own right, she also had lineage from the Medici family of Florentine fame. Her social status and her association with patronage of the arts put her in the path of trendsetting fashion, and she became an influencer herself. The influence of Elizabethan fashion is present in the overall look of the time, but the stiffness disappeared with the padding, and ease of movement became more important in the construction of clothing patterns.\nHenrietta Maria was queen of England until 1649, and her son, Charles II became king in 1660. He was a trendsetter himself, and he had a fast friendship with his equally regal cousin, Louis XIV, the Sun King. The two kings together set trends in men's fashion that are still followed today, including creating the concept of a complete suit of clothes, called \"en suite,\" from which we get the clothing term \"suit.\" Prior to this fashion innovation, most outfits were mix-and-match, with separate pieces being paired to make an outfit. Louis XIV introduced outfits in which the pieces were made to match, and Charles II took this to England with a new piece called a vest, forming the basis for what would evolve into modern men's suits.\nLouis XIV promoted fashion in a lot of ways because it was good for French trade. The French produced a lot of textiles, such as brocade and lace, and the Sun King even formed a dressmakers' guild, which attracted the most sought-after designers and tailors in France. He was known for throwing lavish balls, inviting nobles and royals from all across Europe and challenging them to show off their best fashions. Trade with the Far East brought new textiles as well, and France capitalized on this by becoming a major exporter of silk and other luxury fabrics. All of these efforts made France the leader in fashion in the latter half of the seventeenth century.\nIn England, Charles II was setting his own fashion trends, introducing the French styles and influencing the Catholic courtiers with their ornamented elegance. Decorations using lace and embroidery were often found in the clothing of this era. However, as much as Charles II was a trend-setter, he also set an anti-trend. Protestant factions looked upon all of this finery as an indulgence and developed styles that showcased the simplicity of what they considered to be a proper lifestyle. Nicknamed the Roundheads for their close-cropped haircuts and hats, they did not believe in excess. This is not to say they were not stylish in their own right, however. These cousins to the American Pilgrims showed their fashion sense through sleek cuts and stark lines, displaying through their style of dress the simple lifestyle they believed in. They nicknamed the styles of Charles I and II the \"cavalier\" style in an attempt to associate it with libertine behavior; this label endured despite its derision.\nIf Henrietta Maria, Louis XIV, and Charles II were the supermodels of their day, Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens was the era's most faithful paparazzo. A look at Rubens's portraits of the famous nobles and royals of the day displays many of the fashions that characterized the period. He painted notable figures including the Duke of Buckingham and Marie de Medici, and he earned a knighthood from Charles I. He also worked as a diplomat, work that put him at the forefront of European fashion in the Baroque era, preserving it for generations to come.\n- Dressing to Impress in the 17th Century\n- 17th Century Fashion Seen Today\n- Women's Fashion of the 17th Century\n- The King of Couture\n- Fashion, Court, and the World Turned Upside Down\n- Beaver Hats and 17th Century English Society\n- The Well-Dressed Elizabethan: Renaissance Fashions as Social Markers\n- Louis XIV's Use of Fashion to Control the Nobility and Express Power\n- Women's Clothing From 1700\n- Baroque Fashion: History, Style, and Characteristics","A quick scroll through a few of our favorite designer homes leaves no doubt as to the Louis chair’s enduring appeal. But trying to distinguish one type from another can send you spiraling down a Wikipedia rabbit hole.\nThat’s why we created this go-to guide: Breaking down the key features of each successive Louis style, it’s an easy reference whether you’re shopping for a new chair or simply curious about a piece you spot in the wild. While the nuances can be subtle (and since tastes have always evolved organically, many chairs feature elements of multiple styles), once you get the basics, you’ll be able to distinguish your XVs from your XVIs with ease.\nLouis XIV: The Royal Treatment\nThere’s a reason Louis XIV was known as the Sun King. The mastermind behind the gilded glory of Versailles, Louis XIV (whose long reign lasted from 1643 to 1715) felt that his surroundings should mirror the divine power of the monarchy itself. Artists and craftsmen followed suit, resulting in furnishings that were highly ornate, often gilded, and decidedly dramatic.\nTo spot a Louis XIV chair, look for:\n- Drama: Silhouettes are grand and thronelike, with high backs (often fully upholstered).\n- Heft: Legs feature H- or X-shape stretchers, resulting in a heavier look.\n- Rigidity: Armrests extend to the front edge of the seat, and seat backs are straight and upright.\nLouis XV: Comfortable Curves\nLouis XV’s reign, from 1715 to 1774, aligned with the Rococo period in European art and design, characterized by a love of organic motifs and intricate ornamentation. Chair styles loosened up accordingly, with an increase in curvilinear shapes and a new emphasis on comfort. It’s easy to picture one of these elegant pieces in the lavish rooms of Louis XV’s mistress Madame de Pompadour.\nTo spot a Louis XV chair, look for…\n- Sensuality: Seat backs are often rounded and feature curved wood frames, typically with carved decorations. Chair legs, set at an angle, are often cabriole, or S-shape.\n- Romance: Wooden chair frames often feature a gilded finish.\n- Comfort factor: Seat backs are angled for increased comfort. Armrests shorten in length, ending before the edge of the seat, to better accommodate the era’s full-skirted fashions.\nLouis XVI: Clean and Classic\nA reaction to the over-the-top ornamentation of the Louis XV era, design under Louis XVI (in power from 1774 to 1791, the start of the French Revolution) favored a clean and crisp aesthetic inspired by antiquity. Dubbed the goût grec, or “Greek taste,” this neoclassical style dictated decorative restraint and an emphasis on clear architectural forms.\nTo spot a Louis XVI chair, look for…\n- Restraint: Think clean lines, geometric shapes, and straight, columnlike legs. Chairs may feature round, rectangular, or shield-shape upholstered backs.\n- Classicism: Decorative carvings reflect classical motifs, including scrolls, fluting, and ribbon-twist details.\n- Clarity: Armrests once again meet the front edge of the seat, often ending in a graceful scroll.\nHow the Style Endures—and Evolves\nDesigners continue to look to all three Louis chair types for inspiration, incorporating antique pieces into contemporary spaces and putting fresh spins on new Louis-style pieces. For our own exclusive furniture collection, we reimagined a Louis XV armchair and a Louis XVI accent chair with painted finishes and unexpected upholstery, including glamorous leopard prints, colorful leathers, and lively florals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c4c4c6c1-b1cd-4f0b-a0f3-d4eebda6a6a9>","<urn:uuid:cce2e140-b946-4f5e-97ad-1ed410051af1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the differences between soil quality in tilled versus no-till agricultural fields?","answer":"Tilled soil becomes powdery brown dust that lacks biological activity and is easily eroded, while no-till soil is darker, coarser in texture, and full of beneficial organisms like worms and bacteria. No-till soil shows improved structure, better water infiltration, and maintains organic matter between plant lines. The soil in no-till fields becomes soft and friable, whereas tilled soil is prone to compaction and degradation. Under no-till practices with controlled traffic, soil condition remains excellent and yields can improve significantly - for example, sorghum yields increased from 3 to 7 tons per hectare over five years in one documented case.","context":["The planet is getting skinned.\nCall it the thin brown line. Dirt. On average, the planet is covered with little more than 3 feet of topsoil -- the shallow skin of nutrient-rich matter that sustains most of our food and appears to play a critical role in supporting life on Earth.\n\"We're losing more and more of it every day,\" said David Montgomery, a geologist at the University of Washington. \"The estimate is that we are now losing about 1 percent of our topsoil every year to erosion, most of this caused by agriculture.\"\n\"It's just crazy,\" fumed John Aeschliman, a fifth-generation farmer who grows wheat and other grains on the Palouse near the tiny town of Almota, just west of Pullman.\n\"We're tearing up the soil and watching tons of it wash away every year,\" Aeschliman said. He's one of a growing number of farmers trying to persuade others to adopt \"no-till\" methods, which involve not tilling the land between plantings, leaving crop stubble to reduce erosion and planting new seeds between the stubble rows.\nMontgomery has written a popular book, \"Dirt,\" to call public attention to what he believes is a neglected environmental catastrophe. A geomorphologist who studies how landscapes form, Montgomery describes modern agricultural practices as \"soil mining\" to emphasize that we are rapidly outstripping the Earth's natural rate of restoring topsoil.\n\"Globally, it's clear we are eroding soils at a rate much faster than they can form,\" said John Reganold, a soils scientist at Washington State University. \"It's hard to get people to pay much attention to this because, frankly, most of us take soil for granted.\"\nThe National Academy of Sciences has determined that cropland in the U.S. is being eroded at least 10 times faster than the time it takes for lost soil to be replaced.\nThe United Nations has warned of worldwide soil degradation -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where soil loss has contributed to the rapidly increasing number of malnourished people.\nHealthy topsoil is a biological matrix, a housing complex for an incredibly diverse community of organisms -- billions of beneficial microbes per handful, nitrogen-fixing fungi, nutrients and earthworms whose digestive tracts transform the fine grains of sterile rock and plant detritus into the fertile excrement that gave rise to the word itself (\"drit,\" in Old Norse).\nAs such, true living topsoil cannot be made overnight, Montgomery emphasized. Topsoil grows back at a rate of an inch or two over hundreds of years. Very slowly.\n\"Globally, it's pretty clear we're running out of dirt,\" Montgomery said.\nRon Myhrum, state soil scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's office in Spokane, agreed that global soil loss is a huge problem. But Myhrum said erosion rates in the Northwest region have improved recently because of better conservation farming practices, including federal payments to farmers to leave some natural ground cover in highly erodible areas.\n\"We don't have the kind of dust storms here we used to have,\" Myhrum said. \"What's more alarming to me than erosion is conversion of farmland to urban use.\"\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\nNever Miss a Beat.\nGet our best delivered to your inbox.\nThat is indeed another way to lose soil -- paving it over. Judy Herring, manager of King County's farmland preservation program, said the county has lost 60 percent of its farmland since the 1960s. In 1979, Herring said, voters approved a bond program that buys back farmland to protect it from development (and has done this for 13,200 acres so far).\nBut while some land is lost to development, pollution or changing weather patterns, Montgomery, Reganold and others say global soil loss is a crisis mostly rooted in agriculture.\n\"Erosion rates have improved here, but that doesn't mean they're good,\" Reganold said. Topsoil clearly is still being stripped off faster than it can be regenerated, he said.\nAeschliman, the Palouse farmer, a stocky and energetic man who doesn't seem to notice that he's in his 60s, stood on a dirt road looking at the difference between his land and that of a neighbor. Because most neighbors are relatives, he did not provide any names here.\n\"Just look at that!\" he bellowed, pointing to a series of water-carved cracks and gouges running down a recently tilled field of wheat. Every year, he said, these fields are tilled and the rains come, washing the soil down into the road so deep the county routinely has to dig it out. The rest of the soil runs off to the Snake River and, eventually, to the Pacific.\n\"Here, look at this stuff,\" Aeschliman said as he held up a handful of the fine brown silt that had eroded off his neighbor's (cousin's) hillside. \"Now, look over here.\"\nHe walked across the road to his no-till wheat field. Unlike the rolling hills of loose dirt on the tilled field, Aeschliman's field looks more like a shag rug, with its rows of dead wheat stubble. He reached down into the dirt and pulled out a coarsely textured, much darker clump of dirt, roots and debris.\n\"This soil is full of worms, bacteria and all sorts of life,\" Aeschliman said. \"And it stays put. That stuff over there (waving his thick hand back behind him) is just powder, brown dust. It's dead. There's no worms, no life in it.\"\nThirty years ago, Aeschliman was one of the first in the Palouse to grow his grains using no-till farming methods. He's an ardent no-till proselytizer today, but he didn't abandon tilling the fields based on some organic epiphany or desire to save the world.\n\"I just got tired of all the mud,\" Aeschliman said. The family home, built in the 1880s, sits at the base of a long drainage off the rolling wheat fields. Every spring, with the tilling and the rain, his home would be a foot deep in muddy runoff.\nNo-till farming could do a lot to reduce topsoil erosion, Reganold said, but it's not without its downsides. Switching to no-till farming requires heavy upfront investment and learning new techniques, he said, and also tends to depend more on herbicides because the weeds are no longer controllable by plowing them into the soil.\nOrganic farming methods also can reduce soil loss, Reganold said. He cited his own research, which has shown a marked increase in soil health, water retention and regrowth when organic methods are used rather than the traditional methods.\nA regional association of farmers and other proponents of no-till agriculture, also known as direct-seed farming, is holding its annual meeting in Kennewick next week. Aeschliman is one of the founders of the organization, the Pacific Northwest Direct Seed Association, and is happy to see that no-till farming is growing in popularity.\n\"It's both good for the soil and good for your pocketbook,\" he said.\nP-I reporter Tom Paulson can be reached at 206-448-8318 or firstname.lastname@example.org.\n© 1998-2008 Seattle Post-Intelligencer","View sectionsExpand all Collapse all\n1.

Description of the SLM Technology\n2.1 Short description of the Technology\nDefinition of the Technology:\nLarge-scale no-till grain production with permanent wheel tracks\ncommon to all on-farm equipment.\n2.2 Detailed description of the Technology\nThis controlled traffic, no-till farming system (CT/NT) is practiced on a 1,900 ha farm on the broad, almost flat Jandowae Plains in semi-arid Queensland, Australia. Principal soil types are vertisols, with some poorer areas where the sand content is greater, and these have a tendency to hard-set and crust. Over the past five years, the farm owner has changed the farming system completely from conventional farming to no-till with controlled traffic. Controlled traffic means permanent uncropped wheel tracks or ‘tramlines’: all equipment has 2 metre axles. The total farm machinery comprises a tractor, a spray rig and two 11 meter zero-till planter/fertilizer units; one each for wheat and sorghum sowing. The tramlines were laid out two years ago by a contractor using Geographical Positioning System (GPS).\nThe main technical objective was to eliminate soil compaction. The CT/NT combination ensures the land -between the tramlines - remains in excellent condition. There has been no ploughing or tillage at all in those 5 years. He practices a three year rotation between winter wheat, summer sorghum and fallow, but the system is not fixed: it depends very much on soil moisture status and thus on the rainfall (opportunity cropping). Generally in summer about one third is in summer sorghum and in winter about one third in winter wheat, the rest of the land is\nunder fallow. The one-year fallow is maintained through the use of herbicides sprayed onto the undisturbed residue from the previous crop. The system is designed for rain capture - to build up soil moisture stores in the fallow periods for subsequent crops - and for disease control (to ‘spell’ the land). During the cropping cycle, the key to his effective weed control system is ‘to get in early’ and ‘actively chase weeds’ through judicious spraying. The farm is now free of the locally common persistent weed Erigeron annuus. In the five years his sorghum yields have risen from 3 to 7 tons per hectares. Over the last three years the soil has improved, becoming soft, friable and moist between his plant lines. Infiltration has improved a lot and soil structure is now excellent.\nTractor use and overall fuel consumption has decreased to less than one quarter of that under conventional tillage. Correspondingly the workload is hugely reduced: from four men required under the conventional system for an equivalent area, the farmer is the sole operator, very occasionally assisted by his son, and a paid contractor for harvesting. He is so satisfied with the CT/NT system that he is attempting to purchase a nearby property to extend the area that he can farm using his current machinery.\n2.3 Photos of the Technology\n2.5 Country/ region/ locations where the Technology has been applied and which are covered by this assessment\nRegion/ State/ Province:\nJimbour (north of Dalby), Queensland\nSpecify the spread of the Technology:\n- evenly spread over an area\nIf the Technology is evenly spread over an area, specify area covered (in km2):\nIf precise area is not known, indicate approximate area covered:\n- 10-100 km2\n2.7 Introduction of the Technology\nSpecify how the Technology was introduced:\n- during experiments/ research\n3.

{"question":"What is the relationship between geographic labor mobility and social inequality, and how do family background and local labor markets impact earnings across different regions?","answer":"Geographic labor mobility and social inequality are closely interconnected. The Social Mobility Commission found that where someone grows up truly matters, with sons from disadvantaged families earning twice as much in high-mobility areas (over £20,000) compared to low-mobility areas (under £10,000). In areas with low social mobility, up to 33% of the earnings gap is driven by family background and local labor markets, beyond educational achievement. While geographic mobility can provide better allocation of labor supply and productivity by allowing workers to move where jobs are available, barriers to mobility can make macroeconomic policy less effective. Key factors affecting mobility include transportation options, standards of living, family circumstances, housing issues, and individual education levels. However, even when people obtain education, unless they move to areas with better prospects, it remains difficult to close the earnings gap, as deprived areas offer fewer professional and managerial roles. This creates a complex dynamic where both location and ability to relocate significantly impact economic opportunities and social mobility.","context":["In this article, Alexandra Sufit of the Social Mobility Commission discusses their new report, The Long Shadow of Deprivation: Differences in opportunities across England.\nA socially mobile country provides equal opportunities for everyone, irrespective of circumstances of birth.\nThe Social Mobility Commission’s previous work identified a series of ‘hot’ and ‘cold spots’ across England, reflecting varying prospects in terms of education and employment. What this research did not tell us was the degree to which the place you grow up has a lasting impact on your earnings in adult life.\nOur new report The Long Shadow of Deprivation: Differences in opportunities across England is the most detailed study of regional social mobility ever conducted in the UK.\nIt uses new data, never before available to researchers, to track the journey of all state-educated sons* in England, born 1986-1988. We follow them through their school journey, charting their transition into work under the strain of the 2008 recession and finish on a snapshot of their earnings aged 28.\n* We only tracked sons as it was not possible to provide reliable estimates for daughters, given that adult earnings measures cannot be adjusted for part-time work.\nThe report reveals stark inequalities and confirms what many of us have long suspected – that where you grow up truly does matter. Two sons from equally disadvantaged family backgrounds will earn very different amounts as adults, simply based on where they grew up.\n“These findings are very challenging” said Steven Cooper, interim co-chair of the Commission, “they tell a story of deep unfairness, determined by where you grow up. It is not a story of North versus South or urban versus rural; this is a story of local areas side by side with vastly different outcomes.”\nDepending on where they grew up, sons from disadvantaged families can earn twice as much as their counterparts in other areas of the country\nIn areas with the highest social mobility, they will, by age 28, earn more than twice (over £20,000) that of their counterparts who grew up in areas with the lowest mobility (under £10,000). Annual earnings for this group range from £6,900 (Chiltern) to £24,600 (Uttlesford).\nAlfie Casey who lives in Welwyn Hatfield, a local authority area with higher-than-average social mobility, says: “I still live at home with my parents, so I only pay a small amount for rent, and I have enough money to live on. We are a working-class family, but we have never been poor.”\nSocial mobility in England is a postcode lottery, with a deep gap in earnings between the sons from disadvantaged and affluent families.\nUnsurprisingly, there is an even wider pay gap between adults from affluent and disadvantaged families. At a national level, those from affluent backgrounds earn, on average, more than £27,000 a year – that is double the income of those from the most deprived families (c.£13,000 a year).\nThis gap also varies significantly across the country. The pay gap in the least socially mobile areas is 40% larger than in areas with high social mobility.\nWhat this shows us is that there is unequivocally a postcode lottery when it comes to social mobility across England.\nIn the most unequal areas of the country – namely those with the largest pay gap and the poorest social mobility – up to a third of the earnings gap is driven by family background and local labour markets, over and above education.\nEducation still matters. It remains the key driver of the gap in adult earnings between sons from disadvantaged and affluent families – but in parts of England where inequality is already less pronounced.\nAcross local authorities, education gaps between sons from poor and wealthy families explain, on average, around 80% of the gap in adult earnings. But in areas where existing inequalities are greater, education alone will not improve social mobility.\nWhat is clear is that disadvantaged sons earn less than those from privileged families because they have lower levels of educational attainment.\nThose from disadvantaged backgrounds perform less well at school and are less likely to attend university than their peers from wealthier backgrounds, despite growing up in the same area. But we have found compelling evidence that inequalities in adult earnings are also driven by factors outside education.\nThe missing piece of the jigsaw – family circumstances and the wider economy\nGaining an education and moving to another part of the country is not in itself enough to fix all the inequalities ingrained at birth, due to where a child is born. This tells a story of deep unfairness.\nEducation alone is not enough to get on in areas of low social mobility. For instance, in Bolton, an area that has been classed as a ‘cold spot’, only 56% of the pay gap can be explained by education. In the least socially mobile areas, relative educational performance explains only two-thirds of the adult pay gap. So what accounts for that remaining third?\nIn areas with low mobility, it is the lasting shadow of family circumstance – up to 33% of the pay gap is driven by family background, over and beyond educational achievement. And we see the lasting effect of family background on individuals with similar education levels. This is because deprived areas offer fewer opportunities in terms of the proportion of people holding professional and managerial roles, so even a university education is not the ‘fix all’.\nOur report Moving out to move on: Understanding the link between migration and disadvantageshowed that the there is a 33% differential in earnings for those who move areas; partly explained by the fact that movers tend to be more highly educated (56% have a degree). That is because those who stay behind may suffer from a lack of opportunities, remaining in areas that lack the economic infrastructure and offer fewer well-paid jobs.\nSo even with an education, unless an individual moves to an area that offers better prospects, it will be difficult for them to get on and close that earnings gap. However, there are still other factors at play.\nGoing back to our current report, we’d do well to remember that this cohort entered the labour market around the time of the ‘Great Recession’ of 2008. Previous research has shown that the most deprived are hardest hit in difficult labour markets – possibly because those from more affluent families are better placed to cope by moving away or take advantage of their family’s financial, social or cultural support to tap into the limited opportunities available.\nIf family background is indeed more important when there are limited labour market opportunities, COVID-19 threatens to further increase pay gaps between the poorest and most affluent families.\nThis does not bode well for ‘Generation COVID’, as young people entering the job market this year are likely to be particularly badly hit by the current economic crisis.\nAccording to a recent survey from the Sutton Trust almost half of current undergraduates believe the pandemic has had a negative effect on their chances of finding a job and 61% of employers offering work experience placements have had to cancel their schemes.\nSo how can we address these challenges and ‘level up’?\nSince labour markets play such a critical role, employers need to be part of the solution.\nLocation, location, location\nThe SMC would always encourage employers to expand the geographical diversity of their workforce by recruiting beyond their physical headquarters and setting up flexible working arrangements. This enables people to continue working in their local area, or from home, so that they don’t have to choose care duties or support networks over their career.\nThrough our research, we have identified the ‘coldest’ spots in the country – and this is a literal road map for employers, local authority leaders and government on where to target efforts. We are keen to help local leaders and employers to provide the right opportunities in the areas that need them most.\nOften people have good reasons not to want to leave their community (as highlighted in our Moving Out to Move On report), but forward-thinking employers can leverage the best talent by allowing them to stay in place.\nThe Civil Service itself has a role to play as a leading employer. In our 2020 monitoring report, we praised the civil service’s efforts to expand outside of London, but we also encouraged it to do more to target job opportunities in cold spots and ensure progression opportunities are available nation-wide.\nCreating a more level playing field\nSecondly, we need to look at equalising the opportunities available to young people.\nThose from less privileged backgrounds may lack the family connections or knowledge to help them gain good jobs. They may lack role models within their immediate network of friends and family or fully understand the differentials in income between different jobs or industries. This can leave young people from less privileged backgrounds with a smaller frame of reference.\nYet according to Accenture’s 2019 Getting to Equal report, an ‘innovation mindset’ is six times higher in the most-equal cultures. While inclusive teams create efficiencies – they make better business decisions 87% of the time and twice as fast.\nWe would also urge employers to carefully consider whether traditional qualifications are truly needed for a particular role. It may be possible to bypass GCSEs or A-levels for those working at a call centre, for instance. Life experience, motivation and determination may be all the skills required to succeed in certain roles, so where possible employers should try to open these up to a wider pool of talent.\nBuilding a strong outreach programme is a critical step in ensuring that, as an employer, you are reaching that talent. You can, for instance, move beyond the same-old places: target FE colleges and schools in social mobility ‘cold spots’ and use empowering language in job adverts, with a focus on potential rather than existing qualifications where possible.\nFor more practical measures, employers can visit the Toolkitsection of our microsite, which provides guidance on how to develop strong outreach, hiring and progression pathways in order to tap into the widest possible pool of talent available.\nOur key findings show that:\n- Social mobility in England is a postcode lottery, with large differences across areas in both the adult pay of disadvantaged adults and the size of the pay gap for those from deprived families, relative to those from affluent families.\n- Disadvantaged young adults in areas with high social mobility can earn twice as much as their counterparts in areas where it is low – over £20,000 compared with under £10,000.\n- Pay gaps between deprived and affluent adults in areas with low social mobility are 2.5 times larger than those in areas with high social mobility.\n- In areas of low social mobility, up to 33% of the pay gap is driven by family background and local market factors, over and beyond educational achievement.\n- Characteristics of the coldest spots: fewer professional and managerial occupations, fewer outstanding schools, higher levels of deprivation and moderate population density.\n Cloverpop, White Paper: Hacking Diversity with Inclusive Decision-Making","What is Geographical Labor Mobility?\nGeographical labor mobility refers to the level of flexibility and freedom that workers have to move from one region or locale to another in order to find gainful employment in their field.\n- Geographic labor mobility refers to the ability of workers within a specific economy to relocate in order to find new or better employment.\n- Workers' mobility is determined by several factors, from transportation options to standards of living and other government-related policies.\n- The rate of geographic labor mobility within the United States has been consistently declining since the 1980s.\nUnderstanding Geographical Labor Mobility\nGeographic labor mobility refers to the ability of workers within a specific economy to relocate to find new or better employment. It can be compared to occupational labor mobility, which is workers' ability to change jobs or professions irrespective of geographical location. Geographical labor mobility can also be related to capital mobility or the mobility of economic goods.\nThere are several determinants of geographic labor mobility. The ease of movement and migration and the economic incentives to relocate are the main determinants of an economy’s fluidity of geographic labor mobility. Physical, geographic, and political barriers to movement are key factors that can make moving more difficult. At the economic level, a region's size, distance, and aggregate job opportunities determine the geographic labor mobility. At the personal level, however, determinants of the individual’s specific personal circumstances, such as family situation, housing issues, local infrastructure, and individual education affect geographic labor mobility. An economy's level of trade is also a direct factor in the geographic labor mobility of its workforce. For example, increasing the level of domestic and international trade requires that offices and other institutions be opened in various parts of a country, increasing job opportunities in these locations.\nOther Elements That Affect Geographic Mobility\nIn addition to the major root factors, there are other, specific key factors that can make geographic labor mobility more or less available. First, the aggregate level of education influences the mobility of the labor force, with a higher education generally resulting in greater ability to move in order to find employment.\nPersonal and cultural attitudes also drive labor mobility. For example, if an individual employee has no motivation to seek employment elsewhere, they will not, which results in low geographic labor mobility. Agricultural developments can also affect labor mobility as they drive people from densely populated areas to less-densely populated areas during busy seasonal periods.\nAnother key determinant is industrialization. Highly industrialized economies provide more blue collar job opportunities, which increases the labor mobility of the economy. More specifically, an industrialized economy helps workers move from rural locations to larger cities where there are more job opportunities.\nGovernment policies can also heavily influence geographic labor mobility. In global economic terms, the European Union actively tries to increase the geographic labor mobility of individuals by helping qualified workers find employment in other countries and cross national borders to spur individual, corporate, and national economic growth. If a government wants to increase geographic labor mobility, there are several actions it can take. The country can support transportation options, help raise the standard of living, and advance government policies that help with mobility within an economy.\nOne negative result of geographic labor mobility is the brain drain, or human capital flight, from developing regions and nations.\nPros and Cons of Geographic Labor Mobility\nGeographic labor mobility provides several benefits to a nation's economy. Chief among them is better allocation of the supply of labor and productivity. When workers can move to where the jobs are, more workers find employment and businesses can obtain the labor they need, where they need it. An economic study published in The Yale Law Journal in 2017 points out that geographic labor mobility makes managing macroeconomic stability easier and that local barriers to mobility can make macroeconomic policy less effective.\nOn the other hand, while geographic labor mobility is promoted as an ideal situation in blackboard economic models, it also has its downside. Labor mobility is associated with the dissolution of local communities and extinction of indigenous cultures as members migrate to seek economic opportunities and resettle in areas in which they are culturally alien. This tends to erode social capital in both the locations that workers leave and in new areas they move into. Geographic labor mobility is also the direct cause of the brain drain, or human capital flight, from developing regions and nations.\nGeographic Labor Mobility In the United States\nThe United States presents an interesting case study of geographic labor mobility during and after the development of economic systems.\nWhen the country was expanding westward and new industries were being developed, geographic labor mobility was at its peak as new migrants and the existing population moved to places with economic promise. However, it has declined consistently since the 1980s. According to U.S. Census data, the rate of movement between states has fallen by nearly half since 1989 while the rate of mobility between counties has declined by almost a third."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8de1c0f8-3d6a-4c3a-8438-e021757e8f42>","<urn:uuid:bd8cfd80-ae56-4ab4-afae-419be20defdb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the social benefits of football facilities in developing communities, and what safety concerns exist regarding the artificial turf materials used in such facilities?","answer":"Football facilities in developing communities offer multiple social benefits: they help youth address issues like children's rights, health promotion, peace promotion, and social integration. These facilities serve as community service points providing access to water, energy, technology, and sanitation, while supporting youth programs and health education. They can serve 250-300 children daily and help tackle issues like HIV/AIDS awareness. However, artificial turf surfaces used in these facilities raise safety concerns. The material contains potentially harmful chemicals including phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Studies have shown that repeated exposure to these chemicals could increase cancer risks and cause respiratory irritation, skin irritation, and eye irritation. Additionally, artificial turf puts additional stress on joints and heats up more than natural grass in the sun.","context":["The Beautiful Game - Social Change Through the Power of Football\nIn many parts of the world sporting activities, especially football, are now being incorporated into a variety of programmes geared toward helping youth address a broad range of issues affecting their lives. These include children's rights & education, health promotion, peace promotion, anti-discrimination & social integration, and the environment. By emphasizing a \"team\" approach, these programmes help impart the skills needed by the next generation to overcome the many challenges faced by their countries, from poverty to HIV/AIDS, malnutrition to low educational access.\nBy creating a space for gathering we can create social change through the power of football.\nYou are challenged to work in interdisciplinary design teams of five to develop an anchor within the lives of a community by designing a sustainable youth led football facility in a context where formal resources are severely constrained, and basic conditions for human development are challenged.\nAs a community service point this facility will bring in services often overlooked including access to water, energy/power, IT/technology and sanitation. The facility must also incorporate a structure to house existing youth programs and health education.\nMoreover you are tasked to create a holistic program that includes a new graphical identity for the team, including home and away strip. It is important that issues of HIV/AIDS awareness are incorporated into this as the client uses football to help tackle this pandemic in the areas’ youth. This new identity should be apart of an over all strategy to create a self-sustaining model that incorporates novel approaches to income generation.\nYou will have approximately 3 days to develop a conceptual design and sustainability plan that will be then presented to the clients. This project has a real client and real community. While the workshop is to try and push your boundaries of design, remember that for the end users a sustainable solution is the only solution to create long-term change.\nFinally remember the most important aspect of design, creating joy including your own.\nGrassroot Soccer (GRS), Zambia\nGRS was founded by professional football players as a project aimed at mobilising the global football community in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The organization trains local role models (including professional football players) to deliver an interactive, football-themed behaviour development curriculum to young people, who are then empowered as peer educators to teach the community at large what they have learned. GRS runs its flagship projects in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia and partners organizations in several other African countries.\nThe community centre and the small-size football pitch will serve an average of 250-300 (up to 1000) children and youth and a staff of 10 to 30 persons daily.\nTimeline for Construction:\n3 to 4 months\nTeams are challenged to design a small-size pitch (20m x 40m) with surrounding space for spectators (e.g. seating on elevated ground, etc.) as well as classrooms and media, health, conference and educational facilities that can offer young Africans the chance to further their scholastic and sporting education while providing health and social services. The centre will be located on the site of an existing local community partner, strengthening their activities in the community in order to improve basic education, prevent diseases and promote health as well as encourage the social integration of minorities and disadvantaged populations.\nYou are also charged to create a marketing and sustainability plan for the organization as well as updated graphical identity.\nTeams are challenged to incorporate the needs of the community and to employ sustainable and/or local building materials and construction methods to realize their design. There is the potential to create shared services to the community at large, including access to water, power and other support services.\nThe artificial turf for the football pitch will be freighted to the site in two standardized shipping containers and are free to be utilized in the design if the design teams so choose.\nPoints to be taken into consideration in the concept phase: future prospect of this centre, expanding in terms of capacity and infrastructure, creating a self-sustaining model for the host community group and becoming development hubs for the training of social entrepreneurs.\n- Size: Length 40 m and Width 20 m\n- Surface: artificial turf, green\n- Orientation: Preferred orientation of the field is with the goals facing N.N.W. and S.S.E.\n- Goal: Placed in the middle of the goal line; Width 3 m between the goalposts; 2 m height (between crossbar and the ground); Goal posts 8 cm; Nets, made of hemp, jute or nylon; Depth of the goal shall be at least 80 cm at the top and 1 m at ground level; Goal placed solid in the ground.\n- Boarding: Option between solid boarding or fence boarding. Approximately 1m high.\n- Classroom/Conference room (capacity:100)\n- Basic Health Care Facilities (capacity:100)\n- Internet Cafe\n- Common Space for larger gatherings\n- Office for staff members\n- Reception area\n- Two toilet blocks (boys and girls)\n- Rainwater catchment and management system\n- Grandstand style seating around pitch (e.g. seating on elevated ground)\n- Entrance Area and perimeter fencing\n- Parking (for 3-5 vehicles inc. 2 mini-bus/vans)\n- Integration in the local landscape requested\n- Use of local materials and local community involvement requested\nThe centre should be designed in a way that future expansion is possible. The idea is that the basic unit, as described above, develops over the years in regional development hubs/sustainable business. You are not limited to just a football centre but this will be the defining anchor of this project.\nTotal Construction Budget: USD 85,000\nSoccer Tournament During Workshop","By Nyedra W. Booker, PharmD, MPH and Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, PhD\nNational Center for Health Research\nIs your child playing on rubber instead of grass at the playground? The use of human-made surfaces on playgrounds has increased dramatically over the years. Developed during the 1960s primarily for athletic fields, these artificial surfaces were also part of a strategy to provide children with more opportunities for outdoor physical activity, particularly in the inner city where outdoor playgrounds were scarce.1 The first artificial turf (marketed as “Chemgrass”) was made of plastic, yet looked a lot like natural grass.\nAs its use for various sports activities increased significantly over the years, so did the concerns. Athletes began to complain that the surface was much harder than natural grass, as some studies also began to show that the use of artificial turf could increase the risk for football and other sports-related injuries. This prompted a ban on the use of artificial turf by the English Football Association in 1988, while many ballparks and professional sports stadiums in the United States began converting back to using natural grass during the 1990s. Over time, material such as rubber was added to keep the blades of “grass” in place and provide more cushioning.1 Artificial turf containing rubber and other cushioning materials is also believed to reduce sports-related injuries, but study results have been mixed.2 However, even with modern fields, many professional athletes dislike playing on artificial turf. It increases the severity of abrasions due to sliding, puts additional stress on joints, and heats up much more than grass does in the sun.3 Following their failure to force soccer’s international governing body (FIFA) to use sod instead of artificial turf for the 2015 Women’s World Cup, an international group of women players are suing the FIFA.4\nSome of the benefits of artificial turf are that it’s a long-lasting “all-weather” material that does not require a lot of maintenance or potentially dangerous pesticides. Artificial turf is currently used on more than 12,000 athletic fields in the U.S.5\nFrom the tire swings to play surfaces made from tires\nDo you remember when children used to play on tire swings in the backyard or at the park? Those same tires are now being put to a new and possibly hazardous use! Recycled rubber tires have become one of the top choice materials for surfacing children’s playgrounds. 6 In 2013, approximately 233 million scrap tires were generated, of which 8% (approximately 17.5 million tires) was processed for playground surface cover and 4% (almost 10 million tires) for sports surfaces. 7 Logically, tire scraps seemed like a surface that would be less likely to harm children if they fell. Recycling tires for use in playgrounds also keeps them out of landfills where they take up space, harbor rodents and other animals, and trap standing water that serve as breeding grounds for mosquitos and other disease-bearing insects. In addition, tires that have been thrown away can catch fire and that releases many different harmful chemicals into the air and ground water. 8\nThe tire material used on playgrounds can include the following:\n- Loose tire shred (rubber mulch) or “crumb” on a surface that can be raked.\n- Tire shreds that are combined with a binder and then poured onto a permanent surface\n- Tiles made from tire shreds and binder that have been factory-molded, then glued to a playground surface.6\nAre playground surfaces made with recycled tires safe?\nThere has been increasing evidence that raises concerns about the safety of recycled tire material used on playground surfaces. While tire rubber includes natural rubber from rubber trees, it also contains phthalates (chemicals that affect hormones, see Phthalates and Children’s Products), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other chemicals known or suspected to cause adverse health effects.9 PAHs, for example, are natural or human-made chemicals that are made when oil, gas, coal or garbage is burned. 10 According to the EPA, breathing air contaminated with PAHs may increase a person’s chance of developing cancer, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that PAHs may increase the risk for cancer and also increase the chances of birth defects.10, 11\nWhat the scientific studies say\nThe California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) conducted three laboratory studies in 2007 to investigate the potential health risks to children from playground surfaces made from recycled tires. One study evaluated the level of chemicals released that could cause harm to children after they have had contact with loose tire shreds, either by eating them or by touching them and then touching their mouth. The other two studies looked at the risk of injury from falls on playground surfaces made from recycled tires compared to wood chips, and whether recycled tire shreds could contaminate air or water.6\nIt would not be ethical to ask children to eat tire shreds, so the researchers created chemical solution that mimicked the conditions of a child’s stomach and placed 10 grams of tire shreds in it for 21 hours at a temperature of 37°C. Researchers then measured the level of released chemicals in the solution and compared them to levels EPA considered risky. The study also mimicked a child touching the tire shreds and then touching her mouth by wiping recycled tire playground surfaces and measuring chemical levels on the wipes. To evaluate skin contact alone, the researchers tested guinea pigs to see if rubber tire playground samples caused any health problems. This study assumed that children would be using the playground from the ages of 1 through 12. Results of the OEHHA studies showed that a single incident of eating or touching tire shreds would probably not harm a child’s health, but repeated or long-term exposure might. Five chemicals, including four PAHs, were found on wipe samples. One of the PAHs, “chrysene,” was higher than the risk level established by the OEHHA, and therefore, could possibly increase the chances of a child developing cancer.6\nOut of the 32 playgrounds surfaced in recycled tires that the researchers in California looked at, only 10 met that state’s 2007 standard for “head impact safety” to reduce brain injury and other serious harm in children who fall while playing. In contrast, all five surfaces made of wood chips met the safety standard.6\nA 2012 study analyzing rubber mulch taken from children’s playgrounds in Spain found harmful chemicals in all, often at high levels.9 Twenty-one samples were collected from 9 playgrounds in urban locations. The results showed that all samples contained at least one hazardous chemical, and most contained high concentrations of several PAHs. Several of the identified PAHs can be released into the air by heat, and when that happens children are likely to inhale them. While the heat needed to do this was very high in some cases (140 degrees Fahrenheit/ 60 ºC), many of the chemicals also became airborne at a much lower temperature of 77 ºF (25 ºC). The authors concluded that the use of rubber recycled tires on playgrounds “should be restricted or even prohibited in some cases.” 9\nA 2015 report analyzed the chemicals found in 5 samples of tire crumbs from 5 different companies that install school athletic fields, and 9 different samples taken from 9 different unopened bags of playground tire mulch. The researchers found 96 chemicals in the samples. A little under a half have never been studied for their health effects, therefore it is not known whether they are harmful. The other chemicals have been tested for health effects, but those tests were not thorough. Based on the studies that were done, 20% of the chemicals that had been tested probably can cause cancer, and a large proportion were irritants – substances cause a body’s reaction. 24% are respiratory irritants that can cause asthma symptoms; 37% can irritate skin; and 27% can irritate eyes. 12\nWhat the EPA has done\nThe EPA created a working group that collected and analyzed data from playgrounds and artificial turf fields that used recycled tire material. Samples were collected at six turf fields and two playgrounds in four study sites (Maryland, North Carolina, Georgia and Ohio). In a report released in 2009, the agency concluded that the level of chemicals monitored in the study and detected in the samples were “below levels of concern.” There were limitations to this study, however. The study did not measure the concentration of organic chemicals that are known to vaporize during summer heat (called SVOCs). SVOCs include PAH.\nDue to the small number of samples and sampling sites used, the EPA stated that it is not possible to know if these findings are typical of other playgrounds or fields until additional studies are conducted. 13 When announcing the results of the study, EPA joined other organizations in recommending that as a precaution, young children wash their hands frequently after playing outside.13\nA meeting was then convened by the EPA in 2010, bringing together various state and federal agencies to discuss safe levels of chemical exposure on playgrounds made from recycled tire rubber, and opportunities for additional research.13 In the case of PAHs, the EPA has concluded that while there are currently no human studies available to determine their effects at various levels, based on laboratory findings, “breathing PAHs and skin contact seem to be associated with cancer in humans.” 10\nIn February 2016, the U.S. government announced a new action plan to better understand the likely health risks of recycled tire crumb. This initiative involves 4 U.S. government agencies: the EPA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Consumer Product and Safety Commission (CPSC). By late 2016, they will release a draft report, even if studies are not yet completed 14\nHow to protect your children\nSo how can you protect your child at the playground? Remember that children are much more likely to be harmed by exposure to chemicals in their environment than adults because they are smaller (so the exposure is greater) and because their bodies are still developing. This is why it’s important to significantly reduce (or try to eliminate) any contact your child may have with substances that are known or suspected to be harmful. If you have more than one playground in your area, choose the one that doesn’t have a recycled rubber play surface.\nParents can actively persuade local officials that playgrounds should use wood chips rather than recycled rubber or other substances that are less safe when children fall, and more dangerous in terms of chemicals that they breathe or get on their hands.\nThe CDC, Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and EPA all recommend that you teach your child the importance of frequent hand washing, especially after playing outside and before eating.15 Also, if you notice any loose tire shreds or other debris on your child after being at the playground, remove his/her shoes and clothing before entering the home.16\nTo learn more about artificial turf and concerns about cancer risks for kids and young adults, watch this ESPN news video here.\nAll articles on our website have been approved by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and other senior staff.\nThis article was updated in 2016.\n- Claudio L.

{"question":"What role does divine authority play in establishing the legitimacy of medical practice in both the Hippocratic tradition and Ayurvedic medicine?","answer":"Both traditions root medical practice in divine authority, though in different ways. Ayurvedic medicine views Dhanvantari as a divine incarnation of Vishnu and the God of Medicine, with medical knowledge seen as divine wisdom passed down through tradition. The Hippocratic tradition similarly acknowledges transcendence as essential to medicine, with physicians being accountable to a higher authority. The original Hippocratic Oath begins with swearing by Apollo and other deities, while Ayurveda recognizes that divine help plus medicine are required for curing every disease. Both systems thus establish their legitimacy through divine sanction rather than purely human authority.","context":["Commonly worshipped as the Hindu God of Medicine, the Master of Universal Knowledge, Physician of Gods and the Guardian Deity of Hospitals, DHANVANTARI is regarded as the original exponent of Indian medical tradition called AYURVEDA, the ‘eternal science of life.’ This tradition is now accepted as the oldest, most original and unbroken medical system of the world.\nIn ancient Indian tradition there are several schools like those of ATHARVAN, ATREYA, CHARAKA, SUSHRUTA, BEHLA, AGNIVESA, PARASARA, HARITA, VAGBHATA and MADHAVA. Of these, the ‘Great Three’ or BRIHAT-TRAM are the works of CHARAKA, SUSHRUTA and VAGBHATA. Further there was the school of physicians headed by ATREYA and of the Rasa Siddha-s, by KASHYAPA.\nDHANVANTARI has many myths and legends woven around him. Normally shown as clad in bright yellow silk, He is depicted with four hands- the upper pair of hands carrying sankha and chakra, and the lower pair, a (golden) leech (jalookaa-medical term Hirudo Medicinalis) and kamandalu (pitcher) (sometimes shown as a blood letting bowl). Sometimes he is shown with the text of the upaveda, AYURVEDA and medicinal herbs. Sometime he is shown with a tulasi-seed garland around his neck and a plant-wreath halo. His complexion is blue, making Him another incarnation of VISHNU. Interestingly, the leech was part of the doctor’s kit in olden days since it was used to suck out impure blood from the patient‘s body. Even now, extract from its saliva is used to prevent clotting.\nWhat does the word Dhanvantari mean?\nThe word DHANVANTARI affords different interpretations:\n(a) The word dhanus is only indicative (upalakshna). It denotes the science of surgery. The one who has seen the end (anta) of it is DHANVANTARI.\n(b) The word dhanvan means a desert. (Compare RIGVEDA [V.36.1] dhanvachara meaning, he who moves in a desert). There is a mantra in the Veda: dhanvan iva prapaaasi (0 Lord! You are like the place where water is distributed to travellers in a desert.) Thus, DHANVANTARI the incarnation of Lord VISHNU with a pot of nectar in His hand is like prapaa (water spot) in the desert of worldly existence.\nThe RAMAYANA (Balakanda, Sarga 45) describes him as a divine being who emerged from the milky ocean after a churning of 1000 years. He carried a kamandalu (water pitcher) in one hand and a danda (staff) in the other.\nThe first Dhanvantari\nGods, repeatedly defeated and killed by their more powerful cousins, the demons, approached Lord VISHNU, seeking the boon of rejuvenation and the gift of immortality.\nHe then directed them to churn the primeval ocean in which were hidden the secrets of life and death.\nThe Gods sought the help of the demons, to whom they promised part of the spoil. With VASUKI as the rope and Mount MANDARA as the churning rod, they churned the ocean till it yielded several valuable things such as desire-yielding trees, a cow, the flying horse, the white elephant and nymphs, Moon and LAKSHMI. Finally came DHANVANTARI the divine physician, holding the pitcher of AMRITA the elixir of life that could bestow immortality.\nThe HARIVAMSA (ch. 29) describes him as prosperous-looking, and says that after emerging from the milky ocean, he stood worshipping Lord VISHNU. VISHNU named him ABJA. He then bowed down to VISHNU and said: “0 Lord, I am Your son. Allor a share of the sacrifices to me.” VISHNU replied: “Portions of sacrifices have already been allotted. Since you were born after the celestials, you cannot be considered as one of them. You will be born in the world of humans and then you will become a celebrity. In your second life, which will be in the DVAPARA YUGA, even from the time of your conception, you will have various occult powers. You will be born as god-incarnate. You will compose works on AYURVEDA which will be well known in all parts of the world.”\nDhanvantari is worshipped as the Hindu God of Medicine. He epitomlzes medical knowledgeAe is also regarded as the origlnal exponent of the Indian Medical Tradition, Ayutveda.\nIn the DVAPARA YUGA, there was a king called DHANVA in the family of the rulers of KASI. He did not have children for a long time. He performed penance and propitiated ABJA (another name for DHANVANTARI). Pleased by his austerities, ABJA was born as his son. DHANVA named him DHANVANTARI. DHANVANTARI taught AYURVEDA in parts, to eight disciples. To him were born KETUMAN, BHIMARATHA and DIVODASA.\nThere is a story in some purana-s connecting DHANVANTARI with PARIKSHIT, the grandson of the PANDAVA-S. When TAKSHAKA wanted to bite PARIKSHIT and kill him, a specialist in treating poisonous bites rushed to save the king. But TAKSHAKA bribed and sent him back. It is said that the doctor thus sent back was DHANVANTARI. But other references identify him with KASHYAPA.\nThe BRAHMA VAIVARTA PURANA (Krishnajanma Khanda) has an interesting story connecting DHANVANTARI with MAANASAA DEVI, a serpent Goddess. Once DHANVANTARI was going to KAILASA along with his disciples. On the way, TAKSHAKA hissed and spat venom. Irritated, one of the disciples of DHANVANTARI boldly plucked the diamond on the head of TAKSHAKA and threw it on the ground.\nHearing about this, VASUKI, the King of Serpents, threatened DHANVANTARI with thousands of serpents under the leadership of DRONA, PUNDARIKA and DHANANJAYA. The poisonous breath of these snakes made the disciples of DWANTARI swoon. However, DHA”TARI made all of them recover with a powerful medicine and in turn sent all the serpents to a swoon.\nWhen VASUKI came to know about this, he next sent the serpent-maid MAANASAA DEVI, a disciple of Lord SIVA, to face DHA”TARI. MAANASAA DEVI also made all the disciples of DHANVANTARI swoon. But DHANVANTARI proved more than a match for her. He brought back his disciples to normal with his powerful medicines. When MAANASAA DEW realized that she could not harm DHANVANTARI or his disciples with her poison, she took the trisula (trident) given by Lord SIVA and aimed it at DHANVANTARI. At this point, SIVA and BRAHMA appeared before them, pacified and sent them away.\nAccording to some other works, DHANVANTARI was born as DIVODASA, King of KASI. He became famous as KASIRAJA and composed many texts on AYURVEDA. Glorification of these works is to be found in the AGNI PURANA (chs. 279-288), and the works of KASIRAJA’S disciple, SUSHRUTA.\nThe BHAGAVATA PURANA refers to DHANVANTARI as “smritamaatra aartinaasanah” (One who destroys all sufferings even when remembered). DHANVANTARI, DIVODASA and KASIRAJA are names of the same person who is “the first God and who freed the other Gods from old age, disease and death”, and who in his Himalayan retreat taught surgery to SUSHRUTA and other sages.\nThe VISHNUDHARMOTTAKA PURANA (I. 73.41) which is a major text on iconography, suggests that, DHANVANTARI should be presented as surupa (handsome) and priya-darshana (pleasant in appearance), with two hands, carrying a pitcher of ambrosia in each hand. According to some dhyanasloka-s given in the PRAPANCHA-SARA-SANGRAHA DANVANTARI may be meditated upon as bathing Himself with nectar flowing from the two pots He holds over His head. This form is to be visualised as seated on the devotee’s head, or upon the lunar orb in the full-moon night. Yet another verse describes him as handsome (manoharaanga), with a tranquil face (prasanna-mukha) and residing in the solar orb (ravi-bimbastba.)\nDHANVANTARI’S appearance is celebrated each year on the 13th day (trayodasi) of the waxing moon a few days before the DIPAVALI.\nThe second Dhanvantari\nThere is an account of a second DHANVANTARI as AMRITACHARYA. He appears to be an eminent medical scientist born in the ambashtha caste. According to a work called the AMBASHTHACHARA CHANDRIKA, sage GALAVA once went to the forest to collect darbba grass and firewood. He walked for long and felt thirsty and hungry. He then saw a girl coming that way with water. She was a vaisya girl VIRABHADRAA by name. He quenched his thirst with the water given by her. Pleased with her, the sage blessed that she would get a noble son. The girl said she was still unmarried. GALAVA then made a figure of a male with dharbha grass and asked her to get a child from that figure. She got a beautiful baby boy. Since he was born to a vaisya mother and brahmin father (darbha-purusha created by the Brahmin GALAVA) he belonged to the ambashta caste. The boy was named AMRITACHARYA.\nDhanvantari and Kumbha Mela\nThere are episodes connecting DHANVANTARI with the KUMBHA MELA river festival, which takes place once in twelve years at four different places- HARIDVAR, ALLAHABAD, NASIK and UJJAIN. As DHANVANTARI emerged with the pot containing nectar in His palms, a great fight took place between the Gods and demons to wrest the pitcher from His hands. During the fierce battle that took place in the sky, a few drops of nectar fell in the four places referred to. Hence these places became sacred. KUMBHAMELA-S are held at these places to commemorate the divine event. Devotees throng to these places in tens of thousands to purify and rejuvenate themselves with the waters, which are supposed to have within them, the power of AMRITA.\nDHANVANTARI appears to have been an actual historical person, although his precise identity is hard to be ascertained. He taught surgery and other divisions of AYURVEDA (Indian system of medicine) at the instance of SUSHRUTA, to a group of sages among whom SUSHPUTA was the foremost. DHANVANTARI is regarded as the patron-god of all branches of medicine. While DHANVANTARI is not credited with any medical treatise of his own, in the early accounts, there is a voluminous glossary and materia medica known as DHANVANTARI NIGHANTU. Even as there is the HIPPOCRATES’ oath for allopathic doctors, so is there the DHANVANTARI oath for AYURVEDIC practitioners.\nThis work is considered the most ancient of all medical glossaries available. The original work is said to have been in three recensions and the present version may have been based on one of them. This text in six se.ctions deals with 373 medicinal substances, their names and synonyms and a brief description of their properties. Described as the ‘third eye’ for practising physicians, it is extensively relied upon, despite several more comprehensive glossaries that have been compiled subsequently.\nDhanvantari in the context of Allopathy\nModern scholars with a scientific bent of mind assume that Western Science in its modern phase is the paradigm for all forms of scientific knowledge. The native systems of medicine, in their opinion, are crude and unscientific. But if Science can be defined as the body of knowledge based on observation of phenomena under a theoretical framework, which itself is tested in observation, the system of AYURVEDA also has a claim to be called Science. In course of time it has been, and is being realized that there is a vast field for research and discovery in this ancient system of medicine. Texts on AYURVEDA lay great importance on empirid observation – collection of data on drugs, on pathological symptoms, and even on anatomy through dissection of corpses.\nThese texts mention drugs of vegetable, animal and mineral origin. The number of drug plants mentioned in the three SAMHITA-S (CHARAKA, SUSHRUTA and the text ASHTANGAHRIDAYA of VAGBHATA) is somewhere between 600 and 700 and the number of Sanskrit names (excluding their derivatives) of vegetable drugs is about 1900. These works do not discuss plants as such. They discuss, instead, the effects on our bodies of the different parts and products of the plants.\nSays the CHARAKA SAMHITA (Sutra Stbana, Ch. I, verses 72-73): “Roots, bark, pith, exudation, stalk, juice, sprouts, alkalis, milk, fruit, flower, ash, oils, thorns, leaves, buds, bulbs and off-shoots are the plant products now in medicine.” In ancient days they were doing trephining (making holes in the head), nose corrections and operative deliveries. In so far as the drugs of animal origin are concerned, the CHARAKASAMHITA done discusses 165 varieties of animals. It says (Sutra Sthana Ch, I, w. 68-69): “Honey, milk, bile, fat, marrow, blood, flesh, excrement, urine, skin, semen, bones, sinews, horns, nails, hooves, hair, gorocana – these are the substances used in medicine from the animal world.” Again, it mentions 64 main minerals used for drugs. This gives an idea Of the enormity of the pharmacopoeia On which AYURVEDIC medicine was based. About the respect for empirical observation of the AYURVEDIC physicians, CHARAKA (Virnaana Sthana, ch. 118, verse 14) says: “The entire world is the teacher for an intelligent physician, as it is the foe for a fool”. Both CHARAKA and SUSHRUTA declare that there is no substance in the world, which is not relevant for medicine.\nAYURVEDA has cure for several diseases for which there may not be a permanent cure in allopathy. It must be admitted that there is no dramatic and overnight cure in AYURVEDA. It works over a period of time; but it works. There are very effective thaila-s (oils), aasava-s (drugs), churna-s (powders) and vatika-s (pills/tablets) for different ailments. For instance, KSHEERABALAADI TAILAM is effective for paralysis, VASANTA KUSUMAKARAM for diabetes, ARJUNA (bark) for heart ailments, DRAKSHARISHTA\nand DASAMULARISHTA for colds and flues, NARAYANA TAILAM and MAHAMASHA TAILAM for rheumatism; RASNA (a herb) and MAHAYOGARAJA GUGGULU for joint pains, BHOOMYAMALAKI (juice extract) for jaundice (Hepatitis B); LASUNA – garlic (crude or caps) good for heart conditions and the control of cholesterol. Every part of the MARGOSA plant leaves/nuts/oil/shoots, is very effective in curing many an ailment. TULASI (basil) is a very powerful plant with rich medicinal properties. ALOE VERA (called KUMARIe)x tract is ideal for curing\nuterus problems, bleeding complaints, skin diseases and so on. There are several greens like kattali,pasala keerai, kuppameni keerai, agattikeerai, etc. which act very effectively against a number of diseases like herpis, allergy, kidney stones, cataract, toxins in the body, hair loss, etc.\nFor certain diseases, AYURVEDA preparations seem to be better. This is what many doctors practising allopathy also have realized. Of course there is also one section of allopaths, which does not recognize the soundness of other systems like AYURVEDA, UNANI and HOMEOPATHY. A good number of them, ofcourse, are recommending the use of AYURVEDIC medicines to their patients. They themselves are using AYURVEDIC medicines. It may be observed in conclusion that the various systems of medicine should work in collaboration to cure or relieve. There should be an open mind and a healthy respect to all systems. After all, many of our “grandmother‘s superstitions” are being found to have a scientific basis cloaked in mumbo-jumbo. We should never forget that divine help plus medicine are required for curing every disease. According to DAVID FRAWLEY (AYURVEDIC HEALING: 1989. Morson Publishing), “Within all of us is the archetype of the Divine Healer. This Divine Healer is the true healer in all beings, not any particular individual or special personality. To heal others or ourselves we must set it in motion within ourselves. DHANVANTARI represents this truth in the tradition of AYURVEDA. His status is found at most AYURVEDIC schools and clinics. It is a reminder that however much we know or skilful we become, everything still depends on the grace of spiritual nature.\nSri Nrisimha Priya","Definition of Hippocratic Medicine\nHippocratic Medicine has six primary requirements:\n- Transcendence essential to medicine\n- Physician & patient accountable to a higher authority\nMedicine as a Moral Activity\n- Medicine is a moral activity\n- Physicians help patients decide what they ‘ought’ to do\nLife Not Death\n- Physicians promise not to intentionally kill or do harm\n- Complete separation of killing and healing in society\n- Covenantal relationship between physician and patient\n- Professional relationship throughout illness until death\n- Informed by medical judgment, conscience and faith\n- Preserved by freedom to refuse harmful treatment\n- Moral consensus amongst like-minded practitioners\nHistory of the Oath of Hippocrates\nThe Hippocratic Oath was probably not penned by Hippocrates himself but, most likely, by a small collection of his students in the decades following his death. Nonetheless, the Oath named after him almost certainly represents the philosophy espoused by Hippocrates and by which he practiced medicine in his day. For the first time, this physicians’ Oath codified an ethical standard for the art, which, first of all, transcends the vicissitudes of societal law and, further, which specified a professional dedication to the sanctity of life and a trust-based relationship between doctors and their patients.\nFor 25 centuries, the Oath stood unamended and uncontested as the template for medical practice. Anthropologist Margaret Mead wrote:\nFor the first time in our tradition there was a complete separation between killing and curing. Throughout the primitive world, the doctor and the sorcerer tended to be the same person. He with power to kill had power to cure, including specially the undoing of his own killing activities. … With the Greeks, the distinction was made clear. One profession, the followers of Asclepius, were to be dedicated completely to life under all circumstances, regardless of rank, age, or intellect – the life of a slave, the life of the Emperor, the life of a foreign man, the life of a defective child. … [T]his is a priceless possession which we cannot afford to tarnish, but society always is attempting to make the physician into a killer – to kill the defective child at birth, to leave the sleeping pills beside the bed of the cancer patient. … [I]t is the duty of society to protect the physician from such requests. (Marker, 1991)\nThe importance of the immutability of this code of ethics cannot be overstated. The dangers of societal expectations, or even mandates, to violate that professional code are not merely hypothetical. After the second World War, it once again became necessary to codify professional conduct for physicians, but this time, in international law. Following the Nuremberg Trials and the “Subsequent Nuremburg Trials” of 1946-47 for Nazi doctors accused of crimes involving horrific examples of human experimentation, the Declaration of Geneva was adopted in 1948 by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association in Geneva. This declaration was a modern restatement of the tenets of the Hippocratic Oath which would forever prohibit the physician-perpetrated atrocities to humanity exposed among at least 20 Nazi doctors. These same atrocities were defended by the accused physicians based on their legality and by the mitigating circumstance that the doctors were operating under lawful orders of their superiors. The tribunal found the doctors guilty on the basis of violating a “higher law” than that of a nation. If such a professional code is not immutable, then these doctors were convicted unjustly. Clearly, by today’s standards, they would have been acquitted.\nSadly, this declaration has not been treated as immutable either, but has undergone a series of politically-correct amendments that considerably weaken it. For instance, the sanctity of human life has been obscured in the current form of the Declaration of Geneva. The following bracketed portion of the original provision was completely deleted in 2005:\nI will maintain the utmost respect for human life, [from the time of its conception, even under threat, I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity].\nDespite clear examples of the wisdom of- and necessity for the Oath, some of its basic tenets have come under fire in recent decades.\nVersions of the Hippocratic Oath\nIt should be instructive to compare this translation of the original Hippocratic Oath from the 4th Century BC, with the subsequent 1995 and 2009 revisions.\nOriginal Oath of Hippocrates\nI swear by Apollo, Physician and Aesclepius, Hygeia and Panacea and all the gods and goddesses, making them my witness, that I will fulfill according to my ability and judgement, this oath and this covenant:\nTo hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live in partnership to him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brother in male lineage and to teach them this art – if they deserve to learn it – without fee and covenant; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and taken an oath according to the medical law, but to no one else.\nI will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgement; I will keep them from harm and injustice.\nI will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.\nI will not use the knife, not even from sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favour of such men as are engaged in this work.\nWhatever house I visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves.\nWhatever I may see or hear in the course of the treatment or even outside the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself holding such things shameful to be spoken about.\nIf I fulfill this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honoured with fame among all men for all time to come. If I transgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.\nTranslated by J. Chadwick and W.N.

{"question":"As a demography researcher, I'd like to understand how immigration has impacted both European and U.S. population diversity. What are the current proportions of immigrant populations in these regions, and what are their projected future demographic changes?","answer":"In European countries, immigrants now make up around 10% or more of national populations, with the population of 'foreign origin' reaching about 20% by 2010. According to Eurostat projections, by 2061, 26.5% to 34.6% of the EU population would be of 'foreign background', with some countries like Belgium, Germany, Spain, and Austria potentially reaching around 50%. In the U.S., immigrants currently make up 14% of the population and are projected to reach a record 18% by 2065. Combined with their children, immigrants and their descendants will represent 36% of the U.S. population by 2065. The U.S. is projected to become a 'majority minority' nation by 2055, with whites making up less than 50% of the population. By 2065, the racial composition is projected to be 46% white, 24% Hispanic, 14% Asian, and 13% black.","context":["[Population Aging to 2030, Day 5, Essay 1 of 2]\nInternational migration is now the dominant driver of population increase in most Western European countries and in the English-speaking world, exceeding natural increase considerably and in some cases approaching the annual total addition to population from births. If current trends persist those populations will become “super diverse” with today’s ‘majority’ population no longer numerically dominant.\nFigure 1. Rate of natural change and rate of net migration, selected European countries, 2010\nBirth rates in developed countries are relatively low, equivalent to a family size (total fertility) of no more than two and much lower in some Southern and Eastern European countries. Population change is thus driven primarily by international migration, not natural change (the difference between the number of births and deaths). In some NW European countries population growth has been raised to levels not seen since the early 1970s (as in the US Australia and New Zealand). Rates of natural increase in European countries are nowhere over 0.4 per thousand; many are negative. Net immigration, however, approached 9 per thousand in some in 2010 (Figure 1).\nTable 1. Comparison between natural increase and net migration in selected European countries.\nIn some countries (Table 1) the annual contribution of migrants to population growth (net of emigration) has been almost as great as the annual number of births (Switzerland, Italy), including births to immigrants. But migration can swing from one extreme to another in times of economic crisis.\nThe cumulative effects of immigration since the 1960s have been to raise the proportion of immigrants in national populations from (usually) small single figures to around 10% or more (Table 2). The number of immigrants is often substantially greater than the number of foreigners in any given year. Some countries turn foreigners into citizens almost as fast as they arrive in (e.g. France and the Netherlands) through rapid naturalisation.\nTable 2. Number of foreign citizens and immigrants in selected European countries.\nDistinctive cultural patterns and needs, residential segregation and socio-economic and other forms of disadvantage have persisted among many immigrant populations. Accordingly, some countries estimate populations of foreign origin beyond the ‘first (immigrant)’ generation. Countries of the English – speaking world ask individuals to specify their ‘ethnic origin’ or ‘ancestry’ in census or survey questions. In continental European countries with population registers, parallel estimates are made through registration data on nationality and birthplace of individuals and of their parents. In the former, the ethnic ascriptions extend potentially over an unlimited number of generations. In the latter, the ‘third generation’ is assumed to have become ‘native’ (i.e. ‘Danish’, ‘Dutch’, etc.) and casino online disappears from statistical view. According to these estimates the population online pokies of ‘foreign origin’ or ‘foreign background’ had increased to about 20% of the national total by 2010.\nIn the US, the non-European racial diversity represented by the US black population was is not of recent immigrant origin. Usually the major national origin components – Moroccans, Turks, Somalis, etc. are projected separately, and broadly grouped into ‘Western’ or ‘High Human Development Index (HDI)’ (people mostly of European origin) or non-Western (people of non-European origin) from countries of middle or low HDI.\nFigure 2 shows an approximately linear increase of the minority groups to between 20% and over 30% of the national population by the end of the projection period (usually 2050 or 2060). The level of net migration is usually assumed to remain constant, given the difficulty of predicting migration. Those for Norway and The Netherlands are exceptions. In the UK, the favoured variant projection by Rees and his colleagues assumes that dgfev online casino return migration will increase pro rata with growing minority numbers, leading to markedly slower projected growth of the minority populations compared with the highest variant from this author. Later projections for Denmark and The Netherlands in the last decade indicate more modest minority growth than earlier ones, following reductions in immigration partly following restrictive policy initiatives.\nFigure 2. Projection of immigrant population by region.\nThe continuation of these trends online casino in low-fertility countries would eventually lead to the numerical eclipse of the former majority population, assuming that the defined groups remain discrete. The latest US projections assume that the US will become the first industrial country to have a ‘majority minority’ population in about 2043, although there the black population Whereas the opposition to Neptune suggests attraction to illicit drugs, it also heralds artistic talents, which are efficient because they are indefinable or even magnetic (Taurus- scorpio love horoscope axis). is not, for the most part, of recent immigrant origin. Excitable and unscientific projections apart, few projections of European populations have extended far enough into the future to reach a similar outcome. One projection for the UK (assuming the continuation of recent migration and fertility levels) indicates that all ethnic minority populations together would exceed the number of ‘White British’ at around 2070.\nA comprehensive analysis made on a common methodology for all the EU countries was published by Eurostat in 2010, on four different scenarios. The most conservative of these estimated that 26.5% of the EU population would be of ‘foreign background’ by 2061, the highest model being 34.6%. Among larger countries, the lowest estimate overall was for Bulgaria (7%); the highest for Belgium, Germany, Spain and Austria, all around 50%.\nHowever, 60 years is a long time in demography and these projections can only illustrate the consequences of specified assumptions. Migration can, and does, go down as well as up- notably in Germany, The Netherlands and Spain in the last few years, and recently from Mexico into the United States. Populations of mixed origins are increasing fast and will have a profound effect on the social scene and on concepts of ethic identity and categorisation.\nBut none of this is graven in stone. Most depends on migration rates. While their high level may seem inexorable, international migration is the most volatile of demographic components, subject to multiple economic and political uncertainties, and at least in theory subject to policy control. The magnitude of the challenges presented by these trends is very great – to society, national identity, domestic and foreign policy.\nDavid Coleman is Professor of Demography in the Department of Social Policy and Intervention at Oxford University.\nCaldwell, C.

Working Paper 10/02, School of Geography, University of Leeds. http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/wpapers","Modern Immigration Wave Brings 59 Million to U.S., Driving Population Growth and Change Through 2065\nChapter 2: Immigration’s Impact on Past and Future U.S. Population Change\nForeign-born Americans and their descendants have been the main driver of U.S. population growth, as well as of national racial and ethnic change, since passage of the 1965 law that rewrote national immigration policy. They also will be the central force in U.S. population growth and change over the next 50 years.\nAccording to new Pew Research Center projections, immigrants will make up a record 18% of the U.S. population in 2065, compared with 14% today and 5% in 1965. Immigrants and their children will represent 36% of the U.S. population in 2065, which equals or surpasses the peak levels last seen around the turn of the 20th century. That share will represent a doubling since 1965 (18%) and a notable rise from today’s 26%.\nThe arrival of new immigrants and the births of their children and grandchildren account for 55% of the U.S. population increase from 193 million in 1965 to 324 million today. The new Pew Research Center projections also show that the nation is projected to grow to 441 million in 2065 and that 88% of the increase is linked to future immigrants and their descendants.\nImmigration has had only a modest impact on the nation’s age structure, but a striking one on its racial and ethnic makeup.8 Without immigration since 1965, the U.S. today would have a median age of 41, not 38. The nation would be 75% white instead of 62%. Hispanics would be 8% of the population, not 18%. And Asians would be less than 1% of Americans, instead of 6%.\nImmigration’s Contribution to U.S. Population Size and Growth\nThe nation’s population grew by 131 million people from 1965 to 2015, and 72 million of them are linked to immigration—that is, they are immigrants who arrived during this period or they are their children or grandchildren.\nIf no immigrants had entered the country after 1965, when the U.S. population numbered 193 million, the nation’s population still would have grown—to 252 million people by 2015, rather than 324 million. The population would have grown by less than half as much as it actually did (30% vs. 67% growth).\nOver the next five decades, the U.S. immigrant population of 45 million is projected to grow to a record 78 million.9 The growth rate of 74% will be more than double that for the U.S.-born population (30%).\nForeign-born U.S. residents will make up 18% of the population by 2065, higher than the previous record share of nearly 15% during the late 19th- and early 20th-century wave of immigration. The U.S.-born children of immigrants—the second generation—will more than double in number by 2065, from 38 million to 81 million, and will become 18% of the total population.\nSince 1965, when the U.S. had 9.6 million immigrants, the total foreign-born population has more than quadrupled. The growth rate rose for each 10-year period from 1965 to 1995, peaking at 56% growth from 1985 to 1995. The volume of immigration grew from 1995 to 2005, though the growth rate of the foreign born decreased slightly (49%). From 2005 to 2015, the growth rate of the foreign born declined substantially, to 17%, largely because of a sharp drop in unauthorized immigration, especially from Mexico (Passel, Cohn and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2012).\nThe new Pew Research projections are calculated based on immigration rates, birth rates and death rates that are derived from past trends and assumptions about future patterns. Among the assumptions are that the current slowdown in immigration will last through the decade, but that growth will pick up somewhat after that. Fertility rates are not projected to rise, but rates will vary by group. Lifespans are projected to improve modestly.\nThese projections employ today’s racial categories. It should be noted that race and ethnicity are fluid concepts that can change through social consensus, personal self-identification or other means (Liebler et al., 2014; Pew Research Center, 2015b; Wang, 2015). For more details on assumptions and racial categories, see Appendix A: Methodology.\nThe immigrant population is expected to rise within a range of about 9% to 16% each decade from 2015 to 2065. By comparison, the overall U.S. population is projected to grow by 5% to 8% each decade.\nImmigrants contribute to population growth because of both their own numbers and their above-average fertility. Most of those who immigrate are working-age adults, so immigrants are more likely than U.S.-born residents to be in their child-bearing years. They also have higher age-adjusted birth rates than people born in the U.S. (Livingston and Cohn, 2012).\nImmigrants made up only 5% of the U.S. population in 1965, compared with 14% today. The second generation, the children of immigrants, represent about the same share of the population today (12%) as in 1965 (13%). However, as shown below, today’s children of immigrants are considerably younger than their counterparts in 1965, and they are less likely to be white.\nThe second generation, today representing 38 million children of immigrants, is projected to be a major force driving future population growth. The foreign-born population has grown more rapidly than the second generation over the past five decades, but the second generation is projected to grow at a faster pace over the next five decades. The number of second-generation Americans is projected to more than double by 2065, to 81 million, when they will slightly outnumber the 78 million foreign-born Americans.\nThe third-and-higher generations—those born in the U.S. to U.S.-born parents—will grow more slowly, by 17% over the next five decades. This group now makes up about three-quarters (74%) of the U.S. population, but it will decline to about two-thirds (64%) in 2065.\nPast Racial and Hispanic Change\nImmigration is the primary reason behind the striking growth in the nation’s Hispanic and Asian populations since passage of the 1965 immigration law that ended a visa system favoring Europe over other regions of the world. Immigrants and their descendants account for most growth in the Hispanic population (76%) and virtually all growth in the Asian population (98%) from 1965 to 2015.\nFive decades ago, the U.S. was a mainly (84%) white nation with an 11% black minority. Hispanics of all races made up 4% of the population, and other races made up the remaining 1%. All these groups grew in the ensuing 50 years, especially Hispanics, whose numbers grew sevenfold, and Asians, whose numbers rose more than thirteenfold.\nThe Hispanic share of the population more than quadrupled from 1965 to 2015, to 18%, and the Asian share more than quintupled, to 6%. The white share declined (to 62% in 2015), and the black share changed little (to 12% in 2015).\nThe Hispanic population, 8 million in 1965, is nearly 57 million in 2015. The Asian population, 1.3 million in 1965, grew to 18 million in 2015.\nThe white and black populations did not grow as sharply, and less than a third of growth for each race (29%) can be linked to immigration. The 1965 white population of nearly 162 million grew to 200 million in 2015. The black population, 21 million in 1965, increased to 40 million in 2015.\nLooking at immigrants’ total contribution to population growth, by racial and ethnic group, Hispanics and their descendants can be linked to 28% of the overall U.S. increase over the past five decades. Asian immigrants and their descendants contributed 13% of growth. White immigrants and their descendants accounted for 8%, and black immigrants and their descendants are linked to 4% of overall growth over the past five decades. An additional 45% of growth was not linked to immigration, but to births to people living in the U.S. in 1965 and their descendants.\nProjected Future Racial and Hispanic Change\nOver the next five decades, the majority of U.S. population growth is projected to be linked to new Asian immigration (35%) and new Hispanic immigration (25%). An additional 18% will be due to new white immigrants and their descendants, and 8% to black immigrants and their descendants.10 Only about 12% of projected growth is attributable to the population already in the country in 2015 and its descendants.\nDiffering growth rates of the nation’s racial and ethnic groups will reshape the U.S. demographic profile. By 2055, the United States will be a nation without a majority racial or ethnic group. The Hispanic and Asian populations will continue to grow more rapidly than whites and blacks. The white population, now 62% of the total, will decline to less than 50% sometime between 2050 and 2055.\nIn 2065, according to Pew Research projections, whites will make up 46% of the population and Hispanics 24%. Asians will be 14% of the total; after 2060, they are projected to surpass blacks, who will be 13% of the U.S. population.\nNearly all (97%) of the growth in the nation’s Asian population over the next five decades will be due to new immigrants, their children and grandchildren. Most growth will be due to immigration for Hispanics (57%) and blacks (61%). The white population, projected to rise by 1% from 2015 to 2065, would decline by 9% without new immigrants and their descendants.\nRace and Ethnicity Among Immigrants\nAmong immigrants, the white share of the foreign-born population will remain at a historic low over the next five decades. Based on Pew Research Center assumptions about immigration, fertility and mortality rates, Asians are projected to surpass Hispanics as the largest single group among the foreign-born population, beginning in 2055.\nIn 1965, most immigrants (80%) were white, but immigration over the subsequent five decades was dominated by Hispanics and Asians. In 2015, only 18% of immigrant population was white; in 2065, 20% are projected to be white. The Hispanic share of immigrants, now 47%, will decline to 31% as a growing share of Hispanic growth is fed by births in the U.S. and not new immigration. Asians, who surpassed Hispanics among new immigrants by 2011, are projected to rise to 38% of the immigrant population in 2065 from today’s 26%.11\nAsians will be a growing share of the second generation (26% in 2065), but Hispanics will remain the largest single group in the second generation (40%). In 2065, Hispanics will nearly triple their representation in the third-and-higher generation (18% from today’s 8%), but Asians will remain a small share (3%) of this group.\nThe combined share of immigrants and children of immigrants—sometimes called “immigrant stock”—varies widely among the nation’s major race and ethnic groups. The white and black shares are expected to rise over the next five decades, while the Hispanic and Asian shares will decline somewhat.\nIn 1965, nearly one-in-five whites (18%) were immigrants or the children of immigrants, which declined to 10% in 2015 but will rebound to 16% in 2065. Among blacks, only 1% were immigrants or the children of immigrants in 1965, which rose to 15% in 2015 and will go up to 27% in 2065. Among Hispanics, 38% were first or second generation in 1965, compared with 68% today and just over half (53%) in 2065, according to projections. Among Asians, 69% were first or second generation in 1965, 93% are today and 84% are projected to be in 2065.\nToday, Asians are the only major racial or ethnic group whose numbers are rising mainly because of immigration. Although immigration contributes to growth of the U.S. Hispanic population, births in the U.S. to Hispanic women are a more important contributor. Births overtook immigration as the main driver of Latino population growth after 2000 (Krogstad and Lopez, 2014).\nNearly two-thirds of the Asian population (64%) is foreign born, compared with 37% of U.S. Hispanics. About a quarter (23%) of the Hispanic population will be foreign born in 2065, and barely half (49%) of the Asian population will be immigrants.\nDue to a gradual increase in black immigration, 13% of blacks will be foreign born, compared with 9% today. The white population will have only an 8% share of immigrants, compared with 4% today.\nIn 1965, immigration rates had been low for several decades, so both immigrants and their U.S.-born children were considerably older than the U.S. population overall. The contrast is striking in terms of median age—the age at which half the population is older and half younger. For the U.S. population overall, in 1965, the year after the end of the post-World War II baby boom, the median age was 28.\nThe median age for immigrants was 56. The median age for the second generation, whose parents mainly came during the early 20th-century wave of immigration, was 45.\nBy 2015, the U.S. population was older, with a median age of 38, mainly because of the aging of the large Baby Boom generation. Had there been no immigration after 1965, the population would have been slightly older, with a median age of nearly 41. Today’s immigrant population is substantially younger than in 1965, with a median age of nearly 45.\nThe most striking change, though, is in the second generation. The children of immigrants today have a median age of 19, so they are about a quarter century younger than their counterparts in 1965 and are substantially younger than the overall population.\nThe U.S. median age is projected to rise steadily, reaching 42 in 2065. The median age of foreign-born Americans is projected to reach nearly 53, close to its level in 1965. The median age of the second generation will increase even more sharply, to 36, though this group is projected to remain slightly younger than the overall population. Over the next five decades, projected immigration would have the impact of keeping the median age of the overall population slightly lower than it would be otherwise, by 2.7 years.\n- As noted in the Note on Terminology, only non-Hispanics are included in estimates and projections for whites, blacks, Asians and other races.

{"question":"How does ancient pottery production continue in Avanos today, and what role does the Red River play in this traditional craft?","answer":"In Avanos, pottery production has been maintained since Hittite times (2000 BC), with some ancient techniques still in use today. The town is filled with family-run potteries where artisans create items ranging from simple ashtrays to ornate chess sets. The Kizilirmak (Red River) plays a crucial role by providing the red clay essential for pottery making. Visitors can observe demonstrations of traditional pottery-making using the kick-wheel technique and even try creating their own pots.","context":["DAY 1: ISTANBUL\nArrival in Istanbul, welcome & assistance at the airport and transfer to hotel. Free day.\nWe begin our tour from the Sultanahmet district, the heart of old Istanbul at Agia Sophia. Built by Emperor Justinian in the 6th century AD this church is one of the marvels of world architecture. Its massive dome dominates the skyline of old Istanbul. It is famed for its mosaics, including glittering portraits of emperors and empresses.\nNext, we visit the Blue Mosque, which owes its name to the exquisite tiles adorning its interior. Dating from the 17th century, it is the only imperial Mosque with six minarets. The Hippodrome, the stadium of ancient Byzantium, held 100.000 spectators and featured objects from all corners of the empire. After a lunch break, we continue our tour at Topkapi Palace which, from the 15th to 19th century, was the principal residence of the Ottoman Sultans.\nThe final visit will be to the Grand Bazaar which was the commercial heart of the old city and its 4.000 shops are full of treasures – including carpets and kilims, silks, jewellery, ceramics, icons and leather goods.\nWe will depart to visit City Walls. The first breach of the walls was by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the second by the cannons and troops of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror in 1453. Then you will go for Golden Horn. As a natural and extremely secure harbour, the Golden Horn has played an important role in the development of Istanbul. The inlet separates the European shore into two. It is approximately 8 km long, and the widest part is the entrance from the Bosphorus. Two streams drain into this inlet at its far end.\nThe next stop will be Spice Bazaar(Egyptian Bazaar). The air here is filled with the enticing aromas of cinnamon, caraway, saffron, mint, thyme and every other conceivable herb and spice.\nAfter that, you will go on a boat trip to the Bosphorus. A traditional excursion by boat along the waterway separating Europe and Asia. The shore is lined with old wooden villas, palaces of marble, fortresses, and small fishing villages. During the excursion, you will pass the magnificent Dolmabahce Palace, and further along, the parks and imperial pavilions of Yildiz Palace. On the coastal edge of this park, is Ciragan Palace, 300 meters of its marble facade faces the shore. At Ortakoy a great variety of artists gather every Sunday to display their work along the street. Ortakoy is a symbol of tolerance with a church, a mosque and a synagogue existing side by side for centuries. You will see Rumeli Fortress (from the sea, no interior visit). Built by Mehmet the Conqueror in 1452 prior to the conquest of Istanbul, was completed in only four months to control and protect Bosphorus. It is one of the most beautiful works of military architecture anywhere in the world.\nLunch at a local restaurant. Then we will go to Beylerbeyi Palace. The summer residence of Ottoman Sultans with its original furniture and magnificent gardens with the Harem on the Asian. Bosphorus Bridge is a unique chance to step from one continent (Asia) to another (Europe). After that Camlica Hill is the highest point in Istanbul. At the top of it, you can rest and admire the magnificent panorama of Istanbul and the Bosphorus from the beautiful gardens, landscaped in traditional style. Also, there is a possibility of shopping at Bedesten exhibits the traditional silk weaving girls at the carpet weaving courses authorized by the Ministry of National Education Possibility to see jewellery, handicrafts centre and leatherware show.

Upon your arrival, you will be met and transferred to your hotel. Dinner and overnight in Cappadocia.\nOur first real encounter with Cappadocia almost Martian landscape is in the Derwent valley. We visit Pasabag’s “fairy chimneys”, where the voice of the wind harmonizes with songs of the fairies. From here we pause at Avanos centre of terracotta art which is a popular destination because of its attractive old town with cobbled streets, and views over the river and is its production of earthenware pottery, it is also the most economic activity in the town. The ceramic trade in this district and its countless pottery factories date right back to the Hittites, and the ceramic clay from the red silt of the Kızılırmak has always been used. A visit to the ceramic & tile centre to see how the ceramics made by hand.\nAfter lunch, we visit the famous Goreme Open Air Museum to see the best examples of Byzantine art in Cappadocia. People of Goreme, at the heart of the Cappadocia Region, realized that these soft rocks could be easily carved out to form houses, churches, monasteries. These Christian sanctuaries contain many examples of Byzantine art from the post iconoclastic period. These frescoes are a unique artistic achievement from this period.\nYou visit a carpet cooperative, where you’ll see how exquisite Turkish carpets are hand-woven. We complete the tour with a panoramic view of the valleys of Cappadocia.\nDAY 6: CAPPADOCIA – ANTALYA\nAt the indicated time you will be transferred to the airport for your flight to Antalya.

The town is about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from Goreme. Avanos has a lively center with all the usual amenities including a modern, tourist-oriented hamam (Turkish Bath). A large travelling market visits Avanos on Fridays. We suggest a visit to Avanos for individual travelers on Fridays. This tented market has everything for the house, clothing, fruits and vegetables and more.\nStarting just outside the shopping center the old village of Avanos winds up the hills leading away from the town and is a beautiful maze of old stone houses, some restored, some converted and some sadly abandoned to their fate. In some of the abandoned houses the features of traditional Ottoman architecture can be seen along with ancient decorations, motifs and murals.\nThe Kizilirmak (red) river (ancient Halys river) is the longest river in Turkey and it does not only separate the town from other parts of Cappadocia, but also gives the supplies the clay for pottery. It is by this river that the red pottery clay is found from which Avanos derives its main livelihood and its foremost claim to fame. Pottery has been produced in the Avanos area for centuries and some of the techniques still used date back to Hittite times to 2000 BC. The Hittites named the town \"Zu Wanes\" and it became \"Venessa\" during the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.\nAvanos is a mass of family run potteries. These famous potters make wonderful souvenirs and are available at a wide range of prices from simple ashtrays and mugs to ornate plates and chess sets.\nAbout 14 kilometers (9 miles) from Avanos is the underground city of Ozkonak and the beautiful 13th century Seljuk caravanserai, Sarihan (where whirling dervishes ceremonies are performed each evening), is only about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the town center.\nOn one of our Cappadocia Tours, we will see the demonstration of pottery by kick-wheel technique. Our guests can also try to make a pot.\nPLACES TO VISIT IN CAPPADOCIAThere are so many fascinating things to see in Cappadocia that you could spend a lifetime here and still discover new places.

{"question":"How does proper compost pile location affect decomposition, and what are the ideal characteristics of finished compost for mushroom cultivation?","answer":"The location of a compost pile significantly affects decomposition - it should be level with good drainage to prevent water stagnation, and protected from extreme sun and wind while ensuring proper aeration. For mushroom cultivation specifically, the finished compost should be free from ammonia smell, maintain a temperature of 27-28°C, and have a nitrogen content that increases from 2.2 to 2.3, making it an ideal medium for white button mushroom growth.","context":["This post entitled ‘How to Prepare Compost for Button Mushroom: Method 02‘ is extension of previously published post, ‘How to Prepare Compost for Button Mushroom: Part 01?’.\nIn this post we are going to describe about the procedure of compost making for white button mushroom by Pasteurization Method. The previous method was ‘Preparation of Compost by Long Method‘.\n|2.||Preparation of Compost by Pasteurization Method|\n|3.||Things to Remember|\n|4.||Comparison Between Pasteurization Method and Long Method of Composting|\n|5.||Explanation of Post Related Words|\n|6.||Frequently Asked Questions|\n1. Brief Introduction\nButton mushroom is a species of mushroom. It is commonly known as white mushroom. Scientific name is Agaricus bisporus.\nCompost, for button mushroom, is any simple organic matter prepared by following standard procedure during ‘preparation of compost for button mushroom‘.\n2. Preparation of Compost by Pasteurization Method\n2.1 What is Pasteurization Method?\nThis is a popular method of compost making. In this method of compost making the composting materials are pasteurized using heat inside a chamber. This is an advance method of compositing in the production of white button mushroom. This method is completed in two steps:\n- Pre Pasteurization Stage\n- Pasteurization Stage\n2.2.1 Pre Pasteurization Stage\n- First, make an enough sized platform. It should be made of cement.\n- Cut the wheat straw to convert into small chaff.\n- Make 30 – 50 cm thik layer using wheat chaff.\n- Spray water on it.\n- Repeat ot for 3-4 days. Keep flipping the heap.\n- Add all materials with straw after the 4th day except gypsum.\n- This heap of straw is now turned up and down after each 2 days.\n- Gypsum is mixed after the third ‘turned over action’.\n- 7th day: Compost is transferred to pasteurization chamber.\n2.2.2 Pasteurization Stage\nIncreasing the temperature of the chamber\n- Temperature of Pasteurization Chamber: The temperature of pasteurization chamber is maintained at a desired level before transferring compost materials inside it. The temperature of the chamber is maintained at 45℃ by steam, using boilers.\n- Closing Pasteurization Chamber: Now pasteurization chamber is closed to make it heat resistant.\n- Starting Boiler: Boiler is started to provide heat inside chamber. After 2 – 3 hours, it starts to rise in temperature.\n- Stopping Boiler: Stop the boiler once the temperature inside the chamber riches to +50℃.\n- The materials are treated with the same temperature for the next 2-3 days.\n- Now rise the temperature of the chamber up to 58-60℃ for next 2-3 hours.\nDecreasing the temperature of the chamber\n- Opening windows of the chamber: Open any window of the chamber. It is done- 1. So fresh air can come inside the temperature. 2. Reduce the temperature of the chamber.\n- Now the temperature of the chamber starts to come down. It takes 12-15 hours to achieve temperature level between 40 – 45℃.\n- Closing Windows of the Chamber: Now the window of the chamber is closed. This temperature (40-45℃) is maintained for the next 2-3 days. It is necessary for the establishment of the compost.\n- Now, during this period the heat resistant bacteria convert these into organic materials using ammonia.\n- The quantity of nitrogen increases from 2.2 to 2.3.\n- Now it becomes an ideal media for the cultivation of white button mushroom.\n- When the compost reaches to an ambient temperature, it becomes ready to perform spawning.\n3. Things to Remember\n- Compost should be well prepared.\n- The compost should be free from the smell of ammonia.\n- The temperature of prepared compost should be 27-28℃.\n- 200 to 250 kg of compost can be prepared from 100 kg of husk after adding required materials.\n- Turning and Mixing (Applied for both the methods)….\n- First: 6th day.\n- Second: 10th day.\n- Third: 13th day.\n- Fourth: 16th day.\n- Fifth: 19th day.\n- Sixth: 22th day.\n- Seventh: 25th day.\n- Calcium carbonate is mixed during second turning.\n- Gypsum is mixed during third turning.\n- Binaula is mixed during fourth turning.\n- Malathion and me mahin are mixed during last turing operation.\n4. Comparison Between Pasteurization Method and Long Method of Composting\n15-20 kg of white button mushroom can obtained from 100 kg of compost just after 1.5 months. While, only 8-10 kg of white button mushroom can be obtained using long method of composting from 100 kg of compost.\n5. Explanation of Post Related Words\nPasteurization is a process in which food or other materials are treated with mild heat to eliminate pathogens. The required temperature is less than 100℃. The process will extend the shelf life of the material.\nHere, organic matters means- agriwastes.\nHere, chamber means- any special room selected for compostela making.\n6.

At a mature stage, the compost decomposes into a dark brown or black substance called humus that is well used as a soil conditioner and fertilizer. Adding compost to soil can help soil to drain or retain water, enrich the soil with nutrients, and introduce beneficial microorganisms. Composting also reduces the solid waste stream.\nCompost piles accelerate the natural rate of decomposition of organic materials by manipulating the waste to be especially conducive to consumption by microorganisms. This revolves around finding the proper ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the compost pile. Microbes need carbon from wastes such as leaves or wood for energy and nitrogen from green wastes for protein in order to thrive and grow. These microorganisms also need proper amounts of oxygen and water, so wastes added to the compost pile ought to be moist but not so wet as to block aeration. The pile should also be constructed so that oxygen can reach a large area of the pile.\nFactors that might seriously affect this balance, such as extreme rain, sun, or wind, can adversely impact decomposition. Picking the proper location for this pile is important in fostering a good balance for a compost pile. The location should be level and have good drainage to prevent too much water sitting stagnantly in the pile. Avoiding areas with exposure to too much sun or wind keeps the pile from drying out, but it is important to be careful of using trees as shelter because they may grow roots into the pile and use up the nutrients. Sheltering compost piles with trees can work nicely, however, if the pile is built on a stone or brick foundation, but not cement, as it prevents aeration.\nThe method of layering and constructing the pile determines how active or passive the pile is. Free compost piles kept in a yard will decompose at a slower rate and be ready in six to twelve months, whereas compost prepared in a bin takes about two months. Most compost piles are set up one part green waste two parts brown materials. In repetition, this can look like organic wastes on the first level, fertilizer or another type of high-heat, high-microbe starter on the second level, and soil on the third level. Wood chips, plants, ashes, hair, newspaper, manure, and many other materials are okay to compost, while coal ash, dairy products, pet waste, meats, pesticide-ridden or diseased plants, and fats and oils are not recommended.\nCompost piles have many environmental and practical benefits.

{"question":"I'm new to tobacco history - can you compare early Cuban cigar production with current Native American reservation tobacco policies?","answer":"Cuba began officially producing cigars in 1821 following King Ferdinand VII's decree, becoming known for making some of the best cigars in the world due to their long historical relationship with tobacco predating Columbus. In contrast, modern Native American reservations operate under tribal sovereignty, allowing them to create their own tobacco-related policies independent of federal regulations. Many tribes are now actively working to restrict commercial tobacco while preserving traditional tobacco practices - for example, several tribes have banned e-cigarettes and flavored vaping products, with the Oglala Sioux Tribe permanently banning all e-cigarettes on the Pine Ridge Reservation and others like the Muckleshoot Tribe banning flavored vaping products while raising the minimum legal sales age to 21.","context":["Long before Columbus landed in America, the Mayan Indians of Central America smoked tobacco for pleasure and as part of their religious rituals. Their word for smoking, sikar, would one day become the Spanish noun cigarro, from which we get cigar..\nOn October 28, 1492, Columbus arrived off the coast of Cuba, and once ashore, found the natives smoking tobacco in what was most likely rolled plant leaves. Over the next several years, Columbus and other explorers would gradually colonize the New World, and they discovered tribes from Mexico to North America also puffing away as part of daily life.\nThese explorers would bring tobacco back to the Old World, and smoking it soon became a pastime among the French, Spanish, Portuguese and eventually the British. It was the Spanish who, in keeping with the Taino Indians, first smoked what we know as cigars.\nBack in the New World, farmers found that demand for tobacco meant they could earn massive amounts of money by growing it, and plantations flourished from Virginia to the Caribbean.\nIn 1762, the British tried to wrest Cuba from the Spanish, and they failed. However, one of the invading soldiers, Israel Putnam, brought Cuban tobacco seed to New England, jump-starting the illustrious history of Connecticut-grown leaf.\nFollowing the American Revolution, dozens of cigar factories popped up in the newly formed United States, and by the 19th century cigars had become immensely popular. Icons such as Ulysses S. Grant identified themselves by their ever-present cigar and Mark Twain praised fine smokes in print.\nSome of the best cigars, however, came from Cuba, which after an 1821 decree by King Ferdinand VII began rolling its own cigars. The island’s close relationship with tobacco goes back to before Columbus, so it was only appropriate that, when Cuban revolutionary José Martí became desperate to throw off the Spanish yoke at the end of the 19th century, the order to attack was smuggled inside a cigar.\nThe world’s love of cigars continued strongly into the 20th century. The introduction of machine-made cigars in 1920 caused a precipitous fall in handmade production, which by 1950 had declined from 90 percent to 2 percent.\nCigar smoking in the U.S. saw another major change in early 1962 when President John F. Kennedy, one of the century’s most iconic smokers, imposed the embargo on Cuba, which was led by Fidel Castro–another famous puffer. Ever since Castro seized power in the 1959 revolution and embraced the Soviet Union as a sponsor, relations between the two countries soured to the verge of outright war.\nBefore Kennedy signed the order on February 7, however, he ordered his press secretary, Pierre Salinger, on a treasure hunt around Washington D.C. for every H. Upmann petit corona he could find. After Salinger rounded up 1,200 of them Kennedy put the embargo into effect.\nThe embargo has stayed in place to this day, sending U.S. citizens to History of Cigars discover smokes from the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, and other nations. Many of Cuba’s cigar makers, exiled by Castro, found their way to these countries, where they resumed their craft using their old skills.\nThe mid-1990s saw a resurgence in cigars, which in turn led to a collection of high- end cigar magazines hitting the nation’s newsstands, as well as other mainstream media attention.\nMix all of those factors together with a rise in the nation’s wealth, and voila! By 1997, over 400 million premium cigars were being imported into the United States. Across the Caribbean basin, hundreds of new cigar factories sprung up and began churning out their own labels, only to sink just as quickly.\nAs the market flooded with inferior product, sales figures for premium cigars went flat after 1998. But Consolidated Cigar, later to become Altadis U.S.A., had focused on quality and thus not only survived, but prospered despite the decline. There was a silver lining, though: those smokers who endured in their love of cigars did so with much more educated palates, and by 2007, imports had climbed again to nearly 300 million premium cigars.\nIf there’s one thing history has shown, it’s that the love of a good smoke endures above all.","Native Americans & POS Tobacco\nThe CDC reports that 43.8% of Native American (also known as First Nation or American Indian) adults have reported current use of commercial tobacco and have the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking among all racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. The leading cause of death for Natives are cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, both diseases proven to be related to the use of commercial tobacco products. There are disparities around smoking in many other communities as well, but the smoking disparities for Native Americans in one of the highest in the United States.\nA number of factors may contribute to this disparity. The tobacco industry has exploited Native American images, strategically and opportunistically taking advantage of a long history of some Native Tribes growing and using tobacco for their own sacred and medicinal purposes. The tobacco industry has used images representing Native cultures and bodies as a means of targeting Natives and other communities. The use of Native images on commercial tobacco products is a manipulation of a cultural history and practice for the sake of cigarette sales. It is common for cigarette brands to use stereotypical Native American images and motifs for branding and advertising, sometimes as a ploy to convince smokers that these cigarettes are more “natural” or health conscious. Research has found that Non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives are also more exposed to tobacco advertisements in stores than Non-Hispanic Whites. Learn more about product packaging and the use of exoticism in tobacco advertising, and listen to a podcast on tobacco industry misappropriation of American Indian culture and traditional tobacco.\nWhile commercial tobacco is readily available to Native Americans on and off of reservations, and needs to be addressed, strategies to address tobacco sales and use within Native American communities must be culturally aware and respect the historical and cultural practices of the tribes. Tribes are already very aware of the health and community impacts of commercial tobacco and have created campaigns, such as “Keep It Sacred” as a means of refocusing Native American tobacco use back to cultural tradition rather than deadly commercial tobacco use.\nWhat is Traditional Tobacco?\nNot all Native tribes have a cultural practice that involves the use of burning tobacco leaves, but in areas of the United States that have the warm and humid weather appropriate to growing tobacco, many Native Americans have traditions of using traditional tobacco in spiritual ceremonies, gift giving, medicine, and teachings. Many tribes continue to pass down teachings and stories about the origins of traditional tobacco and its religious significance.\nTobacco used by Natives in tradition is usually grown, cropped, and prepared very specifically for its purpose. Some tribes have special containers that hold the prepared tobacco until it is ready to use. When tobacco is ceremonially burned, the smoke is generally held in the mouth, and not inhaled into the lungs. Many tribes that burn tobacco believe that it carries their thoughts and prayers to their spiritual deities.3\nCommercial tobacco is not grown or prepared with the same intentions as traditional tobacco. Commercial tobacco is grown, prepared, and sold in mass quantities and include thousands of extra chemicals and substances including menthol and ammonia that are not present in traditional tobacco used by Natives. For more information on traditional tobacco and its use check out Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board’s report on Traditional Tobacco, and listed to this podcast on traditional vs. commercial tobacco from the National Native Network.\nReservations and Policy\nWhile not all Native Americans live on reservations, many do. Native reservations have treaties with the government giving them tribal sovereignty. Tribal Sovereignty allows tribes to control the laws and policies on the reservation without influence of the federal or state government. This means that the policy process may look different for each tribe, and it is important to use engagement strategies to partner with tribal leaders to best understand the process for a particular reservation.\nBecause of tribal sovereignty, many of the federal policies that restrict forms of predatory marketing and selling of commercial tobacco may not impact reservations, which may also give tribes the opportunity to create their own policies without being impacted by preemption.\nNative tribes are working towards decreasing the influence of commercial tobacco by emphasizing the cultural and historical significance of traditional tobacco and by creating policies around commercial tobacco. Tribes in Minnesota are working on tobacco control policies to create smoke free spaces and pow wows, offering cessation help in clinics, and offering monthly classes on how to grow and harvest traditional tobacco. Learn more about the strategies used by Minnesota tribes here.\nSeveral Tribes have taken action to restrict the sale of e-cigarettes, both in response to the outbreak of lung injuries associated with use of the products(EVALI) and in response to companies like JUUL pushing their products on the reservations. While some bans were temporary, others chose to enact permanent bans. For example:\n- In September 2019, the Oglala Sioux Tribe permanently banned all e-cigarettes on the Pine Ridge Reservation.\n- In October 2019, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribe banned the sale of all vaping products on Tribal land, and the Lac Courte Oreillles Tribe banned the sale of all vaping products in all tribal retail outlets.\n- In November 2019, the Muckleshoot Tribe banned the sale of flavored vaping products and raised the minimum legal sales age for all tobacco products to 21.\n- In December 2019, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe banned the sale and distribution of all flavored vaping products and raised the minimum age for vaping products to 21.\nNative community members can advocate to decrease the influence of the commercial tobacco industry on reservations and the Native community at large using point-of-sale policies such as price increases, minimum pack sizes, limiting retailers in close proximity to schools through licensing and zoning, and restricting flavored and menthol products.\nHowever, policies in areas surrounding Tribal lands may also impact use. Stores located within a 1-mile radius of Tribal lands in California were more likely to sell e-cigarettes, offer price promotions for cigarettes, sold significantly more flavored and total little cigars and cigarillos, displayed more of these items for less than $1, and were more likely to advertise price promotions on these products than stores located on Tribal lands.

{"question":"How do modern warehouses handle parts inspection and quality control workflow, and what are the key considerations in developing inspection specifications?","answer":"In modern warehouses like Siemens, items first go through quality assurance inspection upon receiving, where parts are checked before being moved via conveyor systems to their designated areas. The QA process includes dedicated inspection workstations for testing, with items being tracked through systems like SAP and barcode scanning. Regarding inspection specifications, Product Engineers must create detailed standards that address all potential failure modes to prevent product failures during warranty periods. These specifications need to cover both cosmetic and functional flaws, often requiring multiple revisions based on actual failure data. The specifications must define different inspection criteria for various regions of components while remaining practical for implementation, whether using human or automated inspection methods.","context":["Warehouse Automation: Siemens Sorts It Out\nSiemens sees labor cost and floor space savings, significant improvements in employee ergonomics and morale, and a fast return on investment from its new materials handling system.\nA s a leading supplier of postal and parcel solutions, Arlington, Texas-based Siemens operates one of the largest postal sortation equipment manufacturing plants in the world. The Infrastructure Logistics manufacturing site in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, handles postal sortation equipment parts, pieces, and installation kits, and holds the finished goods for shipment.\nWhen Siemens decided to improve receiving, quality assurance inspection, put-away, and picking at the plant's warehouse facility, it looked for third-party help. After a detailed selection process, it chose materials handling systems integrator Diamond Phoenix, Lewiston, Maine, and Richards-Wilcox, a manufacturer of overhead power and free conveyor systems based in Aurora, Ill., to handle the automation upgrade. Together, the companies analyzed the facility and designed an automation system that would increase overall efficiency and inventory control.\nThe system includes horizontal carousels, an overhead monorail conveyor, a roller conveyor, pallet rack, flowrack, and vacuum fluorescent display controller. It handles three types of Siemens warehouse products: small items in totes, regular 48-inch by 48-inch pallets, and oversized pallets.\nImplementing an automated tote conveyor and carousel system boosted productivity in handling small parts at the warehouse. Previously, warehouse workers picked parts using a paper-based method and placed the parts into totes that they often had to push across the floor to their destinations.\nSiemens wanted to keep these totes, but the model had been discontinued and the design mold had been sold off from the original vendor. Diamond Phoenix was able to research and track down the tote pan mold from an archive and had 1,000 new totes made for Siemens, keeping the operation uniform and consistent.\n\"We identify the old totes by the wear they sustained being pushed across the floor,\" says Michael Savoldi, manufacturing engineering manager for Siemens.\nItems are received through induction and placed into totes for quality assurance (QA). Once items are checked for quality, they are set on conveyors for the monorail to pick up and deliver to the appropriate warehouse area. Items can be moved to one of four places: horizontal carousel pods, kitting stations, shipping stations, or directly to manufacturing. Most of the items are sent to one of the three pods of horizontal carousels where they are stored until needed to fill production orders.\nOrders come into the warehouse from the manufacturing plant, located one-quarter mile from the warehouse, via SAP order. From there, orders move directly to the pick queue manager, who distributes them based on priority. An operator picks the material, places it in a tote, then marries the tote to the item when the SAP paperwork is scanned before it is placed on the conveyor. Diamond Phoenix software tracks the tote's location and the last place it was scanned on the overhead conveyor system.\nSiemens chose yellow monorail carriers and horizontal carousel totes because the color lifts worker's spirits and creates a pleasant working atmosphere.\nThe Richards-Wilcox overhead conveyor acts as a delivery device for totes. The conveyor maximizes floor space, using several elevation changes to clear equipment and machinery. Carriers have a 50-pound capacity and are spaced on eight-foot centers. Totes are loaded automatically onto the first available empty carrier at the four load points—QA plus each of the three carousel pods—and unloaded automatically based on the tote ID destination entered by Siemens.\nThere is no need to stop the overhead conveyor while totes are being picked up. If the loaded tote is unable to divert at the assigned destination, or fails for any reason to unload, it is conveyed to receiving and automatically unloaded. An operator then determines whether to assign a new destination or handle the tote manually.\nThe unload stations are designed to automatically take the tote off the moving overhead conveyor carrier. For the carousel area, once the tote clears the carrier, a transfer moves the tote to the accumulation roller conveyor leading to the work station. For the kitting diverts, a short section of powered roller moves the active tote on to a gravity-run out section of conveyor where the totes are accumulated. Pickup stations have a transfer to place the tote in front of an empty carrier on the overhead conveyor and a stop to hold it in place as the carrier picks it up on the fly.\nTotes inbound from receiving to the carousel area are scanned upstream of the first pod and diverted to the required pod for replenishment. The totes are automatically diverted and accumulated by the end of the carousel workstation.\nWhen operators are ready to replenish parts, they pick the six queued totes off the inbound accumulation conveyor and place them on the work station. Three pods of three carousels each hold the parts until called for.\nOperators place parts from the carousels destined for the kitting operation into totes. When the totes are complete, operators scan the tote ID, the SAP-generated paperwork, and a destination card. This information is written to an electronic file in the receiving area and the destination of the totes is sent to the Diamond Phoenix programmable logic controller. The tote is pushed onto the takeaway conveyor and transported to the overhead conveyor pickup station. The station transfers the tote for pickup on the first empty carrier.\nYOU'VE GOT TO BE KITTING\nAfter picking, operators place the totes on the outbound conveyor pickup transfer using the Diamond Phoenix material handling controller and scanner to capture the tote ID. Then they enter the destination. The tote is automatically transferred to the overhead conveyor system and delivered to the kitting areas.\nNext, the tote bar code is scanned as it enters each kitting area. If the tote needs to be diverted in that area, it is tracked until it reaches the proper point, where a stop actuates the overhead conveyor carrier to unload the tote. The overhead conveyor never stops moving. Once the tote is clear of the carrier, it is conveyed and accumulated for processing.\nAt receiving, pallets are unloaded and those containing parts that require QA inspection are placed on the pallet accumulation conveyor, which feeds six spurs in the QA area. Operators take the parts requiring inspection to workstations for testing. When a SKU completes testing, the pallet is transferred back to the accumulation conveyor and moved to the receiving dock. An operator then places the pallet on a pickup-and-deposit stand to be put away in the pallet rack.\nThrough the use of horizontal carousels, a monorail, and a conveyor, materials now flow through the Siemens warehouse with ease.","Inspection of Machined Metal Surfaces\nThe fabrication of metal components generally requires some type of machining operations. The exposed surface after the machining operation can expose internal features that might be of concern for different reasons. Some of the features might be considered cosmetic flaws and other functional flaws. Regardless of the category that these flaws fall in to, they must be identified and removed from the product stream. The isolation and identification of the flaws requires a quality standard that is defined by a specification.\nThe generation of this specification usually becomes the responsibility of the Product Engineer. The Product Engineer creates a specification that will cover ever potential failure mode of the component to insure that it will not experience a failure during the life of the product or at least its warranty period. If the product has been in use long enough to experience failures the specification may be changed to insure that particular failure mode does not occur again. After several revisions to the specification it will cover the majority of the failure modes. Although the revised specification is complete in its definition of the characteristics of an acceptable product it is usually very difficult to inspect the product as defined using human inspection techniques. The majority of surface inspection processes are still performed using human inspection.\nHuman inspection is still the primary choice for a couple of reasons. 1) If the production quantity is low, then the automation cost may be seen as prohibitive management. 2) The scope of the human inspection can be verbally described in general terms and easily taught to the inspection team. 3) The human inspector is adaptive to changing conditions. Let’s examine each of these topics a little closer to determine under what circumstances they hold true.\nThe volume is a major concern in the determination of whether automation should be implemented in the production environment. It cannot be emphasized enough that Manual Inspection is hard work! Many reports have been written describing the efficiency of manual inspection as a function of the inspection requirements, time and task performance. Most reports on the subject indicate that Human Inspection is at best 70% efficient for a typical inspection period of one shift. Granted it is difficult to perform as well as the Human Inspector at the beginning of the inspection period, but the Human Inspector rapidly become less efficient as the inspection period progresses. When the inspection involves Critical or Safety related components this drop off in efficiency is not an acceptable practice.\nCase in point, the FDA in the last couple of years has stressed the use of automated inspection equipment wherever possible. This is an industry that takes the safety of product very seriously.\nManual Inspection is less costly to implement than automated inspection equipment. This is especially true when there are no or little requirements for the testing of inspection team’s capability. Companies that do not have an annual or semi-annual testing program for the qualification of inspection team members do not experience the cost associated with documentation and retraining. However, this may prove costly if a faulty product makes it to the customer and is associated with an assembled product. The customer may request or require a complete sort of all products in a lot or those manufactured during a specific time frame.\nIt is important to have a good description of the inspection procedure and requirements, most often referred to as an Engineering Specification (ES). This document will instruct the inspection personnel as to what is and what is not allowed in the determination of product quality. The specification usually contains a description of what areas should be inspected and what constitutes a defective condition in each area. The author of the specification will evaluate all of the potential failure modes of a product and then include a special case to protect the product from escaping the inspection process without detection. Often there are different inspection criteria for the various regions of a component. This is where the responsible party of the ES must be careful. It is one thing to include a list of every special case but it is another to expect that members of the manual inspection team will be able to capture all instances. If the product is complicated and has multiple surfaces that must be inspected the time allocated for the inspection process will be a concern. You don’t want the inspection team to short the inspection process because of time constraints but this is a common occurrence when members of the human inspection team are distracted.\nA large percentage of machined components are manufactured from aluminum alloys. Aluminum is a pretty reactive material and tends to form oxides on machined surfaces quickly. The appearance of the machined aluminum surface can change depending on a number factors in the environment including: moisture, impurities, cutting and cooling fluids, tool quality, cutting speeds and endless others. The Human Inspector has the ability to change their interruption of the inspection requirements as the conditions in the manufacturing environment change. This may be considered as a “Good” characteristic by some and as a “Bad” characteristic by others, depending on which side of the “Quality Fence” you are on. The Quality Engineer wants to accept product that meets or exceeds ever item in the Engineering Specification for shipment to the customer. The Manufacturing Engineer also wants quality product but must insure that the required number of the components are shipped to the customer at the specified time. Sometimes there may be a tendency to “cheat” by loosening the inspection requirements so that production requirements can be reached. This is easier to achieve without the documented inspection report associated with each individual component."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a6644f9-483c-40f9-91f3-d4a7f28bb6c7>","<urn:uuid:43fa4a1d-b83f-4d69-a94e-017813197dd6>"],"error":null}

To celebrate this huge accomplishment, every week the TED Blog will be bringing you a Q&A with one of our most prolific translators. Today, meet Els De Keyser.\nWhere do you live and what do you do by day?\nI live in Mechelen, Belgium. By day, I work for the Financial Services and Markets Authority, in the department of supervision of the rules of conduct. Basically, we check whether financial institutions act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interests of their clients.\nWhat drew you to TED?\nI stumbled onto TED in 2010 while preparing my MBA thesis on transparency as a competitive advantage in insurance. (I worked for an insurance company at the time.) Alan Siegel: Let's simplify legal jargon! As a lawyer with a keen interest in plain language, I found Alan Siegel’s talk “Let’s simplify legal jargon” very inspiring.\nWhat was the first talk you translated and how did you pick it?\nI wanted to share Siegel’s talk with my colleagues at work. But that meant I had to overcome the language hurdle. I saw the “Translation” menu on TED.com and I thought, “Why not give it a try and translate it into Dutch?” The fact that the talk was only four minutes long helped too.\nWhat have been your favorite talks to translate? Why?\nI have a couple of favorite speakers, like Hans Rosling and Clay Shirky. They really changed my mindset. And they’re funny — I love the challenge of doing justice to their jokes. But the most moving talks, the ones that really stick with me, are often by speakers I would never have heard of if it hadn’t been for TED, Elyn Saks: A tale of mental illness -- from the inside like Elyn Saks’s testimonial on schizophrenia and Alberto Cairo’s “There are no scraps of men.” Last but not least, I like to translate talks I saw live at TED or TEDx events, because working on the translation brings back fond memories of the experience.\nWhich talk was the most difficult for you to translate and why?\nThis summer, TED-Ed videos were added to the Open Translation Project. I translated a TED-Ed lesson on the art of metaphors, in which the animation illustrated the English imagery. I couldn’t just use the Dutch equivalent — because it would make the animation meaningless. In 3 or 4 seconds, I had to convey the meaning in Dutch and respect the original English image. This six minutes translation took me much longer than many an 18-minute TED Talk.\nWhat’s a phrase in your language that you wish would catch on globally?\nI would propose a word: “pretoogjes,” which refers to the eyes of a chuckling person who is up to mischief. It was the Dutch contribution to the Words Worth Spreading tray designed by Dick Lundgren and presented by the TED Translators at TEDGlobal 2012.","Adult Learning & Job Seeking | Art & Craft | Book Reviews & Literature | Business & Investing | Consumer Information | Driver’s Education | Encyclopedias & More | Genealogy & History | Homework Help | Language Learning | Library Catalogs | Magazines, Newspapers, & Journals | Telephone Directory\nAdult Learning & Job Seeking\n- Search for the perfect job, research companies, and access resume templates and interview tools.

{"question":"When would you use a concept map versus a mind map - what's the main distinction?","answer":"Concept maps are visual representations that can take various forms like charts, graphic organizers, tables, flowcharts, or Venn Diagrams, and they typically have linking words written on lines to explain relationships between concepts. Mind maps, in contrast, are specifically used when brainstorming information that needs to be outlined or sequenced, and work best when topics have many components and subcomponents - they're not suitable when participants are brainstorming ideas to narrow down to the best one or two options.","context":["What is literature map?\nA literature map (Cresswell, 2011) is a two dimensional diagrammatic representation of information where links are made between concepts by drawing arrows (which could be annotated to define the nature of these links). develop your understanding of the key issues and research findings in the literature.\nHow do you write literature?\nWrite a Literature Review\n- Narrow your topic and select papers accordingly.\n- Search for literature.\n- Read the selected articles thoroughly and evaluate them.\n- Organize the selected papers by looking for patterns and by developing subtopics.\n- Develop a thesis or purpose statement.\n- Write the paper.\n- Review your work.\nHow do you find literature in a topic?\nWhere to search when doing a literature review\n- Start with research databases. Scopus and Web of Science are good databases to start with for any research topic and literature review.\n- Focus your search with specific databases. Select two or three discipline/specialist databases to conduct your search for comprehensive results.\n- Find books, theses and more.\nHow do you write a literature map?\nSteps in Creating\n- Start with a central idea or theme.\n- Write down all the words and phrases that come to mind in relation to the topic.\n- Add keywords to the branches.\n- Extend your initial ideas using more branches and nodes.\n- Group ideas/points/references in different ways.\nHow do I make a literature map in Word?\nHow to Make a Mind Map in Word\n- Enable Microsoft Word and open the document that you want to insert a mind map.\n- Go to select Insert > SmartArt and choose Horizontal Multi-Level Hierarchy in the Hierarchy or another suitable graphic in the Relationship.\nWhat is concept map example?\nConcept maps are visual representations of information. They can take the form of charts, graphic organizers, tables, flowcharts, Venn Diagrams, timelines, or T-charts. Concept maps are especially useful for students who learn better visually, although they can benefit any type of learner.\nHow do you write a mind map topic?\n- Begin with the main concept. First determine the main purpose of your mind map and write it down.\n- Add branches to the main concept. Now that you have determined the main purpose of your mind map, add branches that will outline the most basic subtopics.\n- Explore topics by adding more branches.\n- Add images and colors.\nWhat makes a good concept map?\nConcept maps typically have text, or linking words, written on each line to make sense of the relationship between a general concept and more specific ones. The text might include a specific verb like “provides” or “encompasses.”\nWhat is the example of literature?\nLiterature is defined as books and other written works, especially those considered to have creative or artistic merit or lasting value. Books written by Charles Dickens are an example of literature. Books written on a scientific subject are examples of scientific literature.\nWhat is literature review and example?\nA literature review is a survey of scholarly sources that provides an overview of a particular topic. It generally follows a discussion of the paper’s thesis statement or the study’s goals or purpose. *This sample paper was adapted by the Writing Center from Key, K.L., Rich, C., DeCristofaro, C., Collins, S. (2010).\nHow do you write an introduction for a literature review?\nThe introduction should:\n- define your topic and provide an appropriate context for reviewing the literature;\n- establish your reasons – i.e. point of view – for.\n- reviewing the literature;\n- explain the organisation – i.e. sequence – of the review;\n- state the scope of the review – i.e. what is included and what isn’t included.\nHow do you define literature?\nLiterature is a term used to describe written and sometimes spoken material. Derived from the Latin word literature meaning “writing formed with letters,” literature most commonly refers to works of the creative imagination, including poetry, drama, fiction, nonfiction, and in some instances, journalism, and song.\nWhich literature search is required for research?\nLiterature search is a key step in performing good authentic research. It helps in formulating a research question and planning the study. The available published data are enormous; therefore, choosing the appropriate articles relevant to your study in question is an art.\nWhat is a topic in literature?\nA topic—From the Greek, “place”—is a particular issue or idea that serves as the subject of a paragraph, essay, report, or speech. The primary topic of a paragraph may be expressed in a topic sentence. The main topic of an essay, report, or speech may be expressed in a thesis sentence.","“Sometimes we brainstorm information and ideas that need to be subsequently placed into a specific sequence, order, or outline. But our group likes to brainstorm in a nonsequential manner, much like the process outlined in the Old Fashioned Way. Is there an efficient way to brainstorm that will allow us to later sequence the information without extra work?”\n#2 Mind Mapping\nWhat Is Mind Mapping?\nMind Mapping is a brainstorming technique for quickly charting your group’s ideas in logical groupings, even when members give ideas in a nonsequential manner.\nIt is impossible to effectively outline ideas in a traditional, linear format while brainstorming. The Mind Mapping technique allows you to efficiently brainstorm for ideas as well as simultaneously create a skeletal framework for later categorization of the information you collect.\nExamples of situations that benefit from Mind Mapping include planning agendas or projects, identifying customer groups, or dealing with any process that contains many components.\nWhen to Use Mind Mapping\n- When group members will have to remember many steps or issues\n- When you are brainstorming information to be outlined or sequenced instead of brainstorming specific solutions to a problem\nNOTE: Mind Mapping works best when topics have many components and subcomponents or when there are a number of different categories of information. Mind Mapping does not work well when the participants are brainstorming ideas that they will later narrow down to the best one or two ideas.\nHow to Use Mind Mapping\nBefore the Meeting\n1. Identify specifically what you want to brainstorm. Plan an open-ended question to focus the brainstorming. You might say, for example: “What are the steps in completing this project?” “Which types of customers shall we target for testing our new product?” “What still needs to be done in order to finalize the annual report?” or “What do we need to do to be prepared for the move to the new building next month?”\nNOTE: The first time you use Mind Mapping with your meeting group, you will want to create two instructional charts. The below charts illustrate how the Mind Mapping process works and how it later translates into a linear format.\nDuring the Meeting\n1. Introduce the topic, the question, and the Mind Mapping technique. For example: “As you know, our group is moving to the new building next year. I’d like your help in planning for that move. Let’s start by mind mapping your answers to the question, ‘What do we need to do to be prepared for the move to the new building next year?’”\nNOTE: If your group has never used Mind Mapping before, take a few moments at this point to explain the process. You might say, for example, “We’ve never used the brainstorming technique called Mind Mapping before. Basically, it is a nonlinear way of outlining brainstormed information. This is an example of how it might look when it is finished”\n“The main arms or branches that emanate from the circle at the center represent the primary ideas or categories that have been brainstormed. The secondary branches represent the subissues of the primary categories, and the smaller branches are the subsets of the secondary categories, and so on. The idea is similar in structure to the old outline form that many of us learned in school, with roman numerals, letters, and numbers.\n2. Begin the brainstorming session, writing all your group’s ideas down on the appropriate section of the Mind Map. Brainstorm to an appropriate level of detail given your purpose. Continue to brainstorm until the group has exhausted all pertinent information or ideas.\nOPTION: If your Mind Map is getting too complex and cumbersome, consider taking an arm of the Mind Map and using it to create a new, separate, more specific Mind Map.\nBelow is an example of a completed Mind Map, one that categorizes the information brainstormed for planning the summer company picnic.\n4. After completing your mind map, have the group sequence the information if appropriate. You might say, for example, “Which of these arms or branches needs to be dealt with first?” “Which is next important?” and so on. Number them as the group dictates and reproduce your outline in linear form if appropriate. Below is the resulting linearly formatted outline created from the Mind Map of the company picnic.\nNOTE: You may find you want to move some information to different sections once your Mind Map is developed.\nMind Mapping is a nonlinear way of outlining ideas. It works best when the group is not likely to eliminate information but will need to categorize, sequence, or prioritize the information.\nBefore the Meeting\nIdentify specifically what you want to brainstorm. Plan an open-ended question to focus the brainstorming discussion.\nDuring the Meeting\n- Introduce the topic, the question, and the Mind Mapping technique.\n- Prepare your Mind Mapping chart by drawing a circle in the middle of a clean sheet of chart paper. Write your topic or question in the circle or at the top of the chart.\n- Begin brainstorming, writing all ideas down on the Mind Map. Brainstorm to an appropriate level of detail.\n- After completing your Mind Map, have the group sequence the information if ap- propriate. Prioritize the items as the group dictates and reproduce your outline in linear form if necessary.\nBuzan, Tony. 1993. The Mind Map Book.

{"question":"Can you compare the governance structures and stakeholder involvement in marine conservation programs between Belize and Seychelles?","answer":"In Belize, the marine conservation program involves collaboration between multiple entities including The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the government, and involves local stakeholders such as fishermen's associations and tourism boards in the design of marine protected areas. TNC provides technical assistance through a science-based participatory marine spatial planning process. In Seychelles, the governance structure is centered around the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT), an independent trust established to manage the proceeds of the debt restructuring. SeyCCAT manages grant programs and works in partnership with various entities including the GOS-UNDP-GEF Protected Area Finance project and SMSP Initiative, implementing a national consultation process under the Seychelles Marine Spatial Planning Initiative.","context":["WASHINGTON, November 6 – The American International Development Finance Corporation. issued the following press release:\nIn collaboration with Nature conservation (TNC), the government of Belize, and Credit Suisse, American International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) today announced the financial close of a $ 364 million Blue Bond for ocean conservation by Belize. The innovative debt conversion, which DFC made possible through $ 610 million in political risk insurance (covering the principal and interest of the loan), provide sovereign debt relief and simultaneously finance projects in favor of from Belize commitment to protect 30 percent of its ocean. These projects advance ocean protection, fisheries management, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. DFC and Nature conservation announced the financial closure of the project on the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow.\n“DFC’s collaboration with TNC, the government of Belize, and Credit Suisse represents one of the most innovative examples of climate finance and a model for the future, ”said David Marchick, DFC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction is a win-win: it reduces from Belize debt, generates an estimate $ 180 million invest in the protection of the marine environment and biodiversity and promote climate resilience in from Belize blue economy. from Belize the marine ecosystem is one of the most unique in the world, and this transaction will help protect and preserve it for the future. “\n“The twin crises of the climate emergency and biodiversity loss require rethinking and rethinking how we invest in our economies and our natural assets,” said Jennifer morris, general manager of Nature conservation. “The Belize Blue Bond is a global example of how a country can reduce its debt and create more fiscal space to devote substantial funds to its conservation ambitions. Belize shows that when we work together, by combining science, global finance and partnerships from the national level to the community level, we can achieve huge gains for people and nature. “\n“Blue Bonds for Conservation is a unique opportunity to Belize protect our unique marine resources and expand conservation programs while reducing public debt, ”said the Prime Minister of Belize Jean Briceno. “I thank our partners, in particular Nature conservation and the American International Development Finance Corporation, and share their hope that this transaction will serve as a model to address the global emergencies of climate change and sovereign debt. “\nDFC insurance allows Belize redeem $ 553 million sovereign debt discounted. Through a combination of debt cancellation and repayment by the government of Belize over time, the project will generate approximately $ 180 million for marine protection and management, restoration of coral reefs and mangroves, economic diversification, sustainable tourism and fisheries, and will promote the growth of the country’s blue economy. As part of the agreement, Belize agreed to double the percentage of its ocean allocated to biodiversity protection areas, from 15.9 percent to 30 percent.\nThis innovative operation by DFC mobilizes both capital and partnerships with the government of Belize to protect one of the most unique and valuable marine areas in the world. In the context of the climate crisis, this transaction is even more powerful – marine conservation efforts go hand in hand with climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience. The project will finance activities such as the rehabilitation of mangroves, which will strengthen the capacity to remove carbon, thereby helping to reduce the concentration of dangerous climate pollution in the atmosphere. TNC will also provide technical assistance by facilitating a science-based participatory marine spatial planning process that includes local stakeholders such as fishermen’s associations and tourism boards in the design of new marine protected areas.\nThe U.S. government is committed to maintaining its global leadership by forging innovative solutions that help countries balance economic growth with conservation and climate-friendly approaches.","Seychelles’ journey towards sustainable ocean management and the evolution of SeyCCAT are inextricably linked. Key milestones and lessons have been documented at each stage, outlined in the below timeline.\nThe people of Seychelles have always been dependent on the ocean. A brief summary of the history the Seychellois people, the islands, ocean ecology and the economy are highlighted here. It contextualises the importance of managing the ocean resources sustainably for future generations.\nThe effects of the global financial crisis is felt in Seychelles. The Government faced debt repayment challenges with total public debt raising to over 150% of GDP. This debt was subsequently restructured under the Paris Club and Seychelles initiated a five-year economic reform programme to reduce its external public debt.\nThe Nature Conservancy began discussions with the Seychelles Government to support the restructuring of its debt obligations on more favourable terms in exchange for increased ocean conservation.\nFormer President James Michel announces Seychelles’ formal commitment to protecting 30% of its Exclusive Economic Zone by 2020. This announcement initiated the Seychelles Marine Spatial Planning Initiative (MSP) to identify key zones for marine protection, as well as how to finance the implementation of the MSP.\nSeychelles Government begins the national consultation process under the Seychelles Marine Spatial Planning Initiative to identify high and medium biodiversity zones for protection.\nSeychelles Government and the Paris Club of creditors announces the closure of the first debt restructuring for climate adaptation.\nThe Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT) was established as an independent trust to manage the proceeds of the debt restructuring. In preparation SeyCCAT prepares its legal Act, its grant guidelines, investment policy, as well as its social and environmental safeguards policy.\nSeyCCAT receives USD 21.6m from The Nature Conservancy, comprising of a USD 5m grant and USD 15.2m in loan capital. SeyCCAT lends USD 20.2m to the Government of Seychelles in order to purchase USD 21.6m of sovereign debt from its creditors at a USD 1.4m discount to face value.\nThe first loan repayment from the Seychelles Government to SeyCCAT takes place is November, with subsequent repayments scheduled bi-annually.\nFirst call for proposals for the Blue Grants Fund is announced in October with USD 250,000 disbursed in June 2018. Overviews of each project financed are available here.\nFirst USD 15m Blue Bond is launched between the Seychelles Government and World Bank, to finance the fisheries recovery of the Mahe plateau. A detailed explanation of the structure of the Blue Bond is provided, as well as the fisheries analysis that provided the justification for the bond.\nSecond Blue Grant Fund call for proposals announced in March and grant disbursements from both the debt swap and blue bond proceeds equate to USD 550,000.
