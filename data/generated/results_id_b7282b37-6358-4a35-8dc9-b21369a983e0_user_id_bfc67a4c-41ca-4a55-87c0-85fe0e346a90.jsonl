{"question":"How do government regulations and market barriers affect both dairy production in the Americas and the implementation of vertical farming technologies?","answer":"In dairy production, government regulations significantly impact efficiency and market access. Canada's milk marketing boards enforce production quotas and impose 200-300% tariffs on US imports, while Brazil maintains high tariffs (14.8% on EU milk, up to 200% on cheese) and policies protecting small-scale farmers. These barriers prevent consolidation and optimal technology adoption. Similarly, vertical farming faces implementation challenges due to regulatory and economic barriers. It requires extensive investment costs and faces difficulties scaling beyond community-level operations. High energy requirements and substantial initial infrastructure investments make it particularly challenging to implement in developing agricultural nations, where food insecurity is often highest. Both sectors demonstrate how regulatory and economic barriers can impede the adoption of more efficient production methods.","context":["June 28, 2019\nA One Man Show: The Western Hemisphere's disparity-ridden, American dominated dairy farming\nUS technology and scale-driven consolidation single-handedly transformed the Americas into a world-leading dairy exporting region. Will trade wars and government regulations hold back further development?\nBy Eric J. BROOKS\nAn eFeedLink Hot Topic\nSpanning two continents, 1.1 billion people and huge productivity differences, the 160 million tonnes of fluid milk produced annually in the Americas roughly equals the European Union's output. The collective milk 2019 output of North America (122.7 million tonnes) and South America (37.6 million tonnes) is only slightly behind the 176 million tonne production of India's 1.3 billion people. At the same time, the Western Hemisphere holds a unique, underdeveloped role among world dairy exporting regions.\nIn Oceana, Australia and New Zealand's relatively low output is offset by their relatively tiny populations, making them export-driven, pastureland based world dairy suppliers. Spanning three dozen nations, Europe's vast but stagnant dairy sector is divided up among dozens of nations, with five leading EU producers and three fast-growing Eastern European suppliers dominating output volumes.\nDespite collectively supplying the world market more dairy commodities than any other region, Europe remains domestically oriented with under a tenth of output exported. Along with non-EU member Belarus, Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and Poland dominate European dairy exports.\nCompared to Europe or Oceana, Western Hemisphere dairy production is very unipolar and highly concentrated, with regional market barriers and productivity extremes that defy easy generalizations. In some nations, feed-based milk production dominates; others that rely on pastureland, or a combination of the two. Both the world's most advanced dairy technologies and its most primitive ones are found within this region.\nA mere four of the Americas' 35 nations are net dairy good exporters but only one has a strong world market presence. The other 30 other western hemisphere nations are either nominally dairy self-sufficient or net importers. The inefficiency, primitive dairy technology and small scale production found in many of these nations drags down overall Western Hemisphere dairy productivity –but two of the region's nations also lead the world in dairy productivity!\nScattered among the 30 other minor dairy producing nations, Argentina, Canada and Brazil have minor world market role. On the other hand, the United States recently overtook Australia to become the world's second largest dairy exporting nation after New Zealand. The United States now leads the world in both dairy cattle productivity and milk processing efficiency –but it hasn't always been this way.\nIn fact, America is a latecomer to the world dairy market, having only achieved major exporter status after 2000: From 2000 through 2015, the proportion of US dairy output exported jumped from 4% to 18%; thereafter trade wars made this slump back to 15%.\nThe reasons for America's dairy market ascendancy have to do with both resource abundance, business environment and technology. Unlike the Australian and New Zealand's pasture-based dairy sector, US dairy is a feed-driven, cow productivity dependent business model. As a feed abundant nation, US dairy cattle enjoy feed costs as low as their counterparts in Brazil and Argentina, with significantly lower feed prices than either their Canadian or European competitors.\nLeveraging their feed cost advantage to a far greater extent than their Canadian or Latin American competitors, US dairy producers have both invented and implemented productivity-enhancing technology. Innovations ranging from superior dairy cattle genetics to automated farm management and strategic hormone use greatly boosted cattle fluid milk making productivity.\nMost importantly, America is not just an exporter of dairy technology to other nations: Unlike Canada or Latin America, the US allowed free market dairy production consolidation to occur. The latter is required in order to make the use of many new dairy farming technologies cost-effective: According to the USDA, average total farm operating costs fall from US$26/cwt for a farm with fewer than 50 dairy cattle to US$16/cwt on farms with more than 1,000 cows.\nThis scale-driven cost difference drove consolidation, causing the number of US dairy farms to fall from 700,000 in the early 1970s to less than 100,000 today. Over this time period, fluid milk output per farm jumped from 100 tonnes to over 1,600 tonnes.\nConsequently, the quantity of milk produced per US cow doubled from approximately 5.4 tonnes in 1980 to approximately 11.0 tonnes today. –With 10.8% fewer cows than it had in 1980, America's 2019 fluid milk production will be 72% higher.\nCanada, Brazil and Argentina owe their limited dairy export success to the importation of US dairy cattle genetics, farm management technology and supplements. Even after importing US dairy technology however, America's dairy sector remains more efficient than that of its Western Hemisphere rivals and even European producers.\nFor example, US dairy cow productivity is almost 20% higher than that of neighboring Canada and at least eight times higher than that of Brazilian cattle. –Simply put, other potentially efficient North and South American dairy producers do not allow market forces to maximize productivity to the same extent the US did.\nFor example, Canadian dairy herds are nearly 90% as efficient as US cows but their productivity is held back by more than Canada's slightly higher feed costs. This is because in both Canada and Latin America, government regulations and trade barriers protect their dairy sectors from imports while destroying the incentive to fully leverage available dairy farming capital.\nCanada's government-run milk marketing boards strictly enforce milk production \"quotas\" that act as a source of guaranteed income for smaller producers This keeps Canadian milk production remains unconsolidated and productivity too low to compete against larger scale US producers.\nEven under the new USMCA trade agreement that replaces NAFTA, US dairy imports are limited to 3.6% of the Canadian market –with tariffs of 200% to 300% imposed on American dairy goods that exceed their allotted quota.\nAccording to Sylvain Charlebois, a senior fellow at The Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, \"For every liter produced, dairy farmers in Canada receive 72% more than the world average. As a result, the average family income for dairy farmers exceeds $160,000.\" Charlebois adds that \"Dairy farmers who received quotas for free when the system was established almost 50 years ago have accumulated assets worth above $5 million.\" Keeping wealthy inefficient dairy farms in business \"equates to almost 1,800 dairy farms we no longer need.\"\nHence Canada –a nation with low feed costs and the world's second most productive dairy cows after those of the US –would sooner protect wealthy small scale dairy farms than boost productivity high enough to compete with its southern neighbor.\nSimilar protectionism is the norm in Latin American nations blessed with abundant feed resources and ample pastureland. For example, Brazil's dairy farms operate behind import tariffs of 14.8% on EU milk and 42.8% on EU WMP respectively. Brazilian import tariffs on European cheese make imports up to 200% more expensive than domestically produced cheese.\nAs is the case in Canada, other policies protect small scale Brazilian dairy farmers and hold back the formation of consolidation-dependent economies of scale. Consequently, Brazil's dairy sector ranges from two cow backyard farms with hand milking of cattle to large-scale state-of-art free-stall and dry lot operations. While Brazil imports US cattle genetics and farming technologies, these policies prevent the formation of scale economies required for full leveraging of available productive dairy capital goods.\nThis has created a paradoxical situation whereby North America has less than 20% of the Western Hemisphere's dairy cattle herd but accounts for 77% of its milk production, with the US single-handedly supplying 62% of this proportion. 9.4 million US dairy cows will produce over 100.1 million tonnes of milk –nearly four times more than 26.2 million tonnes produced by Brazils 43.1 million head dairy herd.\nThe productivity gap between US and Canadian dairy farming is actually small compared to the efficiency gap between North America and Brazil –and many Latin American nations have even lower milk making productivity.\nConsequently, America on its own defines the Western Hemisphere's contribution to the world dairy market –and until recently, its share of the world market was growing aggressively. Whether it's fatty value-added products or commodity dairy powders, the proportion of US dairy products exported jumped from 4% in 1998 to over 15% last year, generating US$5.6 billion of revenue in 2018.\nUS fluid milk exports for example, jumped 541% from a mere 17 million tonnes in 2000 to 109 million tonnes this year.\nNo nation exports a greater volume of cheese than the United States, which recently overtook New Zealand. From 2000 through 2018, collective EU-28 nation cheese exports increased 92% from 420,000 tonnes to 830,000 tonnes. New Zealand cheese exports rose 30% from 246,000 to 320,000 tonnes while those of Australia declined by 21.5%.\nOver these same 18 years, US cheese exports skyrocketed 642%, from 47,000 tonnes to 348,500 tonnes. Hence, the United States accounts for 17.6% of North America's 18.5% share of the 2018 world cheese market with Canada (10,000 tonnes) and Mexico (7,000 tonnes) making marginal contributions. South America's much smaller 2.9% share of world cheese exports was mostly due to Argentina (40,000 tonnes) with tariff protected Brazil supplying a much smaller 4,000 tonnes.\nOn the other hand, America lags in cheese export revenues, with a 4.6% market share worth US$1.5 billion. Germany (US$4.6 billion, 14.5%), Netherlands (US$4.1 billion, 13%), France (US$3.7 billion, 11.6%), Italy (US$3.3 billion, 10.4%) and Denmark (1.8 billion, 5.6%), all exported smaller quantities of specialized cheeses at significantly higher unit prices.\nAmerica is even more dominant in SMP exports, where its share has risen from 12% in 2000 to 31% in 2018, overtaking both Australia and New Zealand to become the top supplier nation. Thanks to booming US exports, the Western Hemisphere's share of the world SMP market climbed from 16.7% in 2000 to 37.4% in 2018. Over those years, US SMP exports climbed from 142,000 tonnes to 729,000 tonnes; more than any other nation and second only to the EU-28's collective 828,000 tonnes.\n--Even so, the years since 2015, this US-led dairy success story was interrupted. As the accompanying graphs show, both the US and Western Hemisphere's share of world dairy commodity markets peaked around 2015 and have fallen since. There are two reasons for this.\nFirst, in 2015 Europe abolished Canadian style quotas and allowed EU producers to make as much milk as they wanted. This increased massive EU dairy product surplus just-in-time for Russia to ban their importation. That forced EU producers to diverted surplus dairy goods into Asian markets. Discounted surplus EU cheese, fluid milk and SMP subsequently took market share from US and Australian producers.\nSecond America's trade wars with China and Mexico resulted in both nations slapping tariffs of up to 25% on US dairy products. This hurt producers badly, as Mexico alone accounted for 20% of the US$5.6 billion of America's 2018 dairy exports. China was the US's second largest dairy export market and its fastest-growing customer. Both nations substituted dairy goods from Australia, New Zealand and Europe in place of import taxed US dairy products.\nHence, right after US producers stopped losing market share to recently de-regulated EU producers, they suddenly faced steep import barriers to their fastest growing export markets.\nGoing forward, the new USMCA trade agreement and Mexico's subsequent abolition of import tariffs on US dairy products will resume US export growth to the Western Hemisphere's biggest dairy import market. Should America and China finalize a new trade agreement shortly after this article is published, that too would see a resumption of once rapidly growing US cheese and SMP exports to the world's most populated country.\nSouth of the US border, Brazil recently walked away from a planned reduction in dairy import tariffs after politically influential farming lobbyists protested. Its subsidies for small scale dairy farming remain in place.\nArgentina's dairy exports recovered after the 2015 election of market-friendly Maurizio Macri. Even so, no one knows if Argentina's dairy-friendly policies and continued recent export growth will continue after its scheduled Q4 election.\nOve the longer-term, the United States alone cannot optimize the Western Hemisphere's role in the world dairy trade: The greatest capacity for export expansion is in feed-rich but productivity-poor South America, not North America.\nShould Argentina and Brazil liberalize their dairy farms in the same manner that they did their poultry sectors, the 2020s could see Latin American dairy exports start to compete on both quantity and price against their dominant North American rivals. For now, the Western Hemisphere dairy trade is American dominated, with minor contributions from Canada, Brazil and Argentina.\nAll rights reserved.

With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

What you find might surprise you, says Krakow: “It could take you anywhere.”\nIt’s also a legacy written in the neon lights and scuffed dance floors across Chicago, where ground-breaking studios, clubs, and stages continue to invite musical exploration.

{"question":"During WWII, were the resistance activities in Warsaw and the deportation of Slovak Jews happening at the same time in 1944?","answer":"Yes, there was some temporal overlap between these events in 1944. The Warsaw Uprising began on August 1, 1944, and lasted for 63 days until October 2nd. During this same period, Slovakia experienced its second wave of Jewish deportations, which began following the Slovak National Uprising on August 28-29, 1944. Between September and the end of 1944, German units deported approximately 12,600 Slovak Jews to various camps, while in Warsaw, the resistance fighters were engaging in their ultimately unsuccessful uprising against German forces.","context":["A few months ago, I visited Warsaw for the International Conference of Historical Geographers. Whenever I visit a new place I try to find out as much as I can about its history of radicalism and dissent, and there’s no doubt that Warsaw has plenty of that. In Part 1 of this post, I wrote about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April and May 1943, and the ways that it is remembered in Warsaw’s streets and museums. Part 2 is about the Warsaw Uprising, which lasted for 63 days in 1944. The Uprising has an entire museum dedicated to it, as well as an impressive monument.\nDuring the summer of 1944, the German Army was retreating across Poland, pursued by the Soviet Army. The Polish Home Army undertook uprisings in several cities in order to help the Soviet Army, and to assert Polish sovereignty–there were fears that the German occupying force would just be replaced with a Russian one. As the Soviet Army advanced towards the Vistula river, the Home Army in Warsaw decided to begin their own uprising on 1st August. It became the largest military effort of any resistance movement during the Second World War.\nThe uprising was only ever supposed to last a few days, until the Soviet Army reached Warsaw. However, the Soviets halted their advance on the eastern bank of the Vistula, and the resistance forces ended up fighting, almost entirely unsupported, for 63 days. The Home Army, aided by other groups including the National Armed Forces and the communist People’s Army, quickly took control of large sections of Warsaw. These areas were separated from each other however, and communication was difficult. The resistance fighters had received training in guerrilla warfare, but they were inexperienced at prolonged fighting in daylight and severely under equipped.\nOn the 4th of August, the Germans started to receive reinforcements, and began to counterattack. The following day, they began a systematic massacre of civilians in order to crush the resistance’s resolve. The strategy backfired however, only making the people of Warsaw more determined. Resistance fighters captured the ruins of the Warsaw ghetto (see Part 1), and liberated the Gesiowka concentration camp. At the end of August, the resistance decided to abandon the Old Town; the area was evacuated through the city’s sewers, which also served as a major means of communication for the resistance. The resistance eventually surrendered to the Germans on 2nd October; the expected help from the Soviets never came. The city wasn’t captured until 17th January 1945, giving the Germans plenty of time to systematically destroy the city and transport many of its residents to work and concentration camps.\nLife in Warsaw was very hard during the uprising, for civilians as well as resistance fighters. There were severe shortages of food; people largely survived on ‘spit soup,’ made from barley captured from the Haberbusch i Schiele brewery. The media flourished in the city however, multiple newspapers were published frequently, and 30,000 metres of film documenting the uprising was produced.\nWarsaw Rising Museum\nThe Warsaw Rising Museum was opened in 2004, to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising. The Museum contains more than 800 items and 1500 photographs and videos spread over 3000 square metres. It covers all aspects of the uprising, and provides visitors with a huge amount of information. It is arranged chronologically, and I would recommend following the order of the galleries carefully (you go from the ground floor to the top, then work your way back down, which could be more clearly sign posted). I think you need at least 3 hours to see everything, and I would recommend stopping halfway through for a drink and a slice of cake in the cafe, otherwise you will get too tired to take it all in properly. A highlight for me was the Kino Palladium, a small cinema that shows footage of the uprising that was used to make newsreels. I was also particularly moved by the collection of armbands. Soldiers in the uprising didn’t have uniforms, so used red and white armbands to identify themselves. Some people personalised theirs, and it really brought the human element of the uprising home to me.\nMonuments and Memorials\nThe Uprising Museum is located in Freedom Park, where you can also find several memorials connected to the uprising. The memorial wall documents the name of more than 10,000 resistance fighters who died during the fighting. Set within the wall is a bell dedicated to General Antoni Chrusciel, one of the uprising’s leaders. There is also a memorial to the estimated 150,000 civilians who lost their lives during the uprising, as well as the 550,000 who were deported from the city after the uprising failed.\nSet into the city walls surrounding Old Town is the Little Insurgent, a memorial to the children and young people who served as orderlies and runners during the uprising. The statue is based on a small plaster statuette created after the war by sculptor Jerzy Jarnuszjiewicz. It was paid for by former scouts, and unveiled in 1983 by Jerzy Swiderski, a cardiologist who had served as a scout during the uprising. It is a moving reminder of how the uprising consumed every aspect of Warsaw; even children could not escape the brutality.\nThe best-known memorial to the uprising, the Warsaw Uprising Monument, is on a much grander scale. Located on the southern side of Krasinki Square, the momument was unveiled in 1989, and is up to 10 metres tall. The monument has two sections: the larger represents a group of insurgents in combat, running from a collapsing building; the smaller section, in the foreground of the above photo, shows fighters and civilian woman climbing into a manhole. This is an acknowledgment of the significance of the city’s sewer system to the uprising. The monument is impressive, and you’d be hard pushed to walk past without stopping for a closer look. Monuments and statues can often blend into the street around them, which I think defeats one of the key objectives of memorials; drawing attention to the event, person or people it is meant to commemorate. There is no danger of the Warsaw Uprising Monument failing to attract attention.\nLike all cities, Warsaw’s past is inscribed into its streets, buildings and public spaces. Warsaw’s history is more violent than many cities–it has faced more than it’s share of death, destruction, and upheaval, and not just during the Second World War. There a number of different approaches to dealing with such a traumatic history in Warsaw: the city’s museums use different balances of objects and multimedia; and the monuments work on different scales, from the small and personal to the grand and official. Which approaches work best probably depends on personal taste, but the fact that so much effort and thought has gone into all of these commemorative practices demonstrates an admirable relationship with the past.\nSources and Further Reading\nFrederico. “The Warsaw Uprising Museum.” Odd Urban Things.

Encouraged by the Hungarian aristocracy, Jews migrating to northern Hungary from Moravia, Galicia and Bukovina, and Lower Austria tended to settle near the borders of the states from which they had come, and also managed to maintain religious, communal, and linguistic ties with Jewish communities across the borders.\nAs Jewish communities began to spread, Bratislava became the seat of Hungarian Jewish Orthodoxy under the leadership of the renowned Rabbi Moshe Schreiber, who served as rabbi in Bratislava from 1806 until his death. He founded the influential yeshiva of Bratislava. It was Schreiber who taught that Judaism could never change or evolve and coined the phrase, \"Anything new is forbidden by the Torah.\"\nIn 1867, the dual monarch of Austro-Hungary was established and Slovakia became a part of Hungary . The Hungarian parliament passed the Emancipation Law to promote assimilation among minorities, especially Jews. Government officials supported Jewish cooperation in industry and finance.\nThe Jewish population grew exponentially, especially in small, secluded towns in Eastern Slovakia. Nevertheless, much anti-Semitism existed in Slovakia and nationalists refused to allow Jews to assimilate into their culture. In 1918 just after World War I Czechoslovakia, with other central European countries regained independence as a result of Versailles treaty. Jews were given the right to be considered a separate nationality in the country.\nIn 1919, the National Federation of Slovak Jews was established in Piestany and the Jewish Party Židovská Strana was created. On February, 15th ,1921 the first national census in Czechoslovakia was held, 135,918 people registered as practicing Jews, approximately 4.5 percent of the population, 70,522 of them declared themselves of Jewish nationality.\nIn 1938 about 135,000 Jews lived in Slovakia, of whom 40,000 lived in the territory ceded to Hungary. Slovakia was poorer and far less industrialized than the historic Czech crown provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and so were its Jews. They were engaged mostly in retail trade and handicrafts, servicing the peasantry.\nOn March 15, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in the rump Czecho-Slovak state, in flagrant violation of the Munich Pact. The German occupation authorities refashioned the two provinces as a German protectorate, annexed directly to the Reich, but under the leadership of a Reich Protector. Konstantin von Neurath, the former German foreign minister, served as Reich Protector from March 1939 until he was replaced by RSHA chief Reinhard Heydrich.\nThe parliament in Bratislava proclaimed Slovakia independent on 14 March 1939. The next day, German troops occupied the rest of Bohemia and Moravia, declaring it a Protectorate, and Hungary seized the remnants of sub-Carpathian Ruthenia. Little more than 20 years after its creation, Czechoslovakia had ceased to exist.\nSlovakia became an independent state under the leadership of a Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso, whose followers established a fascist, authoritarian, one-party dictatorship, strongly influenced by the separatist Catholic clerical hierarchy in internal policy and closely allied with Nazi Germany.\nCatholic clergy were to play a dominant role in future Slovakian politics – 16 of the 63 Members of Parliament were priests. The government immediately aligned itself with Nazi Germany, signing a Treaty of Protection which effectively permitted Germany to interfere in Slovak internal affairs and to dictate Slovak foreign policy.\nAnti-Jewish legislation was rapidly introduced. At a conference in Salzburg on 28 July 1940, attended by Hitler, Tiso and Slovak Prime Minister Vojtech Tuka, it was resolved to set up a National Socialist regime in Slovakia, with an increased and more systematic policy of anti-Semitism. In August 1940, Dieter Wisliceny was sent to Slovakia as an adviser on Jewish affairs.\nSlovakia was also the first Axis partner to consent to the deportation of its Jewish residents in the framework of the \"Final Solution.\" According to a census of December 15, 1940, there were about 88,951 Jews in Slovakia. The Slovak government enthusiastically embraced the idea of deporting their Jews. They had promised to supply Germany with 120,000 workers.\nThe National Defense Law 20/1940 exempted Jews from military service in the new Slovak state, but required them instead to do manual labor at military work camps. Such Jews, who were called \"Robotnik Zid\" or work Jews, and wore distinctive blue uniforms and berets.\nThey were assigned to the Sixth Labor Battalion which consisted of five companies, three of which were exclusively made up of Jews. New Jewish recruits were assembled in Cemerne, in eastern Slovakia, where they underwent basic military training using shovels instead of rifles.\nBy October 1941 there were actually 80,000 Slovak workers in Germany. At that point, the Slovak government offered to substitute 10,000-20,000 Slovak Jews in place of the missing promised workers.\nAt first the Germans did not respond to the offer, but shortly after the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, Slovak leaders negotiated the terms of an agreement whereby the Slovak government would pay Germany 500 Reichsmark for every deported Jew.\nFor their part, the Germans agreed that the Jews would not be returned to Slovakia and that Germany would make no claims on the property abandoned by the Jews. The initial agreement had been for 20,000 young, \"strong Jews\", but before their deportation had even started, Himmler proposed that Slovakia be made free of Jews.\nThe expulsion of the Jews of Slovakia to the district of Lublin began on 27 March 1942, and ended on 15 June 1942. Nearly 40,000 Jews were deported in 38 ‘transports’ Only a few of the deportees survived. However, only a small proportion of the Slovak Jews were sent directly to the death camps. Most were sent first to ghettos which served as interim stops before the final deportation to the death camps.\nWhen the mass deportation of Slovak Jewry began in the spring of 1942 the position of the \"work Jews\" improved vis a vis the civilian Jewish population. The Jewish labor companies fell under the authority of the Ministry of Defense which was often in conflict with the Ministry for Internal Affairs that was responsible for the deportation actions.\nAs a result, the Defense Ministry sometimes refused to comply with requests from Internal Affairs to discharge \"work Jews\" from the military labor service. On May 31, 1943 the military labor camps for Jews were formally disbanded and the remaining \"work Jews\" were moved to civilian concentration camps around the regions of Sered, Novaky, and Vyhne.\nBy 20 October 1942, 58,645 Jews had been deported in 57 transports from the Patronka’s railroad siding and other places in Slovakia such as transit camps in Zilina, Novaky, Michalovce, Sered, Poprad and Spisska Nova Ves. Of the deportees, 2,482 were children aged four or under, and 4,581 children between the ages of four and ten.\n19 trains, containing 18,746 Jews were sent to Auschwitz. 36 transports were officially sent to Naleczow, a station 20 km west of Lublin. Most of the transports arrived in Lublin, where young men were selected for work at Majdanek concentration camp and other people from the transports, mainly women with children and old people, were sent to transit ghettos.\nTwo transports with 2,052 Jews were directed to the transit camp at Izbica; from there they were sent to to Belzec and gassed. 8,000 of the deportees, mainly younger men, went to Majdanek, from where 1,400 were subsequently transported to Auschwitz.\nContact was established at a very early stage between the deportees and the Jews left behind in Slovakia As a result, the Jews in Slovakia began to learn what was happening to the deportees in the places where they had been sent Steps were taken to help the deportees and there were even rescue attempts.\nThe information from the deportees was conveyed to Jewish organisations in neutral countries, and from there to the free world There were many attempts by Slovak Jews to escape from the ghettos and the camps, but only a few succeeded in returning to Slovakia One of the aims of the escapees was to warn the Jews of Slovakia and other countries about the deportations, and the fate that awaited them.\nAs reports, reached the Tiso government that the German authorities were murdering the Slovak Jews in German-occupied Poland, President Tiso first hesitated, and then refused, to deport the remaining 24,000 Jews in Slovakia in the autumn of 1942.\nRefusal to permit any further deportations led to a period of relative calm for the Jews of Slovakia, but with the outbreak of the Slovak National Uprising on 28-29 August 1944, a second wave of round-ups and deportations began.\nGerman troops moved led by Einsatzgruppe H of the Security Police and SD, whose duties included rounding up and killing or deporting the remainder of the Slovak Jews. Gottlob Berger, chief of the SS Main Office, was dispatched to Slovakia and later succeeded by Hermann Höfle, who brought in additional SS reinforcements, including the notorious Dirlewanger Brigade.\nThe Aktion Reinhard camps had long since ceased operating and Himmler had ordered the killing facilities at Auschwitz-Birkenau to be demolished on 25 November 1944. Because of these factors, an unusually high number of Jews from the second phase of deportations survived to the end of the war.\nBetween September 1944 and the end of the year, German units deported approximately 12,600 Slovak Jews, most of them to Auschwitz, Theresienstadt, and other camps in Germany. German and Hlinka Guard units killed a few thousand Jews caught in hiding or fighting with the partisans in Slovakia.\nDuring the deportations, some 6,000 Slovak Jews escaped to Hungary. On August 29, 1944, however, Slovak underground resistance organizations, Communist and non-Communist, rose against the Tiso regime as Soviet troops entered neighboring sub-Carpathian Rus.\nWith the fall of Bratislava on April 4th 1945 the liberation of Slovakia was completed. Vojtech Tuka and Jozef Tiso were arrested and sentenced to death. Tuka was executed August 20th 1946, followed by Tiso on April 18th 1947.\nIt is estimated that approximated 75,000 Jews from Slovakia or 83 percent of total Jewish population were annihilated.\nThe Final Solution by G.

For x-rays the factor is 1, thus 1RAD =\nThe SI unit for the RAD is the gray equivalent to 100 RAD.\nThe SI unit for the REM is the sievert, equivalent to 100 REM.\nDosages are commonly expressed in R/hr or mR/hr.

{"question":"What are the habitat elevation ranges for the Sheppardia gabela bird and Paphiopedilum urbanianum orchid?","answer":"The Sheppardia gabela is found at elevations of 810-1,100 meters above sea level in dense understorey of primary and secondary forest patches. The Paphiopedilum urbanianum grows at mid-elevations between 400 and 800 meters above sea level in subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.","context":["This poorly known species has a very small range, which is severely fragmented, and its forest habitat is likely to be declining in area, extent and quality. Its population is likely to be highly fragmented and declining. It is therefore classified as Endangered.\nDowsett, R. J.; Forbes-Watson, A. D. 1993.

Voice Mournful two-note whistle, repeated; also high pitched weeh-weeh-weeh repeated with intermittent mechanical scraping call. Hints Very shy and difficult to observe.\nis known only from a few forest patches within 40 km of Gabela, on the escarpment of western Angola\n. A recent brief survey (2003) found that the forest around Gabela has largely been transformed, but three individuals of this species were recorded at a single, large forest block which survives near the village of Kumbira, in regenerating coffee and in secondary bush near the town of Seles (C. Cohen, M. Mills and C. Spottiswoode in litt.\n2003, Mills et al.\n2004, Ryan et al.\n2004). Surveys in 2005 found the species at two additional sites within the known range (Mills 2010). It may possibly occur in other relict patches of forest on the escarpment, but suitable habitat is severely restricted. The species's global range of 1,090 km2\nand the estimated local deforestation rate of 20-70% can be used to estimate the area of available habitat at 327-872 km2\n(Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. With this information, and assuming a territory size of 3 ha per pair (maximum for well-studied Sheppardia\nspecies), the minimum global population is estimated to number 21,800 mature individuals (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005). However, the area of available habitat is probably much smaller than the estimate used (M. Mills in litt\n. 2007), thus this is considered a maximum population estimate. This calculation may include unsuitable forest habitat, and the deforestation rate may be over 70%, however countering this, the species is common in some modified habitats (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005). Population justification\nUsing an estimate of the area of available habitat of 327-872 km2\n, and assuming a territory size of 3 ha per pair the minimum global population is estimated to number 21,800 mature individuals. The area of suitable habitat is probably much smaller than the estimate used (M. Mills in litt.\n2007), so this may well be an overestimate: the population is thus precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals. This equates to 15,000-29,999 individuals in total, rounded here to 15,000-30,000 individuals.Trend justification\nThe population is suspected to be in moderate decline owing to the ongoing clearance of its habitats for subsistence agriculture.Ecology\nIt is found in the dense understorey of a few remaining primary and secondary forest patches at or above 1,100 m, but as low as 810 m (Mills et al.\n. It has been observed in scrubby edges of managed \"coffee forest\", but is probably dependent on nearby, more intact forest. It has been observed mostly at heights of 4-6 m above the forest floor (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. It is probably exclusively insectivorous, gleaning insects from leaves and branches of undergrowth. Its breeding ecology is unknown although birds in breeding condition have been found in September. Two immature birds were trapped in Kumbira Forest in January 2004, probably constituting the first breeding record for the species (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. Territory size is probably in the range of other well-studied Sheppardia\nspecies, at around 0.5-3 ha per pair (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\nIt is threatened by loss of habitat from subsistence agriculture, which possibly affects 30% of forest in the Kumbira area (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. In some areas, 20-70% of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms is being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes (Dean 2001)\n. In other areas, up to 95% of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (Dean 2001)\n. Since the 1930s, shaded coffee plantations have been developed in the forests of the escarpment (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. It is likely that suitable habitat has increased since the mid-1970s, as civil war has forced out commercial farmers\nand resulted in the abandonment of shaded coffee plantations (Mills et al.\n2004, Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n, however, relict coffee plantations are now being encroached by subsistence agriculture (Sinclair et al.\n. With the return of peace, commercial activities on the Angolan escarpment (such as coffee growing) (Sinclair et al.\nare expected to resume, presenting a serious threat to the species (Mills et al.\n. In particular, the replacement of shade-grown coffee with sun-tolerant varieties could pose a serious threat (Ryan et al.\n. The marketing of local produce is currently limited by the poor state of the Sumbe-Gabela road, however this is a priority for reconstruction, which would contribute to increased development and agriculture in the area (Ryan et al.\n. Most of Kumbira Forest was selectively logged before the civil war (Sinclair et al.\nand, although there is no evidence of ongoing logging, the forest continues to be a source of firewood (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. Conservation Actions Underway\nA protected area of 50 km2\nin the region was recommended in the early 1970s, but has not been established (Dean 2001)\n. Conservation Actions Proposed\nConduct surveys to estimate the population size and ascertain its presence in other forest patches. Survey forest cover in the Gabela region by studying satellite imagery, in order to improve the population estimate (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n. Designate the forest at Gabela as a protected area (the only effective conservation action possible) (W. R. J. Dean in litt.\n. Implement a conservation strategy for the Angolan escarpment in reaction to the resumption of commercial activities (Mills et al.\n. Promote ecotourism as a viable supplement to agriculture (as tourism becomes possible) (Sinclair et al.\n. Study the species's territory size by radio-tracking individuals (Sekercioðlu and Riley 2005)\n.

{"question":"What defense strategies did Orzel and Anglia employ when under enemy threat?","answer":"The Orzel and Anglia had very different defensive capabilities and strategies. The Orzel, as a submarine, could actively evade attacks by diving - when faced with depth charges from German planes and patrol vessels, it would submerge to depths of over 200 feet and use currents to drift away from danger. During one particularly intense attack, they remained submerged for 20 hours despite deteriorating air quality. In contrast, the Anglia, as a hospital ship, relied on passive protection through its designated status, marked by large Red Crosses painted on the ship's sides. However, this proved ineffective as the ship was still targeted in what was described as a 'total war at sea' where hospital ships were considered 'fair game' by U-Boat commanders, despite their supposed immunity.","context":["Orzel's Patrol - Polish Submarine in World War 2\nOn 1 September 1939 the Polish submarine Orzel (Eagle) lay in the Polish Baltic port of Gdynia. On that day Nazi Germany invaded Poland and the port at Gdynia was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Orzel slipped her moorings and sailed out into the Gulf of Danzig. German ships and aircraft constantly patrolled the sea looking for her. The Captain of the Orzel, Commander Kloczkowski, fell seriously ill and in mid September the Orzel anchored in the harbour at Tallinn in neutral Estonia. The Captain was admitted to hospital and the Estonian authorities gave them 24 hours in port to carry out repairs.\nLieutenant-Commander Jan Grudzinski took command of Orzel and was informed by the Estonians that their departure would be delayed by six hours in order to allow a German merchant ship to leave port. Later Orzel was boarded by an armed detachment and told that the Estonian government had decided to intern the submarine. They were trapped. On the next morning the Estonians started to disarm Orzel removing most of her torpedoes, ammunition and charts. The only thought of the Polish crew was how to escape.\nEscape from Tallinn\nAt 2am the Polish crew disabled two guards and took them prisoner. A Polish sailor sabotaged the electric cable to the docks which put the lights out. The hawsers attaching the submarine to the dock were cut and Orzel started to move. Machine guns opened fire and Orzel left the harbour under a hail of bullets. They headed for Sweden and released the two Estonian guards onto the island of Gotland.\nFor four weeks Orzel searched for enemy shipping to use her remaining torpedoes upon. They found nothing bigger than small patrol ships. Water and fuel supplies began to run low. They decided to leave the Baltic and head to Britain. The sea routes out of the Baltic were heavily patrolled by German ships. Their attempts to break out in daylight failed but they succeeded in alluding the searching vessels at night. In the North Sea, on their second day out from Skagerak, Orzel signalled the British Admiralty, telling them their position and that they awaited further orders. A British destroyer intercepted them and escorted them to a British port.\nOrzel Sees Action\nIn early April 1940 the Orzel leaves Britain for her designated sector off the Norwegian coast. On 8th April a ship is detected in their periscope. It is a German liner, the Rio de Janeiro. Orzel surfaces and hoists flags to signal that the ship should stop. The Rio de Janeiro increases speed and heads towards Norwegian territorial waters. Orzel machine guns the ship and she stops. A new signal is hoisted:\nAbandon ship immediately. Intend to fire torpedo in five minutes' time. (p. 65)\nOrzel fires her torpedo and the Rio de Janeiro is hit. She keels over to starboard and a column of smoke rises from her. A second torpedo sends her to the bottom. In the evening on British radio the Orzel crew hear the following announcement.\nAt noon today, a British submarine on patrol torpedoed and sank off Lillesand on the south coast of Norway the German supply ship Rio de Janeiro of 6,800 tons. The Rio de Janeiro, a Hamburg liner, had on board about 400 sliders and war material... (p. 79)\nThe Norwegians' announce that at 23.00 they will observe a black out over the entire country. On 9 April 1940 Nazi Germany attacks and invades Norway.\nAttacks Against Orzel\nOn 11 April 1940 Orzel spots a German liner and a transport vessel. She readies her torpedoes for firing.\nBoom! boom! boom! boom! Four terrific explosions interrupt the Captain's orders. All lights go out for a moment, then come on again. Everybody feels a very great shock. (p. 100)\nGerman planes had dropped depth charges on Orzel. The firing of the torpedoes is abandoned and the submarine dives. German patrol vessels search for them and drop depth charges. The submarine shakes from the nearby explosions. In the evening Orzel returns to periscope depth. The current has swept them into a fiord. The next day German patrol vessels approach their position and again launch depth charges. German planes join the hunt. Orzel is submerged at over 200 feet. More depth charges explode and the submarine rocks. In the evening they return to periscope depth and find the current has taken them almost to the entrance to the fiord. They start their engines and head out to sea.\nOn the next day, 13 April, they receive orders to move to another sector. Through the periscope they now see the coastline of Denmark rather than Norway. Three trawlers are seen two or three miles away. They head straight for Orzel and launch depth charges. Orzel submerges beneath the sea. The trawlers continue to depth charge unceasingly. Explosions shake the submarine. After 20 hours submerged the air in the submarine is dreadful. On the 16th of April there are no depth charges and they proceed on the surface. They have orders to return to Britain. On the 18th they see the coast of Britain and return to a safe harbour.\nOrzel returned to sea again but on 11 June 1940 the Polish Admiralty in London issued the following statement.\nOwing to lack of information, and being long overdue, the Polish submarine Orzel is presumed lost.

Denny & Brothers in Dumbarton Scotland for the London & North-Western Railway Co. She was of 1,862 tons with a 424hp triple expansion engine and two propellers, to give her a speed of 21 knots. The ship measured 329 feet by 39 feet to draw 16 feet.\nWith the advent of WW1, the ship was acquired as an Auxiliary Hospital Ship, and with Captain Lionel John Manning in command, at 1230 on the 17th. of November 1915 she struck a mine, only one mile East of Folkestone Gate, and quickly sank.\nPicture of Ladies Deck Cabin on board SS Anglia prior to her conversion to an Auxiliary Hospital Ship\nHMS Hazard to the rescue.\nThe Royal Navy Submarine Depot ship HMS Hazard arrived on the scene to pick up survivors.\nAnglia's route, Calais to Dover.\nAnglia was returning to Dover from Calais where she had loaded 390 Military personnel, 4 Officers, 1 nurse, 13 wounded Officers, and 372 wounded other ranks, all from the Front Line of the war in France.\nSS Anglia prior to her being converted to an Auxiliary Hospital Ship\nNumber who died.\nThere is some conjecture about the number who died that day from this mine laid by the German Submarine UC-5.

{"question":"I'm a healthcare manager looking to improve our billing efficiency. How does RPA technology streamline the medical billing process?","answer":"RPA technology streamlines medical billing in several ways: It uses bots to access and digitize data from various systems for faster, more accurate account information. The system confirms patient insurance eligibility, deductibles, and copays with providers. RPA eliminates manual coding errors that cause delays and claim denials. It can extract, prepare, send, and file medical billing files and reports digitally. The system flags discrepancies for investigation and can follow up on missing medical reports, information, forms, or signatures.","context":["Revenue Cycle Management\nWhat is RPA for revenue cycle management, and why does it matter?\nMany healthcare providers have turned to other solutions to deal with a significant increase in patient numbers. One of many solutions adopted is robotic process automation (RPA) to stay on top of their influx revenue cycle management (RCM).\nRevenue cycle management is the financial process in which healthcare providers utilize billing software to track information, from patient registration all the way to the final payment of the outstanding balance for healthcare services received.\nRPA can help simplify this by eliminating the mundane manual processes such as data entry, insurance verification, and even preauthorization. These processes are ideal use cases for RPA, as automation brings the best results when applied to time-consuming, repetitive processes in the revenue cycle. In addition, as more time-intensive, drudging processes are pulled into RPA, higher-level thinking processes receive the full attention of human workers that they deserve.\nWhat are the benefits of RPA for Revenue Cycle Management?\nThere are many benefits to using RPA to manage your practice's healthcare revenue cycle. These benefits help healthcare providers gain back time and resources lost to time-consuming tasks and focus their efforts on more important subjects such as patient care, efficiency and doctor-patient communications. Here are some examples of how automation technology can assist healthcare providers in managing workflows to reduce human error and streamline business processes.\nThe Automation Anywhere Robotic Interface makes RCM communications more efficient by the ability to pull in layers of information from several sources. Data is collected into a central location: always on, always available and updated in real-time. No more back and forth between departments or duplicated efforts.\nPatient communication is as important as staff and interdepartmental communication. RPA makes it easier to support patients through revenue cycle activities. For example, after talking on the phone with a patient to answer questions or discuss service costs, you can automatically send a recap email of the conversation that they can refer to.\nRPA bots can run their processes either attended or unattended around the clock as a digital workforce. For example, the bots would process claim intake, evaluation, and handling of incoming claims data from providers to seamlessly extract required data, identify exceptions, and process invoices through to payment.\nRPA technology for healthcare revenue cycle management can provide compliance-based records with 100% accuracy to meet all HIPAA compliance requirements. Be audit-ready at any minute with automation technology.\nIn busy healthcare organizations, having someone streamline your inputs and outputs can be very helpful. RPA bots can act as “digital assistants”, such as when a specific inbox receives an email. The bot can scan the email, extrapolate important information and forward that email to the appropriate parties.\nUnattended bots can expedite the preregistration process once patients submit the necessary form. With online portals, patients can submit information at any time of day. Bots can access databases, fill in gaps on submitted forms, flag exceptions, and more overnight. Complete documentation is ready when employees arrive in the morning.\nCan RPA streamline your revenue cycle management?\nRealize the benefits of RPA for every aspect of the revenue cycle management.\nWho benefits from RPA for Revenue Cycle Management?\nHealthcare organizations can benefit from RPA with machine learning for revenue cycle management. From patients to providers to accounts payable and accounts receivable, automation technology can provide opportunities for revenue cycle efficiencies.\nRPA can automate claims processing for faster throughput, pre-authorization due to verification of patient coverage, payer notifications, claims status or follow-ups and faster denial management or reimbursement. Exception reports can be generated on-demand with 100% accuracy.\nAutomating the revenue cycle processes can streamline accounts payable and accounts receivable transactions, payment posting, billing, and reimbursements. This can eliminate human error due to manual data entry, resulting in more accurate forecasting and RCM processes.\nIntelligent automation can speed patient enrollments, new patient appointment requests, and update patient information. It can extract and process data from documents, and transfer it to other systems and formats with up to 100% accuracy.\nRPA is well suited for handling back office tasks that support revenue cycle management. Bots can be employed for premium processing and health plan enrollment, as well as determining eligibility for enrollment. In addition, bots are used to automate tasks such as cell phone expense reporting.\nR1 RCM efficiently automates over 32M tasks annually using RPA\n\"We selected Automation Anywhere’s RPA solution due to its ability to scale quickly and its bank-grade security and encryption which is critical in the healthcare industry.\"\n- Sean Barrett, Vice President of Digital Transformation\nmillion tasks have been automated annually\ndigital workers in production\nhealth systems in over 200 locations have been connected\nHow RPA for Revenue Cycle Management Can Help Your Business?\nPatient Data Migration and Processing\n- Reduced manual entry of data\n- Faster file transfers between hospital staff and departments\n- Faster processing and digitization of older files\n- Get faster communication between medical departments\n- More accurate data available for better patient communication\n- Easier access for patients creating a more positive end-to-end experience for all involved\nInsurance Data Automation\n- Intelligent automation can exchange and digitize data with any enterprise or legacy system.\n- Efficient exchange of patient information to providers for patient insurance verification and pre-authorization.\n- Immediate confirmation of insurance verification, eligibility, claims status, and denial management.\n- Reduce risks of security breach during patient health information transfer due to cloud-native encryption protocols.\n- Create detailed audit trails regarding access, permissions, decisions and outcomes for patient care.\n- Detailed compliance protocols for HIPAA and other regulatory requirements .\nMedical Billing Processest\n- Use RPA bots to access and digitize data from disparate systems for faster, more accurate account information.\n- Confirm eligibility and patient insurance with the provider, insurance deductibles and copays.\n- RPA can eliminate manual coding errors which cause delays and claim denials, repetitive tasks and follow-ups.\n- Intelligent automation can extract, prepare, send and file medical billing files and reports digitally.\n- RPA can flag discrepancies for investigation and follow-up to ensure billing and coding match.\n- RPA can follow up for missing medical reports, information, forms or signatures.\nInsurance Claim Processing\n- Cross-reference insurance, medical coding and charge posting to verify accuracy prior to claims submission.\n- RPA tracks claims denial management, generates exception reports and forwards balances to accounts payable.\n- Cross reference explanation of benefits to claims reporting, reconcile and update patient account information.\n- RPA can update claims systems as soon as updates and changes occur to ensure the system is always in compliance.\n- RPA can easily scale to support increased claim activity, reducing or eliminating backlogs.\n- Real-time monitoring and reporting of claims system, metrics, data and analytics.\nWhat to Look For in RPA for revenue cycle management?\nRPA can improve RCM by decreasing errors and costs, providing a more positive patient experience and optimizing net revenue.

{"question":"What are the insurance coverage options and liability risk management strategies available for landowners who host guests on their property?","answer":"For insurance coverage, landowners should carry liability insurance that covers all activities on the property, with coverage amounts based on risk level - properties hosting events need higher coverage than isolated farms. Farm/Ranch Package policies offer broader protection than standard homeowner policies, especially for business activities. For liability risk management, landowners should identify and either warn about or fix dangerous conditions on their property, obtain written liability releases from guests that comply with state laws (in Texas these must be conspicuous and explicit about negligence), and consider using limited liability business entities like LLCs to protect personal assets. Additionally, they can utilize state liability protection statutes like Recreational Use or Agritourism Acts that offer protection if certain conditions are met.","context":["Ask a Lawyer | How Can Landowners Protect Themselves From Liability?\nBy Tiffany Dowell Lashmet, assistant professor and extension specialist, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension\nTiffany Dowell Lashmet is an Assistant Professor and Extension Specialist in Agricultural Law with Texas A&M AgriLife Extension. She focuses her work on legal issues affecting Texas agricultural producers and landowners including agricultural leases, water law, oil and gas law, eminent domain, easements, and landowner liability. You can find the Texas Agriculture Law Blog, the “Ag Law in the Field” podcast, resources, and other information at agrilife.org/texasaglaw.\nShe was a featured speaker and panelist at the Cattle Raisers Convention in March, sharing her expertise on topics important to ranchers, including landowner liability, grazing leases and more.\nA common concern for landowners across the country is how to ensure they are protected from liability if someone is injured on their property. I frequently get emails from landowners asking what they can do to best defend themselves in the event an injury does occur on their land.\nUnfortunately, there is no silver bullet that will ensure a landowner will not ever be liable for anything. Additionally, there is nothing a landowner can do to make it impossible for another person to file a lawsuit against the landowner. There are, however, steps landowners can take to limit liability and protect their operations from this concern.\nCarry liability insurance\nThis is the most important step a landowner can take in order to protect his or her operation. Every landowner needs to have a liability insurance policy that covers every activity taking place on the property. For example, if a landowner has a farm and ranch policy, but also conducts other activities like a roadside fruit stand or guided hunts, the landowner should confirm that the additional activities are covered by the farm and ranch policy’s provisions. How much insurance should a landowner carry? Well, in typical attorney fashion I’ll say that it depends. Landowners should consider the amount of risk associated with their operation. For example, a farm in the middle of nowhere that does not host any sort of events or have any guests would likely need a lower coverage amount than a farm that has a pumpkin patch and corn maze every fall with thousands of guests. Talking through the details of your operation with your insurance agent is a great way to determine the right coverage level and type of policy to obtain.\nIdentify dangerous conditions on the land; either provide warnings or make them safe\nEvery state has slightly different laws related to when a landowner can be held liable for injuries. Most states group people into different categories and assign a certain level of duty to a landowner for each category. However, generally speaking, warning any guest on the property about dangerous conditions or making them safe would satisfy the duty of care owed by a landowner to any type of guest on the property. What are dangerous conditions? Whatever a court says they are. A deep hole covered with tree limbs, for example, could be considered a dangerous condition. A landowner can either warn people about potential dangers or make them safe. There is no set requirement for how warnings may be given, but often if the landowner is entering into any type of lease or contract, identifying dangerous conditions in that type of document is useful.\nTexas law divides people into three categories: (1) trespassers; (2) licensees; and (3) invitees. Landowners owe a different duty (level of responsibility) to each category. If the duty is met, the landowner is not liable. If not met, the landowner can be held liable to an injured party.\nUnder Texas law, a landowner’s only duty to a trespasser — which is anyone on the land without permission — is not to intentionally injure them and not to act with gross negligence. This is a very high bar for an injured party to prove in order to recover damages from a landowner. For a licensee — anyone on the property for their own benefit — the duty is a bit higher. In addition to not intentionally injuring or acting with gross negligence, the landowner must warn or make safe dangerous conditions known to the landowner that might not be obvious to the plaintiff. For an invitee — someone entering the property for the mutual benefit of themselves and the landowner — the duty is even higher. In addition to no intentional acts or gross negligence, and in addition to warning for known dangerous conditions, the landowner now has a duty to warn or make safe any dangerous condition of which he or she should have known with a reasonable inspection.\nObtain written liability releases from anyone coming on the property\nLiability releases (also called liability waivers) are simply documents signed by guests agreeing that they will not hold a landowner liable for injuries that occur on the property. Again, laws differ by state, but generally speaking, courts will enforce this type of waiver if drafted in a manner comporting with the law of the state where the land is located. Releases usually identify the activity involved, list out common dangers associated with that type of activity, state that the signer understands those risks, and agrees not to sue the landowner for negligence. Given the complex nature of these releases, and the importance of having one that is enforceable, it is recommended that a landowner seek the assistance of an attorney to draft a proper waiver. Spending the money up front to do so can certainly pay off in the long run if a lawsuit can be avoided.\nIn Texas, courts require releases to be conspicuous and to comply with the express negligence doctrine. This essentially means that the release cannot be hidden in the fine print of a larger document, like a hunting lease, and must contain language providing that the signer releases the landowner all claims of negligence or gross negligence related to the signer’s being on the property.\nEnsure that all limited liability statutes apply to the operation\nMany states have limited liability statutes protecting landowners from liability if certain conditions are met. Two of the most common types of statutes are an Agritourism Act or a Recreational Use Statute. Again, the details of these statutes differ by state, but they can offer important protections for landowners and generally are easy and inexpensive to comply with. For example, the Texas Recreational Use Statute provides that a landowner is not liable except for intentional acts or gross negligence if the person injured was there for a recreational purpose and the landowner either charged no fee, did not charge more than a certain amount, or carried a sufficient level of insurance. Landowners should investigate the various statutes in their own state and ensure that they apply to their operation.\nBoth the Texas Recreational Use Statute and the Texas Agritourism Act provide important protections for owners of ag land in Texas. “Ag land” is defined under the Recreational Use Statute as land that is suitable for growing crops, forestry, or raising livestock, and under the Agritourism Act as land suitable for growing crops and raising livestock. They offer limited liability to the landowner if a plaintiff is injured on the property while engaging in a recreational activity, including hunting, fishing, riding four-wheelers, and many more listed examples. Further, the Agritourism Act also applies to plaintiffs on the property for educational activities. Both have different requirements in order to apply, with the Recreational Use Statute requiring certain monetary requirements be met and the Agritourism Act requiring a sign be hung or certain release language signed. Additionally, Texas also has a Farm Animal Liability Act that protects farm animal owners from injuries caused by the inherent risks of farm animal activities.\nConsider the use of a limited liability business entity structure\nLandowners may want to consider putting their business (or a particular part of the business) into a business entity that offers limited liability. This could include a limited liability company, limited partnership, or corporation. When formed correctly and handled properly, these types of entities can provide limited liability for a landowner if an injury occurs on property owned by the entity.\nFor example, if someone gets injured on property owned by an LLC of which Bob is a member, Bob would not be personally liable for the injuries. Conversely, if Bob owned the land in his own name, his personal assets could be subject to liability if an injury were to occur. There are several considerations that go into whether a business entity is right for an operation and, if so, which entity to select. Landowners should consult with an accountant and attorney in their area to help make the right decision for their operation.\nFor additional information on landowner liability and statutes, visit agrilife.org/texasaglaw.\nAsk a Lawyer is excerpted monthly from The Cattleman magazine.

Both policies cover your personal property and liability exposures but the scope of coverage can differ greatly. Here are some of the most significant differences.\nCare, Custody & Control\nHomeowner policies contain an exclusion for non-owned property in the care, custody & control of the insured. This exclusion applies to any non-owned horse on your property, even if there for a short period of time.\nA Farm/Ranch Package policy can be endorsed to include livestock care, custody & control coverage with limits starting at $5,000 per horse and $25,000 per occurrence Higher limits are available upon request.\nBusiness Pursuits Exclusion\nHome-based business owners may mistakenly believe their homeowners policy will cover their business activities. All standard homeowners policy contains a “business pursuit” exclusion or “professionals services” exclusion. These exclusions specifically state that the policy does not cover business activities at home.\nIf a homeowner boards a horse or gives a few lessons in exchange for money, feed or anything of value he is engaging in a business pursuit and these activities are excluded from the liability coverage of a homeowners policy.\nA Farm Package policy uses the ISO or AAIS Commercial General Liability forms to extend proper commercial and business liability coverage. This form does not contain a Business Pursuit limitation as it is intended to cover loss arising from bodily injury or property damage which results from equine business activities as described in the declarations of the policy.\nHomeowners Property Limitations\nA homeowner policy significantly limits coverage for Business Property and Appurtenant Structures .\nAppurtenant or Other Structures – Coverage for appurtenant structures (covered as “other structures” under Coverage B on the policy) is excluded for any structure which can be used in whole or in part for business purposes on a homeowners policy. This includes any farm buildings such as barns, hay storage and tack rooms whether or not they are used for a commercial venture. That means that if you are boarding, training, breeding or even if you only have personal horses, your homeowners policy may not insure those buildings for any losses.\nAdditionally, “Coverage B” is usually limited to ten percent of the limit of the dwelling. In most cases, this amount is not adequate to replace your equine structures.\nBusiness Personal Property\nCoverage for business personal property (such as tack, hay fed to boarded horses, and other equipment used for the care of horses) is typically limited to $2,500 on the premises, $250 off the premises. This limit is rarely adequate to replace this type of equine property, especially when off the insured location.\nA Farm Ranch Package policy lists farm buildings and structures individually (Coverage G) and farm personal property specifically (Coverage E or F) for their true replacement values so that there is no mistaking the intent of the property to be covered, and no business limitation on the use of the property.

The calculation involves dividing the number of lost customers by the number of customers at the start of the period. For customer retention rate (CRR), while it's typically measured annually, it can also be measured quarterly or monthly to track progress. However, the measurement frequency depends on the business model - companies with long-term contracts may measure less frequently, while subscription-based businesses might measure as frequently as daily. When calculating CRR, it's crucial not to include new customers acquired during the measurement period to accurately analyze retention performance.","context":["Guide to customer churn rate\nCustomer churn rate is one of the most important metrics for businesses to track. Find out what is is and why it matters.\nPublished April 22, 2020\nLast updated May 18, 2021\nCustomers can be a fickle bunch—happy one day, gone the next. That’s why it’s important for companies of all shapes and sizes to monitor when customers leave, commonly known as customer churn or customer attrition.\nWhile customer churn is often considered to be a measure of failure rather than success, churn is one of the most important metrics you can track. It impacts nearly every aspect of a company’s business, from product and revenue to customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Because what’s a business without customers?\nRead on to find out what your customer retention rate is, how to calculate it and why it matters.\nWhat is customer churn rate?\nCustomer churn rate is defined as the percentage of a company’s total customers that stop doing business with the company over a specified time period. No matter what you sell, customer churn is one of the most impactful metrics for businesses because it’s the ultimate measure of customer happiness.\nWhen evaluated alongside a company’s other key metrics, a company’s churn rate is a powerful way to assess what a business is doing well, and where it needs to improve.\nDepending on the nature of a company’s business, churn rate may be monitored annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or in the case of some SaaS companies, even daily. While all companies strive to have loyal customers and a churn rate of zero, the reality is that customers come and go. Therefore, it’s important for companies to come to grips with what is causing customers to cut ties with their business and consider customer retention strategies that could help.\nHow to calculate customer churn rate\nTo identify your company's churn rate, choose a period of time you want to measure and identify the following values:\n- Number of customers at the start of the period (X)\n- Number of customers lost during that period (Y)\nThen, use the following formula to determine your customer churn rate (Z) as a percentage.\nCustomer churn rate formula\n(Y/X) *100 = Z\nFor example, if a business had 100 existing customers at the start of the month and lost 10 customers by the end of the month, it would divide 10 into 100, and get .1, or 10 percent. This means the company had a monthly churn rate of 10 percent.\nDepending on the nature of a company’s business, it may also look at churn through the lens of other churn metrics, including recurring revenue lost, decreased engagement with a product, percentage of revenue lost, or any number of variables specific to their product and business. The more granular a company is with churn analysis, the more effective it can be when working to reduce churn with its customer base.\nWhy is customer churn an important metric?\nCustomer churn is an important metric because lost customers equal lost revenue. If a company loses enough customers it can have a serious impact on its bottom line. In fact, according to a study by Bain & Company, improving the customer retention rate for existing customers by just 5 percent can improve a company’s profitability by 25 to 95 percent.\nAnother reason it is so important to improve customer retention and reduce churn is that it’s considerably more expensive to find new customers than it is to keep existing customers. The same study found that customer acquisition costs to find a new customer are five times higher than the cost of keeping an existing customer. So companies that lose customers to churn aren’t just losing the revenue from those customers, but they’re also stuck with the high cost of finding new customers.\nNo matter how good a company’s product or service may be, it’s critical that they understand their customer churn rate, what makes existing customers happy, and focus on their loyal customers to assure they maximize their customer retention rate.\n4 tips for reducing churn\nUnderstanding a company’s churn rate is an important first step—but it’s just that, the first step. Once a company understands how many customers churn, it’s important to find ways to minimize churn and grow their business. Here are 4 steps that companies can take to begin to develop a churn reduction strategy.\nListen to customers\nLoyal customers don’t leave for no reason. It’s important for companies to listen to their customers in the form of surveys, feedback forms, and other customer satisfaction indicators to understand why existing customers are leaving. Businesses should also look inward and consult metrics from all the different touchpoints in the customer journey to find ways to improve the customer experience. If you are a SaaS company, this may involve looking at their customer onboarding process. An online retailer might look at customer success rates when searching for a product.\nIdentify at-risk customers\nIf a company wants to focus on customer retention, it’s important for it to understand which customers are most likely to leave. Of course, that’s easier said than done, but companies should consider the metrics they have available to them and look for patterns that could indicate that a customer is at risk. This can include things like the amount of time since they’ve been in contact with sales, visited a website, or placed an order. Other factors could include negative feedback, product returns, or a poor interaction with customer service. Once a company understands who may be at risk, it’s easier to target them with special offers or enhanced support to try and rebuild customer loyalty.\nDouble down on your best customers\nEven with the best plans in place and advanced customer churn prediction metrics, it’s nearly impossible to get a customer churn rate down to zero. That’s why it’s also important for a company to identify and take care of its best customers. By maximizing sales with the customers that are most likely to buy a company’s product or service, a company can grow to help offset the inevitable churn that it may experience down the road.\nInvest in service and support\nOne-third of customers say that they'll stop doing business with a company after just one bad interaction with customer service. Eighty percent say they’ll leave after multiple bad experiences. Companies that want to cultivate customer loyalty and maintain long-term relationships with their customers can’t afford to deliver sub-par service and support. One of the ways companies can deliver fast, personalized service, and support on all the channels that are most important to customers are with helpdesk or customer relationship management software.\nTurn the churn around\nCustomers are the lifeblood of any business. It’s important for companies to understand customer churn if they want to grow and adapt to meet their customers’ needs. While it can be a scary metric to face, understanding customer churn is the first step to improving any business and managing profitable long-term relationships with customers.\nCompanies that are looking for even more ways to reduce customer churn can learn more here.\nCustomer Experience Guide\nFind out how to create great customer experiences that will lead to loyal customers, improved word-of-mouth promotion, and increased revenue.

Yet, many companies struggle to keep their customers happy because they don't know how to measure, evaluate or improve their customer retention rate.\nThe average annual customer retention rate for the SaaS industry is 50-68%, and, in addition to that, the average company will lose 10-25% of its customers each year. In this article, we'll go into how to measure CRR and strategies you can implement to make sure that you are beating industry averages and retaining as many customers as possible.\n- What customer retention rate is\n- How you can calculate your customer retention rate — both manually and in Excel (we've prepared a template)\n- What a good customer retention rate is\n- Why and how often you should calculate your customer retention rate\n- How to interpret your CRR\n- Strategies you can implement to improve a low customer retention rate and, finally,\n- How software like Fullview can help you increase your CRR\nWhat is customer retention rate?\nCustomer retention rate (AKA CRR or user retention rate) is the percentage of customers who stay with a company over a period of time. It is expressed as a percentage of a company's existing customer base, meaning that if you start with 100 customers and lose 10 over some period of time, your customer retention rate during that period was 90% (i.e., 90 of your existing customers remained customers and didn't churn).\nShould you count new users when measuring user retention?\nIt's important not to include new customers who signed up during that same period when you're calculating your customer retention rate. This is done in order to accurately analyze your customer retention rate and what it means about what you're doing right — and what you could improve upon. Why?\nBecause making up for churn by acquiring new customers is unsustainable and can hide serious issues with your product, customer experiences, or business model. Plus, it's 5 times more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to retain existing ones, so shoring up churn with new acquisitions quickly becomes an expensive enterprise.\nHow often should you measure CRR?\nCRR is typically measured on an annual basis, but it can also be helpful to measure customer retention on a quarterly or monthly basis in order to track progress and identify any potential issues early on. How often you measure customer retention depends very much on your business model: if most of your contracts are long-term or annual contracts, measuring CRR frequently is pointless. In contrast, some subscription or pay-as-you-go businesses can benefit from measuring CRR frequently — over time periods as little as a day, in some cases.\nWhy is it important to measure customer retention rate?\nWhen it comes to customer retention, many companies focus on acquisition and forget about the importance of keeping their customers happy. Here are five reasons why customer retention rate is so important:\n- Lower marketing costs: It's estimated that it costs five times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. By focusing on customer retention, you can reduce your marketing costs and reinvest those savings into other areas of your business.\n- Repeat customers means more profit: When customers feel brand loyalty, they're more likely to make repeat purchases. In fact, according to Bain & Company, a five percent increase in customer retention can lead to a 75 percent increase in profit. Plus, repeat customers also increase the customer lifetime value, which is also an important measure of how viable a SaaS business is.\n- Free word-of-mouth advertising: When customers are happy with your product or service, they're more likely to tell their friends and family about it. This word-of-mouth advertising is invaluable because it comes from a trusted source.\n- Gain valuable feedback: Your customer retention rate can give you both direct and indirect feedback about how healthy your SaaS business is. If you see a sudden drop in customer retention, it could be a sign that something is wrong with your product or service. On the other hand, if you see a steady increase in customer retention, it's a good indication that you're on the right track.\n- Higher purchase values: Existing customers are also more likely to spend more money with your company because they trust your brand, know how to use your product or service, and are more likely to take advantage of upsells and cross-sells.\nHow to calculate customer retention rate?\nCRR is relatively straightforward to calculate. In order to do so, you'll have to:\n- Decide on which time period you want to calculate CRR for. This could be a month, a quarter, a year, or another length of time that makes sense for your company and business model.\n- Identify the customers at the start of this period. If you use CRM software like HubSpot or Intercom, this number is easy to find and automatically tracked.\n- Count the total number of customers at the end of that period. Include both existing and new customers — we'll subtract the number of new customers acquired when we're calculating CRR.\n- Count the number of new customers you have acquired during that time period. We'll need to subtract this number from the total number of customers at the end of the period to arrive at an accurate CRR.\nOnce you've done all of that, you can calculate your customer retention rate using this formula:\nCustomer Retention Rate = ((Customers at the end of the period - New customers acquired during that period) / Customers at the start of that period) x 100\nFor example, if you have:\n- 100 customers at the start of the time period\n- 120 customers at the end of that period\n- 30 new customers acquired during that period\nYour CRR would be:\n((120-30) / 100) x 100\nCan you customer retention rate be negative?\nYes, you can have a negative customer retention rate. But the only way for this to happen is for you to lose some or all of the new customers you acquired during that period as well as existing customers at the start of that period.\nFor example, if you started the period with 5 customers, added 150 customers during that period and ended the period with 100 customers, that would imply that you lost at least 50 new customers during that period.\nUsing the formula above, you would technically end up with a negative customer retention rate:\n((100 - 150) / 5) x 100\nor - 1000%\nHow to calculate customer retention rate in Excel?\nFor an easier way to calculate your customer retention rate, we've made a template you can use (it's ungated and completely free to use — all you have to do is make a copy of it).\nOnce you've made a copy, follow these steps to automatically calculate your customer retention rate:\n- Import a list of customers you had at the beginning of the period in column A\n- Import a list of customers you had at the end of the period in column B\n- Import a list of the new customers you added during that period in column C\nAnd then template will calculate your CRR. Find it by clicking on the image above or here.\nIf you want to create the template yourself, here is the formula: =(((COUNTA(B:B)-1)-(COUNTA(C:C)-1))/(COUNTA(A:A)-1))\nJust remember to import the right customers into the right columns as detailed in the bullet list above.\n10 best ways to increase retention\nIf you calculate your CRR and find it lacking, here are some tried-and-tested ways to increase your customer retention rate:\n- Master your onboarding\n- Personalize your customer experiences\n- Make proactive support a habit\n- Build trust and loyalty\n- Always seek and implement customer feedback\n- Start a loyalty program\n- Provide value\n- Use the right tools\n- Offer the right incentives to customers who are churning\n- Measure your performance and improve it\nHave you ever wondered at what points a customer is most likely to churn? One of the major ones is if they sign up for your product and don’t immediately get a sense of what it is, how to use it, or how it can benefit them. You have to demonstrate value from the minute they log on or you risk losing them. The best way to do this is to design a simple but effective onboarding sequence that hooks them immediately. If yours is a particularly complex product, design your onboarding sequence in stages and make sure there is a clear CTA at each one – even if it is as simple as prompting them to add a team member.\nPersonalize your customer experiences\nNo one likes feeling like just another number on a spreadsheet. It’s crucial to remember that those retention targets you are trying to achieve represent real human beings. One of the best ways to retain a customer is to reach out personally when they sign up. You don’t have to do this for every customer (for example, those on your free plan may not be relevant), but there are certain segments you should absolutely make it a point to develop relationships with. This is also one of the best ways to foster a sense of loyalty in your customer base.\nOffer proactive as opposed to reactive support\nIf a customer is reaching out to you with a problem, it’s likely that they have spent at least some time trying to figure it out on their own before giving up. This means that, when they reach out, they are already feeling a sense of frustration and helplessness. This is why it is so crucial to offer proactive support rather than waiting for customers to reach out to you once they have already encountered a problem. The best way to do this is to invest in a session replays tool that records user sessions in your product. You can then monitor these sessions on an ongoing basis to scan for issues.\nBuild trust and loyalty\nLike every good relationship, your relationship with your customers should be built on a foundation of trust if you want to inspire any brand loyalty. SaaS customers have a lot of choice these days, so your brand reputation counts for a lot. One of the best ways to build this trust is to be completely transparent with your customers and take steps to make sure their data and privacy are protected. Another way to build trust is through social proof in the form of testimonials and reviews.\nAlways seek and implement customer feedback\nCustomer feedback should form the bedrock of any good product. After all, if you aren’t building it with your customers in mind, who are you trying to build it for? It’s a good idea to make it a point to solicit their feedback at relevant points in their customer journey. You can build it into your onboarding sequence, send a short CSAT survey after a customer support interaction or email particularly active users with a longer product survey.\nStart a loyalty program\nAnother great way to ensure that your customers stick with you for the long haul is to incentivize that longevity with a loyalty program. Loyalty programs can take many different forms, so you’ll have to design yours around your particular business. You could, for example, give customers who stick around for a particular amount of time discounts on plans or items. You could start a point-based loyalty program, where customers earn points for every dollar spent. Or you could offer a tiered loyalty program and give customers discounts based on the amount they spend on your platform — the more the spend, the bigger the discount. Again, it all depends on your business model.\nThis one should be evident, but it bears repeating: if you don’t demonstrate value to your customers from the moment they sign up, they are likely to leave and never return. One of the most likely moments for customers to churn is during onboarding and then within the first few days or weeks of signing up for your platform. If you can hold their attention and demonstrate immediate value in that time, they will stick around. However, if you don’t demonstrate any value or make it difficult for them to realize this value, they will likely churn.\nUse the right tools\nIn order to prevent as much churn as possible, it is essential to get your tech stack right and make sure you are investing in the right kinds of software. From customer relationship management software, to customer support software, to your MarTech stack, investing in the right kinds of tools for your business can help you create the best customer experiences.\nOffer the right incentives to customers who are churning\nMost CRM platforms these days have mechanisms in place to alert you when a customer is likely to churn. How do they measure this? With product usage benchmarks that you can customize. To do that, you’ll need to think about what constitutes churn for your business and then monitor that in your CRM. So, for example, if your software is something that people typically use daily and a user has not signed in for a few days, you could define that as them being likely to churn. Once you identify which customers are about to churn, tempt them back with discount codes or other incentives to continue using your product.\nMeasure your performance and improve it\nPreventing customer churn is an ongoing process and it is something that you will have to perfect over time. Because this is something that you will be dealing with for the entire lifecycle of your product, the most important thing is to measure your performance and then constantly seek to improve it. We’ve already put together a list of the most important customer support metrics to track, which is a good place to start. But you will also need to track commercial metrics and marketing metrics to see how optimized your pipelines are and how sticky your product is.\nWrapping things up\nCustomer retention rate (CRR) is an important metric for any business, especially in the SaaS industry where it can be more challenging to retain customers. By measuring CRR regularly, companies can identify any potential issues early on and take the necessary steps to improve customer retention. The benefits of a high CRR are numerous, including lower marketing costs, more profit, free word-of-mouth advertising, valuable feedback, and higher purchase values. To calculate CRR, companies can use a simple formula that takes into account the number of customers gained and lost over a specific period of time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8aa63e35-c85b-4532-9d9a-39c811fe52ac>","<urn:uuid:3cd98de8-3bf8-482c-bbb2-4eb30a655e59>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For an environmental impact study, what's the connection between data security systems and natural resource extraction - specifically how do digital solutions affect mining operations?","answer":"Digital security systems like XML signatures rely on computing infrastructure that requires mineral resources obtained through mining. While digital signatures provide secure document verification using RSA keys and cryptographic processes, the hardware needed for these systems depends on minerals that must be extracted through mining operations.

{"question":"How do acetylcholine and glycine receptors differ in their effects on the nervous system?","answer":"Acetylcholine and glycine receptors have contrasting effects on the nervous system. Acetylcholine can be both excitatory and inhibitory depending on the location, with different effects based on receptor types - it excites skeletal muscles through acetylcholine receptors, inhibits heart muscle via muscarinic receptors, and has varying effects in the brain. In contrast, glycine receptors are primarily inhibitory in the adult vertebrate central nervous system. When glycine binds to its receptor, it opens a chloride channel that prevents membrane depolarization and neuronal firing, thereby inhibiting nerve signals. This glycine-mediated inhibition is important for processing motor and sensory information that controls movement, vision and audition.","context":["Acetylcholine (Ach) was probably not the first neurotransmitter, but it was the first one to be identified. This occurred in 1915 through the work of Henry Hallett Dale, and it is very common in many locations throughout your body.\nAch is an interesting neurotransmitter because it is excitatory in some locations and inhibitory in others.\nIn the Peripheral Nervous System\nAch is the neurotransmitter that activates skeletal muscle. When your brain sends a signal to move your arm Ach is the messenger that transmits the message from the neuron to the muscle.\nActs on Your Heart\nAcetylcholine also affects your heart muscle except on your heart it attaches to a different type of receptor where it causes a slowing or inhibition of your heart muscle contraction.\nIn Your Autonomic Nervous System\nYour autonomic nervous system is composed of your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.\nAcetylcholine is one of the major neurotransmitters these systems used to control your organs and other body parts without you thinking about.These autonomic reactions are known as your \"fight or flight\" and your \"rest and digest\" responses.\nWithin Your Brain\nAch is the neurotransmitter involved in many important functions of your brain. It has been shown to strengthen strong nerve signals and filter out weak signals coming into your brain.\nThe connections that it makes between parts of your brain play a part in the reward and arousal behaviors related to drug abuse, food intake, and sustaining attention.\nThis neurotransmitter that is found in so many different areas and has so many different effects accomplishes this by attaching to many different types of receptors. The stimulation of different types of receptors causes different types of responses.\nOn skeletal muscle it attaches to acetylcholine receptors.\nOn cardiac muscle it attaches to muscarinic receptors.\nIn the sympathetic nervous system it stimulates the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.\nWithin the brain its effects, both excitatory and inhibitory, will vary depending on the site of release and the receptor subtypes available at that location.\nDoctors can use medications to block certain receptors or to manipulate your Ach levels. They are attempting to cause specific reactions within your body.\nSide effects and other problems can develop when other receptors are also blocked or the altered levels of Ach cause unintended reactions.\n•Atropine blocks muscarinic receptors\nThis will cause dilation of your pupils, decreased stomach acid, and is also helpful in treating Parkinson's disease. It may also cause dry mouth, photophobia, and increased heart rate.\n•Bethanechol mimics the action of Ach.\nThis will stimulate activity of the intestinal tract and is also helpful treating urinary retention. It may also cause nausea, vomiting, and sweating.\n•Tacrine blocks Ach breakdown.\nThis medication is used to treat Alzheimer's disease. It may also cause confusion, seizures, and changes in behavior.\n•Scopolamine blocks muscarinic receptors in your brain .\nThis helps to treat motion sickness, dizziness, and nausea. It may also cause blurred vision, sensitivity to light, and agitation.\n•Physostigmine blocks Ach breakdown .\nThis treatment is used to diagnose and treat myasthenia gravis. It also lowers pressure within your eye and is used to treat glaucoma. It may also cause headaches, stomach pain, and anorexia.\nMany of these medications can be very helpful for improving your life. However, whenever you start a new medicine you should discuss possible side effects with your doctor because any new treatment can have unintended consequences.\nAch is a neurotransmitter that is found throughout your body and it serves many different valuable functions. Researchers are working to find ways to manipulate or control it to help manage many different diseases.\nMaybe these can also help:","Glycine receptor alpha (IPR008127)\nShort name: Glycine_rcpt_A\nOverlapping homologous superfamilies\n- Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channel (IPR006201)\n- Gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor/Glycine receptor alpha (IPR006028)\nGlycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter (NT) in the adult vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Glycinergic synapses have a well-established role in the processing of motor and sensory information that controls movement, vision and audition [PMID: 11396606]. This action of glycine is mediated through its interaction with the glycine receptor (GlyR): an intrinsic chloride channel is opened in response to agonist binding. The subsequent influx of anions prevents membrane depolarisation and neuronal firing induced by excitatory NTs. Strychnine acts as a competitive antagonist of glycine binding, thereby reducing the activity of inhibitory neurones. Poisoning with strychnine is characterised by over-excitation, muscle spasms and convulsions. Whilst glycine is the principal physiological agonist at GlyRs, taurine and beta-alanine also behave as agonists [PMID: 11437237]. Compounds that modulate GlyR activity include zinc, some alcohols and anaesthetics, picrotoxin, cocaine and some anticonvulsants. GlyRs were thought for some time to be localised exclusively in the brain stem and spinal cord, but have since been found to be expressed more widely, including the cochlear nuclei, cerebellar cortex and forebrain [PMID: 11358478].\nGlyRs belong to the ligand-gated ion channel family, which also includes the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) and serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptors [PMID: 10414351]. Affinity-purified GlyR was found to contain two glycosylated membrane proteins of 48kDa and 56kDa, corresponding to alpha and beta subunits, respectively. Four genes encoding alpha subunits have been identified (GLRA1 to 4), together with a single beta polypeptide (GLRB). The heterogeneity of alpha subunits is further increased by alternative exon splicing, yielding two isoforms of GLRA1 to 3 [PMID: 11358478]. The characteristics of different GlyR subtypes, therefore, can be largely explained by their GLRA content.\nGlyRs are generally believed to adopt a pentameric structure in vivo: five subunits assemble to form a ring structure with a central pore. Typically, a stoichiometry of 3:2 (alpha:beta) is observed [PMID: 11437237]. GlyR subunits share a high overall level of sequence similarity both with themselves and with the subunits of the GABAA and nACh receptors. Four highly conserved segments have been proposed to correspond to transmembrane (TM) alpha helices (TM1-4), the second of which is thought to contribute to the pore wall [PMID: 11358478]. A long extracellular N-terminal segment precedes TM1 and a long cytoplasmic loop links TM3 and 4. Short cytoplasmic and extracellular loops join TM1-2 and TM2-3, respectively, and a short C-terminal sequence follows TM4. Studies using radiolabelled strychnine have shown the alpha subunit to be responsible for ligand binding, the critical residues for this interaction lying within the N-terminal domain. The beta subunit plays a structural role, contributing one of its TM domains to the pore wall as well as playing a putative role in postsynaptic clustering of the receptor.\nIn several mammalian species, defects in glycinergic transmission are associated with complex motor disorders. Mutations in the gene encoding GLRA1 give rise to hyperplexia, or startle disease [PMID: 1323284]. This is characterised by muscular spasms in response to unexpected light or noise stimuli, similar to the symptoms of sublethal doses of strychnine. The mutations result in amino acid substitutions within the TM1-2 and TM3-4 loops, suggesting that these regions are involved in the transduction of ligand binding into channel activation.\n- PR01673 (GLYRALPHA)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2d884b74-2265-4e7c-962c-71a4087fa87e>","<urn:uuid:db394ed7-217b-4b4d-bc51-b5cc0890dc73>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the judging process for selecting winners in the Storm Photography contest?","answer":"The judging process involves multiple stages: First, all submitted photos are sorted into categories and reviewed by judges for potential Shortlist inclusion. The Shortlist is then narrowed down to 30 images for Single Image categories and 15 portfolio groups for Photographer of the Year. Judges conduct video critiques of Shortlisted images, which are posted online. Through offline voting, judges select Top 10/6 Finalists, who must provide RAW files within 48 hours when notified. Another round of video critiques follows for Finalists, and judges vote offline to determine Top 3 in each category. Winners are announced live on Zoom and via email. Judging criteria includes color correction, editing quality, uniqueness, emotion, drama, and power. For Photographer of the Year, variety is also considered.","context":["(Updated for 2023)\nFirst off, what constitutes “Storm Photography”?\nBefore we get into the rules, we know the definition of “storm photography” is probably going to be different for everyone. Photography is subjective already – art is subjective – so we realize a standard definition for this is likely impossible. But we understand the photographs that get submitted will vary from things like a light rain shower with some sunset colors to a full blown tornado destroying a cornfield.\nA storm is defined as “a violent disturbance of the atmosphere with strong winds and usually rain, thunder, or lightning”. Our judges will be looking for photos that fall into that broad definition. Dramatic, beautiful images that capture the power of storms. But also stunning scenes, fantastic compositions, and unique moments. A haunting rainbow could be just as powerful an image of a tornado a few feet away from the photographer. Bottom line is that “storm photography” will be determined based on the opinion and expertise of our judges.\nWho Can Enter\nThe contest is open to any professional or amateur photographer who personally photographed the images they are submitting, have full copyrights, and the image was taken in the past year (2022). By entering your image into this contest, you are confirming that it belongs to you and does not violate any laws where you might reside.\nWho Can’t Enter\nThose who judge the competition, the owners of this site and the owners/judges’ family members are ineligible to enter.\nEntry Period and Important Dates\nThe time in which photos can be submitted will be from February 1st, 10:00AM ET, 2023 to February 28th, 11:59pm ET 2023. Winners will be announced on March 30th, 2023.\nFeb 1st – Contest Opened\nFeb 28th – Contest Closed\nMarch 16th – Video Critique for Selections Review Posted\nMarch 23rd – Video Critique for Finalists Review Posted\nMarch 30th – Live Zoom Award Show!\nHow to Enter the Contest\nYou can only submit your photos for entry through our Enter Contest page. The submission process will come with a fee of $10 for one image submitted to our “Single Image” categories (currently Storm Photo of the Year, Tornado Photo of the Year), and $5 for any additional photos submitted to those categories. The fee will be $25 for our “Multiple Image” categories (currently Storm Photographer of the Year). You can enter as many categories as you’d like, but you can only submit one entry for Storm Photographer of the Year.\nPhoto Requirements and Restrictions\nAll submitted photos will be required to follow these guidelines and rules:\n- Any photo you submit must have been taken in the previous year (2022).\n- Each submitted photo must include date, location, and a short caption. It also must be in JPG format.\n- Every submission should include social media channels we can link, mainly Instagram and Twitter. You can add this during checkout.\n- Submitting for the Photographer of the Year award will require 10 photographs to have all been taken on at LEAST SEVEN DIFFERENT DATES. This is a change from our first contest…meaning you can have more than one photo taken on the same day, but seven of your ten submitted must at least be taken on different dates.\n- If you are a Finalist, you MUST produce the corresponding RAW file(s) to the judges within 24 hours of it being requested. We may also request the high resolution JPG(s) for a more detailed critique.\n- If you CANNOT provide a RAW file, IE. you took the photo in JPG only, you must provide overwhelming proof that nothing was majorly manipulated or changed. Video proof, other photos showing the original scene would be acceptable. Judges will determine if it’s enough evidence.\n- At this time, we will not be allowing composites, digital art or stacks. Panoramas are okay.\n- Photos need to be at least 2000 pixels wide for landscape orientation and 2000 pixels tall for portrait orientation.\n- All submitted photos should as faithfully as possible represent the scene captured. We understand and expect all the standard RAW file editing that goes into making a beautiful photograph, and while some removal of small objects, power lines, etc is to be expected, anything that vastly affects the original scene will be in jeopardy of being rejected if the original RAW file is too manipulated from the original. This will be solely up to what the judges deem acceptable.\n- Any photo submitted must not violate any licensing terms or exclusive rights that the photographer has made with other parties. An entry into The Storm Photo Contest confirms you have the legal right to submit and we will not be held responsible for any violations in this matter.\nWinning and Judging Criteria\nThe following guidelines lay out exactly how winners will be selected.\n- All submitted photos will be sorted into their specific award categories. All images will be reviewed by judges and Selections will be made for potential Shortlist inclusion.\n- The Selections will then be judged and narrowed down to the Shortlist: 30 images for the Single Image categories and 15 portfolio groups for Photographer of the Year. This process will happen internally by the judges.\n- The Shortlist Review will be conducted by the judges on video with each image critiqued and discussed. Videos will be posted to our page and YouTube channels.\n- Judges will vote offline on each of the Shortlisted images and determine the Top 10/6 Finalists in each category.\n- Finalists will be notified via email and RAW files/high res JPGs will be requested. Finalists have 48 hours to respond.\n- Any Finalist who does not respond, or has no RAW file to provide, will be replaced by the next image in the judging order.\n- The Finalist review will be conducted on video with the judges critiquing each image once again, with more detailed discussion on strengths and weaknesses. This video will be posted to our page and YouTube channels.\n- The judge will vote offline to determine the Top 3 in each category.\n- Winners will be announced live on Zoom, and will be invited to participate on the Zoom call to discuss the winning images with our judges. Winners will also be notified via email and a press release will go to our website and social media channels!\nJudging any kind of image or art is always going to be subjective. All of our judges are professional photographers and specialize in storm and/or landscape imagery, and will be looking for high quality work to be deemed the winner in each category. Here are some of the criteria our judges will be using when reviewing/critiquing images:\n- Color correction/white balance\n- Overall editing quality\n- Uniqueness of the image or subject\n- Emotion, drama and power\n- For the Photographer of the Year award, variety will also be a factor in the consideration\nThe prizes for each award will be as follows (Still in flux):\n- Grand/First Place Prizes: $750 and a 20×30 Metal Print of Winning Image supplied by ImageCraft. In the case of the Photographer of the Year, the winner will choose which of their winning images to have printed.\n- Tornado of the Year will win $500 and a 20×30 Metal Print of Winning Image\n- Lightning Photo of the Year will win $250 and a Lightning Trigger IV\n- The Photojournalism Award will win $150\nHow Your Images Will Be Used\nWe want our contest to be different. Most of the big, commercial contests out there make you sign your life away and have big terms of usage agreements that essentially give them the rights to use your image commercially for any means they want. We want Storm Photos of the Year to be a safe space for photographers to enter their work and know it will never be used for anything other than promotion of the artist and the contest.\nHow your images will be used:\n- Any image posted online will be Watermarked with the Storm Photo of the Year logo in the bottom corner and artist name will be credited wherever possible.\n- Images will be shared on our Instagram channel (@StormPhotoContest), Twitter (@TheStormys), Facebook (@StormPhotosOfTheYear) and our blog/website/YouTube (The critiques) to help promote the contest and the photographer.\n- Any image we post on social media, such as Instagram or Twitter, will tag/mention the photographer so long as they provided us usernames and also have accounts there. If you provide another link to your work, like an online gallery, website, YouTube, etc., we will endeavor to link to those instead where we can.\n- The goal of the contest is to not only provide prizes and recognition to the photographer, but also as much publicity as we can for everyone. Therefore the contest results and images may be shared by media outlets when winners are announced and we will ensure that any publications that do write about the contest use only the watermarked images with corresponding artist credit alongside. Since it is a public contest, sharing the results of it online by media would be considered fair use.\nWhile want to remain different from other contests and focus solely on showcasing the best storm photography out there, we are still a company and need to protect ourselves. Therefore here are things lawyers think are important:\nWinners are responsible for all taxes from prizes. Monetary prizes over $600 will be reported via 1099 in the United States.\nStorm Photos of the Year = The Contest\nSubmissions amount to a perpetual non-limited license for The Contest to use photos as exemplars of entries and winners, to promote the contest, but not for other commercial usage (I.E. we wont sell your photos). Any commercial opportunities that arise from this contest about the images posted will be passed on to the photographer.\nIn the unlikely scenario that the operation of The Contest is impaired or unable to continue, The Contest will choose to either pause until it can resume at a later time or award prizes based on the eligible entries up until the time of impairment. The Contest reserves the right to disqualify or seek damages from any individual that tampers with The Contest, violates the Official Rules or acts in an unsportsmanlike manner.\nBy submitting and participating in The Contest, the entrants agree to release and hold harmless The Contest, associated judges and sponsors from any liability, claims of loss or damages that arise from being part of The Contest, including but not limited to: human interventions; copyright violation out of our control; mistakes in the administering of the contest; use or misuse of any photo, including claims based on copyright, publicity rights, defamation or invasion of privacy.\nThe Contest, judges and sponsors are not responsible if any prize cannot be awarded due to cancellations, delays, or interruptions due to acts of god, acts of war, natural disasters, pandemics, weather or terrorism.\nEntrants waive the right to claim any attorneys’ fees and any damages or losses whatsoever, including, but not limited to, punitive, consequential, incidental, direct, or indirect damages.\nAll entrants become part of our mailing list automatically.

{"question":"What role does temperature monitoring play in maintaining both hydraulic systems and bearings, and what are the acceptable temperature ranges for each?","answer":"Temperature monitoring is crucial for both systems but with different acceptable ranges. For bearings, normal operating temperatures range from 27 to 66 degrees C, with most bearings rated for -29 to 121 degrees C. Temporary temperature spikes of up to 10 degrees C are normal at start-up, and -1 degree C after re-lubrication. For hydraulic systems, most run in the 110-150°F range, with mobile hydraulic systems running up to 250°F. For water-based hydraulic fluid, temperature should not go below 140°F to prevent water evaporation. In both cases, overheating can cause serious problems - in bearings, it can lead to lubrication breakdown and failure, while in hydraulic systems it can cause oxidation leading to varnish and sludge deposits.","context":["11 bearing myths debunked\nHow to avoid the easily avoidable problems.\nThe wheels of industry turn on bearings, so why do they vibrate, clatter, squeak, drag and overheat? Bearings fail for lots of reasons. Most failures are related to lubrication and contamination, but myths and misconceptions handed from one generation of maintenance engineers to the next help perpetuate many easily avoidable problems. Here are 11 of the most common false notions and what to do about them.\n1. It’s okay to hammer a bearing into position if needed. A direct hammer blow leaves dents in the raceway that cause noise and dramatically reduce bearing life. If installation is difficult, first check the shaft diameter and look for burrs, dirt or corrosion. If needed, use a press to slide the bearing on. Apply pressure equally on the face of the inner ring to avoid damaging the raceways and rolling elements.\n2. Off-the-shelf TGP shafting is the best option. It’s more important to know the shaft’s tolerance range to ensure it meets the spec for diameter and roundness. Review the manufacturer’s recommendations and measure/specify the correct diameter.\n3. It’s fine to hand-tighten setscrews one at a time. Under tightening allows the bearing to slip on the shaft. Over tightening distorts the raceway or cracks the inner ring. Tighten the first setscrew to half the recommended torque, the second setscrew to the full torque, then go back to the first setscrew and apply full torque.\n4. Bearings should not be hot to the touch. Normal bearing operating temperatures range from 27 to 66 degrees C, but some applications run higher or lower. Most bearings are rated for -29 to 121 degrees C, but special grease, seals or heat stabilizing processes allow them to operate at higher temperatures. Bearings normally run hotter at start up or right after re-lubrication because excess grease increases drag and friction. Spikes up to 10 degrees C are normal at start-up, and -1 degree C after re-lubrication. Steady-state temperatures resume as the rolling elements purge excess grease through the seals.\n5. Bigger bearings are always better. They may show a higher fatigue life, but if the load does not achieve the minimum requirement, rolling elements skid along the raceway. This causes high temperatures, excessive wear, lubrication breakdown and failure.\n6. Sealed/lubed-for-life bearings will last forever. Bearing life depends on the grease, which is affected by the operating conditions (speed and load) and environment (temperature and contamination). Grease life improves with enhanced seals, proper installation and proper selection.\n7. Re-lubrication once a year is sufficient. Start by reviewing the manufacturer’s lubrication recommendations, but actual intervals may vary quite a bit, depending on load, speed, temperature or environmental conditions. Applications with higher speeds, temperatures or heavy contamination sometimes require weekly or even daily relubrication. By contrast, a mounted ball bearing in a lightly loaded, low-speed, clean environment may do fine with 12- to 24-month intervals. Certain applications may need to be monitored and lubrication intervals/amounts adjusted accordingly.\nRe-lubrication replenishes grease that temperature breaks down or deteriorates. Pumping in new grease also helps flush away contamination.\n8. Always add grease until it purges from the seal. Doing so will probably fill the bearing cavity, which increases operating temperature and may create enough pressure to blow out the seal. However, in low-speed or dirty conditions where contamination may easily enter the seals, filling a bearing may help improve performance. Application experience will dictate when the entire bearing cavity should be filled.\n9. Add grease if a bearing makes noise. Noise indicates internal damage has likely occurred. Adding grease may provide temporary relief, but a noisy bearing should be closely monitored and replaced at the first opportunity. Be sure to investigate the root of the failure.\n10. Any grease will do. Greases do differ. Some may be incompatible because of the different thickeners (soaps) used. For example, many electric motors use a polyurea thickener while some mounted ball bearings use lithium-complex thickeners. These greases are borderline compatible, but depending on the actual make up, may not work together. Grease types will also be incompatible based on the viscosity or type of oil in the grease.\n11. Just shoot grease through the fitting. It’s better to always clean grease fittings and the grease gun tip. Put the tip in an oil bath or protect it with a plastic cover. A plant’s uptime and OEE may “turn” on bearing health. If you are falling short of desired operational life, ask the bearing manufacturer to assist you with selection and troubleshooting.\nThis article was provided by industrial technology provider Emerson Industrial Automation, Power Transmission Solutions, based in Florence, Ky., with Canadian offices in Rexdale and Unionville, Ont.

Luckily, proper hydraulic maintenance can prevent most of your problems, including leaks, as well as maximize hydraulic system uptime. After all, hydraulic maintenance requirements are not that complicated if you have a detailed preventive maintenance program on hand. In this article, learn about hydraulic fluid maintenance, preventive maintenance task lists, and how to measure the success of your hydraulic maintenance program.\nMost Important Questions to Ask Yourself Before You Start\nNow before we dive in any further into the hydraulic maintenance best practices, start from asking yourself a few simple questions:\n- What is my hydraulic system workload?\n- Is my hydraulic system operating at maximum flow and pressure higher than 70%?\n- What are the system operating conditions? Is my equipment located in a relatively hot and dirty environment?\n- What are the equipment manufacturers’ requirements when it comes to preventive maintenance for each piece of hydraulic equipment?\n- What are the requirements of hydraulic system components’ manufacturers when it comes to hydraulic fluid contamination and ISO particulate?\n- What are the requirements of filter manufacturers?\n- Is the previous maintenance history available? If yes, what is the history?\nThree Types of Hydraulic Maintenance Explained\nThere are three main types of hydraulic maintenance: reactive maintenance (RM), preventive maintenance (PM) and predictive maintenance (PdM).\nReactive maintenance stands for breakdown maintenance and involves the repairs that are done to fix the equipment that is already broken.\nPreventive maintenance is regular maintenance that is performed on the equipment to prevent it from breaking down. Preventive Maintenance is implemented through a Preventive Maintenance Program.\nPredictive Maintenance or condition-based maintenance uses sensor devices to collect information about the system and components and prompts the personnel to perform maintenance at the exact moment when it’s needed. Due to high costs and technical requirements, it is still new to the market and not used very often.\nPreventive Maintenance Program\nThe Preventive Maintenance Program is defined by the operating conditions and manufacturer requirements for each individual component and for the system as a whole. To start, you should write down or update the procedures for each preventive maintenance tasks. We recommend having a written copy of the Preventive Maintenance Program even if you own a small business and do not have a maintenance technician on staff. It is vital that all maintenance employees know, understand, and follow the maintenance procedures explicitly created for your business.\nHydraulic Fluid Maintenance Best Practices\nSince the hydraulic system uses hydraulic fluid to power hydraulic machinery, you should pay extra attention to hydraulic fluid maintenance and care. Hydraulic fluid performs many functions, including minimizing wear and tear, reducing friction, removing heat, protecting the system from rust and deposits, removing debris, and dirt from the system.\nThe most common problems that cause hydraulic fluid going bad are system overheating, system contamination, and dirty operating environment. Therefore, to take care of the hydraulic fluid, you should take the following actions:\n- Prevent the hydraulic system from overheating. Hydraulic fluid gets hot while being pushed through the pumps, tubing, and relief valves. If the system’s temperature is too low, the condensation starts in the reservoir, which can cause pump cavitation. On the contrary, if the temperature is too high, oxidation that causes varnish and sludge deposits occurs. Most hydraulic systems run in the 110-150°F range with mobile hydraulic systems running up to 250°F. If you use a water-based hydraulic fluid, don’t let the temperature go below 140°F, so the water does not evaporate from the fluid. Perform regular checks of the oil cooler and outside the reservoir to prevent overheating.\n- Keep the System Clean. Prevent contamination of the system by dirt, water, metal debris from entering the system by keeping the reservoir cover, drain lines, and breather fill openings always clean.\n- Keep the Fluid Clean. Test oil regularly for contaminants. Store hydraulic fluid in the designated containers in the clean environment, clean the fill cap before adding hydraulic fluid. Change and check fluid filters on a regular basis. Filter oil added to the system through portable filters to achieve better results.\nHydraulic Preventive Maintenance Task List\nAs a general recommendation technician or equipment operator shall perform a weekly scan of the equipment to make sure it’s functioning properly.\nThe typical weekly Preventive Maintenance list should include, but is not limited to the following tasks:\n- Check hydraulic fluid levels. Add hydraulic fluid of the same brand and viscosity grade if needed using portable filters when applicable.\n- Check breather caps, filters, and fill screens.\n- Check return/pressure/hydraulic filter indicators and pressure gauges for readings.\n- Sample hydraulic fluid for color, visible signs of contamination, and odor.\n- Check system temperature using a built-in or spot infrared thermometer. If the temperature is higher than recommended by the manufacturer, check the condition of the cooler and relief valve settings.\n- Inspect inside of the hydraulic reservoir for any signs of aeration. Use a flashlight and look into the fill hose for any signs of foaming or small whirlpools. Aeration may be a sign of a leak in the suction line or faulty shaft seals, so it’s important to inspect the reservoir on a regular basis.\n- Inspect hydraulic hoses, tubing, and fittings for leaks and frays. Remember that any leakage is an environmental and safety hazard since hydraulic fluid gets hot inside the system and is highly toxic. If the fluid level gets too low, the system will operate at reduced capacity and will get overheated.\n- Inspect proportional/servo valves for overheating. High temperature means that the valve is sticking.\n- Listen to the pump for making any unusual noise. The noise may be a sign of cavitation. Cavitation is the formation of bubbles or so-called cavities in the hydraulic fluid and is caused by the air that gathers in the areas of relatively low pressure around an impeller. It damages the pump, decreases the flow, and causes vibration if not treated.\n- Scan the electric drive motor with a handheld infrared thermometer for hot spots.\nTracking Success Made Easy\nTo measure the success of a hydraulic maintenance program, you need to watch for the three key metrics:\n- track downtime if any\n- calculate costs associated with the downtime\n- test the hydraulic fluid\nLet’s focus on each of them individually. You’ve done everything in our list of preventive maintenance tasks, but the equipment still broke down. Now that it happened learn how to measure the effects of the downtime on your business.\nFirst, identify which of the components of the hydraulic system has failed. Then try to determine what caused the failure. It can be anything from wear and tear associated with time to the low quality of the components. Finally, make sure the part was replaced or repaired and discuss with the team if the failure could have been prevented.\nAfter fixing the system, it’s time to calculate costs associated with the downtime. To do that, add the costs associated with the part replacement or repair, labor, and money lost while not using the equipment.\nAs the last step, analyze hydraulic fluid for contaminants, including metals and water. Fluid analysis is one of the most important diagnostic tools and gives you information on filter performance as well as internal leakages and wear debris. Luckily, in 80% of the time, hydraulic failures can be prevented by analyzing the fluid.\nSchedule a service visit\nWe've recently expanded our field service capabilities to include industrial hydraulic systems.

{"question":"How does the range at cruise speed compare between the HSV X1 Joint Venture and the USS Little Rock (LCS-9)?","answer":"Both vessels have the same range at cruise speed of 4,000 nautical miles. This is specifically mentioned for both the HSV X1 Joint Venture in its operational capabilities and for the USS Little Rock (LCS-9) in its ship design specifications.","context":["Launched in 1998, Hull 050 began its operational life trading as the Devil Cat between Devonport and Melbourne before moving to New Zealand in May 1999 to introduce that country’s first high speed roll-on roll-off ferry services across the notorious Cook Strait between the north and south islands.\nAt the end of her New Zealand role the vessel was taken on charter by the US military. Their brief; to use the high speed craft to demonstrate its ability to perform specific mission scenarios and limited operational experiments in order to assess its usefulness in US Military and Coast Guard applications which require a platform to move troops, heavy military vehicles and equipment.\nSeveral component commands of the Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard combined their resources to lease the Joint Venture for an initial one year period. Units in the experiment included the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command, the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the Coast Guard’s Deep Water Project, the Office of Naval Research, the Navy Warfare Development Command and the Naval Special Warfare Command home of the Sea, Air and Land (SEALS) teams.\nFor Incat the task of converting a practically brand new commercial ferry for military service was taken in its stride. The task was simple; modify and equip the vessel for troop transportation, including the construction and installation of a helo deck capable of accommodating military helicopters. In a world first for high speed craft, a 472 square metre helicopter deck was fitted to the vessel to handle large helicopters such as the SH-60 Seahawk and the CH-46 Sea Knight. The helo deck and a two part hydraulically operated vehicle ramp to allow rapid loading and discharge of vehicles from the stern or alongside were both designed by Incat’s Hobart based design team to meet full military specifications.\nOne of the first accomplishments of the newly named HSV X1 Joint Venture was a winter crossing of the North Atlantic. In early February, 2002, she shot across the Atlantic from her base at the Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base, in Norfolk, Va, to Rota, Spain in just five days and fifteen hours. The US Navy’s fastest amphibious assault ships, in contrast, could cruise no faster than 24 knots. Furthermore, they require a draft of 8 metres of water to navigate. The Joint Venture can operate in only 3.6 metres of water, enabling it to come much closer to the shore than traditional naval vessels.\nHSV 1X JOINT VENTURE MILESTONES\nDuring exercises in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast, HSV X1 Joint Venture served as the command and control ship for a mine warfare readiness group of five other vessels. The squadron’s commander, Navy Captain Richard C Rush, said the catamaran’s capabilities enabled him to “think out of the box”. He added: “There are many things that you do with this ship that you can’t do with a minesweeper, which only has a speed of eight to ten knots.”.\nIt immediately became very apparent that the vessel could be used in active scenarios and it was not long before she went on station in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedon. The HSV X1 Joint Venture played a special operations role in the first days of the war, serving as a floating forward staging base for Marine anti-terrorist security units and Navy SEAL teams.\nMajor General Robert T. Dail said, “The testing of the HSV X1 Joint Venture during the lease period is part of the Army’s transformation goal of being able to deploy a combat ready brigade anywhere in the world within 96 hours, a division in 120 hours and 5 divisions within 30 days. We’re very excited about what we’re doing”.\n“The HSV X1 Joint Venture has proven its value in the Persian Gulf. The ship travelled 5, 191 nautical miles in seven days to reach Kuwait from Rota, Spain before spending 61 days on a variety of missions in the Persian Gulf,” he said.\nRANGE AND ENDURANCE\nRange and endurance are not problems for Incat’s wave piercing catamarans. They are designed to have a cruising range of 4,000 nautical miles at 20 knots and can be refuelled at sea. In fact, HSV X1 Joint Venture circumnavigated the globe in 31 sailing days over a period of 7 months, travelling from Australia through the Panama Canal to the US Gulf Coast, then on to Little Creek, Virginia. She then made her less than 6 day Atlantic crossing to the United Kingdom. From there, she conducted exercises and tests in the extreme weather conditions along the cost of, and in the fjords of, Norway. From there, responding to the call for support for the war on terrorism, HSV X1 Joint Venture proceeded to Gibraltar and on through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the coalition counter terrorism base in Djibouti. Then she sailed on to the Persian Gulf. After servicing in Gulf waters, she crossed the Indian Ocean and proceeded back across the Pacific Ocean to the US West Coast.\nHSV X1 Joint Venture did much more than just ferry supplies back and forth in the Persian Gulf during Iraqi Freedom. She also took part in her first combat operations, serving as a special operations ‘mothership’. Details of this action were written up in Marine Corps Times. The Joint Venture deployed Navy SEALs and US Marine Corps Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Teams (FAST) in Mark V craft and Rigid Inflatable boats. The SEAL’s and Marines seized two major offshore oil terminals at the entrance to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. Navy Captain Phil Beierl remarked, “For the first few hours of the war, we were the most forward ship in the US Navy.”\nIn 2004 while the ship operated in Korean waters, two Black Hawk helicopters landed on its flight deck, the first such landings on an Army vessel since the Vietnam War.\nCOMPLETION OF CHARTER\nSpeaking towards the end of the charter period Colonel Genaro Dellarocco, US Army commented, “HSV X1 Joint Venture has done very well during the lease, the senior Army leadership are very impressed and it has gotten their attention. It literally delivers Army transformation”.\nTo date four Incat built high speed wave piercing catamarans have entered military service. The HSV 1X Joint Venture (Hull 050) was preceded by HMAS Jervis Bay (Hull 045) for the Royal Australian Navy, and followed by US Army Vessel (USAV) Theatre Support Vessel TSV 1X Spearhead (Hull 060) and the US Navy’s HSV 2 Swift (Hull 061).","The Navy commissioned its newest Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the future USS Little Rock (LCS-9), during an 11 a.m. EST ceremony Saturday, December 16, at the Canalside waterfront in Buffalo, New York.\nThe future USS Little Rock, designated LCS-9, is the 10th littoral combat ship to enter the fleet and the fifth of the Freedom-variant design. It is the second warship named for the Arkansas state capital and will be commissioned alongside the first USS Little Rock (CL-92), which serves as a museum at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park.\nArkansas Senator John Boozman delivered the ceremony’s principal address. Mrs. Janee L. Bonner, spouse of the Honorable Josiah «Jo» Bonner, a former U.S. representative from Alabama, is serving as the ship’s sponsor. In a time-honored Navy tradition, she gave the order to «man our ship and bring her to life»!\n«The future USS Little Rock represents much more than the state capital of Arkansas, it represents service», said Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer. «This ship would not exist without the dedicated service of the men and women of Marinette Marine, who can be proud of the accomplishment of putting another warship to sea. Once commissioned, this ship will provide presence around the globe for decades to come».\nLCS is a modular, reconfigurable ship, designed to meet validated fleet requirements for Surface Warfare (SUW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Mine CounterMeasures (MCM) missions in the littoral region. An interchangeable mission package is embarked on each LCS and provides the primary mission systems in one of these warfare areas. Using an open architecture design, modular weapons, sensor systems and a variety of manned and unmanned vehicles to gain, sustain and exploit littoral maritime supremacy, LCS provides U.S. joint force access to critical areas in multiple theaters.\nThe LCS-class consists of the Freedom variant and Independence variant, designed and built by two industry teams. The Freedom variant team is led by Lockheed Martin (for the odd-numbered ships, e.g. LCS-1). The Independence variant team is led by Austal USA (for LCS-6 and follow-on even-numbered ships). Twenty-nine LCS ships have been awarded to date: 11 have been delivered to the U.S. Navy, five are in various stages of construction and three are in pre-production states.\nShip Design Specifications\n|Hull||Advanced semiplaning steel monohull|\n|Length Overall||389 feet/118.6 m|\n|Beam Overall||57 feet/17.5 m|\n|Draft||13.5 feet/4.1 m|\n|Full Load Displacement||Approximately 3,200 metric tons|\n|Top Speed||Greater than 40 knots/46 mph/74 km/h|\n|Range at top speed||1,000 NM/1,151 miles/1,852 km|\n|Range at cruise speed||4,000 NM/4,603 miles/7,408 km|\n|Watercraft Launch and Recovery||Up to Sea State 4|\n|Aircraft Launch and Recovery||Up to Sea State 5|\n|Propulsion||Combined diesel and gas turbine with steerable water jet propulsion|\n|Power||85 MW/113,600 horsepower|\n|Hangar Space||Two MH-60 Romeo Helicopters|\n|One MH-60 Romeo Helicopter and three Vertical Take-off and Land Tactical Unmanned Air Vehicles (VTUAVs)|\n|Core Crew||Less than 50|\n|Accommodations for 75 sailors provide higher sailor quality of life than current fleet|\n|Integrated Bridge System||Fully digital nautical charts are interfaced to ship sensors to support safe ship operation|\n|Core Self-Defense Suite||Includes 3D air search radar|\n|Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) gunfire control system|\n|Rolling-Airframe Missile Launching System|\n|57-mm Main Gun|\n|Mine, Torpedo Detection|\n|Decoy Launching System|\n|USS Freedom (LCS-1)||06-02-2005||09-23-2006||11-08-2008||San Diego, California|\n|USS Fort Worth (LCS-3)||07-11-2009||12-07-2010||09-22-2012||San Diego, California|\n|USS Milwaukee (LCS-5)||10-27-2011||12-18-2013||11-21-2015||San Diego, California|\n|USS Detroit (LCS-7)||08-11-2012||10-18-2014||10-22-2016||San Diego, California|\n|USS Little Rock (LCS-9)||06-27-2013||07-18-2015||12-16-2017||San Diego, California|\n|USS Sioux City (LCS-11)||02-19-2014||01-30-2016|\n|USS Wichita (LCS-13)||02-09-2015||09-17-2016|\n|USS Billings (LCS-15)||11-02-2015||07-01-2017|\n|USS Indianapolis (LCS-17)||07-18-2016|\n|USS St. Louis (LCS-19)||05-17-2017|\n|USS Minneapolis/St. Paul (LCS-21)|\n|USS Cooperstown (LCS-23)|\n|USS Marinette LCS-25|\n|USS Nantucket (LCS-27)|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2aec6d86-c817-455f-bd78-c3ad35396d87>","<urn:uuid:5acb0f87-7a98-4f61-9f27-a84464715e94>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the earliest age at which female horses and greyhounds can begin racing?","answer":"Greyhounds must be at least 16 months old before they are permitted to race. For female horses (mares), in horse racing they are considered racing mares when they are above four years of age.","context":["Greyhounds are not permitted to race until they have reached the age of 16 months. Once they reach this stage, RWWA has many rules and policies in place to ensure that the best levels of care are given to greyhounds whilst they are racing.\nRWWA’s Stewards regularly conduct kennel inspections to ensure compliance with the Rules of Racing.\nBelow provides a summary of the types of rules and policies that are currently in place. However, to view the full Rules of Racing and full range of Stewards policies please click here.\nThe 'Code of Practice for the Keeping of Greyhounds within the Western Australian Racing Industry' has been prepared by RWWA’s Integrity Department, in consultation with people who have expertise in greyhound management, welfare and veterinary science. The code was developed with input from RSPCA WA whose welfare officers assisted with review and development of this code through a RWWA-RSPCA WA working party. The purpose of the document is to describe standards and guidelines that safeguard the welfare of greyhounds within the racing industry in Western Australia.\nUnder this Code, the Minimum Standards set the minimum level of conduct required. They are based on current scientific knowledge, recommended industry practice and community expectations.\nThe Guidelines provide information to improve awareness of good welfare practices and encourage the considerate treatment of greyhounds.\nThe Code is designed to encourage a consistent approach that will:\nThe Code emphasises the importance of good management practices, pointing out that persons in charge of greyhounds have a legal liability.\nThe overriding theme of this Code is that the wellbeing of the greyhound must at all times be considered above the demands of owners, breeders, Participants, sponsors, officials or spectators.\nThe full Code of Practice for the Keeping of Greyhounds within the Western Australian Racing Industry can be found here.\nTo ensure that the best levels of care are given to greyhounds whilst they are racing appropriate veterinary care is required.\nTherefore, greyhound trainers are required to establish a relationship with a veterinary practitioner to provide advice and treatment as needed and immediate veterinary attention must be provided for sick or injured greyhounds, to relieve pain, suffering and distress.\nPersons in charge of greyhounds must be able to recognise common signs of disease and ill health and take reasonable measures to respond to these observations, which includes seeking veterinary advice.\nWhilst racing greyhounds must be vaccinated in accordance with the RWWA Rules of Greyhound Racing which includes at a minimum vaccination against distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, parainfluenza virus and bordetella bronchiseptica (C5).\nFurthermore, internal and external parasites must be controlled through routine preventative treatments.\nParticipants must also have appropriate biosecurity measures in place to prevent the spread of infectious conditions within the kennel and they must maintain either an isolation area on the property to isolate sick animals or have suitable isolation facilities available off site.\nIn addition, greyhounds are vet checked at the commencement of each race meeting to ensure that they are in a suitable condition to race. The greyhounds’ weight is also recorded at every race meeting to ensure they’re maintaining a healthy weight range.\nWhen training greyhounds it’s important that they have suitable living conditions. Whilst a greyhound is racing, Trainer’s must provide accommodation that is in line with strict guidelines, including:\nWestern Australia is well-known for its hot summer days and therefore RWWA has a hot weather policy to ensure in instances where the temperature and humidity reach extreme levels, the greyhounds receive necessary care.\nWhen the hot weather policy is activated the following are observed:\nHowever, where the temperature rises above 40°C, or the Stewards are of the opinion that the temperature is likely to rise above 40°C during the meeting, the Stewards may abandon the meeting, or cancel particular races of that meeting.\nBreeding greyhounds is no easy task as it requires extensive knowledge as well as complete dedication, as it incredibly time-consuming.anc_Link1\nThe early stages of a greyhound’s life are extremely important for their development and their early rearing environment is critical for building resilience.anc_Link2\nWhen a greyhound retires from the racing industry, at any age, the owner must aim to have every healthy and behaviourally sound greyhound re-homed.anc_Link3","What Is A Mare Horse?\nAn adult female horse is called as mare.

{"question":"I am new to website optimization and noticed both usability testing and A/B testing mention resource efficiency. What differences exist between these two approaches regarding required resources and time investment?","answer":"Usability testing requires relatively few resources, with tests involving as few as three users potentially providing enough data for up to a month of development team adjustments. However, it needs observers to watch, listen, and record participant progress, plus time to analyze both qualitative and quantitative metrics. A/B testing, on the other hand, focuses on gathering statistical data through automated tools like Optimizely, making it more streamlined in terms of human resources. However, it requires careful planning, design approval, build and QA processes, and sufficient time to reach statistical significance. Both methods aim to save organizations time and expense, but through different approaches to data collection and analysis.","context":["What is Usability Testing?\nUsability testing is used to evaluate and address changes to design or content for a product or service with representative users. During testing, participants attempt to complete specific tasks while observers watch, listen and record their progress or difficulties. Goals are generally to identify any usability issues, collect qualitative and quantitative data, and determine the participant’s satisfaction with the product or process.\nTesting allows the design and development teams to identify problems before they are coded in the initial stages of development, or flaws in construction during other aspects of the development process. Usability testing can save organizations time and expense, as well as maintaining rigorous schedules and deadlines.\nDuring testing, the design team learns if participants are able to complete tasks successfully, how long each task takes, and the satisfaction rate of the website or product. Testing allows the testers to identify changes required to improve user performance and experience, as well as to analyze performance to determine if the product meets testing objectives.\nUsability testing requires fewer resources than when it was originally instituted, and the results from a single test with as few as three users may take the development team up to a month to adjust. As long as specific parameters are used in testing, a high quality of data may be collected that will significantly affect the positive outcome of the product or process.\nPlanning Usability Tests\nIt is important to go into a testing session with a concrete plan. Without strict goals, testing can waste time and resources as well as collecting incomplete or unimportant information. Typically, a plan for usability testing includes:\n- Scope — This will determine what will be tested and how much of the product or process the test will cover.\n- Purpose — This identifies the concerns, questions, and goals for the test. This may be a single performance issue or a more broad sense of usability.\n- Participants — This includes the number and type of participants in the study.\n- Scenarios — This will indicate the number and types of tasks included in the test.\n- Metrics — This includes the questions that will be asked prior to testing, after each scenario has been completed, and an overall evaluation of ease, satisfaction and likelihood of recommendation at the end of each session.\n- Quantitative metrics — This includes the numerical data that can be used to measure response times, completion rates, errors, and time frames for each task.\nSeveral metrics are used to determine rates of success or failure for each scenario, and data collection is critical for accurate evaluation and proper adjustments in product or process development. Testing should include:\n- Successful task completion\n- Critical and non-critical errors\n- Error-free rates\n- Time for each task\n- Likes and dislikes\n- Recommendations for improvement\nTesting sessions will also normally include subjective evaluations that participants submit indicating ease of use, ease of finding information, satisfaction, or any other issues discovered by the participant during the testing session.","Knowing where to start when it comes to A/B testing can be challenging. However, the important point to remember is that the people and processes in place are just as vital to testing success as the tool that you’re using.\nBetween my previous experience in optimization at Sky to my current role at Dailymotion, I’ve learned that by carefully planning out each A/B and multivariate test from the beginning, the execution and outcomes of the experiment will more easily fall into place. Because the process behind effective optimization and testing is so essential, I’ve put together this 7-step process for effective A/B testing, which helps you generate more meaningful results, avoid wasting resources, and ensure that you don’t lose organizational knowledge.\nStep 1: Planning\nThe planning phase underpins an entire test and is arguably one of the most important steps to take to ensure that you will generate meaningful results you can act on. Every test must have a hypothesis, which should articulate the problem are you trying to solve with the test. A strong hypothesis will also propose the solution to the problem, and make a prediction about an expected result.\nHere’s an example of a bad hypothesis:\nReducing the size of the homepage thumbnail images will increase our visitor click through rate.\nAnd a good hypothesis:\nThe click through rate on the home screen thumbnails is low. By reducing the size of the thumbnails, we will display more videos above the fold and increase content discovery, therefore increasing the visitor click through rate.\nThe good hypothesis above identifies a quantifiable problem (a low click through rate on the home screen thumbnails), considers a solution (reducing the size of the thumbnails and moving more videos above the fold), and predicts a result (increased content discovery). Simple!\nWhen planning your experiment, also consider how you will track your goals, which audience segments you want to test on (if any), and how you are going to segment your experiment results data to enhance your learnings.\nStep 2: Design\nThis step involves designing your A/B test variations and gaining internal approval to test them. Design as many potential solutions as you need for the hypothesis of the test, creating one or more variation for each variable you want to change in the test (learn more about A/B/n testing vs. multivariate testing).\nGetting the go-ahead from the rest of the team or other people within your organization to test these variations is essential. Make sure that anything you test is a change you would feel comfortable implementing longer-term on your website or in your mobile app. Without internal approval, you risk wasting resources and time on preparing for and running a test that may, in the end, never have an impact on your customer experience—no matter how amazing the results could be.\nStep 3: Build & QA\nBuilding an experiment is easy with a product like Optimizely. After deciding upon the design variations, create them, along with any necessary custom tracking, in the testing or analytics tool. After the variations have been created, QA the test in all major web browsers or on a beta version of your mobile app.\nWhat custom tracking should you consider setting up as part of building your A/B test? In a test we ran on Dailymotion’s native iOS app, our team implemented a custom event in Optimizely to track when a homepage thumbnail was clicked. The event was set as our primary goal, and was also implemented in Google Analytics to give us flexibility when segmenting results.\nIn this instance, we had already integrated Google Analytics with Optimizely, so we were able to easily map a custom dimension to the experiment in Optimizely. By using Optimizely’s preview tool, we could then QA the experiment to ensure it was working as expected.\nStep 4: Launch\nThis step is fairly self-explanatory: at this stage of the process, set the experiment live and wait for the results to come in.\nStep 5: Analysis\nIt’s time to review the results of the test. Are the results statistically significant? If not, consider running the test longer to reach a statistical significance threshold.\nChallenge the data that you get from an A/B test. If you see no improvement when looking at high-level data, try segmenting the results by audience attributes such as traffic source, device or country and see if the variation(s) performed differently for these different segments. Remember not to treat every user the same, and to draw analysis and insights that can link back to the hypothesis that was formed in Step 1.\nFor example, for the hypothesis detailed in Step 1, if the results show an uplift in our success metric (homepage click through rate), with statistical significance, then we have clearly demonstrated that reducing the size of the thumbnails generated an improvement in content discovery, and that we have proved the hypothesis to be true.\nStep 6: Action\nAfter analyzing the results, acting upon them is the next logical step to take in your A/B testing process. Is there a clear winner in the A/B test? Is the test generating more questions than answers?\nAnswering both yes and no to these questions is fine. If there isn’t a clear winning variation, there is still insight to be gained, since your hypothesis has been proven untrue. However, if there is a clear winner, decide whether it is best to roll out the new experience or run an iterative test to build on the success of the test and try and drive an even greater uplift. If even more questions are generated, use these to guide the direction of future tests you may want to start planning.\nStep 7: Document\nUnfortunately, this last step often gets forgotten. However, there are many benefits to documenting test plans, results, and actions.\nDocumenting lets you learn from past A/B and multivariate tests and avoids tests being repeated further down the line when they may seem like a distant memory. Having an organized and accessible record of historical tests means that no insight is ever wasted. Whether the test is recorded as a success or if it showed inconclusive results, it’s important to have a note of where to improve and what can be done differently the next time around.\nYou might find that some tests don’t need to follow all seven steps to be successful, but it’s a useful guide to refer to. By keeping tests simple and data driven, without too many KPIs, and by getting the rest of the team onboard, you will soon be on your way to testing success. And remember—you can’t fail when testing, there is always insight to be gained!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a79650c8-79c0-4421-aa0a-d723c2c82110>","<urn:uuid:22dcab0f-47f3-4136-a1be-4680413c71ab>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 in terms of frequency band support?","answer":"While Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) only supported the 5 GHz bands, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is supported in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. This expanded support is particularly beneficial for IoT devices, which are expected to adopt Wi-Fi 6 in the 2.4GHz bands specifically for its power saving features.","context":["In branch locations, exciting new Wi-Fi standard calls for higher-speed routers\nWi-Fi use continues to grow, and users ranging from restaurant guests to office employees expect a good experience everywhere. High-bandwidth applications such as streaming video and Wi-Fi video calls require high capacity and low latency, and the explosive growth of a new generation of IoT devices will also add to the crowded wireless space. In light of all this, the emergence of Wi-Fi 6 — and routers that support it — is important.\nWhat is Wi-Fi 6?\nWith the introduction of IEEE 802.11ax, the Wi-Fi Alliance also announced a new label to help end users understand the dizzying array of Wi-Fi technologies. Rather than describing each new Wi-Fi release with the IEEE standards name, a simpler generational name will be used.\n- Wi-Fi 1: 802.11b — The original Wireless Ethernet standard\n- Wi-Fi 2: 802.11a — The first Wi-Fi in the 5 GHz bands\n- Wi-Fi 3: 802.11g — Higher speeds than 802.11b\n- Wi-Fi 4: 802.11n (aka HT) — Still faster speeds, now in both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands; MIMO introduced\n- Wi-Fi 5: 802.11ac (aka VHT) — Multi-gigabit Wi-Fi, but only the 5 Ghz band; MU-MIMO introduced\n- Wi-Fi 6: 802.11ax (aka HE) — The newest generation of Wi-Fi, with emphasis on efficiency\nEach new Wi-Fi generation strives to be backwards compatible with the previous generation. Clients using older standards are still supported; however, older clients are slow, ponderous users of precious airtime and should be phased out in favor of newer, higher-speed devices. Newer standards are more power friendly as well.\nEfficiency of Wi-Fi 6\nWhile Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) focused on using more bandwidth, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) focuses on using the existing bandwidth more efficiently. Wi-Fi 6 is also called HE (High Efficiency) to reflect its focus on better usage of existing spectrum. Multiple enhancements to the physical layer increase the amount of data that can be in the air, and improvements in sharing the air with other equipment make better use of the available bandwidth.\nWi-Fi 6 requires new hardware to support its features. However, a router can support Wi-Fi 6 and be backwards compatible with the previous generations of Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi 4 and 5 clients can connect to a router with Wi-Fi 6 enabled, with no disruption to new Wi-Fi 6 clients.\nUnlike Wi-Fi 5, which only supported the 5 GHz bands, Wi-Fi 6 is supported in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. IoT devices are expected to adopt Wi-Fi 6 in the 2.4GHz bands especially for its power saving features.\nSmall packet sizes are common in Wi-Fi client traffic, with most traffic featuring packets less than 256 bytes. Wi-Fi 6 will noticeably improve time/latency sensitive applications as well as “chatty” applications with smaller packets by using OFDMA (more on OFDMA later).\nQuadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and is the coding of bits into radio signals. Each dot in the images below represents a pattern of bits. The more dots possible, the more bits can be represented simultaneously.\nAdding 1024 QAM gives a 25 percent increase in data rate. With 256 QAM, we could encode 8 bits per symbol. 1024 QAM increases to 10 bits per symbol. The higher density symbol rate requires better air quality, so clean air providing high signal quality is now more important than ever.\nSOURCE: Michael Bernhard, Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart\nBandwidth of Wi-Fi 6\nWi-Fi 6 supports increased bandwidth of 80+80 and 160 MHz. The 80+80 is two 80 MHz channels that can be separated by other bands. The 160 is a single wide band. Wi-Fi 6 also has a \"hole punching\" capability which will exclude contentious 20Mhz bands within the larger bands. Previously, if the AP detected interference anywhere in the channels that made up the 80+80 or 160 bands, the AP would drop back down to a narrower width. With Wi-Fi 6 hole punching, only small parts of the large band will be removed.\nValue of OFDMA\nThe most exciting development in Wi-Fi 6 is Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). In current generations of Wi-Fi, data frames have been transmitted consecutively. Each device contends for the medium and, when seized, the medium is held exclusively by that device. Between each transmission, all devices obey a SIFS (Short Inter-Frame Spacing) and a contention period. The contention period allows devices to listen for another device claiming the medium; contention time is lost time during which the medium could have been used.\nIn OFDMA, a channel is divided into sub-channels called Resource Units (RUs). An RU is a group of subcarriers. Multiple devices can use the subcarriers simultaneously.\nVisualize a restaurant dining room. The kitchen is the AP, and the tables are wireless clients. With Wi-Fi 5, the focus was to get as much data to the client as possible, but the communications were serialized. Imagine a single waiter, running back and forth from the kitchen to the tables. The waiter has a large tray and wants to serve as much food to one table as possible, so the diners at that table may receive all courses of their meal at once. With Wi-Fi 6, the focus is to use the spectrum efficiently, by sending data to multiple clients, and allocating the amount of data based on need. In this situation there are multiple waiters that leave the kitchen at the same time. Each waiter has smaller trays (because the kitchen can only produce food at a fixed rate), so they only provide each table with one course at a time. However, more tables get food on a more consistent basis.\nDownlink OFDMA, an AP sending to a station, is required for Wi-Fi 6 certification. Uplink OFDMA, a station sending to an AP, is optional. OFDMA shows more than 4x improved throughput vs 802.11ac in densely deployed environments. Future updates to the Wi-Fi 6 specification may provide OFDMA on the uplink as well as downlink.\nSending More Data with 8x8 Spatial Streams\nWi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) introduced 4x4 spatial streams. Wi-Fi 6 is expanded to eight spatial streams officially (Wi-Fi 5 unofficially supported 8x8). Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), combined with spatial multiplexing, allows more data to be sent in each transmission by sending different data on each spatial stream. Each spatial stream requires an additional antenna and additional transmit/receive chain, and thus adds to expense but increases reliability and data throughput. A 2x2 MIMO system would have two radio chains for receive and two for transmit. A 4x4 would have four and an 8x8 would have eight antennas, thus making an 8x8 router officially classified as an arachnid.\nIn previous power saving states, the station would signal to the AP that the station is going into a sleep mode. The AP would cache the packets addressed to that station. The station would need to wake periodically to check if the AP had traffic. The Traffic Indication Map (TIM) is part of a beacon, so each sleeping station would need to wake every so often to receive a beacon to check if there was pending traffic.\nThe Target Wait Time (TWT) is much more battery efficient. The station tells the AP when the station will wake up. The station no longer needs to periodically wake to listen for the AP’s beacon. By putting the station in charge, the station can stay asleep longer and preserve battery life. This battery-preserving feature will be a boon to future generations of IoT. The 802.11ax TWT was leveraged from 802.11ah.\nCo-channel interference (CCI) is when multiple APs are sharing the same channel. CCI reduces efficiency because the APs must defer transmitting until certain other devices aren’t using the channel, a process called clear channel assessment (CCA). That deferral is wasted time — time that could have been better spent sending actual traffic to clients.\nBSS coloring is another innovation from IEEE 802.11ah that was adopted into Wi-Fi 6. With BSS coloring each basic service set (BSS) is assigned a color, and all APs participating in one BSS are assigned the same color. (There is an automatic process to determine unique color and to recover from color collisions.) When an AP is ready to transmit, it first listens for other transmitters on the air. If the AP hears another frame, it will check the color. If the color is the same as the AP itself, the transmission is fully deferred the usual time. If the color is different than the AP and the signal strength of the frame is below a certain threshold, the radio can transmit; if the signal strength is above that threshold, the radio will defer the usual time.\nGoing back to the restaurant analogy from the OFDMA section, imagine each BSS is a table. The restaurant itself is the shared spectrum. Each person at the table is chatting with others at their table. The table has the color. During the conversation at their table, a person feels free to speak over someone at another table, if their voice is low enough. But it would be rude to speak over someone at your own table.\nBSS coloring will also help improve battery life because a radio could stop decoding a received frame with a color not matching its own. The radio only needs to wake long enough to receive the few leading bits from the frame header, then can return to sleep.\nImproving Security with WPA3\nWPA3 is a new authentication mechanism and is likely one of the best new features of Wi-Fi 6. The WPA2 preshared key authentication protocols have come under cryptographic attack and are vulnerable to brute force attacks on weak passwords. WPA3 uses an improved mutual authentication mechanism, Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which has better protection against brute force attacks.\nWPA3 now requires Protected Management Frames (PMF). Certain management frames are vulnerable to spoofing, allowing a malicious actor to forge those management frames to disrupt the network. PMFs are not new and have been a feature since 802.11w. However, WPA3 now requires PMF to be enabled. In order to pass the Wi-Fi 6 certification, WPA3 support is required, so greater security is now enforced by the certification itself.\nClients Supporting Wi-Fi 6\nClients supporting Wi-Fi 6 have been slowly rolling out the last two years. The Samsung S10 was the first Android phone with Wi-Fi 6. The iPhone 11 also supports Wi-Fi 6. Intel’s AX200 chipset ships in most new laptops and has very good Wi-Fi 6 support. For a full list of clients, visit wi-fi.org/product-finder.\nWPA3 support does not require new hardware and is supported in Windows 10 with the 1909 update. Apple Mac OS and iOS also support WPA3.\nCradlepoint Router Support for Wi-Fi 6\nThe first generation of Cradlepoint routers supporting Wi-Fi 6 is rolling out now. DL-OFDMA is supported, which will help in the crowded wireless environments of today’s offices and retail spaces. The higher speeds of 1024 QAM will greatly benefit bandwidth-intensive applications (large file transfer or video, for example). The extra security of WPA3 will increase peace of mind."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bdd88d14-5e35-4496-aa19-bf6bda68ae3b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences in pressure control capabilities between a PID-modified Gaggia Classic and the ACS Vesuvius Evo espresso machines?","answer":"The Gaggia Classic, even with PID modification, has a basic pressure system that needs to be manually adjusted to 9 bars through the over-pressure valve (OPV). In contrast, the ACS Vesuvius Evo offers sophisticated pressure profiling capabilities through its brushless gear pump with magnetic drive. The Vesuvius allows users to create custom pressure profiles with up to 7 phases, ranging from 2 to 12 bars with 0.2 bar increments. Users can store up to 5 different pressure profiles, and can even emulate traditional lever machine profiles by programming specific pressure sequences. This makes the Vesuvius significantly more advanced in terms of pressure control functionality.","context":["The Gaggia Classic is a very capable espresso machine that gets even better with a couple of improvements. Once the machine has been set to 9 bars of pressure (see bottom of article), the next big improvement is the addition of a PID. This gives the machine a whole new level of consistency, and gives you fine control over brew temperature. Here’s how to install a PID on the Gaggia Classic Pro.\nHowever, at the cost of convenience, these kits can be relatively expensive. On top of the original price tag, international shipping, taxes, duties and currency exchanges can make obtaining these kits time consuming and even more expensive.\nI decided to go the do-it-yourself route, ordering the parts separately, at a fraction of the cost of the kits. I installed the PID so that there are no permanent modifications to the machine, and the Gaggia can be returned to factory condition at any time. Because there is very little information on how to install a PID on the latest generation of the New Classic (2018 and newer, also called the Gaggia Classic Pro in North America), here are instructions on to do this.\nIn a nutshell, the Gaggia Classic thermostat is replaced by the combination of the the thermocouple, the PID, and the solid state relay.\nThe required parts are a PID controller, a solid state relay (SSR) preferably rated for 40 amps, a K-type thermocouple, a thermocouple adapter to connect the thermocouple to the Gaggia boiler, wire rated for mains voltages as well as some smaller gauge 12 volt wire, male and female quick disconnect connectors, spade connectors, and two piggyback spade connectors. Because the PID runs on mains voltages, an enclosure is required. Zip ties, heat shrink tubing, thermal paste, double sided tape, and a bolt and nut to attach the SSR are also required.\n- PID: I chose the REX-C100, which I ordered as an inexpensive kit with a thermocouple and a solid state relay. The REX-C100 PID is frequently used in espresso machines. It’s inexpensive and works well for this purpose. The kit ended up being cheaper to order than sourcing the parts separately. The 40 amp SSR that comes with the kit works well too. The problem with the kit that I ordered (and the problem with any PID kit, as far as I can tell) is that the included thermocouple is permanently attached to a threaded adapter that will not fit into the Gaggia’s threaded thermostat connector. To get around this, I had to order a separate thermocouple and adapter (see below).\n- K-type thermocouple: I ordered a separate K-type thermocouple, without an adapter. These are fairly inexpensive due to the demand from the 3D printing community. This one from Banggood fits into threaded adapters (see below), and is inexpensive.\n- Thermocouple adapter: the Gaggia boiler thermostats have M4 threads, so you need an adapter to connect the thermocouple to the boiler. Thankfully the 3D printing community uses all kinds of thermocouples and adapters, so these adapters can be relatively easily found. This thermocouple adapter works well.\n- To avoid having to make any permanent modifications to the Gaggia, a couple of piggyback spade connectors will let you tap into the power cables without having to cut any wires.\n- There are very few enclosures that offer a perfect fit. A 1/16 extruded aluminium case offers the best fit and finish, but they are very hard to find. If you have access to a 3D printer, a case can be printed. Here are the STL files I adapted: enclosure, and lid.\nWarning! This process involves working with potentially lethal mains-level voltages. Always work with the Classic unplugged. Do not undertake this procedure if you are not comfortable or uncertain.\nNote: I fully tested the PID, SSR and thermocouple on the workbench before final installation. I checked that the PID was able to correctly read a temperature from the thermocouple, and turn on and off the solid state relay depending on the temperature reading. Because the wiring connections can vary between manufacturers, you should bench-test your setup before final assembly.\nHere are the installation steps:\n- Unplug the Gaggia Classic. This is VERY important! You will be working with potentially lethal mains voltages. Do not work with the Classic plugged in.\n- Remove the portafilter and water tank.\n- Remove the cover assembly and filler funnel by unscrewing the two small screws at the rear of the top. Pull the cover assembly off by pulling upwards, and disconnect the ground cables. Set the cover and screws aside.\n- Pull off the steam knob and disconnect the steam wand. Although this is optional, it is difficult to access the power switch to tap power for the PID, and it is almost impossible to reach the thermostat without moving the boiler, and the boiler can’t be moved unless the steam wand is removed. To do this, loosen the nut connecting the steam wand to the steam control assembly. Pull the steam wand up and out of the Classic, and set it aside.\n- Loosen the four bolts that hold down the boiler assembly. These are located around the shower screen. Once these bolts are removed, the boiler can be moved around without having to disconnect any hoses or wires.\n- Tap the switched hot/load mains power: disconnect the lower left-hand (if facing the front of the machine) wire from the power switch. Plug in a mains-rated cable connected to a piggyback spade connector, and then plug the original switched mains cable into the piggyback. I hesitate to identify wires by their color, as the wire colors in the Gaggia seem to vary from year to year and from region to region. I strongly suggest checking which switch terminal switches the mains. Run this wire along the rest of the existing cables and out the back of the Classic, through one of the vent slots. Leave this cable longer than needed for now, it will be trimmed and terminated later.\n- Tap the neutral mains: disconnect the lower wire from the mains connector at the back of the Classic. Double check that this is the neutral! Plug in a mains-rated wire connected to a piggyback spade connector, and then plug the original neutral cable into the piggyback. Again, as above, run this cable out the back, and leave it unterminated and longer than needed.\n- Disconnect the two connectors from the brew thermostat, which is located on the bottom left-hand side of the boiler as you face the machine. This is probably the most difficult part of the installation. These connectors are hard to reach, and are on very tight. Using pliers to pull the connectors can pinch them on even more tightly, making them extremely difficult to remove. I found that carefully pushing the boiler up gives better access to the thermostat, either from above, or by reaching up from below. Be careful, the edges of the hole in the chassis are very sharp. Wear a glove when reaching in from below, otherwise bloodletting is likely.\n- Pull the two wires that you removed from the thermostat up to the top of the machine, near the rest of the wires that run from the front to the back of the machine. These wires will be connected to the solid state relay later on, so they no longer need to be in the bottom of the machine.\n- Remove the thermostat. It’s threaded on, and should not be very tight. Leave as much of the thermal grease in place as possible. Keep the thermostat, in case you want to return the Classic back to factory condition.\n- Thread in the M4 thermocouple adapter in the place of the thermostat. Do not over-tighten the adapter, it only needs to be finger-tight.\n- Slip some heat shrink tubing over the thermocouple, and ideally dip the thermocouple tip in some thermal grease, then insert the thermocouple into the adapter. Heat the shrink tubing.\n- Thread the thermocouple wire through to the back of the machine, and out the same slot as was used for the other wires. If the thermocouple wire is too long, coil it up inside the machine, well away from the boiler or any uninsulated connections, using zip ties to hold the coil in place.\n- Using two 5-8 cm pieces of properly-rated wire (15 amps for North America), make two connectors to connect the thermostat wires to the AC terminals of the solid state relay. One end of the wire should be a male disconnect connector, and the other end should be a spade connector. Tighten one end of your connector down to one of the solid state relay’s AC (~) terminals and plug the other end into one of the disconnected thermostat wires. Do the same with the other connector wire. It doesn’t matter which thermostat wire is connected to which of the AC terminals on the solid state relay.\n- Run two 12 volt wires from the + and – terminals of the solid state relay and out the back of the Classic, again using the same slot.\n- Attach the solid state relay to the inside back wall of the Classic, using a small bolt and nut. It should be placed as close to the left-hand side of the Classic as possible. Most assembly guides recommend using some thermal paste between the SSR and the Classic to ensure that any heat from the SSR is dumped to the chassis.\n- Make sure that all the new and repositioned wires are cleanly routed away from the boiler and pump and any uninsulated connectors. A couple of zip ties come in handy here. You should now have two mains wires, two 12 volt wires, and the shielded thermocouple wire running out of the back of the Classic.\n- Re-attach the boiler with the four bolts, re-attach the steam wand, push on the steam knob, and put the lid assembly back on, without forgetting to re-connect the two ground wires.\n- Trim, terminate and connect the wires you routed out the back of the Classic to the PID. Depending on the enclosure, you may need to insert the PID into the housing first. The two mains wires connect to terminals 1 and 2 (starting counter-clockwise from top-left). It doesn’t matter which mains terminal is connected to hot and which one is connected to neutral. The 12 volt wires from the SSR connect to terminals 4 and 5. The thermocouple connects to terminals 6 and 7. Make sure the polarity for the SSR and thermocouple wires is correct, this is important.\n- Close the PID enclosure, and attach it to the side of the Classic. Double sided tape will work.\n- You should be done! If the wiring was done correctly, the PID should power up when the Classic is turned on.\nThe REX-C100 should work out of the box, set for heating mode, with alarms disabled, and units set to Celsius. However, depending on the seller, some settings may need to be changed. Consult the instructions that came with your PID to make sure.\nThe default target temperature on the PID will almost certainly not be correct. For the Gaggia Classic, taking into account the temperature drop between the boiler and the group head (5-8 degrees C), the PID target temperature should be set to about 103 degrees C or 220 degrees F at sea level.\nTo set the target temperature, press the ‘Set’ button on the front of the panel. Then use the cursor keys to select the digits to increase and decrease.\nLeave the Classic powered on for at least 15 minutes. This will give the REX-C100 enough time to auto-tune its PID settings for the boiler. When the temperature stabilizes to within 1 degree of the target temperature, the auto-tuning is complete.\nFinal note: before going down the PID route, the easiest modification to make, and the best starting point for Gaggia Classic modifications, is lowering the brew pressure. The Classic’s over-pressure valve (OPV) is set to 14 bars, which is a pressure better suited to the use of pressurized portafilters. For espresso, 9 bars is the generally preferred pressure. For the Classic Pro, this requires either shortening the spring in the OPV valve through trial and error, or ordering a spring kit from Mr. Shades.","ACS Vesuvius Espresso Machine\nThe ACS Vesuvius Evo is one of the first prosumer pressure profiling machine that gives the user ultimate control over the entire extraction. The dual independently operated PID controlled boilers allow for optimum extraction of any coffee type or roast style.\nThe star of this machine is the brushless gear pump with magnetic drive which allows the pump speed (aka pressure) to be controlled. The pressure profiles can have to 7 phases with pressures between 2 and 12 bar and adjusted in 0.2 bar increments. For example, you can emulate the profile of a traditional lever machine by setting parameters to: 4 seconds at 2 bars, 10 seconds at 12 bars, 6 seconds at 10 bars, 4 seconds at 8 bars … You can even store up to 5 of your favorite pressure profiles.\nAll machine functions are controlled by the touch screen that includes an automatic on/off function – your machine is ready to go whenever you need coffee. The machine can either be used with the side loading water tank or can be plumbed in. Another unique feature is that when the machine is plumbed in; incoming water is pumped into the water reservoir instead of the brew boiler so your line pressure won't impact your brew pressure. The ACS Vesuvius is not only a beautiful and well built machine, but it is also one of the most capable machine on the market.\nNote: The ACS Vesuvius Evo Leva is highly customizable. Panels can be painted the color of your choice, multiple wood kits are available and you can choose between different style of steam and water wands. Contact us at email@example.com if you would like to special order a custom machine made to your specifications.\n- Pressure Profiling Machine: Thanks to the variable speed gear pump, the Vesuvius offers 7 stage pressure profiling that can be adjusted in 0.2bar increments. You can also store 5 different programs for all your favorite coffees.\n- E61 Group Head: The E61 brew head design has been around for 50 years and is used in the majority of the high end home espresso machines. It is known its reliability and temperature stability due to heavy brass head combined with a thermosyphon system keeping the group head hot.\n- Dual Boiler: Two PID controlled stainless steel boilers, one for steam and hot water delivery and one for the coffee extraction. A system studied to grant higher temperature stability and to allow the simultaneous delivery of coffee and steam.\n- No Burn Steam and Water Wand: Both the steam and water wands are insulated so that they can be manipulated without the risk or burning your fingers.

{"question":"I'm studying biblical literature and would like to understand the differences between Prophecy and Apocalyptic writing. How do these two genres compare in their approach to future events?","answer":"While both Prophecy and Apocalyptic writing deal with future events, they have distinct characteristics. Prophecy primarily functions as both 'forth-telling' and 'foretelling,' focusing on immediate moral and religious concerns while also predicting future events. Prophets were active mainly from the 8th to 5th centuries BC, condemning apostasy and false religion while standing for the Torah. Apocalyptic writing, on the other hand, is a more specific form of prophecy that uses cryptic symbols and vivid imagery to reveal hidden meanings about future events. It appears in books like Daniel and Revelation, using symbolic language partly to prevent readers from being too confident in applying the passages to their present setting. While prophecy often has direct, clear messages, apocalyptic literature intentionally obscures its full meaning through symbols and imagery that will become clearer over time.","context":["DIGGING DEEP – 4 by Abidan Paul Shah\nSome preliminary remarks:\n- Again, remember the tool imagery from last week. We are trying to put together the most well rounded system of interpretation (comprehensive, congruent, consistent, and coherent) – from David L. Wolfe, Epistemology, The Justification of Belief.\n- Find a balance between “commitment to literal” and “appreciation of genre”\nToday we will be looking at what’s known as Genre or Type of Literature found in the Bible. My information is coming from Grant Osborne’s Hermeneutical Spiral.\n- Narrative – Found in OT books like Genesis, Exodus, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Nehemiah, etc.; NT books like Gospels, Acts, etc. They contain both history and theology. The basic method to study them is to “Read them” and look for the various dimensions of the story – plot, characters, and setting. Also look for the various dimensions of the discourse – implied author, point of view, and implicit commentary, implied reader.\n- Poetry – Found in some OT historical books (Gen 49; Ex 15:1-18, I Sam 2;1-10), some entire prophetic books (Hosea, Joel, Amos), some extensive portions of other prophetic books (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah), and especially in Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Song of songs, or Job. Types of Poetry – War Songs, Love Songs, Lament, Hymns or Praise Songs, Thanksgiving Hymns, Songs of Celebration and Affirmation, Wisdom and Didactic Psalms, and Imprecatory Psalms. In the NT, there are many quotations of psalms; quotations from ancient poets (Acts 17:28); poetic passages in the form of Hebraic hymns (Luke 1-2); passages without meter but containing exalted expressions of poetry (Mt 5:3-12 or John 1)\n- Wisdom – Found in OT books – Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes. Various forms of Wisdom Literature – Proverb, Saying, Riddle, Admonition, Allegory, Hymns and Prayers, Dialogue, Confession, Beatitudes. Found in the NT books – Sermon on the Mount (Mt 5), Romans, 12, James 1-3,\n- Prophecy – predominant in the latter part of the OT and in the NT. The writing prophets were active in only three centuries (from the 8th – 5th). The prophet was a “forth-teller” before he was a “foreteller.” They were not angry with the Jewish system but with the apostasy and false religion that was practiced in both Israel and Judah. They stood for the Torah and condemned Israel’s worship because it was impure. The key to understanding prophecy is to determine the original context.\n- Parable – One third of Jesus’ teaching in the synoptic gospels comes in parables. The Hebrew term is “masal” which is also the word for proverb and riddle. It has the basic idea of comparison. Again, carefully read the original setting.\n- Epistle – most of the NT. To correctly understand the epistle – study the logical development of the argument. It is a letter.\n- Apocalyptic – In the OT – Daniel, Zechariah, visions of Ezekiel (37-39), Isaiah 24-27, locust plague of Joel; in the NT – Olivet Discourse (Mk 13 and parallels), I Cor 15, II Thess 2, II Peter 3, Jude and Revelation. It covers the period from the seventh century BC to first century AD. The term “apocalypse” means to reveal or uncover. Again, begin by looking at the original context and then seek to understand the present application with humility. The reason for cryptic symbols is to keep the reader from being to confident in applying the passage to his/her present setting.\n- John 3\n- Gen 24\n- Psalm 91:1-4\n- Malachi 3:1-3\n- Ecclesiastes 2:9-17\n- Matthew 5:20 vs. Galatians 2:21\n- Luke 15\n- Revelation 9:1-3 in light of Joel 2\n- Revelation 13:5 along with Daniel 12:11","What Are the Types of Literature Genres in the Bible?\nThe Bible is not one book; it is a library of sixty-six books that were written over a period of more than 1,500 years by many different authors. These authors were inspired by the Holy Spirit in their thinking and writing. Thus, the Bible is the inspired Word of God without error. It also has the human touch from its authors. Paul is different from David, who is different from James or Moses. So, their style and personality come out to us. These create the marvelous depth and wonder of Scripture and how God chooses to use us when He does not need to.\nThe Bible is literature, as is any book, filled with many kinds or types of language. It has Law, History, Wisdom, Poetry, Gospel, Epistles, Prophecy, and Apocalyptic Literature.\nWhat is Genre?\nHow does the literary type or wording in the passage effect the interpretation? A lot, for example in my men's group the other day, they we talking about the big rivalry football game that was coming up. All the words they used were in English; however their meaning is very different in describing the game of football than the same words used to describe a dance or play or in causal conversations. If some was there listening to the conversion and did not know about football they would be as lost as I was. Because it is all about how we use words, phrases, symbols and descriptions. In English we do this all of the time. In English, we have story, comedy, tragedy, novel, lyric poem, and epic to name a few. In the Greek and Hebrew, we have narrative, law, poetry, prophecy, apocalyptic, parable, epistle, and even romance. This is very important, as this helps us interpret the meaning of the text and whether it is literal or figurative. And if it is figurative what does the depiction represent.\nThis is important when determining if we will take a word or phrase as literal. Some are just common sense. When the Bible is referred to as a rock, we do not garden with it; when the Bible is called a mirror, we do not shave with it; when Jesus says He is the Bread…well, you should get the point. Some words are not to be taken literally, but the Bible is still communicating the literal Word of God. How do we determine if something is figurative, a metaphor, or a poetic figure? Usually, the Bible gives a clue in context, such as two or more words that do not go together like LORD and Rock, in Psalm 18:2, The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer. In this case, it means \"unfailingstrength,\" as God is our Strength who does not fail. In this situation, you may need to look it up. Thus the key is, if you come across a word or phrase, assume it is literal, unless it does not make sense or does not seem to fit. Your clue is to pay attention to the context and genre and then look the word up in the various resources, such as a Lexicon, Bible Dictionary or Concordance.\nThe Basic Genres:\n· History or Narrative: There are stories and the epics and include Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Jonah, and Acts.\n· Law: These are the instructions and precepts of God given to us through Moses, such as Leviticus and Deuteronomy.\n· Wisdom: These are the literature of maxims and sayings such as Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes.\n· Poetry: These are the prose and rhymes such as Psalms, Song of Solomon, and Lamentations.\n· Prophecy: These include both major and minor prophets such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.\n· Apocalyptic: These are combinations of narrative and prose written in vivid imagery and poetic phrases that are intended to exaggerate for a purpose such as Daniel and most of Revelation.\n· Parable: These are the sayings of Jesus that are narrative and instructional, contained in the Gospels.\n· Epistle: These are the letters written to a specific audience that are practical for us today such as Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, Peter, John, and the first three chapters of Revelation.\n· Romance: These are narrative, written also as love stories, such as Ruth and Song of Solomon.\n· Then, ask how the type of genre (type of literature) shows you the significance and implication of the general overview?\n· How does the type of genre contribute to possible meanings of specific words and then the point of the passage?\nBiblical Genres Include\nLaw: This contains the instructions and precepts of Moses, such as Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Law is \"God's law\", and is the expression of His sovereign will and character. The writings of Moses contain a lot of Law. God provided the Jews with many laws (619 or so). These laws defined the proper relationship with God, to one another, and with the world (the alien), as well as for worshipping God, governing the people, priestly duties, what to eat and not eat, how to build the temple, proper behavior, manners, and social interaction, etc. The Ten Commandments are often known as \"The Law;\" so are Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In the New Testament, the \"Sermon on the Mount\" is considered law and the fulfillment of the law, and Paul's calls to the church are law in their literature form.\nMost Christians have a distorted view of the law and think it does not apply to us. Jesus repeated and affirmed the Ten Commandments and the Law of Moses. The law points to our depravity and need for a Savior. Without the law, there would be no relationship to God or need for Christ to save us. Christ fulfills the law and thus we are not bound to its curse, but we must acknowledge its role in our lives as the pointer to the Cross and the mirror to our soul.\nHistory or Narrative: These are the stories and the epics, and include: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Jonah, and Acts. Almost every Old Testament book contains history. Some books of the Bible are grouped together and commonly referred to as the \"History\" (Joshua, Kings, and Chronicles); these books tell us the history of the Jewish people from the time of the Judges through the\nWisdom: This is the literature of maxims and sayings, including Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. Wisdom Literature focuses on questions about the meaning of life (Job, Ecclesiastes) and on practical living and common sense (Proverbs and some Psalms). This literature contrasts our faulty human wisdom to God's reasoning perfection. Thus, when we live for our own will and not His, we will experience grief and frustration, not because God is vengeful and angry, but because we led ourselves that way out of our pride and arrogance. This literature warns us of our evil nature and desires.\nPoetry: These are the prose and rhyme books such as Psalms, Song of Solomon, and Lamentations. Poetry is found mostly in the Old Testament and is similar to modern poetry. Since it is a different language of Hebrew, the Bible's poetry can be very different because it does not translate into English very well. Poetry that we are used to is usually based on parallelisms, rhythm, or various types of sound mixings, as is our music. Hebrew poetry is based on a tempo of stanzas and phrases re-told differently called \"synonymous parallelism\", conveying the same ideas and meaning in contrasting or similar ways. Some called \"synthetic parallelism,\" also have extra ideas and words inserted. \"Antithetic parallelism\" is mostly contrasting stanzas, and is very predominant in Proverbs. Some Bible books are all poetry (Psalms, Song of Songs, and Lamentations), and some books only have a few verses such as in Luke.\nGospel: This word means the \"good news\" that we received through salvation by the work and life of God's Son, Jesus Christ. When the Gospels were first written in the first century, it was a brand new form of literature. The four Gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John) contain a bit of all the literary types with the primary purpose of expressing faith in Christ and what He has done on our behalf. In these works, the stories are not necessarily in chronological or sequential order, except for Luke. In this type of literature, we find what is called a \"Parable.\" These are the sayings of Jesus that are narrative and instructional, contained in the Gospels. Each of the gospels presents the teachings, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus in a distinctive way, but not contradictory, and for a specific audience. Matthew was written to Jews, and Luke to Greeks, both with different ways of reasoning and thinking. Think of the Gospels like the facets of a diamond, giving more depth and meaning.\nParables: These are the sayings of Jesus told in a short story or illustration form that are narrative and instructional; they teach a truth, and are contained in the Gospels. Usually, these are from everyday life examples that may have taken place or may not. At times, such as in the Parable of the Sower, Jesus was possibly pointing to it as He taught. These had a deeper purpose than the face value of the illustration, thus it took some thinking and a desire to learn in order to understand them. Perhaps, He used them to keep people of impiety and without intent of faith from bothering Him; or, perhaps He wanted to challenge the skeptics and people who were unresponsive.\nEpistle: This refers to the 21 letters in the New Testament written to a specific audience that are also practical for us today such as Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, Peter, John, and the first three chapters of Revelation. Epistles are the personal letters from the Apostles to their churches. These letters are both different and similar to the letters of their time. Most challenge the congregation to wake up out of their selfish ways and to concentrate on Christ in specific ways and clarifications. They begin with the names of the writer and the recipient, then a greeting, a reason for the letter, and then the central message or body of the letter; there is usually a closing, just like most letters today.\nThe epistles deal with concerns and false teachings that needed immediate correction. Some epistles were written in response to questions from the church, or for clarification for another letter, such as II Corinthians. The teachings of the epistles applied to both to the church they were written to, and also to Christians today. However, we need to understand the cultural and historical situation to better understand what is going on, so we do not misunderstand what is being said.\nProphecy means past, present, and future, not just the future. This includes major and minor prophets-Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Prophecy is the type of literature that is often associated with predicting the future. However, it also contains God's words of \"get with it or else.\" There are two main types. One is \"predictive,\" as in foretelling an event, and the other is \"didactic,\" challenging others to line up morally or to teach a truth. Thus, prophecy also exposes sin and calls for repentance and obedience. It shows how God's law can be applied to specific problems and situations, such as the repeated warnings to the Jews before their captivity. This is found in the Old Testament books of Isaiah through Malachi, the section of the Bible labeled \"Prophecy\" by both Jews and Christians. There are over 2000 specific predictions that have already come to pass, hundreds of years after the author's death!\nIn the New Testament, prophecy is mainly found in Matthew 24 and the book of Revelation. Prophecy has both an immediate call to a given situation, such as the \"seven churches of Revelation\", and a predated future to come to pass. That is, it is two fold-a past and a future, both applying to the present. Some predictions are already fulfilled, such as the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and some have yet to come to pass such as sections of Daniel, 2 Peter, Revelation, and the return of Christ.\nApocalyptic: These are combinations of narrative and prose written in vivid imagery and poetic phrases that are intended to exaggerate for a purpose such as Daniel and most of Revelation. Apocalyptic writing is a more specific form of prophecy. Apocalyptic writing is a type of literature that warns us of future events from which full meaning is hidden to us for the time being. Apocalyptic writing is almost a \"secret,\" giving us glimpses of what is to come through the use of symbols and imagery. We may not know the meanings now, but time will flush it out. Apocalyptic writing is found in Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Revelation.\nWarning: a lot of Christian writers love to embellish on this subject and give their own version of what will happen. But, the scores of books that have been written in the last hundred years have not panned out in their theories. It is \"their\" theories, not based on fact or careful study of scripture. The Bible clearly tells us we do not have access to that information; no one will know the time.\nFor a more in-depth and insightful look into the genres and knowing the Bible, see the resources How to read the Bible for all it's Worth, by Fee, Zondervan, and Knowing Scripture by R.C. Sproul, Inter Varsity. For the serious student or seminarian, Exegetical Fallacies by D.A. Carson, Baker, and Biblical Exegesis by Hayes, John Knox Press are very good.\n© 1985, 1989, 1998, 2006 R.

{"question":"Do dust storms and haboobs have similar durations when they occur?","answer":"No, they have different typical durations. Haboobs are relatively short-lived, lasting for an average of less than three hours, as shown in the Coachella Valley incident which had a warning that expired after just a few hours. In contrast, regular dust storms can affect areas for much longer periods, lasting for days and even up to months.","context":["Man hospitalized after haboob hits the Coachella Valley\nThe sun is expected to make a lasting return to the Coachella Valley Friday and through next week — a welcome change from the past few days of lower than normal temperatures, overcast skies, and Thursday's sudden dust storm, which weather experts dubbed a haboob.\nThe strong winds that accompanied the event are believed to have downed a tree that fell onto a pickup truck and a man, according to Palm Springs police.\nThe downed tree was reported at 4:53 p.m. at Marguerite Street and 34th Avenue near the Tahquitz Creek Golf Resort, according to the Palm Springs police Sgt. Mike Villegas.\nPolice and fire were called to the incident, which Villegas added was most likely caused by the weather.\nThe man was rushed to Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs, where his injuries were considered non life-threatening, officials said.\nJhorel French, who lives along Marguerite Street across from the felled tree, said he called 911 and attempted to help the injured man.\n\"All of a sudden the wind just kind of picked up. There was a whole bunch of dust everywhere and the tree came down on the guy,\" he said.\n\"It was a crazy loud noise from the tree hitting the truck. It was nuts.\"\nFrench, 25, said he left his house to help the man and ended up calling it in.\nFrench said the man suffered a cut to his back where a branch caught him.\n\"Everyone in this neighborhood has been waiting for this tree to fall,\" French said. \"But it's sad that it happened with this guy underneath.\"\nThere were other reports of damage across the valley, but there were no other reports of injuries, officials said.\nThe National Weather Service issued a blowing dust warning for the Coachella Valley that took effect about 20 minutes before the overall event, which weather experts were calling a haboob.\n\"I don't think there are specific criteria,\" said meteorologist Stephen Harrison of the storm. \"Anytime there's a dust storm produced by a thunderstorm boundary being pushed out, where there's near-zero visibility, those dust storms are usually called haboobs.\"\nThe warning expired at 7 p.m.\nThe storm seemed to appear suddenly, and moved quickly from the east valley west toward Palm Springs, blanketing everything in its wake. The conditions were so intense that Palm Springs cancelled its weekly Thursday night street fair, VillageFest.\nThe weather service's notice also predicted wind gusts of 40 mph, especially along Interstate 10 and authorities warned of brown-out conditions and reduced visibility on Coachella Valley roadways. Drivers were urged to use caution.\nIn addition, the South Coast Air Quality Management District issued an \"unhealthy\" air quality advisory, which cautioned those with sensitive respiratory conditions — respiratory or heart disease, older adults, and children — to avoid any vigorous outdoor or indoor exertion. Those affected were also advised to remain indoors.\nAt the height of the storm, Pacifica Seafood Restaurant in the Gardens on El Paseo in Palm Desert lost its Internet service and was unable to process credit transactions, according to an employee.\nThe Fix, a restaurant across the street from the Gardens, also reported Internet trouble.\nDespite the strong winds, neither Southern California Edison nor the Imperial Irrigation District reported weather-related power outages in the Coachella Valley.\n\"We don't appear to have anything there,\" said SCE spokesman Robert Villegas. \"But we do have some scheduled maintenance going on in Rancho Mirage, but no customers are impacted.\"\nMarion Champion, spokeswoman for IID, said there were isolated outages in Imperial Valley, in areas such as Brawley, Niland, and Salton City, but none in the Coachella Valley.\nEarlier in the day, the National Weather Service issued a flood advisory — which means there was a possibility of minor water overflows on streets and washes — for the Coachella Valley. It expired at 5:30 p.m. Thursday.\nInitially, the National Weather Service warned that hail up to three-quarters-of-an-inch in diameter could fall, and people should prepare for accumulation of water on roads and low crossings.\nAnd, while scattered showers did fall intermittently during the day, there was only a trace amount of accumulation.\n, On Friday, the sun is expected to return, according to Harrison. The high in the valley will be around 100 degrees, he said, adding that it will remain sunny and warm through the weekend.\nSimilarly, AccuWeather predicts Friday will be mostly sunny with a high of 99 degrees.\nDesert Sun reporters Blake Herzog and Ian James contributed to this story.","|Dust Storms||en español|\nWhy are dust storms a concern?\nA dust storm is a moving wall of dust and debris that usually arrives suddenly. Dust storms form in arid regions such as the U.S. Southwest when dust particles and fine-grained soils are blown into the air, often lifted by strong winds. Dust storms can be up to 100 miles wide and several thousand feet high. They travel an average of 25 to 50 miles.\nDust storms are common in the Southwest during the region’s summer monsoon season, when winds shift, temperatures rise, and conditions are extremely dry. Powered by intense ground heating, thunderstorms can produce strong downdrafts. These downdrafts blow up loose sand on the desert floor, creating a dust storm.\nDust storms can contain particulate matter, which can be a serious threat to human health if it accumulates in the respiratory system. Dust particles can lead to respiratory problems, particularly for people with asthma. They can harm sensitive lung tissue, irritate the lungs, and trigger allergic reactions, including asthma attacks. Exposure to dust in dust storms can cause coughing, wheezing, and runny noses. Breathing a lot of dust over a long period of time may cause chronic breathing and lung problems.\nDust storms may expose people to fungal spores that can cause a disease known as Valley Fever, or coccidioidomycosis. These spores live in the desert soil of semi-arid areas and are native to the Southwest. They may become airborne and spread during a dust storm.\nValley Fever is often mild, with no symptoms. Some people may experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, coughing, and muscle aches. A small number of people may develop a chronic infection or pneumonia from Valley Fever. Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-Americans are more likely to develop an infection from Valley Fever.\nDust storms can have a significant effect on agriculture by damaging crops and harming livestock. They can blow away valuable topsoil, cause erosion, and reduce the land’s nutrients and water-holding capacity.\nDust storms reduce visibility, at times to zero. They can make driving hazardous, cause accidents, and force airports to close because of poor visibility and dust conditions. Dust storms can take down power lines, cause power failures, damage infrastructure, and harm computers and communications equipment from the buildup of dust.\nSome intense dust storms are called haboobs, from the Arabic word for “wind.” They are most frequent in the Southwest from May through September. They have winds of higher than 30 miles per hour, may raise dust to higher than 3,000 feet, and last for an average of less than three hours.\nDust storms can affect areas for days and even up to months.\nDrier conditions projected to result from climate change in the Southwest will likely lead to increased dust storms, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nThis description is based on the information found in the Web links listed with this topic.\nWeb Links from MedlinePlus (National Library of Medicine)\nDust Control On Open and Vacant Lands (Pima County, Arizona) (PDF — 135.83 KB)\nDust Storm Safety: Motorist Beware!

In contrast, Aqua Signal's marine lighting technology prioritizes functional performance and safety, featuring specialized LED technology with proprietary prism lenses for maximum visibility, heat dissipation systems, and compliance with maritime regulations. Their lights are specifically engineered for marine applications ranging from small sailboats to cruise ships and offshore platforms.","context":["Kinds Of Outdoor Lights If you’re seeking to illuminate your yard, patio, or front porch, outdoor lighting is a very easy home renovation job that can include an attractive, risk-free and practical aspect to the area. There are numerous kinds of lights readily available, and also it is necessary to select an ideal fixture to match the area. You can either tackle the whole lawn simultaneously, or mount each individual fixture separately. Despite the kind of lighting you pick, your outdoor room will be more secure and extra cosmetically pleasing. For a remarkable effect, think about making use of 2 or more lights to light up a prime focus. A light over and also one listed below the prime focus reduces extreme darkness as well as draws attention to the centerpiece. An excellent place to begin your lights project is the Understanding Center at FX Luminaire. One more beneficial resource is the Landscape Illumination Book by Janennox Moyer. These books have tips on exterior lights. The Knowing Center at FX Luminaire provides a selection of instances to get you began. You can also make use of aquatic quality exterior illumination if your residence gets on a coastal area. Marine quality illumination can withstand salt water as well as various other outside conditions, while coastal quality lighting is especially fit for this location. Coastal lighting is generally more durable than other types, and it has actually an enhanced layer that avoids it from wearing away. For houses on the seaside, there are even unique illumination fixtures that are immune to deterioration as well as various other severe elements. Modern and also standard designs have their benefits and drawbacks. Modern designs will make use of smooth, minimalistic forms as well as products, as well as they may damage the mold and mildew with futuristic style techniques. You can match your lighting with your residence’s outside style by utilizing the exact same materials. Nonetheless, if you have an older design home, typical outdoor lights will be much more typical, and also will certainly be in maintaining with your house’s design. However, if you’re searching for something in-between, you might intend to select standard styles that are made of traditional products. Lanterns are one more prominent type of exterior illumination. These lights supply low-voltage accent illumination and also are normally installed near a back door. Lanterns are usually semi-flush or flush install, as well as are made up of a metal as well as glass outside and an arm affixed to a wall plate. In addition to lights, there are battery-powered tabletop lights that supply visual passion and light up items that are reduced or at eye degree. Article lights give a sophisticated accent to a landscape layout. If you select to mount article lights much from your structure, you will need to get extra electric job. The regional hardware shop can aid you with that. When choosing message lights, remember to follow the instructions for risk-free setup. You can also pick a range of design and styles that will certainly complement your building. Using the best combination of exterior lights can substantially enhance your building’s appearance and complement the surrounding location.","Aqua Signal Lighting\nAqua Signal has been producing marine lighting & electronics for over 130 years. Their range of conventional and LED lighting meets the needs of recreational, commercial, and naval vessels ranging from small sailboats to cruise ships, ferries, and even offshore drilling platforms.\nAqua Signal LED Lighting\nDid you know Aqua Signal was the first marine lighting manufacturer to offer a complete line of LED navigation lights, and the first to receive worldwide approval for this technology?\nCombined with Aqua Signal's proprietary prism lens, these LED navigation lights give your boat markedly increased visibility and contribute to safer boating. The LED fixture features a single high quality diode with patented prism to meet industry requirements for light output, angles of visibility, and color. Additionally this fixture also helps to reduce the risk of premature failure of the diode by featuring a machined aluminum heat sink to dissipate heat build-up.\nCompared to conventional incandescent bulbs, LED lights have lower power consumption (up to 80% less), burn brighter and last longer. LED navigation lights require no modification to operate with 12 or 24 volt systems. All Aqua Signal lights exceed USCG visibility requirements, are certified ABYC A-16, and are easy to install.\n- Navigation lights\n- Control lights\n- Outdoor lighting\n- Indoor lighting\n- Emergency lighting systems\n- Computerized illumination systems\n- Decorative lighting\nDo Aqua Signal lights meet USCG approvals?\nYes, all Aqua Signal LED's meet all worldwide regulations, they also meet or exceed the specific regulations promulgated by the USCG and ABYC for the US and Canadian market.\nWhat are the benefits of LED technology?\n- Compact LED size allows for a wide range of housings designs and sizes\n- Increased life expectancy over incandescent (50,000 to 100,000 hours, defined as > 50% of original output)\n- Safe Against Mechanical Shock and Vibration which makes it an excellent choice for automotive and marine applications\n- Unlike conventional lighting, there is no risk of implosions\n- Low maintenance costs (exchange or cleaning)\n- Low operating costs (power consumption)\n- Saves low voltage power supply (energy efficient)\n- LED's produce more light/watt than incandescent light\n- Can emit light of an intended color without the use of color filters that traditional lighting methods require\n- LED's inherently focus the light\n- No ill effects or premature failure from cycling on and off of LED lights\nWhat are candelas in relation to navigational lights?\nCandela (or candle power) is a measurement of light output and is often used for searchlights, floodlights and in some cases interior lights. This is the light output of the light or the measurable intensity of the light output. Navigation lights on the other hand, certified and measured by the distance they can be seen. The difference is light output vs. visible light detection. Aqua Signal does not publish candela rating measurements for their navigation lights.\nStrobe light and LED light combination's\nAqua Signal LED fixtures do not include strobes. There are several reasons for this because of the smaller conductor sizes for the LED and the size of heat sinks need to cool the diodes. Because of the size of the heat sinks, it is not possible to fit the strobe into the LED fixture."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7323d239-14e5-40c0-98de-7efca865c9de>","<urn:uuid:583e4568-887e-4bf6-9e98-ca7e50cbcb5a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How many men were needed to operate the gun on a Martello tower and what was its range?","answer":"The 24-pounder muzzle-loading gun required a team of 10-14 men to operate it. The gun could fire round shot with a range of up to a mile.","context":["Dymchurch Martello Tower\nHistory, tourist information, and nearby accommodation\nIn 1803 Captain William Ford proposed a plan to erect a series of small artillery towers along the south and east coast of England in an attempt to counter the threat of an invasion by Napoleon. Ford was inspired by the French round tower at Mortella Pont on Corsica, ironically the birthplace of Napoleon himself. In 1804 the plan gained approval from William Pitt's government, and construction began the following year.\nThe Dymchurch tower was just one of 103 round towers built along the coast, and one of 6 built in Dymchurch itself. The tower design is very simple; it is 2 storeys high, with a basement and a gun platform on the roof. The basement level holds a water tank and food storage, while gunpowder and other supplies are on the ground floor. Quarters for officers and men occupy the first floor. There is a very clever drain system on the roof that feeds rainwater directly into the water storage cistern in the basement.\nThe gun platform supported a 24-pounder muzzle-loading gun. The gun could be turned a full 360 degrees, using ropes, but to operate the gun took a team of 10-14 men. The gun could fire round shot with a range of up to a mile. The garrison quarters theoretically could hold up to 24 men, but it would have been incredibly cramped if all 24 were there at once.\nThe French invasion under Napoleon never materialised, so the effectiveness of the Martello towers were never tested in battle. After the French defeat at Waterloo many of the towers were used by the Coastguard to control smuggling. Once that threat in turn died down, some were simply allowed to decay, some were sold into private hands. Many of the latter are used as private dwellings today, including tower number 23, just north of Dymchurch on the Hythe road.\nThe exterior can be viewed at any time, but as of this writing the interior is unfortunately only accessible by appointment.\nAbout Dymchurch Martello Tower\nAddress: Hythe Road, Dymchurch, Kent, England, TN29 0TJ\nAttraction Type: Historic Building\nLocation: Access from Dymchurch High Street\nWebsite: Dymchurch Martello Tower\nEnglish Heritage - see also: English Heritage memberships (official website)\nOS: TR102 294\nPhoto Credit: Oast House Archive, licensed for reuse under the Creative Commons Licence\nNEARBY HISTORIC ATTRACTIONS\nHeritage Rated from 1- 5 (low-exceptional) on historic interest\nRomney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway - 3.3 miles (Family Attraction)\nWestenhanger Castle and Barns - 5.1 miles (Castle)\nBrabourne, St Mary's Church - 7.7 miles (Historic Church)\nDungeness Old Lighthouse - 7.9 miles (Historic Building)\nFairfield, St Thomas Becket Church - 8.6 miles (Historic Church)\nHorne's Place Chapel - 9 miles (Historic Building)\nWillesborough Windmill - 9 miles (Historic Building)\nBrook, St Mary's Church - 9.5 miles (Historic Church)\nNearest Accommodation to Dymchurch Martello Tower:\nNearest Self Catering Cottages\nNearest Bed and Breakfasts\nNearest Tourist Information Centre ('as the crow flies')\n1-2 Guildhall Street\nTel: 01303 258 946"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0b4acf5d-5b89-470c-a913-b193fa55f999>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do red foxes and arctic foxes share the same hunting patterns during daytime?","answer":"No, they have different patterns. Red foxes prefer the cover of darkness, though some attacks occur during daytime, particularly by young foxes learning to hunt. In contrast, arctic foxes are more focused on hunting techniques like jumping off ice or snow to break through and catch prey beneath, using their excellent hearing and forward-facing ears to detect small prey below with great accuracy.","context":["Mr. Fox has to be every poultry keeper’s number one enemy. Sadly, many people have lost their chickens or other poultry to a fox. When it happens, it can be devastating.\nWhen I was 7 years old, I went down to the chicken house to open the outer run door to let our small flock of hens out for their usual free range of the garden. On opening the door, I saw all of our hens killed inside the house with their heads removed. Only one hen had survived and was petrified, hiding in a tree where she had escaped the attack.\nCrafty Mr. Fox. Usually a poultry keeper’s number one problem?\nWhilst I love nature and have a live and let live attitude towards most things, this experience has given me a vivid memory of a fox attack and that makes me pretty vigilant when it comes to keeping my chickens and ducks safe. I appreciate that not all of the protection methods here will suit everyone, but I will give you as many ideas as possible to help you keep your chickens safe.\nWhich method(s) you choose is up to you but I do appreciate many people like to see foxes around, yet others don’t and would rather kill them…This article aims to give you some practical advice on how to alleviate or eliminate fox problems. You can decide which methods are best suited to your views on foxes and how much time and energy you need to invest relative to the scale of the problem. Whatever your view of Mr. Fox I hope you manage to keep him and your poultry apart!\nWas it a fox that killed my chickens?\nFoxes are careful, fastidious hunters and there isn’t normally much evidence of a visit. If birds are out in a large run or field during the day, a small patch of feathers is normally all you will find. They do of course need an entry and exit point and if the area is fenced, this is normally a small hole under a gate or fence. There will usually be no signs of entry if they have managed to get over the top of a fence.\nIf a fox gets into a small run or chicken house and there are a number of birds in there, they can get into a killing ‘frenzy’ and will kill 30 or more birds, usually taking only one bird with them. Typically, they will bite the heads off the birds. Sometimes, they will bury the bodies if there is enough loose soil. The photo to the right shows a duck that was killed and part buried. There were scrape marks on the ground where the soil had been gathered.\nHow many foxes killed my chickens?\nFoxes are normally lone hunters, except when they first leave their mother when they will often hunt as a pair or a trio. They are pack animals and will keep in touch with the other members of their family by barking. You can sometimes hear this at night. So it is normally only one fox.\nWhen are my birds most at risk?\nThe times your birds are most at risk is when foxes are feeding their cubs in the spring. Another time to be careful is around August time when the mother leaves the cubs to go and find their own food. You are more likely to have a visit from a fox during the daytime when the cubs are learning to hunt and aren’t so wary of people. I have had young foxes sitting at the end of my garden watching me release my ducks out into their run at this time of year.\nAre urban and country foxes different?\nThere is no difference between an urban and a country fox – they are both the same species, however, the fox has adapted to many different environments around the world.\nThe urban or country fox is one and the same species.\nBoth urban and country foxes do not know how to hunt in the different environment they are presented with. Problems can occur when somebody has caught a fox in a trap and released it into the countryside as this fox is in unfamiliar territory and does not know where to get its food from and is often in another foxes’ territory and will be attacked.\nHow to protect poultry from foxes\nThere are two options here which are THE most effective means of protection if done properly: poultry fencing or an electric fence. A good fence should be at least 6 feet high if it’s not electrified and ideally have an outward sloping top to prevent the fox from climbing over into your chicken run. Electric fences are becoming more popular and are really quite good at keeping foxes out if they are working correctly. If the battery is flat, or the fence is shorted to ground via some overgrown vegetation touching the wires then it is a pretty pointless exercise. Electric fences come in two varieties – electric poultry netting that has electric strands running through it and the electrified ‘wire’ that is placed in front of the existing fence to stop a fox digging under or climbing over the fence, often called a tri-wire. To be effective, there needs to be electrified strands at sniffing height. A fox will always use its nose to investigate first and after receiving a shock from the fence, it will act as a psychological barrier.\nIn studies (by Wildlife Online) foxes have normally received a shock from an electric fence once, occasionally twice before learning to stay away. Once they have received a shock, they will not dig under or jump over a fence, even if they can easily clear the top of the fence (such as with electric poultry netting at only one metre high) so these are an effective barrier to protect poultry.\nThe following video clip was taken from a BBC Documentary called “The Private Life of… Chickens” and shows you how easily a fox will squeeze under a fence:\n1. Locking up your birds at night\nThis seems to be obvious – and of course it won’t stop visits during the late afternoon or early morning but you are more likely to have a fox visit during the night. So lock up those birds EVERY night without fail!\nI use this automatic pop hole opener made by AXT Electronic in Germany for my chickens. These cost you a few bob but work very well indeed. They close your pop hole when it gets dark and reopen it when it gets light. I also use the additional time clock module though which keeps the door closed until a preset time in the mornings – this stops the chickens from going out at 4am during the summer months when they could be at risk from a fox and also keeps my noisy cockerel inside until a sensible hour in the morning!\nAn Automatic Door Opener / Closer\nSome manufacturers include the timer in their design. You can see a range of different models for sale on this page here.\n2. Secure accommodation\nAnother fairly obvious one but imagine a dog with a tugger-toy, a fox is no different in terms of strength and if he can get hold of a panel or door he can tug quite hard to open or break it. Flimsy door catches on a hen-house in an unfenced area present no great challenge to a determined fox.\nHumane fox traps can be bought from various country stores and online suppliers. These are large cages that are baited. When the fox enters, it triggers the trap, closing the door behind him. Traps need to be placed on a run known to be frequented by the fox. Traps need to be camouflaged since foxes are very intelligent creatures.\nTraps must be inspected frequently and of course the big question is what to do with it if you succeed in capturing it. A trapped fox must not be released elsewhere (see below) they must be humanely dispatched. A suitable shotgun or firearm is the usual method although the person (in the UK) must hold a valid shotgun certificate.\n4. Re-homing urban foxes to the countryside\nI personally do not believe in ‘re-homing’ a fox by trapping it, then driving out-of-town to the countryside before releasing it. Firstly, foxes are territorial animals and other foxes in the area will attack it, secondly, it will need to eat before too long and doesn’t know where to find food in its new environment. The fox may find somebody else’s chickens but will probably starve to death. Thirdly, the local farmer will probably have to go out and shoot it. Foxes, like dogs learn from their environment as cubs. An urban fox has learnt different methods of scavenging and hunting to foxes in the countryside so it will be a very unpleasant or slow death for the animal.\n5. Flashing Lights\nA flashing light can work as a deterrent as long as you move it around regularly. Once the fox gets used to it, it will no longer be scared but can be a useful deterrent in the shorter term. This fear of new or unusual items in their territory is called neophobia.\nThere are several units available that flash lights and are designed to mimick the reflection of eyes watching the predator. You can see a selection here.\n6. Can our dog keep foxes away?\nA family dog may keep a fox away. The fox can smell the presence of the dog which can put the fox off but if it’s hungry, it will probably just avoid the times that the dog is around and since dogs are social animals, it would be cruel to leave a dog on guard on his own for long periods of time.\nLlamas apparently keep foxes away by driving them off. It is well-known that Llamas are used to protect flocks of sheep with lambs from predators. The young Llama grows up with the flock and sees them as ‘family’ and will apparently chase foxes away! A little extravagant for your average backyard poultry keeper but maybe worth thinking about for smallholders. Read our Using Llamas to protect Chickens against Foxes article\n8. Shooting Foxes\nProviding that the area is suitable for shooting, with the correct Shotgun certificate or Firearms Licence and the right sort of gun, foxes can be shot to keep their numbers down.\nWhen fox numbers have reached a certain level, they will regulate their own numbers so shooting a number of foxes will cause a greater number of vixens in the area to have cubs the next spring. An experienced waterfowl keeper whose husband was a keen shooter said they do not shoot foxes in their area because they have learnt they can’t get in to their field after touching the electric fence where they keep their birds so will not keep trying. If you shoot these foxes, more foxes will move into the area.\nA separate article “Shooting Foxes” gives more information about the licence requirements in the UK and methods of luring the fox to within range of a gun if you would like to learn more about this method of control.\nSome common myths about foxes\n1. Foxes only come out at night.\nWhilst they prefer the cover of darkness and your chickens are mainly at risk at night, some attacks actually occur during the daytime: the chickens are out in the garden or field, there’s a quick dash from the hedge and all you find is a heap of feathers. Young foxes that are learning to hunt for themselves will often be out during the daytime and will be brave enough to approach areas that older foxes would avoid.\nA young fox taking a stroll along my fence during the day.\n2. A fox cannot get through chicken wire.\nLarge foxes can ‘tear’ 1 inch chicken wire open with his teeth to gain entrance to a chicken run. This is normally only if the wire is weak, loose or damaged in some way. The rectangular wire seems more successful but a hungry determined fox can get his teeth into 1 inch round chicken wire (sometimes called rabbit wire) and pull, stretching the wire until it breaks.\nTry to get the strongest wire you can for your chicken run or double up the wire on the lower sections that are most at risk. Not all chicken wire is equal! Look for heavier gauge, galvanised wire and buy from a reputable supplier. There is more guidance on how to build a chicken run / poultry fence that is secure from foxes here.\n3. Foxes can’t jump over a 5 foot fence.\nOh yes they can! I’ve heard of people losing chickens after a fox scaled their 5ft high fence and I have lost birds too. Generally though, you should provide at least a 6 foot high fence to keep foxes out and ideally provide a mesh roof or an outward facing slope like you see on many security fences. You also need to bury the wire a foot under the ground. It’s a lot of work but if you do the job properly once, it will save you so much heart ache and cost.\nLatest posts by Tim Daniels (see all)\n- Northampton & District Poultry Club Spring Show 2016 - 1st May 2016\n- Incubation Humidity - 6th March 2016\n- Reading Bantam Show 2016 - 5th March 2016\n- Federation Poultry Show 2015 - 23rd December 2015","Arctic Foxes are no longer threatened directly by humans. Their extreme habitat challenges them; but they continue to do well, other than in the Scandinavian mainland. They are an interesting species because they typically mate for life, but also use the help of an extra female to tend to their young. They live in the tundra and have a fur coat which provides camouflage and changes with the season.\nArctic fox numbers in the wild have rebounded due to the decline in the fur trade; but they remain endangered in the Scandinavian mainland, where their numbers are estimated to be as few as 120.\nOne threat they face in their environment is the movement of the red fox further to the North. This is believed to have occurred due to climate change. It causes the Arctic fox to now compete with the much larger, and typically more aggressive, red fox. The red fox is the largest of the foxes.\nArctic fox locations are also tied to the movement of lemming populations, a primary food source. Arctic foxes remain opportunistic due to the scarcity of food in the harsh tundra habitat.\nArctic foxes are white in winter, having a thick coat to protect them from the elements. They also have a thick tail which they use to curl around themselves as protection from the harsh wind and cold tundra winters. Their tails also help them to balance.\nIn warm summer temperatures, the fox’s coat changes from white to gray, brown, or yellow, helping it to remain camouflaged in its surroundings. There is also a blue phase fox which has a long gray coat in winter and a darker gray coat with a sometimes brownish tinge in the summer. The summer coats of the arctic fox are shorter and thinner.\nTheir beautiful warm coats caused them to be threatened, due largely to hunting by humans. Now that the fur trade has decreased, efforts to help the fox have successfully restored their numbers. They are still hunted, but typically in more remote areas.\nArctic foxes build dens, sometimes in the snow, but also in rocks or low mounds. They are extremely resourceful and well adapted to their surroundings, as they use the snow to help keep stored food from going bad.\nThe main predator of the fox is the polar bear, yet they closely and bravely follow bears to scavenge on the leftovers from kills. The arctic fox is an omnivore that will hunt creatively for small mammals and eat berries or vegetation other times. They even eat insects, birds, bird eggs, fish and stool, depending upon what is available.\nWhen hunting, males and females will jump off of the ice or snow and pounce back down to break through air pockets and get prey located beneath. Their exquisite hearing and forward facing ears help them to detect small prey below the snow with amazing accuracy.\nArctic foxes are monogamous, they typically live in a family group with one male and two females that tend to the young. The younger female often remains from the prior year’s litter and assists with caring for pups. However, the male fox also helps in rearing the young.\nLitters usually consist of five to nine pups, though as many as 25 young have been documented. They are born in two litters a year, one sometime near April and the other in July. Their gestation period only lasts about eight weeks.\nThe arctic fox is an animal that is remarkably well adapted to a barren habitat. Their small groups and litters twice a year, along with the aid of man who has come to protect it, has helped their numbers rebound. This magnificent arctic animal is no longer threatened by humans in most locations. Efforts have been made to protect them from hunters, who sought them in order to also utilize their warm and beautiful coats.\nBy Lara Stielow"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1c73b88e-8adb-46c2-a451-5c2be8c871a2>","<urn:uuid:394964cc-24a6-41e7-87aa-0fd11f36a497>"],"error":null}

The medieval mace weapon was a fearsome looking weapon, the most common design incorporated a long handle usually made from metal or wood with some type of metal spiked ball at the end, however there were many different mace weapon designs which usually involved small changes to the head such as flanged, knobbed or spiked mace heads. Unlike medieval flails maces did not have any chain at the end of the shaft connected to the spiked ball. Often the Medieval mace would have a spike sticking out of the end of the head. The morning Star was also a weapon that could be described as being a Medieval mace.\nWhat were medieval mace weapons made from?\nMedieval maces usually had long handles that were sometimes made of wood or more commonly metal, mace weapons could be made of bronze, iron or steel, but the most common metal used to make a medieval mace weapon was probably bronze. If a mace weapon was to be used for any ceremonial purposes it could even be made from gold or silver.\nHeavy metal mace\nWhat type of weapon was Medieval mace\nThe Medieval mace was a close combat weapon that was classed as being a clubbing and bruising type of weapon, it was not designed to cut skin and draw blood, this meant that the medieval mace could be used by churchmen or clerics who were not allowed to draw blood in combat in medieval times. The later medieval mace heads looked similar to the design of a dart flight. Medieval maces were light weapons and they had a security chain at the bottom of the handle for the soldiers wrist to stop the weapon being lost in close combat fighting situations.\nWho used medieval maces\nMedieval Maces were often used in ceremonies by clerics, lawyers and royalty, it was also a weapon that was commonly associated with the medieval knight, used in medieval tournaments in melee and joust contests.\nGothic mace weapons\nDuring the medieval period mace weapons were being upgraded along with other medieval weapons and during the Gothic period the Gothic mace was introduced, it had a thicker shaft in the grip area and a guard and pommel was added that was similar to what you would find on a medieval sword handle.\nA German Knight Holding a German Heavy Mace\nHistory of the Medieval mace weapon\nMedieval maces were believed to have been used in the 10th century and they are depicted as a weapon used by the Normans in the Bayeux tapestry, maces are also shown in the maciejowski Bible of the 13th century and it is known that the Nomads and Turks used medieval mace weapons in combat that had animal head designs.\nThe morning Star – a medieval mace weapon?\nThe morning Star is a type of medieval mace, it combined the mace design with spear points. The head of the morning Star looks like a pineapple head, some historians have also suggested that the morning Star was a type of flail weapon attached to the staff by a chain, however this is not the common view taken.

{"question":"How do communication channels differ between small and large groups, and what are the cross-cultural implications of group communication?","answer":"In small groups, communication channels are more manageable - between two people there is only one channel, and three people have three channels. However, larger groups become exponentially more complex, following the Thelen formula where channels = n(n-1)/2. Groups over 18-20 people tend to receive emotional, simple messages more effectively and require visual support. When communicating across cultures, these dynamics are further complicated by different norms - for example, Asian cultures value silence as showing good listening skills, while Western cultures try to fill silences quickly. For large cross-cultural groups, it's crucial to understand these cultural nuances and potentially work with language consultants to bridge communication gaps.","context":["You Cannot Avoid Communicating\nToday it is obvious that human resources are the added value of all organizations. But it is not always obvious that “soft skills”—those skills related to interpersonal behavior rather than technical expertise—are crucial to organizations. But their importance has emerged along with new organizational models that give more responsibility to individuals. For instance: The organization used to discipline communication channels; now this must be achieved by individuals alone. Decision making used to lie with a few well-defined persons; today, decision making is widespread across the organization. Conflicts used to be managed solely by middle and top management; today, all employees negotiate with one another. It is increasingly important that all professionals become familiar with soft skills. The Way Ahead will analyze and explain a number of these skills in upcoming issues. No matter what kind of job a person has, he must be able to handle the complicated interactions among individuals and within groups. —Michele Tesoro-Tess\nTo communicate, you need a transmitter, or better, a message, a receptor, and a context in which the communication process occurs. You also need a code to enable the receptor to “read” and understand the message.\nThe ingredients listed above are true for each and every type of communication, including communication between machines. Take, for instance, a fire-alarm system. The transmitter is represented by an outside element (i.e., smoke and/or increase of heat) that behaves in a specific context, which is the air in a room. The receptor is the sensor that “reads” the signal through a predefined code and reacts by expelling water or another liquid to extinguish the fire.\nBetween people, there is the advantage that the code is not given by an external entity but is sought by the two communicators while they establish a relationship.\nFor instance, it is easy to imagine how two people who speak two different languages, and use two different linguistic codes, try to use alternative ways to under- stand each other, such as the abundant use of body language and visual expressions.\nAt this point, we can pose a number of truisms:\n- Human beings cannot pull themselves back from communication because they are social beings. You cannot avoid communicating.\n- While communicating, you cannot elude context; communicating in your friend’s living room is not the same as communicating in an emergency situation. The context conditions the meaning of the message.\n- All living species use a code to communicate. The code is not only a collection of shared logical meanings (words or signs) but is all the messages that the transmitter sends to the receptor (expressions, behaviors), and it comprehends all that is defined as body language. Communication between living species is the search for a common code.\n- The last consideration concerns the check of the effects that we have obtained with our communication process: the feedback. The use of feedback makes the communication process a circular onethat does not distinguish between transmitter and receptor. The continuity of the process renders the two protagonists active parts within a communication relationship. Communication means relating to each other.\nTo find the true meaning of communication, let’s examine the word’s Latin origins. Some experts believe that communication means put in common—“communis agere” or “cum munera” (with gifts). Others insist that communication derives from “cum moenia” (with walls, defensive ones). Obviously, this latter meaning is opposite to the former one, but we must not exclude it because in some ways the concept of communication does contain some ambivalence.\nIt is true that we communicate to share or put together information, data, or numbers. But it is also true that communication is used to exclude someone or to defend our- selves from someone or something. Examples include the specific information technology languages that exclude “normal” human beings from understanding, secret codes used during war to keep operations and plans from the opponent, and the invented languages children create to avoid adults’ understanding. Therefore, to communicate “with con- science,” one needs:\n- The understanding of the context in which the communication occurs. In other words, the awareness of the environmental and psychological situation in which the communication takes place. For instance, when you make a phone call to someone, you are well aware of the context you are in, but you often ignore the physical and psychological situation of the other person, which sometimes causes unpleasant circumstances.\n- The will to understand each other and to try to find a common code. Often it is useful to disclose and explain the specific meaning of words or terms to avoid misunderstandings during the communication process.\n- The need for feedback—in other words, the need to establish a two-way communication path between the protagonists. The need for feedback is highlighted during emergency situations. When a pilot communicates with ground control, it is compulsory for him/her to repeat what the other has said.\n- We have just seen how communication between people is a “two-way” path (message and feedback) aimed at generating a change in the knowledge and in the behavior of another. The objectives of communication therefore are:\n- Being understood—put the other person in a position to receive in a clear way the message given and to be able to interpret the meaning of it with regard to a shared aim.\n- Being remembered—enables the other, after time, to “find” the message.\nBeing understood is a function that can be defined as “digital,” and it is positioned in the brain (left side) of the protagonist, enabling one to interpret in a logical way the meaning of the message. Being remembered is “analogical” and is normally positioned at “stomach level” or at the level of the heart (right side of the brain). This function permits allocating the specific message within a collection of other messages archived in the brain of the protagonist.\nThese concepts are much more complicated when one goes beyond the simple communication relationship “person-to-person” and considers the communication of a group with a group. Among a vast number of persons, one must consider that there are many potential “two-way” communication channels. Between two people we have only one open channel, and between three people we still have three “two-way” channels. But things get more complicated when the number of people is more than three. In fact, from four people on, in order to calculate the number of opened communication channels, one must use the Thelen formula. This formula may be synthesized in this way:\nNumber of channels=number of persons (number of persons 1) / 2\nFor instance, if a group contains six people, there are 15 open communication channels. In a group of eight people, the channels opened would be 28. It is true that in a group, the members do not always use all the channels available at the same time, but the presence of all these potential channels creates a pressure on the group. This pressure may have a number of consequences:\n- As the number of components of a group increases, so does the time to carry out the work, in a more than proportional manner.\n- In a large group, more than 18 to 20 people, messages that are highly irrational and full of emotions tend to be received more effectively.\n- It is necessary to have a strong organization and rationalization of all communication channels.\nWhat does all this mean at an operative level?\n- If you have a short time for a meeting, you must keep the number of participants at a minimum. Adding a couple of people may double the time needed to do the job.\n- If the group is large (more than 20 members), one must privilege the emotion- al channel and give very simple concepts (black or white, good or bad) rich in emotional elements. It is basically impossible to explain in detail a complicated concept and therefore best to use the visual channel (e.g., graphs) to support the verbal/listening channels. It is furthermore difficult to manage a series of feedbacks because the pressure that is generated acts as a censor to questions and comments.\n- If you must stimulate debate or moments of analysis and/or focus within a large group, it will be necessary to divide the group into smaller groups of, at a maximum, 5–6 people. It will be possible to use the natural competition between groups to enhance performance and increase the quality of the work done.\nTherefore, people making business presentations to large groups should consider several issues:\n1. One’s presentation must be well structured in three distinct parts.\nSay what will be said….\n- Introduction with a personal presentation and reference to the listeners and their possible motivations.\n- Description of the aim (reason why of the presentation). Synthesis of the main guidelines of the presentation and estimation of the length of the presentation.\nB. Central part where the message is described in detail, using a variety of logical schemes, such as:\n- Chronological (yesterday/today/tomorrow), which is the easiest to understand.\n- Geographical (in Italy/in Europe/in the world), which is also easy to perceive.\n- In steps (Step 1/Step 2/Step 3).\n- Tree (a-a1, a2, a3, b-b1, b2, b3).\n- Matrix (products/markets).\nWhile the first two logical schemes may be used without visual supports, the last three need continuous recalls to diagrams, charts, etc.\nSay what you have said….\nC. Conclude by summing up the logical scheme used and the issues explained, and give a personal statement.\n2. Evaluate the audience\nTry to understand the psychological situation of the listeners and, therefore, the motivation of those who are “exposed” to your message. It is important to refer to the prevailing behavior, which could be\n- Of extreme interest to the specific issue (you just need to be clear and give many examples to explain the concept).\n- Of complete indifference to the specific issue (it is important to “touch” their feelings and emotions).\n- Of opposition to the specific issue and maybe also to the speaker (it is important to demonstrate that you are open to discussion, and the speech must be well-structured, and the examples given must be 100% undeniable).\n3. Check the context\nRemember that to receive a message and listen with ease, it is important in many cases to be able to see what is being presented. Therefore, it is important to verify the correct functioning of the audio system and ensure that slides can be seen clearly. Also check the temperature of the room and the comfort of the environment in general.\nDon't miss our latest content, delivered to your inbox monthly. Sign up for the TWA newsletter.

Your suppliers may be located halfway across the world, your partners may have just moved from another country and your customers may speak a different language than you.\nIn order for businesses to succeed in this global environment, it’s important to know how to navigate cross-cultural communication. By implementing strategies to succeed in cross-cultural business endeavors while crossing hurdles, organizations can show their customers and stakeholders that they value their relationships.\nWhat Is Cross-Cultural Communication?\nCross-cultural communication involves conversing, negotiating and exchanging information either verbally or nonverbally with people who are of different cultures. People from different backgrounds communicate in different ways and follow various societal norms that may be unfamiliar to someone who is not of that culture.\nThe importance of cross-cultural understanding is paramount in business. For example, in Asian cultures, silence within a conversation is a critical aspect that demonstrates good listening skills. Within a business setting, if you ask a question, you may not receive a response right away. The silence between the question and the answer is deemed acceptable and shows that the people involved are paying attention and considering what they say carefully. On the other hand, people from the United States, Brazil or France view silence as an awkward part of the conversation and attempt to fill it up as quickly as possible. When dealing with business partners from Asian cultures, this may show them that you are not paying attention or not listening carefully enough.\nEnsuring Business Success\nIn order to successfully communicate with people from different cultures in business, it’s important to proactively learn how to deal with cross-cultural differences. The best way to communicate is to build trust with your business partners. You can do this by researching the cross-cultural communication differences and being aware of them prior to your meeting. This proactive approach shows your partners that you are invested in the success of your work together.\nSimilarly, it’s important to know the do’s and don’ts of your interaction. Being well prepared will lead businesses to success during cross-cultural communication. For example, in French, German and Israeli cultures, disagreements are expressed directly and forcefully. However, in Brazil or Thailand, the way people disagree is more gentle and subtle. Understanding these nuances prior to the conversation can help the business succeed when dealing with other cultures.\nInvesting in the right tools and assistance can also go a long way. Some businesses work with foreign language consultants who help to bridge the divide between cross-cultural communications. Others hire people in the communications field, such as marketing copywriters, in the country they are doing business to ensure that their marketing message is communicated authentically the way a local would speak.\nOvercoming Cultural Barriers\nThe barriers to cross-cultural communication can cause businesses difficulties, especially if they are not prepared for the nuances that come with conversing with people from other parts of the world. Language is one of the biggest cross-cultural factors in the workplace. Not everyone conducts business in English. If working with someone who speaks English as a second language, some finer elements of the conversation may get lost in translation.\nHowever, there can still be communication barriers between someone from the United States and someone from the United Kingdom who both speak English as their primary language. That’s because culture plays a major role in the way people communicate. Many people don’t expect there to be a cultural difference with someone who speaks the same language and are then caught off guard when they are faced with a communication barrier.\nNonverbal communication can also act as a barrier to cross-cultural communication. In many Western countries, eye contact is seen as a way to build trust and show honesty and integrity. However, in some Middle Eastern cultures, eye contact is considered rude and too forward. For women, it’s seen as a sign of sexual interest. Similarly, pointing to another person using a finger is acceptable in Western countries. However, in Japan the gesture is extremely rude. By proactively knowing the communication differences across cultures, businesses can increase their chances of success when engaging in cross-cultural communication."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:29622a30-1ee9-48a4-b0a5-eb21c6f97bf7>","<urn:uuid:18bdedee-6b07-4d64-8e62-1ae96f8c8b99>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can pest damage vary by home area?","answer":"Yes, pest damage varies significantly by home area, primarily due to moisture levels and location. Cockroaches are attracted to wet areas in homes, particularly bathrooms and areas with leaking pipes, as they constantly seek water sources. Similarly, dampwood termites prefer damp, outdoor wood and may infest wood piles. In contrast, drywood termites appear primarily in coastal regions and prefer dry, intact wood found in house walls or furniture. The most destructive variety, subterranean termites, can enter through the home's foundation and underground areas, creating mud tubes in walls, posts, joists, and sills. These variations make it crucial to monitor different areas of the home, from bathrooms and pipes for roaches to foundations and wooden structures for various types of termites.","context":["Having pests in your home can feel like an invasion of your sacred space. Rats, mice, cockroaches, termites, and other unsavory home invaders don’t make for good roommates — and can also present you and your family with safety concerns. Rats and roaches can carry disease, while termites may make your home structurally unsound. Your best option to eradicate pests is to call pest control services, who can send an exterminator or who specialize in rodent control or termite control, for example. It’s also wise to see what might be attracting pests to your home — is there trash or food left in your home that’s attracting mice? Are baseboards, pipes or ducts, or any other entries to your home sealed up? Keeping your house clean and sealed up can go a long way towards not having to call a pest control service.\nWhat Dangers Can Pests Pose?\nThe main concern when it comes to pests is how they affect your health. Mice, rats, fleas, and cockroaches are all responsible for spreading diseases, bacteria, and other pathogens which are harmful to humans. A national study showed that over 80% of homes in the United States contained mouse allergens and other studies have shown that American roaches are responsible for spreading a minimum of 33 types of bacteria, six different types of parasitic worm, and seven other human pathogens.\nTermites can cause structural damage to your home or other buildings, making them unsafe to live in. Around 15% of new homes even have major structural damages or defects, which include termite damage. Living in a termite damaged home is inadvisable, making them a costly pest.\nAnd, psychologically, having pests in your home can be damaging. Having an influx of mice or cockroaches — or worst of all, bedbugs — can be stressful and horrifying to many people. And once you’ve had them, the fear that they’ll come back lingers for awhile after.\nHow Can a Pest Control Service Help?\nA pest control service can help you eradicate your pestilence and give you some peace of mind. If you’ve been trying to rid yourself of mice or roaches, or another type of pest unsuccessfully, calling in pest control services sooner rather than later is always a good idea.\nAn exterminator will look at your situation and figure out a plan of attack that’s specific and pointed, as well as help you devise strategies to keep them from coming back. They can also monitor your home afterwards and come back to do preventive treatment after the first treatment has had time to kick in.\nHiring an exterminator right when the problem shows up may take care of it more efficiently than home remedies and will ultimately cost less than trying to do it yourself — and likely having to call in an exterminator afterwards. They’re also trained to handle their products safely and where they should be placed inside (or outside) of a home.\nHow Can I Keep A Pest Situation Under Control?\nCertainly calling an exterminator is a good first step, but to keep them from returning, you want to cast an eye to your home. Making sure crumbs and spills are swept up regularly and that containers are sealed. Fruit can often attract pests like ants or fruit flies, which are drawn to the sugar.\nMake sure that your exterior is well sealed against would-be invaders. Keeping your pets clean — especially if they’re outdoor pets — can also help prevent pests from hitching a ride inside. Try and reduce water or moisture in your home as much as possible — ventilated bathrooms and keeping an eye out for leaking pipes is crucial. Cockroaches, for example, are always on the lookout for water. Apart from them though, wet areas provide good breeding spots and gathering places for pests.\nKeep your home well-protected from pests and if you happen to have a pest problem, take care of it immediately. It’ll only get worse if you wait. In just one year, for example, one female mouse might have five to 10 litters with between five or six babies per litter. Call a pest control service to take back control of your home.\nShare This : by","Americans spend more than $2 billion each year fighting termite infestations. They spend billions more repairing the damage termites have done to their homes and properties.\nBut just how much damage can termites do? Do all termites cause the same types and degrees of damage? What can you do if you suspect you may have a termite problem?\nKeep reading now to learn what termite damage looks like, how dangerous it is, and what you can do to protect your home today.\nTypes of Termites\nThe first important thing to know about termites is that there is more than one kind. The three primary types of termites are:\nDrywood termites are small and appear primarily in coastal regions. They like dry, intact wood like that found in house walls or furniture. Colonies tend to be small and they eat through wood slowly.\nDampwood termites prefer damp, outdoor wood. They may infest sickly trees or wood piles rather than homes. They also tend to eat through wood slowly.\nSubterranean termites are the most damaging to homes. They are larger in size than the other types of termites and live in bigger colonies. They can enter homes through subterranean nests and tunnels and eat through wood very fast.\nSubterranean termites can be less noticeable than their counterparts, as well, meaning that they often have more time to do damage before homeowners notice that there is a problem. It is not uncommon for multiple colonies to feed on one house at the same time. Unfortunately, subterranean termites are the most common in Tenessee in general and the Memphis area in particular.\nWhat Does Termite Damage Look Like?\nVisible evidence of a termite infestation is most apparent between March and June and then again in September and October. The CDC recommends that homeowners look for the following signs:\n- Swarms of termites on or around windowsills or doors\n- Mud tubes (about pencil-sized) burrowed into walls, posts, joists, sills, and other wooden portions of their homes’ structures\n- Wood that is damaged or hollow\n- Termite feces on windowsills\n- Discoloration on or bad odors coming from walls\nAuthorities suggest that homeowners in the Southeast inspect their homes for possible termite house damage at least twice per year. If any potentials signs of an infestation are present, it is essential to take action right away. Additionally, when trying to buy a home you may need to get a real estate WDI inspection.\nCan Termites Destroy a House?\nHaving any kind of pest in your home is obviously unwelcome. But what can termites do, exactly? Can they really destroy a house?\nTermite infestations will not immediately make a home unsafe. However, termite destruction can cause serious structural damage to a home in as little as three years, making it unsafe to inhabit.\nThis happens because house termites eat away at critical wood supports within the home. That, in turn, creates an unsafe strain on the whole structure. Repairing that damage can be an enormous undertaking.\nIt is not uncommon for homes to need to be gutted down to the studs to reveal and repair that type of damage. This can be true even for homes made of brick and other materials, as most homes have some form of wooden supports in them.\nTermite feces can also imbue homes with a bad smell. They may cause walls to warp or discolor, as well. Again, this can lead to stripping a house or a portion of a house down to its studs to effect repairs.\nOther types of common termite destruction include:\n- Damage to a home’s foundation\n- Damage to windows and doors\n- Creation of openings for other pests or moisture to infiltrate the home\n- Damage to the furniture within a home, requiring its repair or replacement\n- The ruination of books, boxes, photos, documents, and other paper-based materials within the home\nWhile it may take termites a few years to make your home structurally unsafe, the range of damage they can do means that even a short-lived infestation can be costly and time-consuming to recover from.\nRepairing Termite Damage and Preventing Infestations\nEPA guidelines offer homeowners a variety of ways to reduce the likelihood of a pest infestation in their homes. Among the most important steps are:\n- Following construction guidelines appropriate to your climate\n- Not using wood products in ground fill during construction\n- Maintaining your property to minimize conditions that attract pests\nIn climates like Tenessee’s, however, additional pest prevention is necessary. Most homeowners will need to adopt an integrated pest management system or strategy to protect their homes from termites and other damaging pests.\nIn theory, this is something that homeowners might be able to develop and implement themselves. In practice, the DIY approach has many drawbacks.\n- Researching the best pesticides and applications can be time-consuming\n- Making mistakes when applying pesticides can render them useless\n- Using the wrong pesticides can be dangerous to residents of the home and their pets\n- Many homeowners are uncomfortable storing pest control products in their homes, particularly with children or pets around\n- Homeowners are often busy and may forget or simply not have time to treat their homes when needed\n- Homeowners without experience in pest control may miss important signs of infestation or damage\nAs a result, Memphis homeowners tend to find that they achieve better results by hiring a professional pest management service to protect their homes. Professional termite control services:\n- Have the experience and expertise to identify infestations early, preventing damage\n- Can treat homes to prevent termite invasion in the first place\n- Use safe, EPA-approved pesticides at regular intervals\n- Can eradicate termite colonies if they appear\n- Remove the burden of pest-control maintenance from busy homeowners\n- Can treat properties before a new structure is erected for proactive protection\nProfessional treatments and maintenance can provide peace of mind and offer the best protection against costly termite damage.\nDon’t let termite damage cost you thousands of dollars in repairs.

One in three said they read to children from their mobile phones, and 90% of respondents said they would be spending more time reading on their mobile phones in the next year.\nThe study, says Unesco in its report, found that “people read more when they read on mobile devices, that they enjoy reading more, and that people commonly read books and stories to children from mobile devices”.\n“The study shows that mobile reading represents a promising, if still underutilised, pathway to text,” says the report, for which Unesco partnered with Worldreader – a global not-for-profit organisation that works to bring digital books to readers around the world – and Nokia. “It is not hyperbole to suggest that if every person on the planet understood that his or her mobile phone could be transformed – easily and cheaply – into a library brimming with books, access to text would cease to be such a daunting hurdle to literacy.”\nThe report’s author Mark West said that the key conclusion from the study was that “mobile devices can help people develop, sustain and enhance their literacy skills”.\n“This is important because literacy opens the door to life-changing opportunities and benefits”.\nReasons given by respondents for reading on mobiles were convenience, affordability and lack of access to books. In Zimbabwe, for example, Unesco said the cost of reading a book on a mobile was between 5 and 6 cents, while a paperback bestseller would cost around $12 (£7); in Nigeria, a mobile book would cost around 1 or 2 cents, based on a mobile broadband rate of $13 per 500 MB of data, while a child’s book would cost between $1 and $5.\nUnesco pointed to data from the UN, which shows that of the seven billion people on earth, more than six billion now have access to a working mobile phone. “Collectively, mobile devices are the most ubiquitous information and communication technology in history,” says Unesco. “More to the point, they are plentiful in places where books are scarce.”\nThe most popular genre for readers was romance, the survey found, with the “romance” icon on Worldreader Mobile receiving 17% of all 730,787 clicks during the research period. Nineteen of the top 40 books read during the study period were romance novels, with Ravinder Singh’s Can Love Happen Twice? the most popular book, followed by the Mills & Boon title The Price of Royal Duty in second, and the Bible in third.\nKwame Nkrumah’s The Great African and Nnedi Okorafor’s The Girl with the Magic Hands were also among the most read books between April and June 2013, with the most popular search terms over the period “sex”, “Bible” and “biology”. Chinua Achebe came in fourth, with “Things fall apart”, ahead of “love” in fifth. Religion was the second most popular genre, said Unesco.\nThe survey also found that mobile reading is a “huge tool of empowerment for women”, said Worldreader’s Nadja Borovac. While 77% of mobile readers in developing countries are male, women spend an average of 207 minutes per month reading on their mobile phones, compared to men’s 33 minutes. Unesco’s report points out that in sub-Saharan Africa, a woman is 23% less likely to own a mobile phone than a man, with the gap widening in the case of data-enabled phones. “Men use mobiles for reading most, but the most active readers are women,” said Borovac.\nAlmost two-thirds (60%) of respondents cited lack of content as the primary barrier to mobile reading, and a third said they were keen to read to their children from their mobiles if there were more child-friendly material available.\nOne respondent, Charles, a teacher in Zimbabwe, said he reads to his class from his mobile, and cited lack of printed content as his main reason for turning to his phone. “We live in a remote area where there are no libraries, and the books I have in my own small library are the ones which I have already read. So this is now giving me a chance to choose from a variety of fiction titles,” he said.\nBorovac said that mobile reading was “not a future phenomenon, but something which is happening today”.\n“It can really change people’s lives,” she said. “We work in countries where there is a serious shortage of books but where cell phones are plentiful … We are hoping people will realise the potential of mobile reading [as a result of the report], and that governments and partners will get behind not only us but other organisations using mobile technology to help provide learning and books, and help improve literacy skills.”","Hansa Bhargava MD FAAP\nStaff Physician, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta\nMedical Editor, WebMD\nPediatricians are seeing more and more teens suffering from stress. Whether they are complaining of it or having somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches, it seems that stress and anxiety are on the rise. We know that over scheduling, homework, and the pressures of getting into college can contribute to this. But can media also affect it? Is screen time and media a stressor or a remedy for stress?\nIn a recent WebMD survey published in their Teens and Stress report, 54% of teens were stressed according to parents. Interestingly, 40% of parents turned to the screen for family stress relief while 58% of teens did. Social media and texting was used as stress relief by almost half the teens. This is on the heels of the Common Sense Media survey reporting that US teens were using media for 9 hours a day. Other recent reports have shown that 94% of teens with mobile devices are online daily with many online constantly.\nSo it seems that stress is on the rise and media use is on the rise. Although there may not be a direct relationship, some real issues impact stress and anxiety. Consider this: 23 % of teens report cyberbullying, especially girls. There have been reports of “Facebook depression” and loneliness, as kids who aren’t in social media conversations may feel left out. Other negative consequences can also have an impact: many teens are in front of a screen late at night or ‘sleep text’, both of which can contribute to lack of sleep, which in turn can decrease focus and potentially cause irritability and depression. And last but certainly not least, what about the time media consumes?\nTime spent on media is time often not spent communicating with family. Lately, when I’ve gone into a restaurant, I’ve observed that as soon as a family sits down, everyone pulls out a mobile device. No one is really talking. So even the short amount of time not doing homework, playing soccer, or at school is being compromised. Psychologists, community leaders and experts have long reported that family time can contribute to less depression, less anxiety, better academic performance and generally happier kids. But what if that family time is on media??\nAs the AAP reviews our screen time recommendations, I feel that we, as pediatricians should continue to advise parents about basic principles.\nParents need to lay down some parameters about when and how media is used. Media is a centerpiece of teens’ lives and is not going away, but just as we don’t give our kids a set of keys to our car and say “just drive”, we need to enforce appropriate media use. And good modeling is also critical: parents need to put down their mobile devices and simply communicate with their kids. Old fashioned parenting and just talking to your kids can build the foundation to a less stressful childhood and hopefully a happier life."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:67b555ec-b2f3-4bc0-ab80-92800d5fca05>","<urn:uuid:9ee5a44c-ac0e-4471-bc2a-f3b31e423c46>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the sustainable innovations implemented in DHA City Karachi, and what global urban challenges does this development address in the context of modern cities?","answer":"DHA City Karachi implements numerous sustainable innovations including solar water heaters, wind turbines, double-glazed windows, and strategic building orientation to reduce energy consumption. The city preserves natural topography and streams for drainage, uses recycled construction materials, and features a comprehensive security system. These innovations address several critical challenges facing modern cities globally, including excessive fossil fuel dependency, rising CO2 emissions, and poor urban planning. The project demonstrates how developing nations can implement sustainable practices despite limited resources, offering solutions to issues like energy consumption, water management, and urban sprawl that plague rapidly growing cities worldwide.","context":["Estimated reading time: 14 min\nAs the impact of climate change on communities around the world becomes more apparent, sustainability is fast taking centre stage in the design process. But while sustainable technologies are now almost a mandatory feature of project design in developed nations, developing nations have been largely left to their own devices.\nAs the global economic dynamic shifts, however, sustainable initiatives are beginning to take form in some of the world’s rapidly developing nations. Based just outside Pakistan’s most populous metropolitan city, DHA City Karachi (DCK) is fast becoming a marked example of the positive impact sustainable initiatives can have on a country. Commissioned by the Pakistan Defense Housing Authority (DHA), DCK promises to provide a benchmark for future sustainable design in Pakistan and future cities across the developing world.\nPakistan as a developing nation\nWe talked to Atif Osmani, CEO of RMJM Osmani, and a consultant in the design and construction of Pakistan’s first ever sustainable city. “We knew we had to do something extraordinary,” says Atif, referring to the daunting task of creating a city for 600, 000 people without the “petrodollars” of projects like Masdar City in the UAE. The pressure to deliver “something extraordinary” is understandable. Pakistan is ranked by the 2015 Economic Freedom Index as 121st out of 178, dropping to 146th out of 177 in the UN Human Development Index. Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Pakistan as 93rd in 111 countries for quality of life.\nDespite this, the situation in Pakistan is improving, with real GDP expected to grow by about 4.5 percent in the next year, assisted by lower oil prices, planned improvements in the supply of energy, and investment related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Initiatives like DCK could further elevate Pakistan’s economic standing, harnessing the power of the natural world to ensure a higher standard of living at a lower cost to the people of Pakistan. As Atif explains, that’s exactly what DCK is about – taking advantage of what’s available and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.\nA historic partnership\nDCK represents one of the biggest projects undertaken in Pakistan since its formation in 1947, similar in physical scale to the design and construction of the capital Islamabad in the early ‘60s. RMJM was heavily involved in the masterplanning of Islamabad, now regarded as the most developed city in Pakistan and ranked as a Gamma+ world city. The project brought together RMJM, Osmani and the father of Ekistics Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis for the first time. DCK follows a similar lead, utilising the technological capabilities of RMJM with the local engineering knowledge of Osmani & Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. and the Ekistics theory of Doxiadis to develop the ‘cities within a city’ network. The project brought together leading minds in the sustainable technology community. Spiro Pollalis, Professor of Design, Technology and Management at the Harvard Design School, played a fundamental role in the development of a set of sustainable by-laws by which the entire construction team had to abide.\nAtif argues that as a collection of ‘cities within a city’, the layout of DCK allowed for some highly original urban design. “We tried to design an enabling environment based on spatial proximity” he states, adding, “this approach will reduce the carbon load and allow everyone to appreciate their surroundings.” Each community provides integrated facilities in an attempt to ensure no citizen of DCK has to walk more than twenty minutes to reach vital amenities. The masterplan, developed by RMJM Osmani in conjunction with the Harvard Design School and Doxiadis Associates, has been intricately considered. Spread across 20,000 acres, the city is sectioned into two parcels of land, with DCK South covering around 12,000 acres and the northern half making up the other 8,000. Between 10-12 communities have been planned in total, each one representing a different sector of society. Healthcare, business and cultural districts provide essential services while holistic integrated planning provides a network of infrastructure systems to ensure every area of the city remains completely functional at all times.\nFrom the ground up\nAs the first city in Pakistan planned, designed and constructed on the principals of urban sustainability, DCK may be a daunting challenge, but it’s also the best method for introducing sustainable technology on a large scale. “In city planning, there is an added advantage in a jump start; we can introduce sustainability wherever possible” states Atif, adding “there are fewer options to apply such innovations in cities like London or New York.” Established cities can still integrate sustainable design into new developments, but DCK offers a unique opportunity to integrate viable energy-saving technology from on a mass urban scale.\nThe project has made a notable impact on development in Pakistan. A detailed brochure of the cities features has been made available through the DHA website, prompting several other firms throughout South Asia to adopt some of the techniques. “It’s a problem for us because we do a lot of hard work and we don’t have much in the way of copyright here” admits Atif, although he allows that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “If by virtue of publishing it makes people start thinking about sustainability, then that’s a good thing.”\nCoordinating the impossible\nWhile DCK has ignited a dialogue in Pakistan around the potential of sustainable design, it still faced significant hurdles in the design process, not least the mammoth task of coordinating a huge multi-disciplinary team. “We believe in coordination and teamwork not only between the design and supervision team but also with contractors and clients,” says Atif. “We ensured dedicated management staff liaised on a timely basis and were present at the site to solve the issues then and there.” RMJM-Osmani ensured supervisory staff maintained the quality of materials and structures but also educated the site and design staff to keep every aspect of the design consistent with the overall vision. Maintaining a coherent design vernacular was perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing the design team. With every new team called in to complete a facet of the design process, the risk of losing sight of the design vision increases. On a project of this scale, just as in any project, regular communication is absolutely vital to maintaining a consistent design vision.\nA comparison of the urban layout of central New York to DCK\nRMJM Osmani responded to the issue of coordination with regular meetings and a consummate design focus, but other issues were less simple to resolve. The most pressing of these was the need for official accreditation for their sustainability. The US-based Green Building Council represents the gold standard in sustainable design. But whereas LEED predominantly focuses on the US states, DCK was designed for Pakistan with less financial leeway. The best option for the new city was to seek a rating system capable of taking the economic surroundings into account. “We asked the client if they were aware of this Envision® rating system. It’s a sustainable rating system also devised in the USA, specifically for infrastructure. LEED can work for infrastructure, but we felt it was a more comprehensive system using Envision®” contends Atif. The system uses a set of guidelines to optimise the sustainability of an infrastructure project during the planning and preliminary design phases, as well as to quantify the relative sustainability of the project. DCK is already Envision® rated and ISI (Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure) certified. With this certification came a greater level of confidence, both for stakeholders and future inhabitants.\nThe five key performance criteria of the ISI Envision rating system; Quality of life, leadership, resource allocation, the natural world and climate & risk\nSecurity represented a major consideration to DCK’s development process. Despite a burgeoning middle class and improvements in domestic security, Pakistan still faces a range of domestic and international security threats. As DCK is a city constructed for army personnel and their families, security remained an integral aspect of the design process throughout. “We adopted two approaches to maintaining consistent security; soft security through ICT and hard security through physical design” Atif explains, adding “We further controlled security through traffic circulation by avoiding crosses and unnecessary entries into residential streets. We designed controlled gated communities with emergency exits at each sub-sector level, which means any entry into the residential area can be monitored.” Physical security measures have been extensive, but the intricate digital security network also goes a long way to providing peace of mind to DCK’s citizens. Residents are provided with optimal communication devices to provide real-time information to security services and service operators, meaning any issue, be it security or otherwise, can be addressed quickly and efficiently.\nA diagram of some of the security measures put in place in and around DCK\nThis level of design-led innovation has influenced every aspect of DCK’s design. Challenges were transformed into opportunities with the aid of some truly out-of-the-box thinking. The city’s location presented a major problem to bringing in residents; located 54km away from the DHA’s original town just outside Karachi. DCK’s isolated location was further exacerbated by the limited access provided by the two-lane Malir expressway. The team’s response, Atif says, was to propose a ‘river motorway’ capable of easing congestion and reducing travel time between cities. “As a result, this motorway will connect Karachi to Lahore. We linked the Malir expressway so that it will take only 25 minutes from the old DHA to the new DHA Karachi City. This will change the whole dynamic of the city” beams Atif. This solution had the added advantage of reducing congestion in Karachi by diverting it up the motorway, further improving the quality of life for the people of Pakistan.\nA sitemap showing the proposed Malir River Expressway and it’s proximity to DHA City Karachi\nWorking with Nature\nIn the same vein, DCK turned the potential environmental disadvantages in its favour through intelligent design. In a country where access to electricity and clean running water can be sporadic, employing techniques to harness natural resources can provide a level of comfort still lacking in other areas of Pakistan. The design preserved the site’s topography by building around the ‘critical ridges’ of the surrounding foothills, channeling wind into distinctive corridors. Likewise, existing streams were preserved for natural drainage, running down into one of two natural lakes maintained for rainwater storage purposes.\nAtif describes some of the other innovations incorporated into the DCK design. “We found 50% of the gas bill was for heating water, and 50% was cooking food and things. So we made all the buildings have solar heaters to heat the cold water.” The innovations included as many renewable energy generation techniques as possible. The city’s proximity to a wind corridor and regular sun exposure prompted the installation of wind turbines and solar plaques. DCK isn’t the first city to avail itself of its natural surroundings, but rarely if ever before have natural resources been engaged on such an ambitious scale.\nA triptych of the various terrains in DHA City, including a shot of one of the city’s main lakes\nIt’s not just about harnessing the resources of the surrounding environment. Preparing developments to withstand weathering reduces wear, ensuring a longer life while reducing the energy used to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. “We designed in a way that means the wind will flow between the houses and made it mandatory to use double glazed windows, so the heat will not leave the house” Atif explains. Even the positioning of the house can affect the energy output “South and west are the two elevations where we face problems in the summer, so we made it mandatory to use insulation on these sites.” These innovations aren’t cheap Atif admits, but DHA understands they will save money and energy in time. “We are trying to project sustainability as an achievable aim for clients in developing nations. Part of that involves explaining to the client that including double glazing and solar panels will cost more, but it will save a lot of money in the long run.”\nSustainability on a budget\nThe city has set a benchmark for future projects in Pakistan, but it has also proven the implementation of sustainable technology doesn’t have to come with the price tag associated with other large-scale sustainable projects. “It’s proven that in the environment of Pakistan, just like other developing countries, a city level development can be built on similar sustainability principles” argues Atif, keen to push the idea of dreaming big whilst always keeping your budget in mind.\nRMJM Osmani was determined to implement sustainable practice at every stage of the design process. Such is the team’s commitment to maintaining sustainable standards, waste material was converted into the design. Atif clarifies: “We found a lot of stone when excavating the site. Once you remove the stone and build up the site you can’t use them again. So we took the stone out, turned them into tiles and are now using them in the design.” It’s this economic outlook that most characterises DCK. By collecting and reusing ‘waste material’, the team reduce spending and CO2 emissions on transporting the stone to a landfill, mining and producing other stone for the site and transporting it back to DCK.\nIncentives and Attractions\nThe challenges of building the first sustainable city in Pakistan go deeper than just obtaining and utilising sustainable technology, it also requires a fundamental understanding of the factors that would draw people to live and work there. DCK caters to a range of institutions, including business and trade facilities, community-based amenities, world-class healthcare, education, highly regarded recreation facilities and well-planned energy and municipal services. However, in order to convince Pakistani citizens of the merits of DCK, the team knew they had to offer a sustainable basis for employment and regular tourism too.\nBefore embarking on DCK, a team of engineers, architects, masterplanners and designers embarked on a research mission to inform their ‘model city’ concept. “We saw universities were popular, as were theme parks,” says Atif. Justifying the inclusion of medical teaching facilities in DCK, Atif remarks; “In Karachi, we saw people will come from far away if it’s a good college. Also, if it’s a respected medical institution, people will travel.” For the city to stand as a benchmark for future developments in Pakistan, it had to maintain a cultural and practical use for years to come.\n“We asked DHA to make institutions cheaper to attract universities” Atif continues. By ensuring access to quality educational and medical facilities, Atif and his team also dramatically increased the allure for the politicians, thinkers and trendsetters of the future. So far, three universities are already signed up to develop campuses within the city. Features like this, including the large theme park situated in the ‘Gateway District’, fulfil both an economic and cultural need, improving the quality of life while ensuring a regular inflow of paying visitors, further bolstering Pakistan’s domestic economy.\nA detailed breakdown of the different land-use for each sector. The light blue sections denote centres of education\nPlans for the world’s first completely sustainable mosque are already underway in DCK while the progressive outlook of the international team of designers is apparent in other design features. As one of the first cities in Pakistan to provide city-wide handicapped access, DCK is also pioneering disability rights. “We made sure to always provide handicapped accessibility” Atif explains, adding “We couldn’t achieve the American standard perhaps, but we realised if we provide ramps and wide enough corridors, we can make people aware that we should be doing something to cater to everyone.”\nThis mentality represents a driving factor behind the overall design of DHA City Karachi – the need to create a more inclusive world, where sustainability isn’t the sole preserve of the wealthiest nations, and improvisation can be the seed from which the next standard grows. DHA may not have the same access to funds as cities in the UAE, the UK or the US, but it is founded on the same principles of developing the framework for future living today. DCK can also act as an inspiration to other developing nations looking to create their own sustainable havens. Sustainable design in Pakistan may still be a fresh concept, but it is also vital to take advantage of the limited infrastructure of developing nations now. Sustainable developments like DHA Karachi City don’t need to be stocked with all the latest gadgets to be a modern marvel of engineering; vision, drive and cultural awareness can go a long way to creating “something extraordinary”.","(Journal of Urban Culture Research – Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand )\nThe rapid urbanization of the world’s population over the twentieth century is described in the 2005 Revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects report. The global proportion of urban population rose dramatically from 13% (220 million) in 1900, to 29% (732 million) in 1950, to 49% (3.2 billion) in 2005. The same report projected that the figure is likely to rise to 60% (4.9 billion) by 2030. [Wikipedia]\nUrbanization, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin-America has created mega-cities out of small settlements in less than a century. The process has been, and is chaotic and the result as well. In earlier societies the city was a quite well defined entity. The city was often enclosed by a wall. The people inside the walls were the true citizens with their rights and their duties. Today a shanty town may spring up in weeks or months with thousands or even tens of thousands inhabitants and almost no formal structures. There is no certain definition of the city, and even lists of the most popolous cities of the world are very ambigous for that very reason. A city of fifteen million registered inhabitants may have twenty million during work hours because so many from surrounding areas commute into the city. These migrations very so much that any census is incertain.\nThe city sprawl has also made it hard to define the limits of the city, where does it end and where does the countryside take over? Is New York a city or is it just a part of a super Megalopolis of fifty million people stretching from Boston to Washington DC. Greater Mexico city is a huge conurbation of more than 40 municipalities in the Valle de México. Jakarta was once before colonialism a small trading port. When the Dutch took over they founded the European style town of Batavia in 1619. Today Greater Jakarta has swollowed the nabouring cities such as Bogor into a metropolitan area, called Jabotabek, of almost 30 million people. And then you have the enormous conurbation of Tokyo-Yokohama where you can travel for hours and still be inside the city area.\nIn China the biggest migration in human history is taking place. Over the next few decades some 300 million people, that is approximately one USA, are moving into cities. Hundreds of new cities will be bulit to accomodate them.\nThe megacities are a 20th century invention made possible by the car and cheap petrol. But cheap energy is no longer an option and the city of the 21st century is challenged in a large number of ways. Let’s have a look at the greater picture.\n85 % of world energy consumption are fossil fuels, 37% oil, 25% coal and 23% gas. Fossil fuels have been the energy pushing and pulling the industrial revolution and so also the energy behind urbanization. Now it seems that oil has peaked. World oil production is not increasing any more, new oil fields are few and harder to exploit. In spite of a deep economic recession oil prices have been in the $ 100-120 per barrel bracket. With so high prices one would think that production would increase a lot, but instead it has levelled off. Lately prices have been falling, but that solves nothing, because it means that the marginal oil fields become even less attractive and that the push for alternatives to oil also becomes weaker.\nPeak oil will have a profound and long lasting influence on world cities. Oil does not only go into commuting and transport. Electricity which is so crucial to the city is most places produced by burning oil, gas or coal. Concrete from which the cities are build in highly dependent on fossil fuels. The whole building industry is an oil guzzling industry never to be satisfied without it. And of course to feed and give water to the citizens oil is everywhere. Modern agriculture depends on oil in plowing, sowing, watering, reaping, producing, storing and distributing farm produce. The pesticides and chemical fertilizers that made the green revolution possible and by that the feeding of seven billion people, is based on fossil fuels. 17% av the world’s oil consumption is linked to food production. Fertilizers alone consume 5%. Modern man is a walking SUV. In fifty years agricultural oil consumption has trippled. Taking oil out of agriculture is like takin the central pole out of a tent.\nRunning a car takes oil. And if you prefer an electric car, consider how your city’s electricity is produced and how the car itself is produced. You will find oil og even coal behind the most environmental electric car. To produce one takes about 20 barrels of oil.\nHeating and cooling of appartments and houses consume a lot of energy, and since most electricity id produced by burning fossil fules, it is another carbon agenda.\nWhat about the computers that run your city, or the one on your desk or lap top? No oil in them, to be sure. But to produce one they use at least ten times its weight in fossil fuels. To produce one 32MB microchip they use 1,7 litres of oil. And when you get rid of it it turns into so much hazardous waste. China is the fastest growing economy in the world, but it is also the fastes growing land fill of hazarduos garbage.\nAnd what about our wonderful global internet? It helps us find information from the other side of the globe without moving from our desk or café table. Sure that must be eco-friendly. May be, but running the web consumes about 10% of all energy that is used in the US and close to 6% globally. For most of the people in the world that means oil and coal, and now and then nuclear power.\nProducing sement consumes oil in quantity, 1000 kilos equals 1,13 barrels of oil. China alone consumes 1,7 billion tons of cement and counting. India is following suit. Paving of roads with asphalt takes at lot of oil, of course.\nThe sururbs were unthinkable without cheap energy, read oil. With the increase in Chinese growth alone, the world will not have enough energy long before 2030. Our entire city model is heading directly for a fundamental crisis.\nSyntetic fibres that are used in textile industries is nothing but oil. Plastics are oil. Toys, bottles, machine parts, sports’ equipment, building materials: oil, oil, oil.\n95% of globale trade is based on oil. Globalization equals oil.\nWith peak oil we enter into very uncertain terrain and continued urbanization becomes very dubious indeed.\nBut the trouble doesn’t stop there.\nClimate and global warming\nThe modern city is a CO2-producing unit. Forests can be carbon sinks, but cities not. But the atmosphere already has too much CO2 for future good. Soon we will pass the 400 ppm limit, and that is at least 50 ppm too much. Even if we could stop immediately to emit more CO2 an increase in global temperature by 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial level is a given. But with the present speed in emissions 450 ppm is more likely, and then we might blow the 4 degree level and that is the entry into a very unpleasant planet.\nWeather will be warmer, wetter and wilder. There will be more violent storms, more flooding of low-laying areas so typical for most big cities in the world and more deluvial rainfalls.\nThe modern city is contributing strongly to global warming and the climatic disastres, and it is also a local hot spot itself. City temperatures typically differ from the surroundings by being five centigrades higher. The city is a deposit for store solar heat and the city activity produces a lot of heat by itself.\nSo it is to be expected that the cities are vulnerable to climate change, and particularly the megacities in Asia, Africa and Latin-America.\nFood and fertile top soil\nThe modern city is highly dependent of food production that typically tales place outside of the city itself. The city is a parasite. Without the fertile land outside of the city the inhabitants would die. But in spite of that the city destroys arable land as it grows. The level fiends of agriculture is so much more convenient building land than the barren hills, and the market price for building ground is so much higher than farm land. The end result is that that precious fertile soil that has taken numerous generations to create is destroyed to make way for the city. There is no romanticism from me underlining this, it is a fact. The city destoys the land that it feeds upon. In the long run this is of course lethal.\nWater and sewage\nHanoi has seen its population swell to almost 7 million over the past few years, yet there is not a single sewage treatment plant in the entire city. Wastewater from toilets and showers ultimately ends up in the region’s rivers, from where it makes its way, dirty as dirty can be, into the ground water. http://futurenow.dw-world.de/english/category/environment/megacities/\nResidents in Mexico city get most of their drinking water from aquifers under the city. But because of waste and poor water treatment that water is contaminated with cadmium, chome and other metaøs that are hazardous for humans. Over-exploitation of aquifers has contributed to the continued subsidence within the city (5-40cm per year), increasing the chance of catastrophic flooding.\nIn the port city of Karachi in southern Pakistan, around 30,000 people die due to the effects of contaminated drinking water, while in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), there are both traces of faeces in drinking water and high concentrations of arsenic in ground water.\nIn the rivers of Buenos Aires there are high levels of dumped toxins making the Argentine river Matanza-Riachuelo «one of the world’s most polluted waterways». And millions of people in the city lack safe access to drinking water and are not connected to sewer systems.\nIn Kenya, the capital city lacks capacity to manage the increasing demand for water. And 60 percent of Nairobi’s inhabitants live in informal settlements with inadequate access to quality water and are forced to buy their water at kiosks at a higher price.\nMost of the megacities lie on the estuaries of big rivers. Their sewage, their excessive nitrogen and phosphate over load go into the nearby sea and add to the dead zones in the worlds oceans. This in its turn destroy the feeding ground for fish and other sea organisms, and then of course threaten the food chain of the city dwellers.\nScientists have measured higher acidity in the oceans and a shocking level of planton death over the last few decades. Most of it may be linked with CO2 being dissolved in the ocean water creating carbonic acid which is highly detrimental to all life in the oceans.\nIn the mid Pacific there is a sludge of plastic particles creating the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. As it disintegrates, the plastic ultimately becomes small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean’s surface. Thus, plastic waste enters the food chain. Estimates of the size of the Patch vary widely, but there is no doubt that i represents a huge problem.\nThese ecological problems and the problem with getting sufficient energy are some of the biggest challenges to the future of the cities. The Henry Ford paradigm, that is the car and petrol city, is outdated. But that was the paradigm that fed the city growth, and so far there is no other paradigm in sight that can turn the table and make way for the sustainable city of the future.\nBut there is a lot of research going on in this field, and this is obviously the way to go to turn the city from a parasite and a problem into a contribution to a sustainable society.\nThere is no energy source in the pipe line of the foreseeable future that can match the versatility and energy rihness of oil. The consumption and ultimate depletion of the oil resources is a once in a life time opportunity for a planet. Alternative energies like wind, tide and solar panels contribute but a tiny bit to world energy. And their production and maintenance takes a huge amount of oil. Nuclear doesn’t seem such a bright option after Fukushima and fusion energy remains a mirage very far from the practical world.\nSo the big picture is that we have to use less energy, per person and in sum total.\n- The walkable city. Before cheap oil cities were built for slow and local transport. Commuting over long distances was not an option. We will soon be back there again. Cities must be built or restructured so that people can reach most of their daily activities, including work and play using their own muscles, that is by walking or biking. That means that work places and services must be within a short walk from home.\n- City cells. To be walkable, all basic needs must be within walking distance. That means that the city must become a multi-node, multi-cellular city. A city of towns. Some needs that are not daily necessities could be found farther away, like an over-laying grid.\n- Quality of life. The city nodes must have a sufficiently rich cultural life to satisfy a wide range og needs. Cultural consumption is normally less energy an material demanding and also gives life and attrativeness to the city environment. Here I think not only of culture for the people, but also of culture by the people. The city must give ample room for the creative activities of the citizens.\n- Self sufficiency. The city must become self sufficient and self sustaining to a very large degree. Buildings must produce as much energy as they consume. A certain amount of food production must take place in the city. Sewage must be treated so that phosphates and nitrogen is contained and circulated back to farming.\n- Durability. The modern tendency of use-and-throw is creating waste mountains that threaten to strangle the big cities. Durability and reusability are the new modern. Energy, water and other material resources are stretched thin today. There is small room for growth. So economic use of resources will be crucial.\n- Urban qualities in the countryside. To contain a too great influx of new millions into the megacities, it is crucial to give the countryside some urban qualities. Those qualities that go for the city cells should also be developed in smaller rural centres, when it comes to jobs, housing, culture, recreation etc.\nThe economic and ecological crises in the world today mean that there is no time to wait for change. The problems are only getting bigger and more difficult to solve as we wait. There will not be any one-size-fits-all solution. What we will be looking for is a complex and multifaceted web of solution, local, regional, national and global. A huge number of people all around the globe are thinking about and working for this. They need resources and sufficient leverage to make results. Also some governments have seen some of the drama in the present situation. China, which has some of the gravest environmental problems, not least in its everexpanding cities, has declared its new five year plan «The green leap forward». The chinese have also made plans to develop eco-cities. So far most of these plans remain on the drawing board and the real results are few. One of the problems is that so far these ideas have been top-down techocratic ideas. To succeed I believe such projects must belong to the people, to the grass-roots. People must be deeply involved and have a realistic feeling of ownership to the project. So empowerment, mobilization, real democracy are essential. That is not to say that planners, specialist and scientists do not belong. Their expertise is crucial, but it must be matched with a consientious popular movement for groundbraking change. From the Tahrir plaza to Madison Wisconsin, from the streets of London to Wall Street people demand power over their own future. The mismanaging of the earth by the rich elites have gone all too far.\nAm I naive, is this an utopian vision? I don’t think so. The most unrealistic plan of all today is business as usual. It it business as usual that drives us to destruction.

{"question":"How does physical expansion affect our observation of the early universe, and what role does exercise play in protecting our brain as we age?","answer":"Physical expansion affects our observation of the early universe through inflation, where the universe expanded incredibly fast shortly after the Big Bang, setting up objects billions of light years away from us. This means that as our 'circle of vision' grows, we continue to see new things, though some distant light may never reach us due to ongoing expansion. As for brain protection, aerobic exercise has shown significant benefits for aging brains. In adults aged 60-88, regular walking strengthens brain connectivity in regions linked to memory, while in older women with dementia symptoms, vigorous exercise was associated with increased hippocampus size. The best protection appears to come from combining aerobic workouts with resistance training.","context":["How is it possible that the light emitted billions of years ago is still reaching us today? How can objects be 13 billion years away by some few hundred thousand years after the big bang?\nTo answer this let us construct an analogy to the universe.\nTo begin, consider a sheet of paper, one that we can stretch and compress (i.e. one that can grow and shrink). Let us also draw a grid on the paper (so that it is a sheet of stretchable graph paper).\nNow let's imagine this sheet represents the Universe today, and so let's draw some galaxies on the sheet. Their coordinates can be given by their location on the grid, or we could use a ruler to specify distances to them. (The coordinates on the grid will be the so called comoving coordinates, since the grid will expand with the paper, while the ruler will give physical distances since the ruler won't expand).\nNow since the universe is expanding, we should be stretching the sheet of paper as time moves forward. When we speak of an expanding universe this is exactly what we mean, the very space-time on which our universe is \"drawn\" is stretching, dragging each \"drawing\" with it. We would see that while galaxies remain at their locations on the grid, they do seem to get further apart since the grid itself is becoming larger (each cell of our stretchable graph paper would expand). This is to say comoving coordinates are fixed but physical separations change.\nSo lets us now instead run time backwards and compress the paper. Each cell shrinks and things appear to move closer and closer. If we do this for a while the paper shrinks to a point. Even though we know there is a grid on it that we can use to identify each point on the paper, it looks like the grid has become a point too (from our vantage point outside the paper) and each grid point is overlapping with the others. Thus, our space-time has become singular. Notice that each point on the grid has the big bang occurring there so to speak as all points are singular at this time. Note also we could have done this for an infinite sheet of paper, that is started with an infinite one with a nice well defined grid and then let it contract until all points on the grid were once again overlapping and thus we had an infinite singularity. We believe the universe to be infinite today, which means it was infinite in its formation so this infinite singularity is the picture to have in mind for the Big Bang. So now that we have the big bang setup, we can run time forward to address the question.\nLet us assume we can place a clock at each point on the grid, and of course set them all going from time=0 at the instant of the big bang. Run time forward a bit so that the sheet can expand to some non-singular state, and then let's pause expansion to look at some simple things.\nConsider an ant walking on the page to be a photon (a piece of light). Suppose that we choose a drawing on the paper to represent us, and suppose then that each other drawing has an ant that starts walking towards us at time =0. Suppose further that each ant can move 10 cm per second. If the sheet doesn't expand an ant 10 cm away reaches us in 1 second, an ant 20 cm away arrives after two seconds etc. Thus, only after three seconds do we know about a galaxy 30 cm away, as the first light (the ant) from that galaxy takes that long to reach us. The ant that arrives at this time tells us about how the galaxy it started from looked when it set out (i.e. 3 seconds ago). Note that in spite of the ant coming at t=3 to tell us about the galaxy at t=0, the galaxy it started from is actually also sitting at t=3 since all the clocks are ticking. Thus, all parts of the Universe are the same age, however we see things farther out as younger since the ants are more and more delayed in reaching us to tell us about them. Thus, we can see things at various ages simply due to the fact that it takes time for the ants (light) to reach us.\nBut then if this is the case, and the universe is small early on, that is nearly singular, how can we see light coming from billions of light years away?\nThe answer to this lies in understanding the first \"trick\" of the universe. Very shortly after the big bang the sheet grows incredibly fast (this rapid is expansion is what we call inflation). In a matter of a fraction of a second the Universe expands to a size comparable to its size today. So from this small point like clump of paper, we get a full sheet of paper almost immediately. Now as an organism living on the paper, we would see things in a circle around us, and the size of the circle would be determined by the maximum distance from which light will have reached us, as discussed in terms of ants above. The size of this circle is c*t where c is the speed of light and t is the time since the big bang. Initially at the big bang the circle is size zero, at the time just before inflation the circle has some small but non zero size. Now because inflation expands space so rapidly, grid points that were in the circle just before inflation move outside the circle after, i.e. the circle only grows at a rate c*t, but the expansion makes the space between objects grow much faster. So some things we could see before inflation get pushed past the circle of sight.\nIn terms of ants, recall the ant coming from 30 cm away? Let's now do inflation so that we expand the sheet to 10 times the size in no time at all, then the 30 cm away galaxy is now 300 cm away, so that an ant emitted just after inflation will be 30 seconds away, and so not lie in our present 30 cm (3 second) radius circle of vision. (Note in reality there are no galaxies or even stars around at the time of inflation, but let's pretend for the sake of our ant discussion that there are. Also note that really since light is continuously emitted the light from this galaxy would keep coming for a while seeming, like it is frozen in a 3 second old state, until the after inflation light can reach us normally).\nThen after inflation ends, the circle continues to grow and eventually might recapture some things (I say might because there is still a slower expansion that occurs, which, for sufficiently distant objects results in an overall rapid recession from us). Each time an object enters our circle of vision for the first time we see its earliest light, and so the object looks young, even though the object itself is in actuality the same age as our region of space.\nThe point of discussing inflation is mainly the fact that it sets up objects at vast distances from us, so that as our circle of vision grows we continue to add new things. Indeed, during inflation the expansion is so rapid that things would seem to move away faster than the speed of light, but this is allowed since there is no real motion of the objects through space time, i.e. our drawings don't move at all on the sheet but end up at greater and greater distances simply because we are inserting more space into the space-time between drawings. Thus, we can almost instantly set up objects billions of light years from us.\nThere is another point to mention here, if the Universe is finite, then ultimately at some point our circle of light will stop adding new things, i.e. once it encompasses the whole of the Universe. However, it is held that the universe is likely infinite, so that as time goes on we will continue to see farther and farther. In either case however, expansion can intervene and make it so we don't actually see any new things, since once we see out to a certain distance there will be no light that reaches us, as it is constantly dragged back by expansion.\nThat is consider now a post inflation universe where ants (light) move at 10 cm per second and space expands at a rate of 1 cm per second for every 10 cm of space that exists (that is space expands 10% per second). For simplicity, let's further suppose that in each second first light moves then we apply expansion. That is, let's consider a galaxy 20 cm away emitting an ant. In the first second the ant travels 10 cm and so is now 10 cm away from us, that 10 cm then expands 1 cm so the ant is 11 cm away at the end of 1 second. In the next second the ant travels 10 cm again, and then the 1 cm left expands by ten percent again and so the ant is 1.1 cm away after 2 seconds. Some time in the next second then it will arrive. Thus, with expansion ants arrive later than expected as the distance they must travel also expands. Now, the statement about not seeing new things should be clear, we can imagine being 110 cm away to start. An ant from this distance will travel 10 cm in a second then be 100 cm away but that 100 cm will expand by 10 cm so that at the end of the second the ant is again 110cm away, it makes no progress towards us!\nSo the key ideas:\nThe Big Bang occurs at all points in space, so relics associated with it like the Cosmic Microwave Background are emitted from all points in space and can be seen in all directions.\nThe Universe is thought to be infinite, so as time goes on we can see farther and farther away, and thanks to its infinite size and inflation, there are already objects at all distances in the universe for us to see there. These objects long ago emitted light that reflects their earliest state and since they are great distances away (and the journey is lengthened by expansion), that light reaches us only today.\nThings that start emitting light from too far away won't ever be seen as expansion prevents photons from ever reaching us.\nThis page was last updated June 27, 2015.","Want an all-natural way to lift your mood, improve your memory, and protect your brain against age-related cognitive decline?\nThe Benefits of Exercise, Especially Aerobic Workouts\nA wealth of recent research, including a new study published this month, suggests that any type of exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you moving and sweating for a sustained period of time is good for you. This type of exercise, known as aerobic exercise, has a significant and beneficial impact on the brain.\n“Aerobic exercise is the key for your head, just as it is for your heart,” said an article in the Harvard Medical School blog “Mind and Mood. Most research suggests that the best type of aerobic exercise for your mind is anything you can do regularly and consistently for 30-45 minutes at a time. Yet, the latest study suggests that anykind of workout is the best workout. Whether it’s a 5 minute or 45 minute session, exercise can have beneficial impacts on mental health.\nExercise Positively Affects Depression\nThe new study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, is the largest long-term study of its kind to look at the link between exercise and mental health, with a special focus on depression.\nThe researchers studied close to 34,000 Norwegian adults over 11 years. Respondents reported how often they exercised each week, how intense it was, and how depressed or anxious they felt. The results suggested that as little as one hour of exercise each week helped shield people against depressive episodes. Notably, that exercise did not need to be aerobic. Participants who got moving without becoming breathless (perhaps with an activity like a long, moderately-paced walk) were significantly less likely to report symptoms of depression compared with those who did no exercise.\nPlenty of other research has revealed a powerful connection between mental and physical fitness across varying levels of intensity. Some benefits — like a lift in mood — can emerge as soon as a few minutes into a sweaty endeavor. Other benefits — like improved memory — might take several weeks to crop up.\nA pilot study in people with severe depression, for example, found that just 30 minutes of treadmill walking for 10 consecutive days was “sufficient to produce a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in depression.” Aerobic workouts appear to help reduce levels of the body’s natural stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, according to a recent study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science.\nProtecting Against Age-Related Brain Decline\nIn older people, the best way to protect against age-related brain decline seems to be aerobic workouts. A study published in May found that in adults aged 60-88, walking for 30 minutes four days a week for 12 weeks appeared to strengthen connectivity in a region of the brain where weakened connections have been linked with memory loss. And a study in older women who displayed symptoms of dementia found that sweaty, heart-pumping exercise was linked with an increase in the size of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory.\nSeveral studies even suggest that aerobic workouts provide the best protection against other types of cognitive decline, too. A study involving hundreds of breast cancer survivors concluded that such exercise seemed to reduce the symptoms of “chemo brain,” a commonly reported side effect of cancer treatment that involves memory loss and difficulty focusing.\n“The message for cancer patients and survivors is, get active!” Diane Ehlers, the lead author of that study and a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, said in a statement.\nThe best overall health results — mental and physical — for people over 50 appear to come from a combination of aerobic workouts and resistance training (strengthening work like weights or squats). That type of workout plan could be anything from high-intensity interval training, like the 7-minute workout, to dynamic flow yoga, which intersperses strength-building poses with heart-pumping dance-like moves.\nResearchers still aren’t sure why exercise appears to provide so many benefits to our brain and body. One factor could be increased blood flow, since aerobic work pumps fresh energy and oxygen to the brain.\nRegardless of the cause, Joe Northey, an exercise scientist at the University of Canberra, said his research suggests that anyone in good health over age 50 should do 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic exercise “on as many days of the week as feasible.”\nThat’s probably good advice for all ages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fde9090d-49f0-41d5-adff-bfce89a403c8>","<urn:uuid:6d267815-de26-423b-b983-1e2e32701b99>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the social structures and hierarchies compare between traditional societies and early copper-age communities? What changes occurred in social organization with the transition to metal use?","answer":"Traditional societies and copper-age communities show distinct differences in social organization. Traditional societies typically lived in small groups of a few dozen to a few thousand people, with relatively flat hierarchies and communal living arrangements. In contrast, during the Copper Age, as exemplified by the Erimi Culture, societies experienced significant social stratification. The introduction of copper led to the creation of social hierarchies, with wealth differences becoming evident through larger houses and high-status goods. Food storage and preparation shifted from communal to private arrangements. This transformation occurred because access to copper tools and metalworking knowledge was limited to few people, who could sell tools and weapons to farmers, creating profit and wealth inequality. While traditional societies maintained their small-scale, communal structure, copper-age communities grew larger, became fortified, and developed internal economic divisions based on metal access and trade.","context":["Why study traditional societies?\nWhy do we find “traditional” societies so fascinating? Partly, it’s because of their human interest: the fascination of getting to know people who are so similar to us and understandable in some ways, and so unlike us and hard to understand in other ways. When I arrived in New Guinea for the first time, in 1964 at the age of 26, I was struck by the exoticness of New Guineans: they look different from Americans, speak different languages, dress differently, and behave differently. But over the subsequent decades, in the course of my making dozens of visits of one to five months each to many parts of New Guinea and neighboring islands, that predominant sense of exoticness yielded to a sense of common ground as I came to know individual New Guineans: we hold long conversations, laugh at the same jokes, share interests in children and sex and food and sports, and find ourselves angry, frightened, grief- stricken, relieved, and exultant together. Even their languages are variations on familiar worldwide linguistic themes: although the first New Guinea language that I learned (Fore) is unrelated to Indo-European languages and hence has a vocabulary that was completely unfamiliar to me, Fore still conjugates verbs elaborately like German, and it has dual pronouns like Slovenian, postpositions like Finnish, and three demonstrative adverbs (“here,” “there nearby,” and “there faraway”) like Latin.\nAll those similarities misled me, after my initial sense of New Guinea’s exoticness, into thinking, “People are basically all the same everywhere.” No, I eventually came to realize, in many basic ways we are not all the same: many of my New Guinea friends count differently (by visual mapping rather than by abstract numbers), select their wives or husbands differently, treat their parents and their children differently, view danger differently, and have a different concept of friendship. This confusing mixture of similarities and differences is part of what makes traditional societies fascinating to an outsider.\nAnother reason for the interest and importance of traditional societies is that they retain features of how all of our ancestors lived for tens of thousands of years, until virtually yesterday. Traditional lifestyles are what shaped us and caused us to be what we are now. The shift from hunting-gathering to farming began only about 11,000 years ago; the first metal tools were produced only about 7,000 years ago; and the first state government and the first writing arose only around 5,400 years ago. “Modern” conditions have prevailed, even just locally, for only a tiny fraction of human history; all human societies have been traditional for far longer than any society has been modern. Today, readers of this book take for granted farm- grown and store- bought food rather than wild food hunted and gathered daily, tools of metal rather than of stone and wood and bone, state government and its associated law courts and police and armies, and reading and writing. But all of those seeming necessities are relatively new, and billions of people around the world today still live in partly traditional ways.\nEmbedded even within modern industrial societies are realms where many traditional mechanisms still operate. In many rural areas of the First World, such as the Montana valley where my wife and children and I spend our annual summer vacations, many disputes are still resolved by traditional informal mechanisms rather than by going to court. Urban gangs in large cities don’t call the police to settle their disagreements but rely on traditional methods of negotiation, compensation, intimidation, and war. European friends of mine who grew up in small European villages in the 1950s described childhoods like those in a traditional New Guinea village: everybody knew everybody else in the village, everyone knew what everyone else was doing and expressed their opinions about it, people married spouses born only a mile or two distant, people spent their entire lives in or near the village except for young men away during the world war years, and disputes within the village had to be settled in a way that restored relationships or made them tolerable, because you were going to be living near that person for the rest of your life. That is, the world of yesterday wasn’t erased and replaced by a new world of today: much of yesterday is still with us. That’s another reason for wanting to understand yesterday’s world.\nAs we shall see in this book’s chapters, traditional societies are far more diverse in many of their cultural practices than are modern industrial societies. Within that range of diversity, many cultural norms for modern state societies are far displaced from traditional norms and lie towards the extremes of that traditional range of diversity. For example, compared to any modern industrial society, some traditional societies treat elderly people much more cruelly, while others offer elderly people much more satisfying lives; modern industrial societies are closer to the former extreme than to the latter. Yet psychologists base most of their generalizations about human nature on studies of our own narrow and atypical slice of human diversity. Among the human subjects studied in a sample of papers from the top psychology journals surveyed in the year 2008, 96% were from Westernized industrial countries (North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel), 68% were from the U.S. in particular, and up to 80% were college undergraduates enrolled in psychology courses, i.e., not even typical of their own national societies. That is, as social scientists Joseph Henrich, Steven Heine, and Ara Norenzayan express it, most of our understanding of human psychology is based on subjects who may be described by the acronym WEIRD: from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic societies. Most subjects also appear to be literally weird by the standards of world cultural variation, because they prove to be outliers in many studies of cultural phenomena that have sampled world variation more broadly. Those sampled phenomena include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, punishment, biological reasoning, spatial orientation, analytic versus holistic reasoning, moral reasoning, motivation to conform, making choices, and concept of self. Hence if we wish to generalize about human nature, we need to broaden greatly our study sample from the usual WEIRD subjects (mainly American psychology undergraduates) to the whole range of traditional societies.\nReprinted by arrangement with Viking, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., from The World Until Yesterday by Jared Diamond. Copyright © 2012 by Jared Diamond.\n By the terms “traditional” and “small- scale” societies, which I shall use throughout this book, I mean past and present societies living at low population densities in small groups ranging from a few dozen to a few thousand people, subsisting by hunting- gathering or by farming or herding, and transformed to a limited degree by contact with large, Westernized, industrial societies. In reality, all such traditional societies still existing today have been at least partly modified by contact, and could alternatively be described as “transitional” rather than “traditional” societies, but they often still retain many features and social processes of the small societies of the past. I contrast traditional small- scale societies with “Westernized” societies, by which I mean the large modern industrial societies run by state governments, familiar to readers of this book as the societies in which most of my readers now live. They are termed “Westernized” because important features of those societies (such as the Industrial Revolution and public health) arose first in Western Europe in the 1700s and 1800s, and spread from there overseas to many other countries.","Since man first found he could sharpen a stick to defend himself, we’ve realized the importance of good quality tools in making our life easier and more bountiful. In our search for better and better tools and weapons, wood gave way to rocks tied to sticks, that were in turn replaced by chiseled pieces glued and fastened to hardy handles. Whole communities came to rely on those that could turn their hand to working stone, to people such as Otzi.\nOtzi was the finest stone-shaper in the village; the tools he produced bit deep into soil, fell trees and boars alike with ease, and chased away many a pillaging group. They were the zenith of the day’s technology, underpinning every field of human activity, from agriculture, to crafts, to battle. And today, grasping an axe that he himself chiseled, standing next to his fellow villagers, facing strange people from stranger lands, Otzi was prepared to defend his home once again. But as battle raged and stone splintered on the invader’s weird, reddish weapons and armor, realization crept over the defenders; stone was no longer king. The age of copper had begun.\nThe red stone that won’t break\nCopper is widely believed to be the second metal (after gold) that humans learned to shape and utilize. It was more easily encountered and obtained than other metals as it forms native element bodies throughout the crust, and archaeological consensus place its discovery at 9000 BC somewhere in the Middle East — though like agriculture, it was most likely discovered independently by several groups of people.\nA lot softer than iron, with 3.0 on the Mohs scale compared to iron’s 4.5, and very malleable, the metal could easily be beaten into shape and if done at room temperature this would create more durable edges as the metal’s crystals aligned to the mechanical stress. Being easy (compared with other metals) to mine and process but more durable, malleable and less brittle than stone, copper started replacing it as the material of choice for tools, weapons and other objects. However, as limited people had knowledge of the metal or how to work it and as it was fairly expensive, stone remained the most used material throughout the copper age.\nStill, this was little comfort to the peoples that were enslaved by more technologically advanced tribes and empires, in part due to lacking the adequate weapons to defend themselves, such as our hypothetical Otzi.\nFrom finding to extracting\nElemental copper was the first source of the metal that humans used, for obvious reasons — it’s easy to find and doesn’t need much refining. If a big enough chunk was found, all you had to do was hammer it into whatever shape you needed.\nHowever, this is limited by the size and shape of the nuggets miners were able to find, and there wasn’t any way of making sure there weren’t impurities in the metal mass, that could ruin the final object’s properties. As copper deposits were exploited over time, such pieces of metal were increasingly hard to come by, so craftsmen started melting together smaller bits of copper into bars that they would then turn into finished products.\nExperimenting with melting the metal, smiths learned that they could treat copper to have different properties, depending on what they would use it for. If you took a copper bar, heat it up and let it cool down slowly (a process known as annealing), the metal’s crystalline structure would arrange in a more homogeneous structure and the copper was much softer and easier to shape, good for jewelry or coinage.\nOn the other hand, cold-processed copper had a more arranged crystalline structure, harder than the annealed metal. Tools and weapons were shaped this way, to make them more durable and allow them to keep a better edge.\nAfter deposits were depleted of most native copper bodies, smelting was employed to extract the metal from its ores. Early smelters were very primitive, so in these early days of metallurgy, only the most worthwhile material was processed. For example, some of the first recorded smelters were employed by the Sumerians, and they were no more than shallow pits in which ore was thrown over burning charcoal.\nExactly how they reached sufficiently high temperatures in the absence of bellows is still a matter of speculation — one theory holds that the smelters were covered with clay, leaving only an opening towards the prevailing wind to feed the fire. Hieroglyphs show that the Egyptians also had this problem, but solved it using a long tube to blow air into the furnace.\nThis is another major turning point in our history that copper brought about. Smelting involves much more than just melting the metal from the rock — it’s a delicate chemical process, requiring the use of a reducing agent to scrub the metal atoms of oxidizers (most often carbon in the form of charcoal that releases carbon monoxide as it burns, then pulls oxygen atoms from the ore, forming CO2) that usually bind to them, and flux is used to purify the melt.\nSmelting was probably developed over a long period of time, with small improvements being added over time to the procedure. But without a metal useful enough to impose itself in human society, that could be found both in native and ore forms, smelting might have never been developed. And without smelting, other metals such as iron or aluminum would have never been discovered and used.\nIn the later part of the Copper age, as technology advanced, casting was employed on a wider and wider scale as a production method, especially for works of art such as statues or jewelry, for religious objects and some tools. This process required skilled craftsmen, as it is quite difficult to do with copper because of the formation of gas bubbles during the pouring of the metal and its shrinking when it cooled down.\nOk so now we have a pretty good idea of how copper was extracted and processed in the beginning, but how exactly did the discovery of metal (especially one durable and abundant enough to rival stone) impact the lives of people?\nIn a time where virtually all labor was muscle-driven, having access to a material that can make your tools bend a bit instead of breaking — but that’s ok because you can totally hammer it back up — or make your sword shatter an enemy’s weapon was like playing life with cheat codes. This is why we tend to create chronologies (Stone age, Iron age, etc.) based on how widespread the use of some such material was in a certain region.\nDuring the early stages of an age the use of the new metal was still infrequent, but became widespread during the middle stage and common in the final period, and the impact on societies should be viewed with this in mind.\nOne of the most distinctive societies of prehistoric Cyprus (the island from which the name of copper is derived) was the Erimi Culture. Mainly fishers and farmers throughout the Paleolithic, during the Copper Age the Erimi experienced a huge population increase, an explosion of arts and crafts but most importantly — the creation of social hierarchies.\nPeople loved it; they used it for everything, from nails to pans to roof tiles, statues of gods or demons or pretty young ladies (hopefully) — if they could afford it. Villages grew in size and were fortified, with large houses and high-status goods denoting differences in wealth and position. Grain storage and food preparation became private rather than communal, as it was in the earlier villages.\nWith access to better tools, farmers — most of the population — were able to produce much more food than they required to feed themselves; those that had access to copper — few in number — would sell the tools, the weapons and miscellaneous metal goods that the community required, turning a sweet profit for themselves. Trade flourished both internally and with other peoples, and as the Erimi accumulated wealth, they had more and more time and resources to spend on arts, culture and science.\nThis trend keeps around the globe — as groups discovered copper and the means to extract it, they experienced (with some exceptions) huge demographic, economic, and cultural explosions, with social layers or hierarchies being cemented during this period.\nCopper leads to bronze\nSometime in the late Chalcolithic, someone figured out that if you melt copper together with another metal such as arsenic, it becomes harder, more resilient and altogether better at everything people used copper for up to them. Exactly how this was discovered is still a matter of debate, but since copper ores are naturally contaminated with other metal, such as arsenic and tin, it’s likely it was discovered by chance during smelting.\nNo matter how the alloy came to be, it quickly started replacing copper wherever it was available, just as metal once replaced stone. Most artifacts retrieved from the Bronze age are made up of a type of copper alloy called brass, a mixture of copper and zinc, known for its bright gold-like appearance.\nAlthough it lost its monopoly on human metal industry a long time ago, copper is still one of the most valuable and sought-after metals even today. Its resistance to corrosion, thermal and electrical conductivity, ductility and malleability make it irreplaceable in a wide range of industrial sectors, from plumbing to electronics.\nIt’s so valuable to us that up to the 20th century, Sweden was known to have a “copper backed currency” — a mine in Falun, known as the Great Copper Mountain, operated from the 10th century to 1992, produced two thirds of Europe’s copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden’s wars during that time.\nBut no matter how useful it is, or how profitable it is to trade, in my opinion the real value of copper is that it thought us how to shape metal. It freed us from the constrains of wood, bone, fibers, stone and gave us the means and knowledge to produce tools and technologies powerful enough to shape the world around us.\nEnjoyed this article?

{"question":"As someone interested in tissue and organ donation, what are the key differences between tissue donation after cardiac death versus living kidney donation in terms of medical risks and preservation requirements?","answer":"Tissue donation after cardiac death and living kidney donation have significant differences. For tissue donation after cardiac death, there are no medical risks to the donor since donation occurs after death. Tissues like bone, corneas, skin, and heart valves can be preserved for months or even years since they require less blood supply than organs. In contrast, living kidney donation involves major surgical risks including pain, infection, blood loss, blood clots, allergic reactions to anesthesia, pneumonia, injury to surrounding tissue, and in rare cases death. Based on available data, 95-96% of living kidney donors have no complications. However, they may face increased long-term risks of high blood pressure, proteinuria, and reduced kidney function.","context":["Tissue Donation Term Paper\n- Length: 5 pages\n- Subject: Family and Marriage\n- Type: Term Paper\n- Paper: #43055673\nExcerpt from Term Paper :\nDonated body organs like hearts and kidneys contribute to the saving of hundreds of lives each year. The fact is that bequeathed tissues like skin, bone and heart valves could remarkably enhance the value of life for the persons receiving them. A patient who is dead following a cardiac arrest i.e. whose heartbeat has stopped permanently cannot be an organ donor but can be a tissue donor. Though in case of tissue donation the urgency of restoring a life by donation of liver or heart is absent, yet it is no way less critical to bring back vision by the help of a donated cornea, avert the severing of a leg using a bone donated by somebody or brighten the odds of survival of a patient having sustained burn injuries by skin donation.\nTransplanted tissues offer advantages like it helps in alleviating trauma, assisting individuals to see again, resume their work life and also act as a live-saving gesture. Tissue donation, particularly in situations where there are impediments, could extend the chances of near and dear ones to carry out their beloved person's desires. In several families who have lost their kindred get solace from the fact that their adored one has contributed for others in this manner. Tissue transplantation is more prevalent compared to organ transplantation. Tissues can be conveniently conserved, ice-covered and kept for use later on since they need less blood supply compared to organs. 1\n1. Norvilitis, J. M; Riley, T.M. Exploring the Motivations of Bone Marrow Typing Donors. Journal of Psychosocial Oncology, Volume: 19, 2001; p: 53.\nTissues like bone, corneas, skin, valves of the heart and veins could be preserved for months and in certain circumstances, for years. Several tissues, for example bone, could be donated throughout the life. However, majority of the tissues are bequeathed after demise, by those individuals having longed to, in their living years, to be helpful to others in this manner. In many cases they will be having an organ donor card and talked about their desires with their families. As preservation of tissues does not demand the sophisticated environment like organs need for survival, hence donation of tissues can be made even though the hearts and lungs have ceased to function.2\nGrafting of bones could offer immense benefits, rebuilding physical condition and locomotion to a lot of patients. In several medical centers, patients to be operated upon for hip replacement were inquired if they are ready to give the bones that will be removed from their bodies in any case during the course of the surgery. These bones can be utilized for bone grafts helping those patients whose bones have been removed following some ailment, pain or due to any preceding surgery. A lot of similar donations are indispensable for building sufficient stock of bones for meeting any eventualities. In case of certain vision restoring surgeries, doctors depend upon a somewhat weird donated tissue i.e. The amniotic membrane in which a baby remains engulfed within the uterus. This type of tissue is taken, with their permission, from mothers going through deliberate caesarian sections.3\n2. Norvilitis, J. M; Riley, T.M. Exploring the Motivations of Bone Marrow Typing Donors. Journal of Psychosocial Oncology, Volume: 19, 2001; p: 55.\n3. Norvilitis; Riley, p: 57.\nClose to 60 patients can benefit from just one membrane. Several types of tissues can qualify for donation after demise of persons. For implanting, bones are really essential which are utilized in surgeries with the objective of alleviating trauma and enhancing or enabling patients to walk again. Nearly, 10,000 bone transplants are made every year. Lives of patients as well as small children, tormented due to unhealthy or impaired valves, could be saved though transplanted heart valves. In the previous year, 800 heart valve transplants were performed annually. Badly charred patients could be brought back to life through donating skin.4\nThe graft of the skin assists in ameliorating trauma, and readies the tissue beneath it for subsequent aesthetic implants. It also assists in the lessening of blemishes in the case of these patients. A burn victim in a critical condition might require numerous skin donations. Severely injured knee joints sustained due to sporting activities can be cured and movement of patients normalized using tendons. Patients afflicted with acute eye disease or injury can receive cornea transplant. At times the eye's sclera is also required for transplant while performing reconstructive eye operation. In the previous year, nearly 2,500 transplants of the cornea were done. 5\n4. Chabot-Long, Lynn. A Gift of Life: A Page from the Life of a Living Organ Donor, Je-Lynn Publications, 1996, p. 33\n5. Chabot-Long, p. 33\nIndividuals prefer to be living donors, or do not prefer such donations, for diverse causes or for a combination of causes. Several families are afraid of tissue donations like skin, bone and corneas, as transplantation would deface the individual they adore and the last rites cannot be performed in an open coffin. To remove the lengthy bones of the hands and the feet, skin or corneas, admittedly, will make a person appear to look very awkward. People shall have to contemplate of their own and take a decision. No absolute correct reply is there to this issue regarding to donate or not. Also nobody can help you decide in your situations. You are the best judge given your specific situations. On the other side of the coin, a lot can be said that will assist in making certain that the choice you select is a prudent one.\nA judgment or a dilemma entails moral issues while, for example, it concerns the matter of well-being of individuals; while there might be imperatives of harmonizing the wants and benefits of various people; and while matters of utmost significance of the manner of our living are at risk, and while somebody wishes to do the correct thing. In this wisdom, the issue of living donation is moral as it entails harmonizing the wants and benefits of various individuals, primarily the prospective recipient and the prospective donor, and since it involves vital matters regarding the welfare of the people associated. In a lot of cases the yearning to donate an organ might be founded on the inclination to bring back to life or better the health of a family member having prior attachments of warmth and adoration. This might also be a great matter. 6\n6. LaTour, Stephen A; Manrai, Ajay K. Interactive Impact of Informational and Normative Influence on Donations. Journal of Marketing Research. Volume: 26; No: 3; August, 1989, p: 329.\nIn quite separate cases, an individual might desire to contribute a little to bring back to life or better the health of an anonymous individual in the society, founded on increased objective notion of assisting others or contributing to the society. For instance, this may be a gesture for those who willingly enter their names for prospective bone marrow donors or people eagerly donating blood. These donors might feel that the likely personal inconvenience or uneasiness of donating is far offset by the prospective advantages to the person awaiting the transplant. Several holy customs might favor living donations; however diverse customs might have their own viewpoint in the matter. For example, living donation might be regarded, as a chance to dedicate oneself to the cause of a fellow human being, may be an unknown person. 7 support the advocacy of tissue donation since it is based on the simple ground that it provides an opportunity to the family of a deceased one to recover other such families on the verge of such sufferings or health hazards. The magnanimity of the volunteers of tissue donations can be seen from the fact that it involves presentation of the life to the dying persons. Such presentations confer advantages to both the donor and the person receiving the donation along with the social environment in aggregate. Empirical studies reveal that about 5, 00,000 recipients in U.S. are being assisted every year with the bone and skin, cardio-vascular valves and veins. Similarly, the recipients numbering about 46,000 are able to see every year on receipt of the donated cornea. 8\n7. LaTour, Stephen A; Manrai, Ajay K.

Journal of Psychosocial Oncology, Volume: 19, 2001; p: 56.\nAll these empirical evidences are in testimony to the fact of regular occurrence of tissue donations in the clinics worldwide. Donation of tissues by Chuck, husband of Marcy Spangler, following a cardiac failure at the early age of 45 years is visualized by his wife and children as significant contributions even after his death. It was revealed that the donated cornea of Chuck assisted two people to see, his bones were used to recover 30 patients, and his valves assisted in recovering a cardio-vascular patient. Presently, acute scarcity of the…","Living donation involves anesthesia and major surgery and their associated risks.\nIn the majority of cases, the surgical removal of the donor’s kidney (called a donor nephrectomy) is done by laparoscopic surgery which involves two to three small incisions in the abdomen and one larger incision (6-9 centimeters) through which the kidney is removed. Surgery is performed under general anesthesia. In a small number of cases, a laparoscopic nephrectomy is not an option, so the surgery involves a five to seven inch incision on the side of the chest and upper abdomen.\nSurgical complications can include pain, infection, blood loss (requiring transfusions), blood clots, allergic reactions to anesthesia, pneumonia, injury to surrounding tissue or other organs, and even death.\nAfter surgery, the remaining kidney will grow slightly larger to make up for some of the function of both kidneys. Some people are born with one kidney or lose one due to injury and are able to live full lives with little or no effect. However, people with one kidney may be at a greater risk of high blood pressure, proteinuria (protein in the urine) and reduced kidney function. In very rare cases, a kidney donor may experience loss of kidney function in the years following their kidney donation. Should this occur, priority is given to a prior living donor according to national organ transplant waiting list regulations.\nPlease note that there has been no national systematic long-term data collection on the risks associated with living organ donation. Based upon limited information that is currently available, overall risks are considered to be low – 95 to 96 percent of donors have no complications.\nA study by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine that followed 80,000 living kidney donors over a 15-year period found that there was no increase in mortality rates among donors compared to healthy people with both kidneys.\nIn a 2015 paper published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, lifetime risk for the average person of ESRD was 326/10,000 (about 1 in 30), 90/10,000 (about 1 in 110) for those who donated a kidney, and 14/10,000 (about 1 in 700) for healthy non-donors. The reason kidney donors have a lower risk of ESRD compared to the general population is that kidney donors are typically healthier than the average person due to the donor screening process. When donors and healthy non-donors are compared, there is an implied ESRD risk increase of 76/10,000 from donating a kidney. The following are informative papers related to long term risks of donating a kidney: (Source: National Kidney Registry)\nJournal of the American Society of Nephrology – 2015\nReassessing Medical Risk in Living Kidney Donors\nJournal of the American Medical Association – 2014\nRisk of End-Stage Renal Disease Following Live Kidney Donation\nNew England Journal of Medicine – 2009\nLong-Term Consequences of Kidney Donation\nSome medical organizations, such as the American Academy of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Family Physicians, suggest that a person with one kidney should refrain from sports involving high contact or frequent collisions. Individuals who participate in these sports should exercise caution, be aware of possible consequences, and wear appropriate protective equipment.\nNegative psychological symptoms are also possible during the healing process and even years after the donation. Your donated organ may not function in the recipient after it is transplanted. You and/or the transplant recipient may have medical problems from the surgery. Scarring or other aspects of the donation process could possibly contribute to problems with body image. You may have feelings of regret, resentment, or anger. You may have symptoms of anxiety or depression. Treatment for these conditions can be lengthy, costly, and could possibly include the use of medications with risks and side effects.\nSome donors have reported difficulty in getting, affording, or keeping health, disability, or life insurance. It is important that you talk with your own insurance carriers before making a decision about being a living donor. Your premiums could increase. If you do not have health insurance, serving as a donor could be considered a pre-existing condition if you apply for insurance later.\nIf you work, talk with your employer about any existing leave policies before committing to living donation. Also, fully think about the financial impact on your family, especially if you and/or whoever serves as your caregiver during the donation recovery process may face lost wages.\nSource: UNOS Living Donation"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e1b6db37-0925-4ada-810a-e9d308e12829>","<urn:uuid:253c5264-e495-4819-a25e-5239ad27e9d8>"],"error":null}

Users can retrieve and replay ship movements from any day and time in the past. In contrast, Sentinel-1 SAR satellite detection is limited to capturing ship positions only at specific times when the satellite passes over an area - typically at 6 am during descending orbits and 6 pm during ascending orbits local time. This means Sentinel-1 provides only two daily snapshots of shipping activity rather than continuous monitoring, though it can detect ships regardless of whether they are actively transmitting position data.","context":["Pocket Mariner’s AISWatch service automatically monitors vessel movements and AIS SARTs in real-time using easily customisable geofences with audible and visual alerts.

In contrast, the sea surface causes a smaller coherent scattering: the radar waves bounce off the water surface in many directions and thus only a small fraction of the energy return to the antenna, which explains why the sea looks much darker.\nIn Google Earth Engine it's straightforward to generate such a max composite using the function ee.ImageCollection.max(). Here the max composite was done after filtering the Sentinel-1 GRD collection to get images from a similar look angles (in this case ascending node). Hence it provides a snapshot of ships density at the overpass time of Sentinel-1 at 6 pm local time (England). We can compare to the same composite made with descending orbits only i.e. 6 am.\nThe differences in the area near Calais and Dover may be due to the fact that there's a P&O ferry leaving Calais at 5:45 which is still near the French coast at 6am, while a ferry leaves Dover at 5:30 which is already farther off the English coast in the 6 am image. On the other hand, a ferry leaves Calais at 5:55 pm, therefore it is still very close to the port of Calais at Sentinel-1 overpass time. It's fun too look at other straits with the same method...\nSea of Marmara\nIn the Sea of Marmara the traffic is dense between the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits.

In particular a challenge is to deal with interferences from ground sources and SAR ambiguities which create \"ghost ships\" [1,2,3]. However, mass processing of Sentinel-1 data accounting for this effect has been done for maritime surveillance in the Mediterranean sea.\n- If you are a GEE user and would like to play with these composites here is a quick-start script: https://code.earthengine.google.com/522465700ba56fadc5814ac457219d85).\n- The shipping lanes can also be visualized using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data (an automatic tracking system on ships) as done by Marine Traffic. AIS data are emitted by all kind of ships (even small ships that may not be detected by Sentinel-1) and not only at 6am or 6pm. However, an AIS tracker can be switched off, whereas the Sentinel-1 radar at 693 km above sea level is out of reach... It seems that a Greek startup SatShipAI is building a tool to automatically identify ships using Sentinel-1 data.

{"question":"What principles make Chandigarh's city planning unique, and how does it cater to Indian lifestyle?","answer":"Chandigarh was designed as a post-war Garden City with several unique features. The city follows a grid-iron layout to facilitate fast vehicle movement, and its plan metaphorically represents a human body - with the capital complex as the 'head', commercial center as the 'heart', and academic/recreational centers as the 'arms'. Each sector incorporates the traditional Indian 'mohalla' concept and includes a park and shopping street. The planning specifically considers Indian needs and lifestyle by avoiding vertical development to suit the local climate and living habits.","context":["Planning the spread of a city and the way it would respond to its inhabitants’ needs and ease is not a novel idea. Since ancient times mankind has striven to look for ways to enhance its lifestyle and comfort, City Planning presents one of the most vivid examples of the workings of our mind and intellectual usage of available resources to build a community that is not only efficient but larger than life. From veteran cities like Jaipur to new conceptions and inceptions that have yet to be realized, planning of habitable communities has received a lot of attention and thought. It is thus a herculean task to choose between them the world’s top five planned cities.\n“A city is not an accident but the result of coherent visions and aims.” ― Leon Krier, The Architecture of Community\nSo what makes a city great? Let us explore the realm of good neighborhood characteristics by means of the selected five cities below and understand what makes them exceptional.\n1. Brasilia, Brazil\nThe pilot plan by Lucio Costa for Brasilia was the Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek’s vision coming true for the supposed new capital of Brazil in 1956. It had been a long time dream to spread Brazil’s population into its hinterlands. To build a city from scratch is indeed a Planner’s dream and few do justice to it the way Costa has done. Listed among UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites, the city is shaped like an airplane, paying homage to the jet age. Based on the principles of the “functional city” by Le Corbusier, the “plano de metas” for Brasilia accommodates the four functions of city-dwelling, recreation, work, and transportation in a balanced environment.\nCosta was the master-planner for the city while Oscar Niemeyer served as the Chief Architect for all the important buildings. The crucial and most distinctive feature of the plan was the separating character of the administrative civitas and the urbs. It was a highly successful endeavor as it ensured fast completion of the prominent civic buildings allowing the world to get a glimpse of the city yet to come. This divide in the urban fabric also made it easier to locate the different buildings and zones. The whole city has been developed into specific zones allocating each function of a ‘functional city’ its required space. The central location of Brasilia is an added benefit and another reason for choosing the area for the Capital of Brazil.\nBrasilia has two axes crossing each other at the center, the slightly curved horizontal one that is through the wings of the plane, comprises the residential zone. It adjusts according to the natural topography of the area and its drainage system. The city has been designed according to the best possible orientation and the least number of intersections. The other axis, known as the monumental axis, consists of the civic, administrative, and recreational zones. The banking and commercial sectors lie at the intersection, marking the design as well-thought-of and feasible. Well connected by all modes of transport, with even the smaller details of the city classified into zones, all of it makes for a simple yet outstanding plan.\n2. Singapore City, Singapore\nSingapore City is the result of deliberate urban growth. For a city with a land area of some odd 700 km² and a population of five million, it is doing quite well, considering that it is virtually squatter and slum-free with a rapid economic growth.\nLand-use planning of Singapore had its inception in 1819 with its founding father Sir Stamford Raffles, who formed a committee to draw up a plan for its urban development. The resulting plan divided separate ethnic groups of the time into separate zones, and that was the basis of the urban development there.\nToday, the city has been developed into four living zones: North, East, South, and West, with an upcoming North-East Zone. Zoning for natural reserves, industrial area, and others has also been carried out. To reduce congestion and to ensure easy communication, the commercial hubs of the city have been decentralized.\nWith no natural resources to count on, Singapore always had an eye for environmental planning and infrastructure development. Its high-density waste management policy is outstanding. The waste is regularly incinerated and because there is no space for dumping, the ashes are combined with marine sand to increase Singapore’s land mass. Also, sewage is filtered into drinking water through the use of updated technology.\nThe city handles its population spike by building underground and not just upwards. Other cities are taking inspiration from it. It truly deserves an ovation and a mention among the best-planned cities in the world.\n3. Chandigarh, India\nRevered Architects and City-Planners whose techniques and scholarly ideas are still referred to, like Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Jane Drew, and Maxwell Fry have had a hand in building Chandigarh.\nLocated in the foothills of the Shivaliks, its foundation stone was laid in 1952. Albert Mayer drafted the first plan along with Matthew Novicki, and Le Corbusier modified it later. He changed the curvy pattern to proper grid-and-iron layout, as we can see it today. His reason for doing so was to facilitate the fast movement of vehicles, in addition to other economic factors.\nIt was a post-war Garden City that he built, with no vertical development whatsoever in accordance with the living habits of people and the climate of Chandigarh.\nThe whole plan is a metaphorical human being, with the capital complex at the ‘head’, the commercial center at the ‘heart’, and the ‘arms’ containing the academic and recreational centers. It is a proper ‘sector-planning’ based on Le Corbusier’s principles of light, space, and greenery with each sector corresponding to the traditional Indian ‘mohalla’ concept. Every sector has a park and a shopping street, and they are all well connected to each other.\nThe planning of Chandigarh not only covers the important aspects of a good neighborhood but also takes into account the needs and lifestyle of the Indians and that is what makes it an exemplary city.\n4.Seoul, South Korea\nSeoul is not just another well-planned city, it has a history that goes back to when it was Hanyang, Capital of Joseon, 600 years ago. It is strategically located with a natural defense system of mountains and streams. The Seoul from back then was built on the principles of Feng-Shui, with proper balance among the mountains, to ensure prosperity for the people inhabiting it. After the 1950-53 war in Busan, the Seoul Urban Reconstruction Plan started to take effect, and the first masterplan was conceived in 1966.\nWhat distinguishes Seoul from the other cities is its well-laid transportation network with co-ordination among various modes to provide a safe, easy, and fast commute. Moreover, the traffic management is quite efficient with separate tracks provided for cyclists. It also has separate zones for residences, commerce, recreation, and other functions. The 2020 masterplan for the city ensures objectives like having a business-friendly environment, beautiful urban scenery, Eco-friendly infrastructure, and welfare.\nDue to the rapid growth of its population (fastest in the world from 1950 to 1975), Seoul introduced a Greenbelt policy inspired from that of London. These greenbelts are Restricted Development Zones (RDZ). They are very large, with an average of about 10 kilometers wide, beginning at about 15 kilometers from Seoul’s C.B.D. So as it can be seen, lessons can, definitely, be learned from Seoul, its rapid urbanization, and how to cope with it.\n5. Copenhagen, Denmark\nCopenhagen is probably the most different among other planned cities and has become a study-worthy concept over time. The “Five-Finger Plan” was developed in 1947 by Steen Eiler Rasmussen and Christian Erhard Bredsdorff in collaboration with the Urban Planning Laboratory.\nThe Plan focuses on the Green spaces and the transportation system with metropolitan train lines which spread in the form of five fingers from the Palm that is Copenhagen City Center. Other modes of transport include a full network of buses, four lines of water-buses, and a metro system.\nAn extra defining feature of the plan is the bike lanes widespread throughout the city, for which Copenhagen is renowned worldwide.\n“We don’t have cyclists in Copenhagen, we merely have people who happen to ride their bicycles.”- City of Cyclists – Copenhagen bicycle life\nNearly 40% of people ride bicycles daily, and the numbers are expected to rise. In addition, it is a walkable city with shopping areas which are pedestrian-accessible.\nCopenhagen, unlike other cities in so many respects, also focuses on creating green areas, especially playgrounds for children and gathering places. The latest regulations in the city state that the maximum distance between green spaces and residences should be 300 meters, which allows for small pockets of greenery everywhere.\nFuture expansion plans for the city are currently underway. Copenhagen definitely earns its unique place among the great cities of the world with its authenticity and the simple charm oozing from its every corner.\nOur world is full of greatness at every corner, some natural and some man-made. The genius of man when combined with the perfect natural setting, the result is a well-planned ‘City’, in the true sense of the word. There are much more great examples like London, Paris, Washington D.C., Navi Mumbai, and others to look upon for inspiration. To build a perfect utopian society is perhaps not possible, but in chasing that dream we may find something akin to it.\nTo say it in a few words: “Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.”- Vince Lombardi\nBy: Antara Jha"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1c4814fd-06cd-4ea3-aa89-e8ca4e416b4d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the importance of business cards differ between Japanese and Chinese business cultures?","answer":"In both Japanese and Chinese business cultures, business cards are treated with great importance, but with some specific customs. In Japan, when receiving a card, you must accept it with both hands and read it, showing respect for both the card and person. The card should be left visible on the table if seated and not put away immediately. In Chinese business culture, cards should also be offered and received with both hands, and it's recommended to print information in both Chinese and English, with Chinese preferably in gold ink as it's considered auspicious. In both cultures, keeping cards in good condition is important - in Japan, they shouldn't be bent or dirty, and in China, they are typically exchanged during initial meetings as part of formal business protocol.","context":["When speaking about cultures or business etiquette, Asian countries are often grouped together. However, it is not necessarily true that cultures or ethnicities in the same area of the world share the same traditions or values. While there are some similarities in history and culture across Asian countries, each country and the way its people conduct business is unique.\nThe most important thing to remember is to be respectful of everyone you meet. If you don’t know the right thing to say or do in a business or causal setting, ask rather than make an inaccurate assumption and offend your hosts.\nDemonstrating that you are interested in learning and abiding by their norms is one way to show respect. However, even if you cannot learn or adapt to all the traditions of these many countries, here are a few key things to remember when traveling for business.\nIn Japan, it is common to bow when meeting someone new. However, your hosts may be familiar with Western traditions and offer to shake your hand. Be prepared for either or both forms of greeting and follow the lead of your host. To bow properly, keep your back straight and hands down at your sides. Refrain from putting your hands in your pockets or crossing your arms. As is true in American culture, this is a sign of boredom or disinterest.\nBusiness cards are a bigger deal in Japan than in the United States. When presented with a card, accept it with both hands and read the card. This shows respect and care for the card and person who handed it to you. If you are seated, leave the card out on the table or on your card case. Do not shove the card into you pocket or bag. It’s best to keep your own cards in a nice case so they are not bent or dirty when you hand them out.\n- pointing with your fingers or any objects, such as chopsticks or pens.\n- It’s not customary and can be considered rude.\n- pointing out someone’s mistake. Always be respectful of your hosts and business partners.\n- being late. In fact, be 15 minutes early.\nJust as you would in America, offer a firm handshake when meeting someone for business. Similar to Japanese culture, business cards are a big deal. Offer and receive cards with both hands. If possible, print your information in Chinese on one side and English on the other.\nPatience and appropriately following up are very important in Chinese business culture. No big decisions are made quickly and you should prepare for longer meetings and speeches. You may be asked to speak as well but keep your remarks short and avoid “taking over” the conversation. Follow up after a meeting with an email highlighting the positive points and decisions, but don’t be too extensive with your remarks.\nBusiness is frequently conducted over meals. Learn how to use chopsticks and where to put them when eating. It’s best to put them back onto the holder rather than placing them in or on the bowl or plate. If a second meal or meeting is requested, offer to host.\n- being late. Be on time, early if possible.\n- speaking too loudly or quickly. Match the tone of your host.\n- interrupting holidays or being ignorant of superstitions. Respect for tradition is important.\n- pointing with your figures or other objects.\nLucky for Americans, the most common business language in India is English, though Hindu is widely spoken in other areas of the country. Greet your host by saying “Namaste” with your palms together in front of your chest. Offer a slight bow or nod of the head.\nNodding is often a sign of understanding rather than agreement. Be careful not to confuse the two when speaking in business meetings.\nJust as is true in China, be aware and respectful of holidays. In the Hindu religion, holidays can last longer than a day or two, so plan your trip accordingly.\n- shaking hands, especially with women, unless the host offers his or her hand first.\n- declining food or drink in a meeting. Accept what is offered so you don’t cause offense.","1.3 billion people – the largest in the world, 9.6 millions km² of land, vast amounts of valuable natural resources such as coal, oil, and minerals, and the leading consumer of four out of five core commodities; grain, meat, coal, and steel. China’s status is no longer that of a developing country but one of an emerging economic superpower, one that is writing economic history and shifting the power balance from West to East. China’s rapidly growing economy, massive market, and cost effective business infrastructure, is drawing companies and conglomerates to the country to set up shop. And although the country is getting globalized it still has its own local business culture, business etiquette, meeting protocols, mannerisms, etc.which need to be followed.\nIn this article we will discuss and explore certain cultural facts and how they influence business culture and etiquette.\nChinese follow the rule of Confucianism, which revolves around the concept of harmonious relationships, i.e obligations of people towards one another based upon their relationship. In particular Confucianism emphasizes duty, sincerity, loyalty, honour, filial piety, respect for age and seniority. Confucianism permeates every single fabric in society, including business practices. Although subtle, the manifestations are evident: an aversion to conflict, maintenance of proper demeanour and the preservation of ‘face’. The concept of ‘face’ roughly translates as ‘honour’, ‘reputation’ or ‘respect’ and is extremely important to Chinese people. It is essential that one gives face, saves face and shows face when doing business in China.\nGreetings Greetings are part and parcel of any business meetings. In China, meetings start with the shaking of hands and a slight nod of the head. A firm but not overly vigorous handshake is recommended when shaking hands, anything more will be interpreted as being aggressive. The Chinese are not keen on physical contact – especially in a business setting. Even if you are familiar with the person, avoid slapping, patting or placing your arm around someone’s shoulders. In a business meeting, one should always be calm, collected and controlled. Watch out for your body posture and try not to slouch or look listless. A formal and attentive posture tells your associates that you have self-control and are worthy of respect. Business cards are usually exchanged on an initial meeting. Make sure one side of the card has been translated and if possible print the Chinese letters using gold ink as this is considered an auspicious color and reflects well upon your company. When giving your business card, mention your company, rank and any qualifications you hold, making sure you give and receive any business card with both hands. Rank is extremely important in business relationships and you must keep rank differences in mind when communicating. Treating them too informally, especially in front of their peers, may well ruin any potential deals.\nBuilding Professional Relationships\nOne essential thing to remember when conducting business in China is that you are seen as a representative of your company therefore any interaction or dealings has to be professional. Never become too informal and avoid humour. Rather than a lack of humor of the Chinese’s part, it is the fact that jokes may be lost in translation and hence be awkward, redundant and even offensive (unless you speak very good Mandarin!) When doing business in China, it is important to engage an intermediary. As the Chinese don’t like doing business with companies they don’t know, the role of the intermediary is vital. This could be an individual or an organization who can make a formal introduction and vouch for the reliability of your company. In addition, the intermediary get act as an interpreter and navigate you through the bureaucracy, legal system and local business networks.\nGiving Gifts Etiquette While this practice is considered a grey area in many countries and frowned upon in some, the giving of gifts in a professional business setting does not carry any negative connotations. The Chinese believe that gifts should always be exchanged for celebrations, as a thank you for assistance rendered, and even as a sweetener for future favors. However, it is important that gifts are only given for a good reason and in the presence of a witness as this may be construed differently in the absence of both. When the Chinese want to buy gifts, they will often be direct in asking what you would like – this is common. It is not considered bad manners to specify something you desire. That being said, it would be wise to demonstrate an appreciation of Chinese culture by asking for items such as traditional Chinese ink paintings or Chinese tea. Business gifts are always reciprocated in kind as they are seen as debts that must be repaid. When giving gifts do not give cash as it is too easily misconstrued as a bribe. The gifts need to be items of worth or beauty. Do not be too frugal with your choice of gift otherwise you will be seen as a cheap and tight person.\nMeetings and Negotiations At the risk of stating the obvious, meetings must be schedule well in advance. It is considered good manners to forward some literature regarding your organization as a form of introduction. The ideal period for meetings are between April – June and September – October. Avoid all national holidays especially Chinese New Year. As punctuality is correlated to respect, it is important that you are not late. In fact getting to the meeting venue before the other party does sets a good tone for the meeting. Do not dive straight into your pitch, numbers, presentations etc. instead start with some brief small talk. If this is your first meeting then talk of your experiences in China so far. Keep the conversation positive (i.e no complains about food, weather, sleep etc as it’s considered bad form) and avoid anything political. Prior to any meeting, you should always send an agenda. This will allow you to have some control of the flow of the meeting as the Chinese approach meeting very differently. The main topic is discussed first followed by the side issues, so be prepared. Renowned for being tough negotiators, the Chinese’s primary aim in negotiations is ‘concessions’. Always bear this in mind when formulating your own strategy. Be prepared to show compromise and make them feel they have gained major concessions. For the Chinese, business negotiations are like going to war. They will plan meticulously and will know your business and possibly even you inside out. It’s like the ‘three kingdoms’ all over again but in business. One favorite move of Chinese negotiators is to show false humility and deference at the start, designed to make them look vulnerable and seemingly weak, this move exploits any weakness or ‘holes’ in the other camp."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a8927dbe-4aa2-464f-b366-656c38637313>","<urn:uuid:4a2937eb-9fe3-4b23-bc8b-805d43d9b058>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between translation quality and time constraints in subtitling, and how does this compare to current streaming practices?","answer":"Professional subtitlers typically have less than three weeks to complete a film translation, requiring rigorous work to maintain quality while meeting deadlines. They need extensive knowledge of both languages and cultural aspects, plus access to specialists for various topics. Modern subtitling software helps by showing captions directly on the film for easier writing and rewriting. In contrast, current streaming practices are heavily influenced by 'Time is Money' pressures - they often produce quick translations and don't want to pay voice actors fair wages. Additionally, streaming services frequently remove shows from their catalogs after short runs, sometimes before viewers can finish series, prioritizing rapid turnover over quality and accessibility.","context":["Emmanuel Denizot works as a translator in Paris, subtitling US and UK films and TV series for release in France. Some of the films he’s worked on include Puccini for Beginners, Project Nim, Keep the Lights On, Queer as Folk and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Global Edition.\nSince subtitlers are often the final writers on our movies, I asked Denizot to give an introduction to subtitling for screenwriters.\nAs a teenager growing up in France, I fell in love with both cinema and the English language. I used to videotape subtitled versions of British and American classics broadcast very late at night. Everything else on television was dubbed — the dialogue replaced.\nAt the time, I couldn’t have agreed more with Gena Rowlands when she said, “I like subtitles. Sometimes I wish all movies had subtitles.”\nIt used to be very difficult to find theatres showing subtitled films in France, but they’ve become much more popular. Today, most Parisian cinemas show subtitled films, and it’s almost a challenge to find dubbed versions of foreign films in the city.\nGetting the words right\nIn this day of technology, when subtitles are all the rage and anyone can have a go at amateur subtitling, it’s easy to overlook how complex it is to subtitle a feature film. It takes rigorous, creative professionals to provide quality subtitles.\nThe subtitling process goes as follows:\nTime-cueing. This involves creating the captions (in English) along with time-codes. This part is fairly straightforward, but you need to respect shot changes and other constraints.\nTranslation. This is my job.\nSimulation. The subtitles are checked in the lab with a proofreader and the client. In the event of a theatrical release, the distributor will pick their own translator, whereas in the video world it is most often the subtitling company which will subcontract a subtitler and handle the job.\nTranslating a film is just a long series of solutions to be found and traps to be avoided.\nAs a French speaker, I work from English into my mother tongue. This is a basic rule. A subtitler needs to have great ability in writing dialogue in his own language. He will also have extensive knowledge of the language he’s translating from with all cultural aspects that go with it.\nAs with any kind of written work, research is paramount and the Internet does wonders, but I also like to have a range of specialists I can contact. This job takes us from politics to sports and through all sorts of fields in no time at all.\nObviously, we are provided with the image, but also with a spotted list which provides explanations of puns, special intents in dialogue, etc. This detailed list is common for Hollywood films, but unfortunately, it is very unusual for indie films, in which case we are just provided with a simple dialogue list.\nWhat you meant to say\nIn the business, we say a good subtitling is the one you won’t notice.\nWe don’t want people to feel like they’re reading. They should be enjoying the work of a director and actors based on a screenplay. The subtitling must be such that they can forget that they had to put their glasses on to read the captions.\nI like to watch the film a couple of times first to really get into it, and then watch French films in the same spirit so I can sort of work on the language side. What kind of register will I be using for these characters and this particular film? Sometimes the process is completely natural if it’s a modern film which resembles my own sort of speech patterns, and other times it is a totally different world or era.\nIn subtitling, you’re going from spoken to written language that will still need to read as dialogue. What’s more, the number of characters per line you are able to use is very limited.\nOur goal is to express as much as we can in the fewest, shortest words possible. It’s a bit like crosswords: you’ve got a definition but you can only have one word for it. It can be quite frustrating sometimes, but also very satisfying when you find just the right phrase after trying so many different ways to express the same idea.\nSubtitling a comedy, for instance, is always tricky as it is so culturally charged. What will provoke laughter in America might not in France or Canada. I remember subtitling a screwball comedy once which had a running gag on the misunderstanding of Kant & the c-word. I first thought it would be impossible to render puns based on pronunciation. And I was so happy and relieved when I came up with funny lines in the end using the name Kant. Very often, you will get your ideas whenever you’re away from your desk so it’s good to always be able to take notes at any time, just like any type of writer.\nWe often have less than three weeks to subtitle a film and time is paramount to come up with the best solutions. The good news is I work with subtitling software, so captions show up directly on the film. This makes it much easier to write and rewrite so that it’s readable. Rules are strict, but fiddling around is part of the job. The end result needs to be fluid and faithful to the original version, but also feel lively and natural.\nFor cultural reasons, French Canadian distributors get their own list of subtitles. Two French versions will be recorded: one in Quebec, one in France.\nIn other words\nDubbing is a completely separate process from subtitling, which may seem strange. After all, you’re still translating into a language.\nDialogue for dubbing needs to fit the mouths, so to speak, of the original version. This is very far away from the constraints that the subtitler has to deal with. There is no way the subtitles could be used for dubbing purposes, and you can’t use the dub for subtitling either: the dialogue would be much too long for the captions. Therefore, a film will have two sets of new dialogue, one for the subtitled version, one for the dubbed.\nIn the end, many subtitlers are happier talking about their work as adaptation rather than translation. You’re creating a version of the work that hopefully reflects the original intent, but meets the needs of the audience and medium.\nYou can see more of Denizot’s credits on his website.\nFor more information about subtitling as a profession, visit the British Subtitlers’ Association or L’Association des Traducteurs / Adaptateurs de l’Audiovisuel.","This debate crops up with some regularity. First of all, it’s pointless and stupid to tell you which you should prefer. But there are some interesting things about brain science and anime history that can be added to the mix.\nLet’s take a look at the data:\nI’ve had the impression that older anime fans like me were the only ones who preferred subs, but apparently that’s not the case. The International Anime Research Team has been surveying anime fans at conventions and online since 2014, and studying other aspects of fandom as well. They publish the results of their surveys, and wrote a book in 2021: Transported To Another World: The Psychology of Anime Fans that you can download for free. Here’s the result of their question about subs and dubs:\nThat’s a surprise. Over 60% of the people surveyed preferred subtitles. Maybe this is older fans? Nope! They show age data for 2021 Survey (They vary the questions each year):\nSo what’s going on?\nObviously it’s not age or how long you’ve been an anime fan that’s driving this subtitle preference. If you’re over 30 you’re practically invisible. I’m guessing there are fewer older people going to anime cons, but a big draw at most anime cons seems to be meeting the dub voice actors. I suspect their online notices may not be reaching older fans, but there’s no arguing that anime has become a lot more popular in the last few years.\nHere’s my guess: Cons and streaming services want to bring in new people all the time. More people = more profits, and you need new viewers/attendees to replace ones you lose to attrition for various reasons. Even nonprofit cons have to bring in new members or they’ll gradually die out.\nNew and casual fans are less likely to view subtitled anime. They’ll start out with what’s new and popular, that they see promos for, or their friends recommend. Maybe later there might be something more specialized that isn’t dubbed yet, or it never will be dubbed. But the growth for new anime fans is with dubs, so that’s what gets promoted.\nMost of the scientific studies I’ve found are about subtitles for language learning and education, with only a few about watching fiction. None of the studies I’ve seen use anime specifically. Two I found used French or another European language with English subtitles. One hypothesis was that viewers would remember less from a subtitled viewing because their attention was divided between the text and the images. This turned out not to be the case- the first study found that subtitle viewers remembered more about the movie.\nAnother study looked at what viewers remembered, comparing “bridging references” with “outside references”. Bridging references were connections within the film. You might remember that earlier a character said they were afraid of heights, and now they’re faced with the challenge of crossing a swinging rope bridge. Or that bag of money is lost in the park, and later someone chases their frisbee into the bushes and finds a bag. You know it’s the money. “outside references” link to things outside the film. It might be to a trope (in a horror movie, teens that enter the basement one at a time are going to die ) or a symbolic reference (wilted flowers might symbolize a relationship ending, or death). They’re any sort of connection you make to something outside the film.\nThe study found that those who viewed a dubbed version of the film made more outside references, and the subtitle watchers made more bridging references. They didn’t give a reason, but I suspect it’s because the subtitle viewers kept their eyes on the screen more than the dub viewers did. More bridging references means they remembered more about the film.\nI think all of this is mostly because subtitled anime forces you to pay attention to what you’re watching. Maybe the people who prefer subs are getting more out of their viewing experience, even if they’re not consciously aware of it. You can multitask during most English-language series, texting or folding laundry and occasionally checking the screen. You can follow along with the dialog, This is also a reason why shows with complex plots are rare and get canceled on American TV- people can’t follow them.\nHistory of anime subtitles\nIn the old days you had few choices if you wanted to watch anime. Very little came to the US. Most of the commercial releases were “localized” to remove any trace of Japanese-ness. Names and locations were changed and episodes were chopped up or eliminated entirely. To this day, other cultural references to history, Buddhism, Shinto, or Ancestor Veneration routinely are cut or sanitized. In the case of Card Captor Sakura, they edited the show to make the boy the main character in “Cardcaptors.” Many of the dubbed shows sounded like they handed random people the script and said “Here, read this.” Anime was ultra-niche, so the main commercial anime genres were shows for children and ultra-violent ones.\nThe other choice was fan-subtitled works – fansubs. While some were undeniably bad, sometimes hilariously so, some were excellent. One reason for the high-quality ones is that they were totally non-commercial and escaped the “Time is Money” trap. Most fansubbers put in a lot of work, and they wanted to earn a reputation for quality. Their ‘handle’ was their personal brand.\nFansubs could be almost any genre. The down side is that fansub groups often wouldn’t deal with you unless you had shows they wanted for trade. No money changed hands. You mailed them a tape and return postage. If you were lucky there was a university anime club near you, like Animania at University of Michigan, that screened hours of fansubs at their monthly meetings.\nEventually fans pestered Cartoon Network and SciFi to show anime, and we got some stellar dubs like Cowboy Bebop.\nNow in the streaming era with the firehose of new anime, the old “Time is Money” has returned and they don’t want to pay voice actors a fair wage. They also drop most shows from their catalog after a short run, never to be seen again, so if you don’t watch quickly enough you may not get to the end of a series.\nSometimes a dub takes a while to appear. Miyazaki’s Nausicaa was released in 1984, but a dubbed version didn’t appear until 21 years later! (I saw a fansubbed version at an Animania screening in 1993). Totoro was released in 1988, with the Disney dub finally appearing in 2006!\nI’m not sure if Kimagure Orange Road from 1987 was ever dubbed, and that was a big fantasy/romance favorite. It may be one of the many shows that will never receive a dub because there aren’t separate sound/music and voice tracks. That’s a problem for a lot of older shows. And dubbing can be expensive. Nozomi’s kickstarter for dubbing the 26 episodes of Dirty Pair needed $275,000 minimum. The live-action Korean movie Parasite (2019) by Bong Joon-ho apparently hasn’t been dubbed into English either, and it won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film.\nThe other factor to consider is that using subtitles is a skill, like playing the violin or ice skating. It’s going to be harder when you first try, just like any new activity, but you’ll get better with practice. Older fans learned to watch subtitles out of necessity, and by now we’re pretty good at it. If you want to learn, avoid shows with fast-paced dialog.\nThe 2nd paper is The Impact of Subtitles on Comprehension of Narrative Film by Mina Lee , Beverly Roskos & David R.

{"question":"As a bank compliance officer, I need to know what are the key features of letters of credit and what cybersecurity risks could affect their digital processing?","answer":"Letters of credit (LCs) are characterized by their autonomous nature, providing a guaranteed payment method for exporters through creditworthy financial institutions. Their key feature is the autonomy principle, where the bank's obligation to honor a draft is independent of the underlying contract and solely based on compliant document presentation. However, with increasing digitalization, LCs face cybersecurity threats including malware attacks, phishing attempts, and unauthorized system access that could compromise sensitive transaction data. These cyber risks can lead to data breaches, financial fraud, and identity theft, potentially affecting the LC processing system and the sensitive financial information it contains.","context":["With the increasing use and sophistication of technology, the potential for fraud to impact trade finance has increased significantly in recent years. Indeed, technology has allowed fraudsters to globalise their practices and both corporates and banks are under an ever increasing compliance burden just to keep pace. In this article we look at how the certainty of letters of credit may be impacted by wider fraudulent/illegal conduct and what can be done to mitigate the risks.\nInternational trade finance relies heavily on letters of credit (LCs). They secure quick, clean payment and are generally unaffected by the circumstances of the underlying commercial transaction. For this reason, they are ripe for abuse by criminal organisations as a means of laundering money or obtaining payment for corrupt or illegal purposes.\nIn such circumstances, whilst a bank may be justified in refusing to honour an LC where evidence of fraud is present it is not clear whether lesser levels of wrongdoing and/or underlying illegal conduct would allow the bank the same discretion.\nAt a time when the international community is increasing its cooperative implementation of robust anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) and anti-money laundering (AML) measures in international trade, it is at least possible that underlying ABC and AML will (in the future) affect the certainty of LCs.\nThe autonomous nature of LCs\nThe utility of LCs is in providing a guaranteed method of payment for exporters from a familiar and creditworthy financial institution. The key feature of an LC that achieves this function is the autonomy principle. By this principle, an issuing bank’s obligation to honour a draft on an LC is independent of the underlying contract to which the credit relates. Instead, the bank’s sole consideration is whether a request to honour is accompanied by documents which appear, on their face, to comply with the terms of the credit. In this way, LCs have been described as being as good as cash.\nThe fraud exception\nDespite the importance of certainty, unscrupulous sellers are not protected by the autonomy principle. The fraud exception enables buyers to restrain sellers from drawing on an LC, or issuing banks from honouring a credit, if the documents presented to the bank are tainted by fraud. Whilst the exception has been adopted around the globe, its precise scope is unclear and varies from country to country.\nA key area of contention is whether the exception extends to fraud in the underlying transaction or is confined to fraud in the documents presented under the LC. An example illustrating this distinction would be an American distributor purchasing 500kg of full-blood Wagyu beef with a marble score of 9 from an Australian exporter, secured by an LC for the purchase price. The Australian exporter ships 500kg of Wagyu beef, but fraudulently ships substantially inferior beef with a marble score of 4. If the invoice presented to the issuing bank described the product as ‘500kg of Wagyu beef with a marble score of 9’, this would amount to fraud in the documents. However, if the invoice merely described ‘500kg of Wagyu beef’, the fraud would be limited to the underlying transaction.\nThis question of the location of fraud is an important one because if the exception extends widely to fraud in the underlying transaction, this may open the door for courts to consider other disentitling conduct affecting the commercial deal.\nCourts in the United Kingdom have largely taken the narrow view. The general consensus there is that the exception is limited to circumstances where the seller fraudulently presents documents that contain, whether expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that are known to be untrue. However, there has not yet been a definitive judicial statement that the exception cannot extend to fraud that only resonates in the underlying contract and the position remains open. By comparison, in Canada the exception extends to fraud in the underlying transaction if it is of such a character as to make the demand of payment a fraudulent one. In the USA, the same result is achieved by Article 5-109 of the Revised Uniform Commercial Code, which extends the fraud exception to circumstances where honour of the presentation would ‘facilitate a material fraud’ on the issuer or applicant by the beneficiary. Similarly, in China, LC fraud will fall under the general principles of civil fraud laid down in Chinese law and the aggrieved party may apply to the court for payment to be suspended. The courts will treat such claims in accordance with the property preservation provisions of the civil procedure law of the PRC. However, if the bank has already made the payment, the court has no power to interfere or suspend the transaction.\nThe illegality exception\nWhile fraud allows a bank to refuse to honour an LC, it is not so clear whether illegality in the underlying transaction provides the same justification. In North America, the prevailing view is that no illegality exception exists. There is nothing in the Revised Uniform Commercial Code to excuse an issuing bank from paying because of supervening illegality. In Canada, courts have emphasised that LCs are not tainted by illegality in the underlying transaction. However, the possibility has been entertained in the UK. Courts there have contemplated cases where illegality would affect the enforceability of an LC. The cases include judicial comment that, for example, that the courts could not rationally enforce an LC that secured payment for the purchase of heroin or to facilitate the illegal sale of arms to Iraq. While the UK courts have contemplated the existence of an illegality exception in LC law, its nature and scope remains a vexed question. Amongst other things, it is unclear how far removed the illegality would have to be from the LC transaction to justify disturbing the autonomy principle. The bounds of the exception may need to be determined on a case by case basis. The potential for an illegality exception to justify refusing payment is an issue of increasing relevance given worldwide moves to counter bribery in international business and trade based money laundering.\nLCs ripe for abuse\nThe autonomous nature of LCs mean they are ripe for abuse whether through the provision of false documents evidencing shipping, insurance fraud or as a means of laundering money.\nIn addition, it is easy to see how bribery might arise in the LC process. For example, an exporter might promise to pay a bribe to the buyer’s agent in order to secure a lucrative sales contract. The exporter might then request an LC to cover an inflated sales price that incorporates the bribe.\nSimilarly, LCs provide an efficient mechanism for laundering money. Certain behaviours associated with international trade have been identified as indicative of money laundering. These include:\n- deal structures beyond the capability of a customer or involving improbable goods, origins, quantities or descriptions;\n- significant discrepancies between the description or value of goods on the documents stipulated under an LC;\n- significant or repeated amendments to or extensions of an LC that are not reasonably justified; and\n- transfers of funds to international jurisdictions associated with dangerous drugs or with weak anti-money laundering regimes.\nWith advances in technology the scope for fraud and the sophistication of those frauds has increased.\nABC and AML laws\nIn 1997, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) finalised theConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The convention has since been ratified by 34 countries around the world. The United Nations Convention Against Corruption has been even more widely adopted. In line with their treaty obligations, Australia, the UK and the US have all criminalised bribery of foreign public officials in international trade. In the US, for example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 criminalises the corrupt payments of anything of value to a foreign government official in order to secure an improper business advantage. Similar conduct is criminalised in Australia by the Criminal Code (Cth) and in the UK by the Bribery Act 2010.\nOn the AML front, Australian laws were beefed up in 2006 to align with international best practice to deter money laundering and terrorism financing. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) is Australia’s cornerstone legislation. It adopts the practices of the Financial Action Task Force, an international intergovernmental organisation tasked with combatting money laundering. The Act imposes various AML obligations on financial institutions, including establishing robust AML programs, conducting customer due diligence and reporting suspicious activities to Australian authorities. The US and UK impose similar obligations on financial institutions operating in those countries.\nProtection mechanisms for banks\nThe potential recognition of an illegality exception to LCs begs the question: what does a bank need to do to detect illegality in the underlying transaction? Generally, a bank providing an LC will not have any visibility of the underlying transaction. However, this does not mean that banks cannot undertake robust due diligence at the LC application stage.\nABC due diligence\nIn 2006, an OECD working party developed recommendations designed to prevent bribery in export transactions. While the recommendations apply to official export credit providers that provide export credit insurance (ECI), the measures are transferable to the approval phase of an LC. Adopting those recommendations, issuers of LCs should consider:\n- requiring exporters to provide a declaration that neither they, nor anyone acting on their behalf, such as agents, have engaged in bribery in the transaction or have been charged with bribery offences in any country in the last five years;\n- verifying whether exporters are listed on publicly available debarment lists of the World Bank and other regional international banks;\n- requiring exporters to disclose any commissions or fees agreed to be paid to persons acting on an exporter’s behalf; and\n- if suspicions of bribery arise before an LC is approved, suspending the application, engaging in enhanced due diligence and refusing the application if bribery is substantiated.\nAML due diligence\nPrior to issuing an LC, AML laws require due diligence by an issuing bank to identify and verify the applicant. This can involve standard procedures at the account opening stage. The Wolfsberg Group recommends that this stage of due diligence consider the applicant’s countries of trades, the goods traded, the parties with whom the applicant deals and the location of any agents or third parties. If information indicates that high risk countries are involved or that relevant parties and goods are on sanctions or terrorist lists, the issuing bank should conduct further enquiries. Due diligence by the confirming, negotiating or advising bank (as the case may be) should mirror this process in respect of the beneficiary. The banks should also conduct due diligence on one another. It is highly recommended that counterparties utilise electronic screening tools to facilitate this process.\nOnce an LC is on foot, a bank’s means of reviewing the transaction are more limited. However, banks should continually review LC transactions using the latest technology and be alert to new parties or countries mentioned in documents presented under a credit.\nAlthough an illegality exception to LCs has been suggested, it is not yet clear whether these suggestions will crystallise into hard law. Instead, banks could require that a declaration in line with ABC and AML laws be presented as a condition of an LC. A declaration of this nature would require an exporter to assert that neither it, nor anyone acting on its behalf, has engaged in illegal conduct, bribery or used the transaction to launder money.\nIn practical terms, an issuing bank will generally become aware of illegality upon notice from the applicant, who may not wish to complete a sale that is affected by illegal conduct, bribery or money laundering. Even if the applicant can provide the bank with strong evidence of illegality, it is not clear whether the bank could refuse to honour the LC on that basis. However, if the bank was then presented with the beneficiary’s fraudulent declaration that neither bribery nor money laundering objectives had affected the transaction, the issuing bank would be firmly within the established fraud exception in refusing the pay.\nHow can banks minimise exposure?\nFor reputational reasons and as part of good corporate governance, banks have an interest in ensuring that the LCs they issue, confirm or negotiate are not used to further illegality, bribery or money laundering. In practice, there are some key steps that can be taken by a bank to mitigate the ever increasing risks\n- The most fundamental strategy is a robust and fulsome due diligence process at the LC application stage. Banks need to verify the identity of an LC applicant and be aware of the countries, goods and counterparties involved in a transaction – advances in technology and screening have made this process more exhaustive but not necessarily simpler from an operational perspective.\n- If due diligence procedures identify issues of high risk, banks should carefully monitor the transaction. While an issuing bank’s insight may be limited, continuous review of new parties, locations and goods specified in documents presented under an LC provides a means of ongoing due diligence.\n- Finally, banks might consider requiring an ABC/AML declaration to be presented as a condition of an LC. This would create a mechanism to refuse payment based on the fraud exception.","With the increasing digitalization of the world, cybersecurity has become an essential aspect of our daily lives. The internet is a treasure trove of information and opportunities, but it also poses a significant threat to our personal and professional lives. Cybercriminals are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities to exploit, and we must remain vigilant in protecting ourselves and our sensitive data.\nIn the modern era, cybersecurity has become a crucial aspect of our digital lives. With the rise of technology, the need to protect our digital assets from cybercriminals has become more pressing. Cybersecurity involves the practice of protecting our digital systems, networks, and devices from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or any other form of malicious attack.\nThe internet has become an essential part of our daily lives, and it is not uncommon to have sensitive information stored in our digital devices. Cybersecurity measures are necessary to safeguard our personal and professional information from cyber attacks that can cause significant harm. Cyber attacks can lead to data breaches, identity theft, financial fraud, and other criminal activities that can have a severe impact on our lives.\nThere are various forms of cyber attacks, including phishing, malware attacks, and hacking.

{"question":"Looking to understand new sensing technologies: how do the practical applications of bee venom-based sensors differ from MST in terms of their versatility?","answer":"Bee venom-based sensors are specifically designed for detecting explosives and similar nitro-aromatic compounds, including TNT and certain pesticides, but require a commercially available concentrator to bring air molecules into contact with the carbon nanotubes for practical use. In contrast, MST is much more versatile, capable of analyzing a wide range of molecular interactions including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and ions, and can accommodate different buffers and detergents. MST is particularly valuable for studying challenging targets like membrane proteins and works with virtually every available detergent for protein solubilization.","context":["Bee venom makes explosives detector extra sensitive\nA new detector so sensitive it can pick up a single molecule of an explosive such as TNT has been developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nTo create the sensors, a team of chemical engineers led by chemistry professor Michael Strano coated carbon nanotubes with protein fragments normally found in bee venom. This is the first time these proteins have been shown to react to explosives, specifically a class known as nitro-aromatic compounds that includes TNT.\nIf developed into commercial devices, such sensors would be far more sensitive than existing explosives detectors that use spectrometry to analyse charged particles as they move through the air.\n‘Ion mobility spectrometers are widely deployed because they are inexpensive and very reliable,’ said Prof Strano. ‘However, this next generation of nanosensors can improve upon this by detecting single molecules of explosives at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.’\nStrano has filed for a patent on the technology, which makes use of protein fragments called bombolitins. ‘Scientists have studied these peptides but, as far as we know, they’ve never been shown to have an affinity for and recognise explosive molecules in any way,’ he said.\nIn recent years, Strano’s laboratory has developed carbon-nanotube sensors for a variety of molecules, including nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide and toxic agents such as the nerve gas sarin. Such sensors take advantage of carbon nanotubes’ natural fluorescence, by coupling them to a molecule that binds to a specific target. When the target is bound, the tubes’ fluorescence brightens or dims.\nThe new explosives sensor works in a slightly different way. When the target binds to the bee-venom proteins coating the nanotubes, it shifts the fluorescent light’s wavelength instead of changing its intensity. The researchers built a new type of microscope to read the signal, which cannot be seen with the naked eye.\nEach nanotube peptide combination reacts differently to different nitro-aromatic compounds. By using several different nanotubes coated in various bombolitins, the researchers can identify a unique ‘fingerprint’ for each explosive that they might want to detect. The nanotubes can also sense the breakdown products of such explosives.\n‘Compounds such as TNT decompose in the environment, creating other molecule types, and those derivatives could also be identified with this type of sensor,’ said Strano. ‘Because molecules in the environment are constantly changing into other chemicals, we need sensor platforms that can detect the entire network and classes of chemicals, rather than just one type.’\nThe MIT researchers’ sensor uses carbon nanotubes covered in protein fragments. It can detect even a single molecule of an explosive, such as a TNT molecule\nThe researchers also showed that the nanotubes can detect two pesticides that are nitro-aromatic compounds as well, making them potentially useful as environmental sensors.\nThe technology has already drawn commercial and military interest, according to Strano. For the sensor to become practical for widespread use, it would have to be coupled with a commercially available concentrator that would bring any molecules floating in the air into contact with the carbon nanotubes.\nUK firm Inscentinel is also making use of bees’ ability to detect explosives but using live insects as part of a security device.","Label-free and in-solution measurement of protein-ion interactions\nClemens Entzian, Thomas Schubert\n2bind GmbH, Regensburg, Germany\nMicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is an optical fluorescent method. It records the changes in fluorescence of a target molecule as a function of temperature and the concentration of the cognate ligand molecule. Thus, in MST, the target must be fluorescent and the ligand must not be fluorescent in the same wavelength range as the target. The fluorescence changes are the result of two effects:\nFirst, molecules exhibit directed movement along temperature gradients in solution, an effect called thermophoresis (Duhr & Braun, 2006). Such thermophoretic movement of a molecule is characterized by its size (hydrodynamic radius), its surface charge, and its hydration shell. All three parameters can be affected by binding of a ligand molecule. Thus, a concentration-dependent titration of the target molecule’s ligand induces changes in the thermophoretic movement. These changes translate in quantifiable, spatial fluorescence changes, which are easily tracked optically via the target fluorescence.\nSecond, fluorescence is a function of the temperature. Thus, the fluorescence of the target molecule varies with the temperature (Baaske et al., 2010). This temperature-dependence is additionally affected by the local molecular surroundings of the fluorophore. Thus, binding of a ligand molecule to the fluorescent target can change the chemical environment of the target fluorophore and thus the overall detected temperature-dependence of the fluorescence. This effect is known as TRIC (temperature-related intensity change; Gupta, Duhr & Baaske, 2018).\nThe thermophoresis and TRIC signals are additive and thus both contribute to the high sensitivity and robustness of MST measurements towards molecular binding events of all kinds. Thus, MST can be used for determining the affinity and binding strength of almost any kind of molecular interaction with very low sample consumption and very high sensitivity.\nFigure 1. Technical MST setup. (A) MST measurements take place in small glass capillaries. Infrared and fluorescence lasers are used for generation of the MST effect and sample tracking. (B) TRIC and thermophoresis together account for a time-dependent change in fluorescence upon infrared-heating of the sample capillaries. (C) Multiple MST traces are recorded for different mixture ratios of target and ligand molecules. (D) Dose-response analysis of the MST traces allows for determination of the steady-state affinity of the target-ligand interaction.\nIntroduction: Interactions between proteins and small ions\nA great number of enzymatic reactions are dependent on cofactor-binding. However, an analysis of the interaction between enzymes and their cofactors in detail is challenging. Often, it is complicated to access the basic binding parameters such as the affinity of ions using the state-of-the-art biophysical methods. Here, we demonstrate how MST can be used to test the ion-dependence of a target enzyme.\nMicrococcal nuclease (MNase) is a Ca2+-dependent endo-exonuclease of Staphylococcus aureus and a virulence factor in multiple models of infection (Kiedrowski et al., 2014). Given the ion-dependence of the MNase, we developed an MST assay to test the binding of different mono- and divalent ions to MNase. As the ions do not display any fluorescence, it was possible to perform a truly label-free, in solution MST assay by using the MNase tryptophan fluorescence for MST detection (“label-free” assay).\nResults: Ion binding to S. aureus MNase\nAs expected from its Ca2+-dependence, MNase showed a strong preference towards divalent cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ with KD-values in the low millimolar concentration range (KD: 3.6 ± 0.9 mM, 9.9 ± 5.4 mM, 0.9 ± 0.4 mM and 0.2 ± 0.1 mM). In contrast, no interaction of MNase and Na+ was detectable (Figure 2). This assay highlights not only the potential of MST to study membrane-associated proteins but also to detect binding of very small ions to large proteins; a task that is not feasible with most other biophysical methods (or requires much more effort).\nFigure 2: MST binding isotherms of MNase and various mono- and divalent ions. Data are the mean and standard deviation of two independent experiments and are fitted to a KD‑binding model under a 1:1 binding situation.\nConclusion: 2bind MST assays for measuring binding of ions to proteins\nMST assays are very versatile, because they can easily accommodate different buffers, detergents, as well as target and ligand types (proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions). Here, we successfully established an MST assay that allows an analysis of the binding affinity of enzymes and their ionic cofactors in a fast and precise way.\nSince MST features a very low sample consumption (only 6 µl per sample is required, with concentrations of fluorescent target down to 0.5 nM), a wide molecular size range (100 Da- 1 MDa), a very short analysis time, and the strongpoint that measurements require no target immobilization, MST should be your method of choice for studying challenging targets such as membrane proteins. Moreover, MST works with virtually every available detergent, which can be important for solubilization of membrane proteins.\nClick here for a full list of services for protein interaction analysis.

{"question":"How does Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) affect the body, and what are its genetic characteristics?","answer":"BMD is a genetic disease that causes muscle cells to die, resulting in muscles becoming weak, small, and deformed. It is caused by problems with genes and chromosomes. The condition can affect walking, swallowing, and breathing abilities, and may also cause learning or thinking problems. It usually starts in the legs before progressing to other muscles.","context":["This material must not be used for commercial purposes, or in any hospital or medical facility. Failure to comply may result in legal action.\nBecker Muscular Dystrophy\nWHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:\n- Becker muscular dystrophy (DIS-trah-fee) or BMD, is a genetic disease affecting different groups of muscles in the body. A genetic disease is one that you are born with and you may have inherited from your family. BMD causes muscle cells to die, and results in the muscle becoming weak, small, and deformed. BMD is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), except that it develops at a much slower rate. BMD usually starts in the legs and then moves to other muscles. Like DMD, BMD usually occurs in young boys and is rarely found in girls.\n- BMD is caused by problems with genes and chromosomes. Genes are little pieces of information that tell your body what to do or what to make. Chromosomes are like packages that hold all the genes. With BMD, you could have trouble walking, swallowing, and breathing. You may also have learning or thinking problems.\n- Tests to diagnose BMD may include blood tests, muscle biopsy, electromyogram, and magnetic resonance imaging of the muscles. There is no treatment for the weakness and wasting of the muscles. You may have other therapies, such as physical therapy, to improve your quality of life. Ask your caregiver for more information about these tests and therapies.\nAFTER YOU LEAVE:\nTake your medicine as directed.\nCall your primary healthcare provider if you think your medicine is not helping or if you have side effects. Tell him if you are allergic to any medicine. Keep a list of the medicines, vitamins, and herbs you take. Include the amounts, and when and why you take them. Bring the list or the pill bottles to follow-up visits. Carry your medicine list with you in case of an emergency.\n- You may be taking steroids to improve your energy and strength. This medicine may help a lot but may also have side effects. Make sure you understand why you need steroids. Do not stop taking this medicine without your caregivers OK. Stopping on your own can cause problems.\nAsk for information about where and when to go for follow-up visits:\nFor continuing care, treatments, or home services, ask for more information.\nYou and your family will learn about genetic or inherited diseases. This information may help you and your family make important decisions, such as planning a family.\nYou may need to wear braces on your legs, wrists or neck. Braces will help to keep you in the right position. The braces will also give support so you will be more balanced and not fall when walking. Braces may help you to continue walking longer and delay the start of scoliosis. Scoliosis is when your spine bends in the wrong places. It happens because your muscles are not strong enough to hold the bones of your spine in place.\nYou may feel short of breath when you are active. The following are breathing exercises that may help you breathe more easily:\n- Breathe out with pursed or puckered lips (like playing the trumpet).\n- Breathe using your diaphragm. Put one hand on your abdomen and breathe in, causing your hand to move outward or upward. Your lungs will have more room to get bigger and to take in more air.\nOccupational therapy (OT) uses work, self-care, and other normal daily activities to help you function better in your daily life. OT helps you develop skills to improve your ability to bathe, dress, cook, eat, and drive. You may learn to use special tools to help you with your daily activities. You may also learn new ways to keep your home or workplace safe.\nCaregivers at a pain clinic may help you learn new ways to control your pain. You may learn relaxation or special breathing exercises to help decrease your pain. Caregivers at the clinic will help you find ways to decrease your pain that may work for you.\nYou may need to see a physical therapist to teach you special exercises. These exercises help improve movement and decrease pain. Physical therapy can also help improve strength and decrease your risk for loss of function.\n- Hydrotherapy is a gentle water exercise program. It may strengthen muscles that are not damaged by BMD. Your physical therapist may encourage you to try hydrotherapy.\n- Gentle body massages and stretching may help keep you from getting contractures. A contracture is a shortened muscle that may make it hard to walk or to use your hands.\nYou may feel safer if you use a 4 prong (pointed) cane or a walker when walking. To keep from falling, remove loose carpeting from the floor. Using chairs with side arms and hard cushions will make it easier to get up or out of a chair. Put grab bars on the walls beside toilets and inside showers and bathtubs. These will help you get up after using the toilet or after bathing. Grab bars will also help to keep you from falling in the shower. You may want to put a shower chair inside the shower.\nFor support and more information:\nBecker muscular dystrophy is a life-changing disease for you and your family. Accepting that you or a family member has BMD is hard. You and those close to you may feel angry, depressed, or frightened. These are normal feelings. Talk to your caregivers, family, or friends about your feelings.You may also want to join a muscular dystrophy support group. This is a group of people who have BMD.

{"question":"How does the history of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre house's relocation compare with King Kong's impact on cinema during the Great Depression?","answer":"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre house, originally built in 1909, was relocated 61 miles west to Kingsland, Texas in 1998, where it was cut into seven pieces and carefully reassembled as the Grand Central Cafe. Similarly transformative, King Kong made a massive impact during the Great Depression when it was released in 1933, generating approximately $2 million during its initial run despite ticket prices being less than 50 cents, and helped RKO turn a profit for the first time in its 5-year history. Both properties have maintained their cultural significance - the house embraces its film heritage through memorabilia displays, while King Kong was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry and ranked #41 on AFI's list of greatest American films.","context":["The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released into theaters on October 1st, 1974. Filming locations include Bastrop, Hutto, Leander and Round Rock, Tx. Filming started on July 15th, 1973 and lasted for thirty-two days. There's not a whole lot to say regarding this masterpiece that hasn't already been said or covered somewhere else prior. There are the documentaries The Shocking Truth and Flesh Wounds as well as numerous books that include The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Companion, Devil's Advocates The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Chain Saw Confidential and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and It's Terrifying Times.\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre has always been my favorite horror movie 1-A, with The Exorcist being 1-B. The very first horror convention I ever attended was the 2004 Cinema Wasteland in Strongsville, Ohio. That Texas Chainsaw Massacre 30th anniversary reunion was quite possibly the largest gathering of Chainsaw alum ever assembled. In attendance was Roger Bartlett, Bob Burns, Marilyn Burns, Allen Danziger, Gunnar Hansen, Ed Neal, Paul Partain and Lou Perryman. Needless to say, I was starstruck. Sadly however, on May 31st of that same year, only two months later, Bob Burns would pass away. And roughly seven months after Bob's death, Paul Partain passed away as well, on January 28th, 2005.\nThe chainsaw model wielded by Leatherface was a Poulan 306a and it weighed roughly thirteen pounds. The generator (air cooled engine) that Pam and Kirk are drawn to was a Wisconsin brand, which was the state Ed Gein, the influence for the Leatherface character was from. Probably a complete coincidence but interesting nonetheless. The films distressing score was composed by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell. Among instruments used were a stand-up bass, a five-string Kay upright double bass, a Fender lap steel guitar, an African instrument with attached tambourines, a pitchfork and children's musical toys like cymbals, xylophones and shakers. The total score length is fifteen minutes. Songs used in the film include Fool for a Blonde by Roger Bartlett, Daddy's Sick Again & Misty Hours of Daylight by Arkey Blue, Waco & Glad Hand by Timberline Rose and Feria de las Flores & Poco a Poco No by Los Cyclones. The films first DVD release was on October 6th, 1998.\nThe cemetery - 400 N. Bagdad Rd. Leander, Tx. 78641\nThe cemetery opened in 1857. When faced with the burial of his three year old son John L. Babcock, Charles Babcock donated one acre of land as burial ground. Eight years later Col. Charles C. Mason, the first postmaster of Bagdad died and was buried in close proximity to John. Not only is Mason's monument among the tallest in the cemetery, but it would later go on to serve as the opening for one of the most famous and influential horror films ever made. It's the rear of the monument that's shown in the opening scene of the film, sitting about ten feet behind the false monument made for the movie in which the rotted corpse was postured atop of. In the scene where the van first pulls up to the cemetery, there are three men slowly approaching it. The man in the middle, wearing the white wife beater and cowboy hat, is none other than John Dugan, the 20 year old actor who also played the 113 year old grandpa in the film. There have been more than 3,500 burials at the cemetery since it first opened.\nAll \"Now\" pictures taken in 2018.\nThe gate to the main entrance of Bagdad Cemetery.\nThe reverse (front) side of the large monument shown in the opening scene and 2nd ever burial at the cemetery.\nThe grave stone of the first ever burial at Bagdad Cemetery in 1857.\nHitchhiker gets picked up - Across the street from* 101 Farm to Market Rd. 685 Hutto, Tx. 78634\nThere were two things that helped me find this location. The first was a tip from Paul Partain to fellow Chainsaw fan Tim Harden where he pointed out that most of the driving scenes near the beginning of the film were shot along highway 685. The second was a deleted scene that first appeared on the 40th anniversary collector's edition blu-ray. The scene showed an angle of the location that hadn't been shown prior, where you can see a small distinct building down the road in the background. I was able to match the building in question in a vintage aerial image. The small building was removed at some point during the early 90's. Hutto High School, which was built in 1999, now sits across the street from where the van picked up the hitchhiker.\nAll \"Now\" pictures taken in 2018.\nGas station - 1073 Texas 304 Bastrop, Tx. 78602\nSince it's appearance in the film, the gas station has had a few different names over the years that include Hills Prairie Grocery and Bilbo's Texas Landmark. In 2016 the name was again changed, this time to The Gas Station. It now sells horror movie memorabilia and BBQ, as well as rents cabins that are located just behind the building. The original Gulf sign that used to be there, as seen in the film, is now located at Dick's Classic Car Museum located in San Marcos, Tx. Aside from the Gulf sign, they have a plethora of antique automobile's that date all the way back to 1911 and I recommend checking it out if you find yourself in the area.\nAll \"Now\" pictures taken in 2018.\nAn honorary memorial that was first unveiled at the Cult Classic Convention in Bastrop in September 2018.\nThe interior of The Gas Station.\nGrandparents house - Hester's Crossing Rd. and Country Road 172 Round Rock, Tx. 78681\nAlthough it was made to appear quite a distance from the family house in the film, in actuality they were almost directly across the street from one another. The mostly limestone house was erected in the late 1800's. Built by William S. Thompson who lived there until his death in 1903. In 1909 the house and property were purchased by William Quick. He married Sally Stark and they had five children (Emma, Marie, Edith, Edward and Erik) while living there. Erik would later go on to have a daughter named Norma. It was Norma's former room in the house that was shown with the animal print wallpaper when Sally talks about her fascination with the zebra's. The house sat unoccupied for sometime before burning down in the last 70's. The pile of limestone as well as the porch foundation were still there when I visited the site in January of 2001. In 2002 construction began on Texas State Highway 45 and today the exact spot where the house once stood at is now where TSH-45 now lies.\nThe house in it's earlier days.\nAs seen in the film.\nFamily house - 1010 King Ct. Kingsland, Tx. 78639\n(Grand Central Cafe)\nThe house was designed by architect George Franklin Barber. The rooms feature twelve foot ceilings, ornate wood moldings and a curved entry hall along the central staircase. Barber published a monthly magazine in the late 1800's called American Homes, which also promoted his original house plans that he sold through his publication. He had hundreds of house plans available which ranged from one bedroom homes to more elaborate three story houses. There were actually three of these nearly identical houses built in Round Rock at the beginning of the 20th century. One is the house seen in the film, the second remains a mystery and the third was located just down the road from the house in the film and was also known as the Burkland-Frisk house, as it was built by Leonard Frisk and later owned by Tony Burkland. The house still stands today and is currently a dentist office, located just up the interstate in Georgetown. Back to the Texas Chainsaw house, it was built in 1909 for the Thompson family, the previous occupants of the grandparents house used in the film that was located just across the street. It was then purchased in the early 40's by Robert and Nina Sellstrom. In 1949, their daughter Betty even had her wedding reception at the house. In 1971 they sold the house and the surrounding one-hundred plus acres to Celia Nueman who rented the property out. The first tenants were Stuart and Rebecca Isgur. During the filming of the movie in 1973, Stuart's brother Ron was the only resident staying in the house. The filmmakers found the house through the softball team Ron was playing on because Bob Burns, the art director of the film, had a commercial art company that sponsored the team that season. The house would continue to be leased out off and on through the years. In 1998 the house was purchased by Dennis and Barbara Thomas, cut into seven pieces and moved 61 miles west to Kingsland, Texas where it became part of the Antlers Inn resort. It was then reassembled and restored to it's original condition by carpenter Anthony Mayfield. Since then it's been called The Kingsland Old Town Grill and The Four Bears Restaurant but is now known as The Grand Central Cafe. Not only does the place have outstanding food but it completely embraces it's Chainsaw past. While exploring the house you'll come across pictures, posters, shirts, new paper articles and other Texas Chainsaw Massacre artifacts. Also, the staff couldn't possibly be more accommodating to fans of the movie. I highly recommend The Grand Central Cafe, not only to Chainsaw buffs but anyone else who may be looking for somewhere with great food and the atmosphere to match.\nAll \"Now\" pictures taken in 2018.\nThe entrance to The Grand Central Cafe.\nMyself having breakfast in the chicken and bones room from the film.\nA comparison picture of the family house (top) and the Burkland-Frisk house (bottom) as they appear today.\nOriginal family house location and ending - Hester's Crossing Rd. and Country Rd. 172 Round Rock Tx. 78681\nKnown as Quick Hill for former resident and land owner William Quick. Country Road 172 once ran directly over the hill, right in between the family house and the grandparents house from the film. Then in the early 90's the new Country Road 172 was built just to the west of the hill turning the original into Old Country Road 172. Not long after, Old Country Road 172 was gated off and inaccessible to the public. And finally in 2002, construction for Texas State Highway 45 started and it cut directly through the center of Old Country Road 172, dangerously close the the 89 year standing spot of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre family house...which had been moved four year prior. The portion of road shown at the end of the movie where Sally escapes and Leatherface does his infamous chainsaw dance is still there. The very first movie location I ever visited was Quick Hill, on January 1st, 2001. I was moving cross country from Kentucky to California and I had everything I owned stuffed into my car but I decided to roll the dice and venture about 300 miles off course anyway. This was before GPS was widely available and even though I'd never been to the Austin area before I had very little trouble locating the spot, thanks to the reliable directions provided by www.texaschainsawmassacre.net. I remember it vividly. I was a sunny day, unusually warm for early January. As I made my way up the gated off road I examined the surroundings and with each step what I was seeing resembled more and more what I had seen on the screen so many times. This was only a couple years after the family house had been moved and almost all of the other structures were still there, albeit they'd certainly seen better days. One of the sheds was filled to it's ceiling with what looked to be mostly junk. I was pretty sure that most of that \"junk\" were things removed from the house prior to it being moved just a couple year earlier and if I had ANY room in my car I probably would've taken some if it as mementos. Also still there during my visit were the remains of the grandparents house, just across the street. While it had burned down in the late 70's, all of the limestone from it was still there, just sitting in a big pile. The porch foundation was also still visible. I was able to take two souvenirs that day, although very small one's. One was a chunk of the limestone from the grandparents house and the other was a small piece of cement that had broken off from the steps of the family house. I still have both of them to this day. I must've stayed on that hill for about two hours that day exploring and just taking it all in and I didn't see another person up there the whole time. It was so worth the near 300 mile detour and a day I'll never forget. Since then I've visited the location another half dozen times, each time seeing it get smaller and smaller. In 2013, the Camden La Frontera apartments were built near the bottom of the north side of Quick Hill, intruding upon the hill even more. For years there has been a large billboard on the south side of the property facing Texas State Hwy. 45 reading \"For Lease\" and to be honest I'm not quite sure why the remaining land on Quick Hill still hasn't been developed. All Chainsaw fans can do is cross their fingers and hope it stays that way.\nAn aerial shot of Quick Hill taken with my drone (2018).","In 1933, four years after the legendary stock market crash of 1929, America was in the middle of the Great Depression. Unemployment stood at 25%. More than 5,000 banks had failed. It was the year the Dust Bowl began, the times of “The Grapes of Wrath”. An estimated two million people were homeless… migrating across the United States in search of a way to sustain themselves. Soup lines stretched around the blocks.\nContrary to the popular myth, the movies were not ‘Depression-Proof’. They suffered a steep decline along with the rest of the economy. Ticket sales had soared after the 1927 introduction of “talkies” but peaked at 90 million tickets a week in 1930. By 1933, that number had declined by more than a third, to 50 million. Combined with the rollback in ticket prices, 1933 still marks the lowest year at the box office post 1929.\nBut that year, the country (and the world) would be given something to get excited over at the cinema. Something the likes of which audiences had never seen.\n“King Kong” co-directors Ernest B. Schoedsack (left) and Merian C. Cooper (right).\n“King Kong” was the brainchild of director/producer Merian C. Cooper. As a child, he received a book about Africa, and it filled his imagination with wonder about the fearsome creature called the Gorilla. It made him want to be an explorer when he grew up.\nHe got his wish when he and his partner Ernest B. Schoedsack traveled to Africa to shoot footage for their 1929 picture, “The Four Feathers”. It was there, while observing baboons in the wild that Cooper conceived of creating a movie about a gigantic primate squaring off against modern technology, with a “Beauty and the Beast” theme running through it. Cooper had a friend who worked for the Museum of Modern History in New York City, and who had brought two Komodo dragons to the zoo (unsuccessfully). Cooper began to imagine a giant ape being taken captive and brought to the city to be displayed…\nWith the story forming, Cooper pitched the idea to legendary film producer David O. Selznick. Selznick, who was at Paramount at the time, wasn’t interested. The depression was already underway, and the potential cost of location shoots were prohibitive. “Kong”, for the moment, was dead in the water.\nHowever, in 1931, when Selznick became the head of RKO pictures, he brought Cooper with him as his executive assistant. As part of the deal, Cooper had the freedom to make his own films. He began with “The Most Dangerous Game”, which required a giant jungle set being built. It also starred future Kong stars Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray. His friend and film partner (and future “Kong” co-director) Ernest Schoedsack was directing.\nAs part of his duties at RKO, Cooper was asked to evaluate a project whose budget had spun out of control, a film called “Creation”. “Creation” was the story of a group of shipwrecked people who discover dinosaurs on the island that they’re marooned on. Cooper had to recommend the production be scrapped (it was), but while he was analyzing the project, he watched several scenes of dinosaurs they had created using stop motion animation. “Kong”, which had initially been envisioned using footage of real animals, suddenly seemed a possibility again.\nStop motion wasn’t a new technology, “King Kong” was not the first to employ it.\nThe animation lead on “Creation” was Willis O’Brien… one of the pioneers of stop motion. By the time he worked on “Kong”, he had extensive stop motion experience.\nPrior to doing stop motion animation, O’Brien worked as both a sculptor and a cartoonist. He began experimenting with stop motion as a way of bringing sculptures to life. Thomas Edison (who was involved in film production and distribution in the early years of cinema) bought a film from him in 1917 entitled “The Dinosaur and the Missing Link” and also ordered a series of stop motion comedy shorts. In 1925 O’Brien and his crew did the dinosaur filled film “The Lost World”, based on the novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nIt’s a technique that was widely used throughout the rest of the century, and is still occasionally used today (“Frankenweenie”, “ParaNorman”, 2012).\nNow that he had the method for creating his ape, and the jungle set from “The Most Dangerous Game”, Cooper realized he could make “Kong” much more affordably than when he first pitched it. He proposed creating two test scenes for the film to his RKO superiors. If successful, he’d roll them right into the movie to avoid wasting money. The RKO board approved going ahead with the test reels after seeing some production sketches.\nAfter the RKO board approved the production of a test reel, four Kong models were built. Two were jointed 18-inch aluminum covered with foam rubber, latex, and rabbit fur. One was a 24-inch model for the New York scenes, and a small model to take the fall off of the model of the Empire-State-Building. Kong’s facial features were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his expressions were controlled by wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During production the rubber skin would dry out quickly under the lights, making it necessary to replace it frequently and rebuild his facial features. This contributed to inconsistencies in Kong’s look throughout the film.\nThe dinosaurs were made in the same fashion as Kong. Several of the models were originally built for “Creation”.\nA “life-sized” bust of Kong’s head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin. It had 10-inch fangs and 12-inch eyeballs. In order to the control the mouth and facial expressions, it was filled with metal levers, hinges, and an air compressor. Three men were required to operate it. It needed bust to be moved from set to set on a flatcar. Two oversized hands were also made, and one giant foot.\nTwo scenes were shot. Kong shaking the sailors off the log and fighting the Allosaurus in the cave.\nThe RKO board was impressed. “Kong” was a go.\nRKO screenwriter and best-selling British mystery/adventure writer Edgar Wallace was hired to do the script, but died shortly after submitting the first draft. James A. Creelman, who worked for them on “The Most Dangerous Game” was brought in to complete the job, but his work was dissatisfactory. Eventually, Schoedsack’s wife Ruth Rose was called in to finish the script. She and Schoedsack had actually fallen in love on board a boat on an expedition, just like Darrow and Driscoll. She tightened things up and added some biographical touches to appeal to the directors, and the script was ready to go.\nFor the cast, Cooper and Schoedsack had a couple of their stars in-house already. Fay Wray was at the top of her game. In fact, she starred in 11 movies that year. Her love interest in the film, John Driscoll, was played by Bruce Cabot, an unknown at the time who started in pictures just a few years prior. Robert Armstrong (Denham) was an RKO contract player, and, like Wray, had starred for Cooper and Schoedsack in “The Most Dangerous Game”.\nBut in order to film the effects needed, “Kong” needed to utilize every effect in the book and invent some new ones.\nThe camera would be set up with a matte painting of jungle trees and vines, etc on glass in foreground. Then the miniature set, with layers of model trees and vines, where they miniatures would be posed, and finally, another matte at the back. In took an enormous commitment with the miniatures in order to get the film made. A single minute of film contains 1,440 frames of film. It’s estimated they could do 10 frames an hour, which would work out to just under 150 hours of work just to get 1 minute of film.\nBreakthroughs in composite photography were required, including an optical printer where they could stack different layers of filmed scenes. They also utilized rear screen projection… which wasn’t a new technology. In rear screen projection, a film is projected on a screen behind the actors, as the scene is shot, enabling a merging of special effects and live action elements. They also invented a front projection technology that could project a miniature film, one frame at a time, onto the miniature set as the stop motion work was being done, syncing the filmed elements to the stop motion puppetry.\nWillis O’Brien actually patented the devices he invented for King Kong under the name of “Apparatus for Producing Motion Pictures”.\nIn the story, an ambitious film producer, Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) brings an expedition crew and an unknown actress (Ann Darrow, played by Fay Wray) to an uncharted island in hopes of filming a native legend, the mysterious Kong. When they arrive at Skull Island, the natives are in the midst of a sacrificial ceremony, where they give one of their women over to be a bride for Kong. Spotting Ann, however, they wish to offer her (and her blonde hair and fair skin) to Kong instead. The crew refuses of course, but the islanders sneak out to the boat and kidnap her.\nShe then finds herself bound to stakes as an offering to the gigantic ape, Kong. Kong takes her into the woods, pursued by the crew of the boat, who have now discovered Ann missing. Kong protects Ann from several different prehistoric beasts, most famously from a T-Rex. Throughout that process, he develops an affection for her.\nAnd so, when captured and brought back to New York, the giant ape’s motivation is to capture Darrow and keep her safe. He breaks free from his bonds and follows her through the city, eventually grabbing her and leading her to the highest point he can find: The Empire State Building. It’s there that he’s attacked by bi-planes in a scene that has now become movie legend. Shot and bleeding, the giant beast eventually slumps and loses his grip, plummeting to his death on the city streets below.\nThe story of the modern watch of Kong isn’t how much the effects have aged, but in how well they’ve held up. The film was made 80 years ago, but the modern viewer can still watch, suspend their disbelief, and lose themselves in the movie.\nThe acting and the script don’t fare quite as well, admittedly. The misogynistic captain Driscoll chides Ann Darrow just for being a woman, then suddenly has a change of heart for no apparent reason and confesses his love for her. Denham is acted with the subtlety of a carnival barker, regardless of what the scene is. Kong gets a little rapey with Ann at one point. In fact, there are a number of moments that may surprise the modern, politically correct viewer.\nBut it’s still an incredible piece of movie history. A fascinating watch. It’s a fantastic adventure story, with the timeless beauty and the beast element running through it and an overarching theme of the modern society exploiting the natural world and primitive culture. And if nothing else, when you watch Kong and realize that he’s the great, great grandfather of all special effects, it’s impossible not to be impressed.\nThe studio closely guarded the special effects secrets. They even went so far as to disseminate misinformation, including the fact that Kong was actually a man in a suit. They didn’t want the fact that the towering Kong was in fact a puppet less than two feet tall.\nThey needn’t have worried. During its initial run, “King Kong” made an estimated $2 million, an enormous success, especially considering that the tickets were less than 50 cents and there was a depression on. The film turned a profit of $645,000. RKO turned a profit for the first time in its then 5 year history. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive, as well.\nIt didn’t receive a single Oscar nomination, though in fairness there wasn’t a visual effects category until 1938. However, time has remembered it fondly. “Kong” has become a film legend, and is cited today as one of the most classic films of all time.\nWhen AFI released their list of the top 100 American films of all time, “King Kong” placed at #43. Ten years later it stayed strong at #41 on the tenth anniversary edition. In 1991, the film was deemed “culturally, historically and aesthetically significant” by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n“King Kong” is one of the high water marks in early cinema, and has proved its endurance by still holding a place in pop culture 80 years after its release. It’s an important film to see in order to solidify ones knowledge of film history and pop culture, and still a very entertaining movie even after all this time.\nIt’s definitely a “Movie That Everyone Should See“."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1cc9574a-b922-47bb-8f46-7e87dd6fe665>","<urn:uuid:f2710449-e9b0-412c-bee6-ff47722829d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What dance and movement techniques are emphasized at Rose of Athens Theatre versus the Mark Morris Dance Group?","answer":"Rose of Athens Theatre emphasizes highly choreographed fight scenes, dance prologues, and languid romantic dances, working with choreographers like Mirla Criste and Jennifer Adams to create theatrical movement pieces like the dance in Macbeth and disco party in Winnie the Pooh. The Mark Morris Dance Group, on the other hand, focuses on ballet-influenced modern dance techniques, with emphasis on proper posture, spatial patterns, group coordination, and specific technical elements like proper plié form and arm positioning - as described by dancer Stacy Martorana who had to retrain her movement style to achieve the company's signature 'soft but strong' quality.","context":["Rose of Athens Theatre creates vibrant professional theatre that inspires audiences and transforms communities.\n* * * *\nRose of Athens Theatre creates live performances that endeavor to speak to the entire community.

Rune and Tread,which was the first piece Merce saw me do as a RUG. Changing Steps. A lot of that we started with in the first couple rehearsals. And Fast Dance.\nTime Out New York: Did you have much contact with him during that period?\nStacy Martorana: In class, the only thing I remember him ever telling me was a note that I would get a couple times: to bend my back knee in attitude more. [Laughs] I remember being introduced to him as a RUG. He knew me from class, but Tim Ward—who I was hired with—and I had to almost be presented to him. That was one of the few interactions as a RUG. And I do remember him coaching us on Tread, and saying, “Make the fast parts faster; make the slow parts slower.” One other thing I remember was Merce coaching us in Rune. When we stand in relevé in parallel and pick our leg up fast and lower it slowly multiple times in battement, he said how he wanted it to go up more quickly and go down more slowly, which of course makes it more challenging.\nTime Out New York: What was that time like for you since you knew that Merce was fading?\nStacy Martorana: I didn’t expect it to happen that soon. I didn’t really know much about his health. I knew it would happen, but I didn’t know it would be a month after. At that time though, I also was just so happy to have that job. What am I trying to say? I was so excited to have that job and to start learning the work and working with the company members. My only experience as a RUG was him basically not being around. So I didn’t know much about the other experience. I heard a lot about it; I got a taste of it. But my experience as a RUG was getting a lot of feedback from the company members, them coaching us a lot. After Merce was gone they fortunately took it upon themselves to help us and teach us, and of course we had coaching from Robert. But it was also that when the company was away on tour, we were on our own. We would sometimes have former company members like Banu [Ogan] and Carol come and coach us, but mainly we were working on our own, learning from videos, running things, doing outreach—a lot of outreach.\nTime Out New York: What were those final RUG performances like for you?\nStacy Martorana: I have really good memories. I mean I cried, of course. It was special for us. It was like our moment to shine, and we hadn’t had many performances really over the past two years. So six shows for us was a lot. And we were just there for each other. The four of us and the other dancers added into the show. It just felt like we’d been through this whole long thing together, and here was our celebration. It was so special to have that place full every night and to know that we, even as RUGs, were supported and that people wanted to see the work and pieces that the company wasn’t performing anymore. The most special piece I think for all four of us was Inventions. Robert kind of created that for us. [Inventions MinEvent] was our piece and only we did that and that felt so special. The company didn’t know it, which also made us own it. We could own it. We didn’t have to be worried about if this was right or that was. I mean we did, but not in terms of if other people knew it better than we did.\nTime Out New York: When you knew the end of the RUGs was nearing, were you thinking about Mark Morris?\nStacy Martorana: Yes, very much so. I started understudying L’Allegro [il Penseroso ed il Moderato] in April of 2011. I didn’t think it was possible. I didn’t think I could ever get a job here. It just seemed too big and like a dream come true. Like those things don’t happen, right? I was asked to understudy. It was on the plane ride home from L.A., where I had understudied L’Allegro, that Matthew [Rose] asked to get my number so that they would have me come in and take company class. So any chance I could, any chance they were in town, I was here for class and would go rehearse with the RUGs after. [Laughs] I was taking class here whenever they were in town and Mark was teaching.\nTime Out New York: Please tell me about that. Were you shocked?\nStacy Martorana: Yeah. By everything. [Laughs] It was hard to transition from taking ballet here to then doing Cunningham technique, but it was exciting. It was also kind of learning all over again how to move. It felt so foreign to me. It was like I couldn’t remember how to move my head in port de bras. I had to retrain. Cunningham is all about being on the spine and the one thing I always loved about ballet was épaulement, moving the head. I had to retrain myself to do that.\nTime Out New York: What kinds of corrections would you get from Mark?\nStacy Martorana: A lot about my arms. They were so used to being held. It’s hard to answer that question because there are so many things that have changed from his class in a positive way. In terms of safety, I pronate my feet like crazy—especially doing Cunningham with the big movements. He’s helped me with that. Finding more length in my body. I just always felt so tight and muscular.\nTime Out New York: You have to be soft in this company—soft but strong.\nStacy Martorana: Right. I feel like I’ve learned how to use the right muscles. And I’m still learning; I have to say, it’s the closest I’ve felt to feeling like I’m working like a ballet dancer, which is funny because it’s what I always wanted, but couldn’t find. And it’s hard to make the changes, but when you start to feel something change, it’s like, This is why I do it. This is why you stay a dancer. I mean I’m still working on a plié in first position. [Laughs] But that’s fine. Some days it’s frustrating, like, Shouldn’t I have this already? But it keeps you interested. There’s always something new to find.\nTime Out New York: What interested you about Mark’s work as a spectator?\nStacy Martorana: The dances are beautiful. The group work—I was definitely not used to even watching that kind of group work. The spatial patterns and the dancers—they’re gorgeous. I just remember thinking that they looked so at ease, but what they were doing was hard. It is hard. And what, of course, struck me was the musicality. Having spent so much time not working with music and ignoring it, and then seeing music, it was like something I’d never experienced before. And it’s so clear in his work. Big groups of people move as one, but they don’t all look the same. And they don’t all move exactly the same, but it’s a whole. And that’s so beautiful. And the movement: I stopped training to be a ballet dancer, but ballet moves, I like them. And to see modern dance works that have ballet vocabulary in them was beautiful. And they’re done in a different way.\nTime Out New York: What pieces were you first in?\nStacy Martorana: Well, my first show was L’Allegro as an apprentice. Oh my God![Laughs] That experience was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. It was the Kennedy Center. Wow. It was an amazing experience. I remember watching the finale, and it bringing tears to my eyes. And then to do it? The first night that curtain went down, I just lost it. The first rep piece I was in was Canonic 3/4 Studies, which I still do pretty often. It’s so funny, I remember thinking, After Cunningham, things will be so easy. They’re not. [Laughs] Man.\nTime Out New York: What has been a challenge?\nStacy Martorana: First of all, listening to music was hard. It was really hard to pay attention to what my body was doing, what everybody else was doing and hearing the music. I was very used to ignoring it.\nTime Out New York: Did you get yelled at a lot?\nStacy Martorana: Yeah. But it’s good for me. I mean I didn’t even notice at first that I was ignoring the music. [Laughs] And also at Cunningham, say you’re doing a pirouette and it’s not perfect, and you have to step into something else, but there’s no music to be on time for, so you get there eventually. Whereas here, it’s a beautiful challenge. Now I’m getting used to hearing different kinds of music and learning how to count for myself."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f200a733-7cc4-4631-9aa2-2648cfbf7836>","<urn:uuid:50f33133-7f75-40eb-9d78-4464130fadeb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do approaches to preventing greenwashing differ between European green bonds and voluntary carbon credit markets?","answer":"In European green bonds, greenwashing is prevented through strict requirements including verified transition plans for companies, processes to identify adverse impacts, and prohibition of issuers from EU-listed tax havens. For voluntary carbon credit markets, preventing greenwashing focuses on ensuring high-quality credits through initiatives like the Integrity Council on Voluntary Carbon Markets' Core Carbon Principles and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative's Claims Code of Practice, which guides companies on how to credibly use carbon credits without treating them as simple emission offsets.","context":["(Source: European Parliament)\n- Not only is a new label created but also rules for the green bonds market\n- Added requirements for companies wishing to issue European green bonds to weed out ‘brown companies’\n- Additional rules to strengthen supervision\n- Increased transparency to make it clear if bond proceeds will be used in gas or nuclear sectors\nMEPs seek to better regulate the green bond market, improve its supervision, reduce greenwashing, and add clarity when money goes to gas or nuclear.\nOn Monday, MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee adopted their negotiation position on the Regulation on European green bonds. The text, prepared by Paul Tang (S&D, NL), introduces numerous changes to the Commission’s proposal and was approved by 44 votes in favour, 12 against and 3 abstentions.\nThe amended proposal seeks to better regulate the entire green bond market, rather than only establishing the European Green Bond label (EuGB), and reduce so-called “green washing”.\nFor all bonds that are marketed as green, transparency requirements are introduced, including being aligned with the taxonomy legislation on the use of proceeds derived from the bond issuance. This would allow investors to compare EUGBs with other existing green bonds. In addition, all those issuing green bonds must have safeguards in place to ensure they do not harm people or planet.\nNew requirements on benefitting entities\nTo avoid ‘brown’ companies (i.e. with highly polluting industries) using the EuGB label to pretend to be greener than they really are, the amended proposal requires that all EuGBs have verified transition plans. The text also ensures that all issuers of green bonds have processes in place to identify and limit the principal adverse impacts of their activity. Finally, it prohibits all issuers from countries that are on the EU’s grey or blacklist of tax havens from issuing EuGBs.\nSupervision is strengthened in various ways. External reviewers who review the EuGB should have fewer conflicts of interest and provisions are included to ensure that the authorities could ban companies from issuing EUGBs if they fail to follow the rules. The adopted text also ensures stronger market-pressure to comply with the rules by ensuring investors have legal recourse if the issuer’s failure to comply leads to the depreciation of a green bond.\nIncreased transparency for gas and nuclear\nThe adopted text requires stronger transparency requirements so that when a green bond issuer intends to allocate proceeds to nuclear energy or fossil gas related activities, a statement must appear prominently on the first page of the EuGB Factsheet.\nAfter the vote, the rapporteur Paul Tang (S&D, NL) said, “Parliament is giving a clear signal before negotiations with Council. The European Green Bond Standard needs to be fully aligned with the EU taxonomy for it to become the gold standard in the international green bond market. And with transition plans, we put European Green Bonds at the heart of companies’ transitions to a sustainable economy. We are serious about ending greenwashing. When this regulation becomes law, simply saying your firm’s bond is green will no longer be good enough.”\nThe committee also voted to proceed with negotiations with the member states to hammer out a deal. These talks will begin in the coming weeks.\nGreen bonds play an increasingly important role in financing assets needed for the low-carbon transition. However, there is no uniform green bond standard within the EU. The new European Green Bond Standard aims to ensure that European companies can benefit from green financing and that investors will find the green investments they wish.","Opening Statement of Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero: The CFTC’s Role with Voluntary Carbon Credit Markets\nSecond Convening on Voluntary Carbon Markets\nJuly 19, 2023\nRemarks as prepared for delivery\nGood morning and thank you all for joining us at the CFTC’s second convening on voluntary carbon markets. I want to thank Chairman Benham for his continued priority of climate issues and for working with me to promote resilience to climate risk.\nUnderstanding and monitoring climate risk is a critical role for the CFTC, as the physical impacts of climate change pose serious risks to commodities markets and climate change poses systemic risk to the financial system, as the physical. I have met with farmers and producers, reviewed United States Department of Agriculture and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports, as well as seen and heard many examples of the impacts that severe climate events have on those markets. Last year, farmers and ranchers experienced $21 billion in total crop & rangeland losses, mostly s drought and wildfire. 2023 is shaping up to be a year of heavy climate impacts with two-thirds of the U.S. corn production area experiencing drought and harvested winter wheat substantially down as the season progresses. This naturally serves as a risk for derivatives markets.\nOnce we know the risk, we can plan for it. We can manage around it. We can use every tool at our disposal as an opportunity to manage risk and promote climate resilience. In the end, managing risk is what derivatives markets are all about.\nI have heard a lot from farmers and producers about their contributions to climate resilience. In many ways, they are the originals of sustainability. Longstanding practices like conservation tillage or no-till, planting cover crops, and prescribed grazing can all help improve a farm or ranch’s resilience to climate-related disasters, and remove carbon from the atmosphere. This is especially important because 40% of natural disaster damage is uninsured in the United States. The US Department of Agriculture announced plans to invest almost $3 billion in 70 projects under its Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding program, which could result in more than 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide sequestered.\nSome market participants see potential in voluntary carbon credit markets as another opportunity to manage climate-related risk. There are currently carbon credit futures products trading on CFTC-regulated exchanges. This puts the CFTC in a unique position.\nThere is much interest in spot voluntary carbon credit markets over which the CFTC has antifraud jurisdiction. Despite predictions that carbon credits may grow from a $2 billion to a $50 billion market, research by Bloomberg found that corporations used 4% fewer credits in 2022.\nThe spot voluntary carbon credit markets continue to face challenges. I look forward to hearing today about some of the challenges to these markets. I also look forward to hearing about possible solutions.\nWell-designed markets help deliver liquidity and price transparency, while managing risk, when participants are confident they have credible information about the product. One of the biggest challenges in spot voluntary carbon markets is fragmentation that prevents market confidence. There are different registries and standard setters, and much of the market happens in opaque over the counter transactions. A lack of transparency through consistent, comparable data with an agreed-upon taxonomy can present challenges to proper functioning of markets, including price discovery.\nThe recent slowdown in markets may reflect concerns over a lack of transparency and trust. Those interested in participating in the markets want to be assured that they are purchasing high quality credits. Some companies have pivoted away from carbon markets entirely out of concerns that using carbon credits leaves them open to accusations of greenwashing.\nThe market should signal through pricing those carbon credits that are high quality, compared with credits reflecting projects that do not achieve the requisite level of carbon reduction or are temporary. However, there is insufficient price transparency given the fragmentation and lack of trust in the market. According to a May 2023 report by the World Bank, the price of carbon credits has fallen to under $5 per ton for most categories, except credits for carbon removal which trade at approximately $15 per ton. It attributes this drop, in part, to a “least common denominator” effect, where high-quality projects cannot be distinguished from lower-quality efforts of the same type.\nEfforts by voluntary bodies like the Integrity Council on Voluntary Carbon Markets (“ICVCM”) are an important and welcome attempt to create a common understanding of a high-quality carbon credit. The ICVCM has released Core Carbon Principles but has not yet finalized an assessment framework for identifying credits “that create real, additional and verifiable climate impact with high environmental and social integrity.” I have had the fortune of spending time discussing this work with Annette Nazareth of the ICVCM, who was an SEC Commissioner when I worked at the SEC and who is a participant today.\nBuyers of carbon credits are also becoming clearer about how they will use credits in order to avoid accusations of greenwashing. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative (“VCMI”), announced at the COP26 global climate convening, has developed a Claims Code of Practice to guide companies on how “they can credibly make voluntary use of carbon credits as part of their near-term emissions reduction objectives, and long-term net zero commitments.” One key element of that code is encouraging companies to stop treating carbon credits as “offsetting” their emissions and instead to frame them as a contribution above and beyond what they are doing to decarbonize their own business.\nThe Role of the CFTC\nFirst and foremost, our role is to regulate U.S. derivatives markets. The Commission should work with exchanges and market participants to ensure the integrity of derivatives markets and promote responsible innovation in environmental products. A few weeks ago, I met with both CME and ICE to discuss their voluntary carbon credit derivative products, the markets, market demand, and the issues that surround these markets. These conversations build on my proposal earlier this year that the CFTC work with exchanges on listing standards through guidance related to environmental products. These standards would be designed to guide exchanges in fulfilling the Commodity Exchange Act core principles. The guidance could involve looking at the standards developed by the ICVCM and the VCMI and other due diligence.\nAdditionally, in March at ISDA’s ESG conference, I proposed that the Commission follow a similar oversight and approach to environmental products as those adopted for digital assets. This would include education including related to the qualities of a high-quality carbon credit, asserting our anti-fraud legal authority, including in spot carbon credit markets, increasing intelligence in the market, robust enforcement, and government-wide and international coordination. And to continue mirroring the approach the Commission has taken to digital assets, I proposed that the Commission adopt a heightened review framework of any self-certified environmental products that are listed on exchanges, including those related to carbon credits, just as it did with derivatives on digital assets.\nI continue to believe that bringing more of this market onto exchanges would increase transparency and bring greater confidence to the market, including related to pricing. Additionally, listing standards in the derivatives markets could prove an example for how the spot market might consider changing.\nSecond, we have antifraud authority over spot markets. In June, the Commission took an important step forward in promoting the integrity of spot voluntary carbon markets by announcing an Environmental Fraud Task Force. I had advocated for this task force and I appreciate Chairman Behnam’s leadership and working with me to launch the task force. I appreciate the Director of Enforcement who has worked closely with me and my office to launch the task force, and develop strategies to ensure the task force’s success. We are working on sourcing cases, and an important source are whistleblower tips, as we have recently announced.

{"question":"How do traditional seafood supply chains work, and what new sustainable mariculture technologies are being developed for the future?","answer":"Traditional seafood supply chains require establishing consistent, transparent, and traceable relationships with trusted suppliers to ensure sustainable sourcing and prevent issues like inferior quality, inadequate traceability, and mislabeled products. Looking to the future, companies like Kampachi Farms are developing new sustainable mariculture technologies, including deepwater mooring and farmsite automation capabilities for open-ocean aquaculture. They successfully conducted the first-ever trial of open-ocean aquaculture in U.S. Federal Waters with the Velella Project and are working on reducing reliance on wild-caught fishmeal by developing alternative feeds using American-grown agricultural products. These innovations aim to address the $10 billion domestic seafood trade deficit while maintaining responsible and sustainable practices.","context":["Quality, Sustainable Seafood Gets Consumers’ Attention\nLearn why sustainable seafood, including a traceable supply chain, is important to the planet, consumers, and you. It’s more than just “doing the right thing.” It’s an intelligent business strategy.\nSeafood sustainability is a hot-button issue for the food service industry—and for a growing number of consumers, particularly Millennials and members of Generation Z. For many operators, helping to protect the planet and its food supply is the right thing to do. And as guests become increasingly interested in where their food comes from, being able to communicate a commitment to serving sustainable fish and shellfish is becoming more important from a business perspective.\nFor more information on sustainable seafood, see below.\nThe question of what species and sources of fish and shellfish are sustainable can be complex. A number of wild species have been overfished. Not all methods of aquaculture are created equal, especially with respect to issues like environmental pollution and product safety (such as the use of antibiotics in farm-raised fish). And climate change is having a significant impact on the situation.\nJob one is establishing a consistent, transparent, and traceable supply chain for seafood. All vendor relationships are important, but they’re particularly vital when it comes to fish and shellfish. Trusted suppliers represent the best route to the most sustainable sources, and are a first-line defense against inferior quality or freshness, inadequate traceability, and mislabeled product.\nShrimp, salmon, and tuna may be the most popular seafood species in the United States, according to the National Fisheries Institute (NFI), but they’re not the only fish in the sea. In fact, given that the NFI’s Top 10 list accounts for more than 90% of the fish and shellfish consumed in this country, taking a good look at other types will not only help promote sustainability, it will also create variety.\nMany delicious fish varieties are inelegantly called trash fish because they’re bycatch from more popular target fisheries and are actually discarded by fishermen. Sustainability-minded chefs have been instrumental in serving these and other lesser-known species—like squid, black cod (a.k.a. sablefish), mackerel, mussels, Atlantic pollock, and redfish—and educating consumers about their appeal.\nSome of these underutilized species have challenging names, like the spiny dogfish, which is actually a small, abundant species of shark. But with its mild flavor and firm yet tender white flesh, it’s a prime candidate for a familiar menu such as fish tacos. Other species, such as sardines, have a relatively strong flavor and oily texture that’s best introduced in an appetizer or a sauce for pasta.\nSeeking out appealing recipes and training staff to hand-sell less familiar seafood species can go a long way toward introducing customers to new fish specialties. Remember that squid was once a comparatively unknown and intimidating ingredient that is now widely popular, menued as fried calamari with a flavorful dipping sauce.\nSteps to Seafood Sustainability\nAdopt sustainability as a core value\n- Know what species and sources are most sustainable\n- Understand the origins, practices, and quality behind your selections\nKnow and trust your suppliers\n- Research and maintain good relationships with suppliers\n- Ask questions of your suppliers\n- Make sure the seafood you purchase meets your sustainability and traceability requirements\n- Certified seafood is widely considered to be better than product without independent third-party assessment; operators can leverage their adherence to standards by calling it out on menu copy\n- Be engaged, and comment while certification organizations are revising their standards\nThe information provided is based on a general industry overview, and is not specific to your business operation. Each business is unique and decisions related to your business should be made after consultation with appropriate experts.\nAdvisory lists like the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch and the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide are a good starting point for information on seafood that’s fished or farmed in ways that have less impact on the environment. Seafood Watch’s Eco-Certification link can help with sources for farm-raised fish or shellfish.","Sustainable Fisheries & Aquaculture\nThe oceans provide a significant amount of protein to the human diet.

This site will allow efficient, scalable, commercial production of high-value sashimi-grade Kampachi in close proximity to the product’s primary markets.\nKampachi Farms remains committed to advancing the cause of safe, responsible and sustainable mariculture in the U.S.A. Having sucessfully conducted the first-ever trial of open-ocean aquaculture in U.S. Federal Waters with the Velella Project, Kampachi Farms aims to further develop offshore technologies that will facilitate the expansion of responsible mariculture in the U.S. and globally, such as deepwater mooring and farmsite automation capabilities. Ongoing research into alternative feeds is focused on reducing mariculture’s reliance on wild-caught fishmeal and fish oil, replacing them with more sustainable American-grown agricultural products.\nThe Kampachi Farms team firmly believes in the necessity of developing a safe, responsible, and sustinable mariculture industry as an alternative to rampant overfishing and a $10 Billion domestic seafood trade deficit. By employing a combination of industry experience and innovation, Kampachi Farms will show the world that it is possible to responsibly grow delicious, healthy, high quality fish in the open ocean — right where they belong.\nFlies as Fish Food\nDrew is an ardent capitalist but is also very conscious of the state of the planet and the crisis humanity is facing. He believes that capitalism has been a large contributor to the world’s problems but for the same reason, it also has the power to contribute to a significant part of the solution. Drew doesn’t just talk, he walks the talk. Drew’s various enterprises are ingenuous – they are based on ideas so simple that you wish you would have thought of.\nTake his company, the inconspicious sounding AgriProtein, whose name gives no indication of the unique product it is producing.\nCurrently, the industrial farming of chickens, pigs and fish all rely on protein sourced from land-based soy plantations and marine fishmeal. Drew says: “Plant-based proteins are less effective in feeds than fishmeal, and are increasingly expensive to produce as they consume large quantities of land, water and diesel in their production. While 30% of all marine caught fish (facing rapidly declining stock levels) is used in animal feed preparations – with aquaculture operations typically requiring up to 2kg of marine-caught fish to produce 1kg of farmed fish – of which we eat only 25%.”\nDrew wondered if there were a more sustainable solution and the answer he came up was “yes”. Fly larvae are a natural food of chickens in the wild and fish in streams. Their nutritional composition is as good as that of fishmeal and better than Soya. As a natural food it has excellent take on and digestability properties. Drew hit upon the idea of growing maggots and processing them into food for fish and chickens. The fact that most excited Drew was the fact that a single female fly will lay 750 eggs in under a week, which will hatch into larvae which grow in weight over 400 times in just a few days. In effect, fly larvae are amongst natures most efficient protein producers.\nUsing fly larvae fed on abundant waste nutrient sources, AgriProtein has developed and tested a new large scale and sustainable source of protein based upon principles of cradle-to-cradle and bimimicry design. The bioconversion process, takes ‘free’ waste materials, and generates a valuable commodity.\nAt public talks, Drew tells the story of Ghengis Khan to illustrate the ancient knowledge of the value of flies. Khan, the warrior who conquered many lands in Asia recognized the value of fly larvae for the treatment of battle wounds. Fly larvae secrete a biological agent that is amongst the most effective sterilizing agents known. Larvae secrete this substance to keep their competitors, bacteria at bay and have more food for itself. Ghengis Khan recognized this and towed a buggy of rotting maggot-infested meat into battle. When his soldiers were wounded, maggots were placed on the wound and it would consume the dead flesh, leaving the live flesh to heal.\n“These current protein sources are limited and the increasing demand for animal feed and their exploitation has devastating effects on the environment.” says Drew. AgriProtein is based on a typical biomimcry approach which solves mutliple problems at once. It uses existing abattoir waste products to feed fly eggs as they grow into larvae, which are then harvested and dried into AgriProtein’s product called Magmeal.\nAgriProtein’s pilot plant and machinery, located in Stellebosch, South Africa are modular in design enabling plants to be built to suit each location. Each production line can produce up to ten tonnes of larvae protein per day.\nDrew says that “Magmeal has an equivalent nutritional composition to fishmeal and better than soy. Magmeal contains nine essential amino acids with higher cystine and similar levels of lysine, methonine, threonine and tryptophane as marine fishmeal,” AgriProtein is getting many interested inquiries from all around the world."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bf705aa3-6423-4d93-ba89-1f768f973e2e>","<urn:uuid:b3ed2769-229e-462d-ac97-3d638a5c11c6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When using a silver reflector as a main light source, what potential issue should photographers be aware of?","answer":"When using a silver reflector as a main light source, photographers should be aware that it will more closely mimic direct sunlight, which may cause the subject to squint. This can be managed by positioning the reflector further away and to the side of the subject.","context":["Reflectors are a great tool, especially in natural light portrait photography. When shooting in natural light, you often have to learn how to work with and modify the light you have in a particular situation, as opposed to a studio lighting scenario, where you are in complete control from the start. Many photographers struggle with reflectors because they are not using them properly. Some are using the wrong color for the lighting scenario they are in. Others are not using the reflector in the right position.\nA photographer needs to decide the reason for using the reflector, and what type of light they are trying to emulate. There are few different types of lighting in portrait photography- main light, fill light, and back light (rim light), and hair light. A reflector can be used to simulate any one of these types of light. The two most common uses for a reflector are for the main light or for fill light. Let’s talk about how to use a reflector in these two instances.\nUsing a reflector as a main light:\nSome examples of a main light would be the sun, or a studio strobe. When using a reflector as a main light source, here is where many photographers go wrong. Think about this: where is a main light usually positioned? It is generally positioned above the portrait subject, such as where the sun would be most of the day. An incorrect use of a reflector as a main light source would be to position it below the portrait subject’s face, reflecting the light up. This method produces an unnatural effect for portrait photography, although it could be used to produce an interesting effect, if that is what you are looking for. The correct use would be to hold the reflector above the portrait subject’s head, mimicking the natural direction of the sun. In using a 5-in-1 reflector, a silver or white reflector would work well as a main light. Keep in mind that a silver reflector will more closely mimic direct sunlight, possibly causing the subject to squint.\nBelow are some examples of a reflector being used as a main light. The bright sun was behind the portrait subjects acting as a hair light and rim light. The reflector was supported by a chair for some of the images (thankfully, it wasn’t a windy day!), and is positioned evenly with the portrait subject. The reflector was silver, so having the reflector further away and to the side helped a little with squinting. For more tips on avoiding squinting go here.\nAnother issue with having the reflector in the wrong position is that it will not only produce unnatural shadows, but also unnatural catchlights in the eyes. In my opinion, catchlights in the lower part of the eyes only look alright as long as there is a catchlight in the upper part of the eyes also.\nOne scenario when you may use the reflector as a main light, but positioned low, would be to imitate the light of a rising or setting sun. You could use a gold reflector, held even with, or slightly below the subject’s face to help produce a golden light.\nUsing a reflector as a fill light:\nThe main purpose of fill light is to fill in shadows, and help even out the lighting. In my opinion, a fill light could be placed high or low, depending on the intensity of the light, and the desired result. In a situation where your main light is overcast sky, or directional light, such as under a porch, you may want to position your reflector below or even with the subject’s face. With brighter main light, you could also position the reflector higher mimic a double main light.\nBelow are some examples of a reflector used for fill light. For the first few images, a silver reflector was used. The setting sun was behind the portrait subjects, acting as a hair light. The main light was open sky in front of and above the portrait subjects.\nFor the next two images, a large translucent diffuser (scrim) was used to reflect the bright sun back at the portrait subject. A bonus of having a scrim is being able to also use it as a white reflector. Check out this post for more on using a scrim.\nFor the last two example images, a reflector was used to bring in some fill light under the portrait subject’s hat. Only one studio strobe was used. The main light was upper left, with the reflector positioned lower right."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3796f917-6e5e-4abc-9ac6-a6b6c465a184>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I've read about UCP3 in muscle tissue and its role in trauma patients. What are its primary functions in normal metabolism, and how does it contribute to post-trauma complications?","answer":"UCP3 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle where it protects mitochondria against lipid-induced oxidative stress and enables the export of fatty acids from mitochondria when fatty acid supplies exceed oxidation capacity. Regarding trauma complications, when severe tissue injury occurs, cellular breakdown leads to the release of mitochondrial components containing UCP3, which become part of the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These DAMPs then trigger systemic inflammation by binding to neutrophil receptors, contributing to multiple inflammatory processes including cytokine production, leukocyte chemotaxis, and ultimately leading to remote organ injury and immunosuppression in trauma patients.","context":["Use your antibodies-online credentials, if available.\nNo Products on your Comparison List.\nYour basket is empty.\nFind out more\nMitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP).

While early mortality is mainly due to overwhelming hemorrhage and catastrophic central nervous system injuries, later deaths are triggered by multi-organ failure and healthcare-acquired infections. Even if early deaths were reduced with road safety and pre-hospital care improvements, multi-organ failure and healthcare-acquired infections remain a serious burden for severe trauma patients. Indeed, 45% of patients admitted to a Level 1 Trauma Center develop multi-organ failure and infection remains the leading cause of death after trauma.\nIt is now thought that the innate immune system plays a key role in both trauma-induced remote organ failure and in trauma-induced immunosuppression. Indeed, according to the danger theory, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are massively released following severe musculoskeletal injury, which then bind to various receptors on the surface of neutrophils and elicit widespread systemic inflammation. For instance, mitochondrial DNA and formyl peptide are released after cellular breakdown, bind Toll-like receptor 9 and formyl peptide receptors on the surface of neutrophils and trigger multiple inflammatory processes, such as transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, leukocyte chemotaxis and cytokine production. DAMPs are numerous and emerge from multiple intracellular compartments: cytoplasm (S100 proteins, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, uric acid), nucleus (free nuclear DNA, high mobility group box 1, histones), and mitochondria (mitochondrial transcription factor A, mitochondrial DNA and formyl peptides). Mitochondrial DAMPs are particularly relevant since they show evolutionarily conserved similarities to bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).\nMany indices converge on a close association between injury severity and the amount of DAMPs released. Upon DAMPs binding, activated neutrophils propagate inflammation and mediate cell injury essentially in the lungs by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps, which contain elastases, histones and proteases. In the systemic circulation, mitochondrial DAMPs also bind formyl peptide receptors on smooth muscle cells and subsequently induce vascular hyporesponsiveness. Endothelial permeability is also increased through both neutrophil-dependent and neutrophil-independent pathways. In the lungs, increased permeability, lung congestion and direct epithelial damage promote lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. At the same time, DAMPs profoundly reduce innate and acquired immune responses. For instance, leukocyte HLA-DR gene expression and ex-vivo stimulated cytokine production negatively correlate with plasma levels of nuclear DAMPs released in human plasma after severe trauma.\nAccurate characterization of DAMPs release and their consequences after trauma has broad clinical applications since it could entail an individualized approach for both preventive and curative therapeutic strategies. For instance, the determination of the DAMP load and the inflammatory status of the patient could tailor the timing of definitive surgical treatment. Moreover, synthetic formyl peptide antagonists and TLR9 inhibitors are already available for clinical use and could dampen both the pro-inflammatory and the anti-inflammatory responses after trauma.\nIn this Research Topic, we aim to shed light on DAMPs and the role they play in the interactive crosstalk between musculoskeletal trauma, remote organ injury and immunosuppression.

They propose shifting from an obsolete “ego-system” that focuses entirely on individual well-being to an ecosystem that emphasizes the well-being of the whole. In this excerpt, they focus on a key element of this change: learning how to see ourselves through the eyes of others and of the whole.\nOne of the biggest challenges we face in moving toward an ecosystem economy is to act collectively in ways that are intentional, effective, and cocreative. Over the past several years, I (Otto) have watched executives participate in a climate change simulation game at MIT, designed and led by MIT Professor John Sterman. He splits the group into small teams, with each team representing a key country group in the ongoing United Nations-sponsored negotiations over carbon emissions. The negotiators’ agreements are fed into a simulation model using actual climate data. After the model calculates the likely climate change outcomes, the negotiators go back to the table for a second round. After three or four rounds, they are presented with what is inevitably the devastating and destabilizing impact of their collective decisions on the climate worldwide. Then the group reflects on what they have learned.\nThree Obstacles: Denial, Cynicism & Depression\nDuring their post-negotiation reflection session, I noted that the participants had three habitual reactions of avoidance that prevented the consequences of their actions from sinking in deeply: (1) denial, (2) cynicism, and (3) depression. The most common strategy for reality avoidance is denial. We keep ourselves so busy with “urgent” issues that we don’t have time to focus on the one that may in fact be the most pressing. We are simply too busy rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. The second response is cynicism. Once the outcomes of an agreement become obvious, cynicism is an easy way out. A cynical person creates distance between himself and the consequences of his actions by saying, “Hey, the world is going to hell anyway; it doesn’t really matter what I do.”\nBut even if these first two strategies of reality avoidance are dealt with, there still is a third one waiting: depression. Depression denies us the power to collectively shift reality to a different way of operating. Depression creates a disconnect between self and Self on the level of the will—just as cynicism creates a disconnect on the level of the heart and denial creates a disconnect on the level of the mind. And into that void slips doubt, anger, and fear. Fear inhibits us from letting go of what is familiar, even when we know it doesn’t work and is holding us back.\nConversations Create the World\nLearning how to deal with these three types of reality avoidance requires self-reflection and a conversation that bends the beam of attention back onto ourselves. We call this Conversation 4.0—a conversation that allows for embracing the collective shadow…and for unleashing our untapped reserves of creativity.\nThe main problem today is that we try to solve complex problems like climate change with traditional types of conversation, which results in predictable outcomes. The collapse of the climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 and of the MIT climate simulation game are just two of many, many examples.\nAll complex modern systems—health, education, energy, sustainability—deal with both individual and collective entities, the latter often through government. Accordingly, the figure “Four Levels of Stakeholder Communication in Economic Systems,” which shows how stakeholders communicate within our society’s systems, differentiates between individual and collective entities on the one hand, and suppliers and consumers on the other hand. The four levels of conversation are represented by four rings.\n- unilateral and linear;\n- low on inclusion and transparency; and\n- organized by an intention to serve the well-being of the few.\nAt the center are the rarest and most precious types of conversation, which offer a major acupuncture point for future change. They are:\n- multilateral and cyclical;\n- high on inclusion and transparency; and\n- organized by an intention to serve the well-being of all.\nLevel 1: Unilateral, One-Way Downloading & Manipulating\nLevel 1 stakeholder communication is unilateral, one-way downloading with the intent to manipulate, rather than to serve the well-being of, the other side. Most of what we call corporate or professional communication strategy in business and election campaigns is organized this way. Market research segments citizen and consumer communities into specific target groups that are bombarded with customized messaging and communication strategies. The flood of commercials that hits consumers and citizens every day is mind-boggling. According to a survey in 1993, the average child in the United States sees 20,000 commercials per year. The average 65-year-old in the United States has seen two million commercials.\nOne-way communication focuses on “selling,” on making the target buy something or vote in a particular way. But the target has no opportunity to talk back. Lobbyists and special-interest groups operate the same way. Their influence often is based on privileged access and excluding other relevant parties from the conversation.\nLevel 2: Bilateral, Two-Way Discussions & Exchange of Viewpoints\nLevel 2 stakeholder communication is a bilateral, two-way discussion with the intent to provide and receive information, and includes a response or feedback mechanism. In markets, the buyer talks back with her money. In democratic elections, the voter talks back by casting her vote. Both are excellent examples of two-way communication.d\nLevel 3: Multilateral Stakeholder Dialogue: Seeing Oneself Through the Eyes of Another\nLevel 3 stakeholder communication is a multilateral conversation characterized by reflection, learning, and dialogue. Dialogue is a conversation in which you see yourself through the eyes of another—and in the context of the whole. The examples are manifold, from roundtables and “world cafes” to interactive social media. The conversations need a form, a process, and a holding space to operate well. Some companies, like Natura, Nike, and Unilever, have internalized level 3 communication to their benefit.\nFor example, Eosta, an international distributor of organic fresh fruit and vegetables in the Netherlands, and also one of the first companies to be climate-neutral and use compostable packaging, wants its customers to see the “invisible” processes behind its products. A three-digit code on each of its products leads the consumer through the Eosta website to the producer. For example, the code 565 on a mango leads to Mr. Zongo in Burkina Faso, who then responds to the consumer comments online on his wall. This mechanism is an excellent example of level 3 communication because it allows consumers to see themselves in the context of the whole value chain.\nExamples of multilateral stakeholder communication also include town hall meetings in New England, where citizens discuss local issues, and UN efforts such as the Framework Conventions on Climate Change. To work well, these stakeholder communications require enabling technologies and facilitation.\nIn the end, all of these approaches deliver the same result: They help stakeholders in a system to see themselves in the context of the other stakeholders and the larger whole. They bend the beam of attention in ways that help these distributed communities to see themselves as part of a bigger picture.\nLevel 4: Cocreative Ecosystem Innovation: Blurring the Boundary of Ego & Eco\nLevel 4 stakeholder communication is a multilateral, collectively creative ecosystem conversation that helps diverse groups of players to cosense and cocreate the future by transforming awareness from ego to eco. Examples include transformative multistakeholder processes like the World Commission on Dams and the Sustainable Food Lab.The outcomes of these processes deliver not only astonishing breakthrough results, but also a shift in mindset and consciousness from ego-system awareness to ecosystem awareness—from a mindset that values one’s own well-being to a mindset that also values the well-being of one’s partners and of the whole.\nAlthough there are some inspiring examples of level 4 innovations, it is quite clear where the main leverage points are today for shifting the system to a better way of operating:\n- We need to get rid of the toxic layer of level 1 communication (bribery, soft money, commercials, and other forms of propaganda and manipulation that keep intoxicating the communication channels of our society today).\n- And we need to develop new spheres of level 4 cocreative stakeholder relationships, in which partners in an ecosystem can come together to cosense, prototype, and cocreate the future of their ecosystem.","EXTREME WEATHER AND CLIMATE CHANGE: HOW CAN WE ADDRESS UNCERTAINTY?\nCook Campus Center\nCo-sponsored by Climate and Environmental Change Initiative\nKatrina.

{"question":"How do data centers maintain security for their stored sensitive data?","answer":"Data centers maintain security through multiple measures: They implement constant monitoring, CCTV surveillance, and biometric identification. Security includes both virtual and physical components. For physical security, data centers are located in areas with very low risk of natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes. The locations are often specially designed for data center use, with taller ceilings than conventional structures to accommodate racks and overhead equipment. Additionally, well-maintained data centers must provide customers with a backup geo-diverse redundant data center facility in case the primary operations point experiences an unexpected outage.","context":["The infrastructure that supports the internet. It is made up of a huge variety of hardware and related devices. Let’s discuss the computing and non-computing resources that are essential components of data center .\nWhat Is Data Center Infrastructure?\nThe physical components found inside a data center make up the infrastructure of a data center.Essentially, the IT hardware and supporting hardware, like cooling and air quality systems can be categorized as data center physical infrastructure.\nThe majority of people are familiar with the servers and data storage components that make up data center IT architecture, but there are other important non-computing components.\nData Center Facility Infrastructure Is More Than IT\nData center components for electricity and cooling are equally important to operations as IT-related technologies.\nMaintaining uptime in a data center requires reliable power. The majority of data centers even include some kind of power failover and backup supply of electricity. Data centers typically connect to the local electrical grid.\nAdditionally, the physical processes of data center operations frequently generate a lot of heat. Data centers must have cooling systems to control the temperature and humidity. There are other fire suppression technologies available in the unlikely event that cooling systems have a critical failure.\nWhat Is Data Center Infrastructure Management?\nData center infrastructure management (DCIM) is a solution that mixes IT and Data Center Ops and may be used to achieve the best possible performance from a data center. Data center operations managers may better manage the physical components of the data center by using DCIM’s discovery, monitoring, reporting, and visualization tools.\nThird party maintenance, like AKCP Monitoring Solutions can all be used in part or in full to maintain the infrastructure of a data center.\nTypes of Data Center Components\nAs we’ve established, core components of a data center are both the environmental infrastructure and the data center IT infrastructure.\nStorage Infrastructure Data Center Components\nStorage infrastructure includes things like network connected storage (NAS), directly attached storage (DAS), solid state drive (SSD) flash arrays, tape storage, etc. Manufacturers of storage devices include HPE, Dell EMC, NetApp, and IBM.\nServer Infrastructure Data Center Components\nRack, blade, and tower servers that are utilized to store data and applications are referred to as server infrastructure. Servers can also be fully virtualized environments inside of actual machines, but since they are not physical infrastructure, they are not included in the data center components discussed in this article.\nNetwork Infrastructure Data Center Components\nHardware like routers, switches, security devices, and firewalls make up network infrastructure. The connection and integration of the various data center hardware systems depend on these data center assets. Cisco, Brocade, Juniper, F5 Networks, and other well-known names are just a few.\nList of Major Components A Data Center\nThe majority of analysts view power as the data centers’ holy grail. This is necessary since many hosting services and computer systems require a steady and dependable power source.\nFor high uptime and guaranteed server performance, every data center needs a backup or redundant power supply in addition to the primary source. It couldn’t ever operate at peak efficiency without a consistent power source.\nBecause of this, data centers pay close attention to the power source and take steps to ensure that it is never disrupted.\nThe cooling system for a data center is almost as crucial as the power supply.\nIt must be able to support the operation of the computer system, colocation servers, and networking hardware without causing any of them to overheat.\nThe information technology (IT) equipment in a data center can soon become hot if there aren’t adequate ventilation systems, cold or hot corridors, and raised floors. That would harm not only the system but also the data center’s ability to operate. All trustworthy data centers set up a suitable cooling system to keep the hardware system cool and the operations running smoothly.\nSecurity is the final aspect that must be there for a data center to run smoothly.\nSensitive data is stored on all of the servers and hardware in data centers. Well-maintained data centers employ constant monitoring, CCTV surveillance, biometric identification, and other security procedures to keep them safe.\nData center security includes both a virtual and a physical component. Choosing a location for data centers that have a very low risk of natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes is important for physical security.\nThe majority of the time, the locations where data centers are located are created particularly for that use. As a result, their ceilings may be taller than those of conventional structures. This is due to the necessity for more height for racks and overhead equipment. A data center may occasionally occupy just one level of a typical structure.\nFor IT operations, data storage, and application development, every data center must have the necessary hardware and software. These could consist of servers, storage devices, network hardware including switches and routers, and firewalls among other information security components.\nAs you can see from the foregoing, a data center must possess dependability and high uptime.\nThe data center’s fail-safe procedures for all of the data kept there are an important additional feature. This implies that every host of a data center must maintain and run a backup data center where all data is copied and kept. In case the primary point of operations has an unanticipated outage, datacenter providers must provide customers with a backup geo-diverse redundant data center facility.\nThere must be a place to store all of a data center’s data. Computing units, data storage units like solid-state drives and hard disk drives, and other gear are responsible for this.\nIn order to make the best use of the facility’s space, racks are then built and mounted with the hardware. Typically, they extend all the way to the ceiling, leaving just enough space for cooling, circulation, and overhead cable systems.\nMost data centers use the same strategies they use with power sources when it comes to being online. This indicates that several fiber connections to various internet service providers are frequently present in a single data center.\nMaking sure that the operations continue to function even if one of the internet providers goes down is the ultimate goal, just like with power. Always keep in mind that the data center’s dependability, safety, and scalability are paramount.\nThe capacity of data centers to scale and expand in response to changing market demands is another crucial characteristic.\nColocation and dedicated server purchases are long-term investments. It must be able to adapt as your needs change as a long-term investment as your business grows. All data center providers must give customers the space they need to expand.\nTypes of Data Center Facilities\nThe evolution of data center infrastructure has caused the growth and classification of several different types of data center facilities.\n- Enterprise Data Center Facilities\nThese are conventionally set up buildings that are solely owned and run by one company. These are often on-site, and an internal team is in charge of network monitoring, hardware upgrades, IT deployments, and maintenance.\n- Colocation Data Centers\nThese include communal data centers where a company can lease space for servers and other technology. The advantage of colocation over internal data centers is that the colocation facility handles the building, power, HVAC, internet bandwidth, and physical security; you (the customer), however, are still responsible for providing and maintaining the gear.\n- Managed Data Center\nA corporation leases the physical infrastructure of a managed service data center, while a third-party managed service provider looks after the facilities and equipment. For more information about ParkView, our complete offering of managed services for the infrastructure of data centers, get in touch with Park Place Technologies right away.\n- Cloud Data Center\nOver the past few years, this kind of data center building has grown in popularity. A cloud data center is an off-premises location that your business may access over the internet, but you are not liable for the infrastructure’s upkeep.\nImprove Efficiency With AKCP Monitoring Solutions\nWhen it comes to future-proofing your data center, it makes sense to keep the leading provider of digital infrastructure support in your corner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:06a45e3b-b325-4c34-8519-62fff2a0c8a9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was the experience of both Australian and German soldiers as they entered Greece in 1941?","answer":"The Australian soldiers and German forces had markedly different entries into Greece. The Australians arrived in March-April 1941 to a warm welcome, with crowds throwing flowers and cheering as they passed through. They found the Greek environment familiar, with its white light, sun, and eucalyptus trees reminding them of home. They enjoyed local hospitality, visited the Parthenon, and sampled Greek beverages in tavernas. In contrast, the German forces entered Greece as invaders on April 6, 1941, through military action. German Stuka dive bombers conducted bombing raids on Greek cities, and their ground forces advanced with tanks and artillery, moving through captured territory and meeting resistance from Greek and Allied forces. The Germans had to overcome various military obstacles including muddy roads, cratered pathways, and RAF fighter attacks.","context":["A PIECE OF AUSTRALIA\nThe AIF arrives in Greece, March–April 1941\nThey find themselves in a country that might be a piece of Australia towed across the world. The Greek spring with its white and piercing light, its floods of sun, its clean sharp water and, above all its exiled eucalypts, is closer to home than anything they have seen since they left Fremantle. 23\nAs the troopship MV Cameronia headed across the Mediterranean for Piraeus in April 1941, the men of the 2/6th Battalion AIF were briefed by Captain ‘Bully’ Hayes on the nature of the country they were going to defend. In the words of Lieutenant Jo Gullet, Hayes had read the available ‘literature and did his manful best’:\nThey [the Greeks, were not], as most of us might have thought, exclusively engaged in the fish and chip business. They had a splendid military tradition and they were currently belting the hell out of the Italians, but in times past they had also thrashed the Turks and also the Persians. The Turks were only next door, but how the hell they came to be fighting the Persians he could not say … They had other claims to our respect. Greeks it appeared were very strong on culture. They had invented democracy f’instance and the Olympic Games too … Soon you would see their wonderful old buildings. The Parthenon f’instance. Something to do with their religion. A sort of church. Damn near two and a half thousand years old, so we must expect it to be in a rather clapped-out condition, or so the sailors said. Well, that’s government departments for you. Same in Greece as anywhere else … There was no point in asking him any questions because we now knew as much about Greece as he did himself. We believed him. 24\nAs the 2/6th left the Cameronia, their commanding officer, Colonel Hugh Wrigley, determined that his unit would not straggle in a rag-tag fashion through foreign streets towards its camp. They were inspected, fallen in properly and with the battalion band playing Waltzing Matilda, they marched through Athens, as ‘Jo’ Gullet recalled, ‘not a little pleased with ourselves’.\nIn Greece the Australians were made to feel welcome and at home. It was spring and as units either marched or drove through the streets to their camp at Dafni, crowds waved and threw flowers into the road. On leave they had their pictures taken, visited the Parthenon and met the guardsmen of the crack Greek regiment – the Evzones. Kenneth Slessor felt that there was a ‘perceptible affinity’ between the men of the AIF, the ‘Argonauts of the southern world’, and the Athenians who were the ‘descendants of an age-old race whose monuments overshadow them’. Soon the city bars and cafes were crowded with Australians eating and drinking with Greek civilians and soldiers:\nIn all those places where the Australians meet Greek fighting-men straight from the front line, you see them clustered together, exchanging broken conversation. 25\nKeen interest was displayed in the local beer, wine and spirits. In a letter home Sergeant Robert Robertson, HQ 1st Australian Corps, provided a detailed account of what was readily available in the Athens tavernas:\nMuch time had been spent on the transport discussing what type of alcohol would be available and at what cost. But the results surpassed our wildest dreams. It was abundant, it was cheap. Beer brewed from the mountain streams was glorious and always served very cold at 18 dracma or 10 pence Australian the bottle. Koniak, a fierce form of brandy, could be bought at 50 dracmas the bottle or 2 drachs a nip. The same applied to ‘Ouzo’ … Proclamations posted in Athenian cafes stated that the sale of Ouzo was forbidden to members of His Britannic Majesty’s Forces … The plonk merchants were in heaven and the resultant effects were not in the interest of the army. 26\nThe Australian commander, Lieutenant General Blamey, met the King of Greece, George II, who spoke English fluently and with whom he sat chatting and smoking for 20 minutes:\nThe King [said Blamey] struck me as an easy and friendly man … eager and quick to respond and remarkably youthful in his manner. He … said how delighted he was to have the Australians in his country, since his dad had always admired them and had followed their deeds closely. 27\nBut beneath the initial colour and euphoria none could escape the fact that this was a nation at war. Athens was a city of women, children and old people, as most of the men of military age were at war in the mountains of Albania, and life was hard:\nEverything was grey and the people undernourished … casualty lists were read from the corners and it was touching to hear the women crying and screaming. 28\nDuring their brief interlude in Athens the men of the AIF were prepared for war. As Private Charles Robinson of the 2/2nd Field Ambulance recalled:\nIn the morning we were issued will forms and filled them out sprawling under the olive trees. No one could ever accuse the army of subtlety! 29\nSoon the Australians were hurrying north to meet the anticipated German invasion. They journeyed through a spectacular landscape of mountains and river plains with place names out of ancient history and legend – Thiva (Thebes), Mount Parnassus, Mount Olympus. Everywhere, as they moved through the countryside in railway wagons or in military vehicles, there was the same warm welcome:\nPeople lined the track cheering, smiling, and calling ‘goodbye’. Little did I realise the significance of this when a young despine (Greek girl) threw me a bunch of wild flowers, and with a wistful look in her eyes, called … goodbye! 30\nAs the 6th Australian Division’s fighting units began arriving at Piraeus from mid-March 1941, planning for the defence of Greece by the British force commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry ‘Jumbo’ Wilson, and the Greek commander, General Alexander Papagos, was well under way. It was clear that the initial German attack would be across the Greek–Bulgarian border in Thrace, but there was a real danger that German units would also strike through south-eastern Yugoslavia and then turn south and enter Greece via the Monastiri Gap and the Florina Valley. If the Greek and British forces were too far forward towards the Bulgarian border then they could be outflanked from the rear by this German movement through southern Yugoslavia. Consequently, it was decided that the British would hold a line from the sea through Mount Olympus, stretching north to Veria and then bending west towards Florina: the so-called Vermion–Olympus Line.\nOn Sunday, 6 April 1941, Lieutenant General Blamey learnt that from that day Lustre Force would be on its own. The Germans had attacked in Libya, driven the British back, and it would now be impossible for Wavell to send the 7th Australian Division or the Independent Polish Brigade to Greece. At 5.30 am on that same day in Athens, the German Ambassador, Prince Erbach-Schönburg, presented a note from his government to inform the Hellenic Government that Germany was at war with Greece. The Greeks were given no time for comment, for also at 5.30 am units of the German 12th Army moved into Greece across the Bulgarian border and into southern Yugoslavia.\nAs the German campaign in Greece opened, they dealt their enemies a severe blow. On the night of 6 April 1941, Able Seaman Patrick Bridges, RAN, was aboard HMS Hyacinth in Piraeus, Greece’s premier port and an essential link in the British supply line back to Egypt. He recorded the destruction of Piraeus by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in his diary:\nSunday April 6, 1941: Mass air attack here tonight. Hit 1 ship full of TNT, which burnt for 4 hours then blew up. A sheet of the ship’s side tore through our bridge and killed Lft Humphrey. Ship broke away from the jetty and we had to abandon it. We pulled it back and tied up and then run the gauntlet through blazing oil and burning ships and magnetic mines with only half a ship’s company.\nMonday April 7, 1941: Piraeus is still burning furiously. Sky is black with oil smoke and ammunition and dynamite is still exploding. Both our skiffs are holed. Bridge and boat deck are either wrecked or burnt. Great lumps of steel and shrapnel all over the deck. Drifting wreckage all over harbour. 1 plane came over to see damage … Waiting for raiders now. 31\nThe ‘ship full of TNT’ was the merchantman Clan Fraser, and the blast as it blew up was felt kilometres away throughout Athens. After the raid, which devastated Piraeus, only five of the port’s twelve berths were useable, dozens of small service craft had been destroyed, many skilled workers had been killed and many others quit their jobs.\nBy 9 April 1941, despite gallant resistance from the border forts on the Greek–Bulgarian border, Greek forces in the north-east were facing defeat. Hitler’s Panzers of the Second Armoured Division had swept round the western end of the Greek line near Lake Doirani and down the valley of the Axios River towards Thessaloniki, threatening to cut off Greece’s Eastern Macedonian Army. At 1.00 pm on 9 April, the Greek commander in eastern Macedonia capitulated. In southern Yugoslavia the German 40th Corps drove through the hapless Yugoslavs. The SS ‘Adolf Hitler’ Division now turned south towards Greece. Coming through the Monastiri Gap on 10 April, the division crossed into Greece and took Florina. At this stage, German progress was somewhat hampered by muddy roads that had also been cratered by British and Australian demolition units and repeated attacks by small numbers of RAF fighters and bombers. By 10 April, however, tanks of the German 9th Armoured Division and infantry of the ‘Adolf Hitler’ Division were pressing on towards Vevi and the Vevi Pass.\n23: Kenneth Slessor, official Australian correspondent, Athens, 30 March 1941 in Clement Semmler (ed), The war despatches of Kenneth Slessor, Queensland University Press, 1987, p. 140 (hereafter Slessor despatches)\n24: Henry ‘Jo’ Gullet, Not as a duty only – An infantryman’s war, Melbourne, 1976, pp. 40–41\n25: Slessor despatches, ‘Arrival in Greece’, Athens, 30 March 1941, p.140\n26: Letter, Sergeant RG Robertson, 19 May 1941, 2DRL/1304, AWM (hereafter Robertson letter)\n27: Slessor despatches, ‘Blamey and the King of Greece’, Athens, 1 April 1941, p. 141\n28: Bob Holt, quoted in Margaret Barter, Far above battle – The experience and memory of Australian soldiers in war, 1939–1945, Sydney, 1994, p. 83 (hereafter Barter, Far above Battle)\n29: Charles Robinson, Journey to captivity, Canberra, 1991, pp. 65–66 (hereafter Robinson, Journey to captivity)\n30: Sergeant Vic Hill, 2/4th Battalion, quoted in White over green –The 2/4th Battalion with reference to the 4th Battalion, Sydney, 1963, p.105 (hereafter White over green)\n31: Patrick Bridges, diary, 1941, in private hands (hereafter Bridges diary)","Invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece 6 April 1941 Yugoslavia and Greece being invaded.

{"question":"I'm trying to compare two potential stock investments - how do I calculate and interpret the return on investment (ROI) to make a better decision?","answer":"To calculate return on investment, divide the net income by the amount invested. First, calculate net income by subtracting your total investment cost from the total income from sale. Then divide that result by your initial investment amount. For example, if you buy 100 shares at $30 each ($3,000 total) and sell them for $45 each ($4,500 total), your net income would be $1,500. Dividing $1,500 by $3,000 gives an ROI of 0.5 or 50%. The higher the ROI percentage, the more profitable the investment is per dollar invested. Remember that ROI provides a more accurate comparison than just looking at profit per share since it accounts for the different initial investment amounts.","context":["What is Return on Investment – Your 5-minute Guide to Analysing Investments\nReturn on investment is one of the most basic (and important) terms that you would encounter commonly in the world of investments. You know your investment goals and you know about the different instruments (investment options) available in the market. So, how do you decide which instruments to invest in and which to leave? How do you decide which instruments are better than others?\nThe simple ratio that can enable you to answer these questions quickly and accurately is the return on investment ratio. This ratio tells us the profitability of an investment, i.e. how much profits you made on every dollar that you invested. Thus, this simple tool can quickly and easily allow us to compare many different types of investments. This, in turn, allows us to decide which of the investment options being considered are better and thus, enables us to make good investment decisions. So, let us quickly understand the concept of return on investment.\nReturn on Investment Definition and Examples\nThe ratio, return on investment, is defined simply as net income on an investment divided by amount invested. Let us understand this ratio better through a simple example.\nSuppose you buy 100 shares of company A today. Each of these shares cost you $30. Thus, the total sum of money that you invested in these shares = $30 X 100 = $3,000.\nTwo years later, you sell these shares for $45 each. Can you calculate the return on investment achieved in this case?\nWell, if you calculated the return on investment as 50%, then you are absolutely right. In this case, total income from sale of shares = $45 X 100 = $4,500.\nNet income = Total income – total cost (i.e., amount invested)\nHence, Net income = $4,500 – $3,000 = $1,500\nThus, return on investment = net income/amount invested = $1,500 / $3,000 = 0.5 or 50%.\nThere you are – you have understood how to calculate the profitability of an investment. Let us try one more example to understand this concept better.\nSuppose you buy 100 shares of company Y for $50. Three years later, you sell these shares for $70 each. Is this investment better (more profitable) than the previous investment (the one in company A?\nLet us see how we can quickly answer this question. We have already seen that the return on investment in the previous case (investment in shares of company A) is 50%. Now, we need to calculate the return on investment for the second case (i.e., the investment in shares of company Y).\nIn this case, total amount invested = $50 X 100 = $5,000\nTotal income = $70 X 100 = $7,000\nNet income = Total income – total cost = $7,000 – $5,000 = $2,000\nThus, return on investment = net income/amount invested = $2,000 / $5,000 = 0.4 = 40%\nHence, while the first investment (investment in shares of company A) yields a return on investment of 50%, the second investment (investment in shares of company Y) yields a return on investment of 40% only. Thus, the first investment is more profitable than the second one (i.e., per dollar invested, the first investment yields higher returns – greater profits – than the second investment).\nDo note that in the first case the profit per share is $15 (profit per share = sale price – purchase price = $45 – $30 = $15) whereas in the second case the profit per share is $20 (profit per share = sale price – purchase price = $70 – $50 = $20). Hence, if we only consider profit per share, we may get the impression that the second investment is more profitable. But, we need to realise that the cost of investment in the second case is much higher (cost of investment in the first case = $3,000 while cost of investment in the second case = $5,000). Hence, the return on investment, per dollar invested, is actually higher in the first case. This is how return on investment gives us a much more accurate picture as it considers the cost of investment as well.\nYou have now understood how to calculate return on investment and have understood how to compare two or more investments using this wonderful tool. Let us now look at two useful rules/tips regarding return on investment.\nGeneral Tips About Return on Investment\nThere are two general rules about return on investment that may come in handy for you. Do note that there may be many exceptions to these rules. Hence, you should not unquestioningly follow these rules. Instead, always try to perform precise calculations and determine the exact return on investment for each of the investment opportunities that you are trying to analyse. This would enable you to accurately judge which investment opportunity is better.\nRule 1: the higher the risk, the greater the return.\nTypically, in the investment world, if an investor comes across two investment opportunities, one of which is safer than the other, then the investor would prefer to invest in the safer option if both options offer the same return (equal return). The investor would only choose the riskier option if it offers higher return. Thus, instruments that are riskier will generally be priced in a manner that ensures that they offer higher returns than safer instruments.\nThe implications of this are obvious. Suppose you come across two instruments, one of which offers significantly higher returns than the other (and hence appears far more appealing). In this case, do not choose the instrument with the higher return without further analysis. It is possible that this instrument is riskier than the other one. Study both instruments deeper, identify the level of risk that each carries and then decide which instrument you wish to invest in.\nRule 2: the longer the period of investment, the greater the return on investment.\nSuppose you come across two investment opportunities, one of which requires that you invest your money for two years while the other requires investment for three years. In this case, if both opportunities offer equal returns, then it is better to invest your money in the first one since it requires investment for less time. You can then reinvest your money and get some more returns over the extra year that you save here. Thus, if the second investment opportunity does not offer higher returns then it may not be very sensible to invest in this opportunity. Hence, in general, you would observe that instruments that require longer periods of investment may offer higher returns. This implies that if you want higher returns on your investment, then looking for opportunities with longer periods of investment may reveal ideal options for you.\nDo note that both of these are general guidelines only – it is not at all necessary that every instrument will follow these rules. Hence, analyse each investment opportunity thoroughly before you make your investment decision.\nYou have now understood how to use return on investment to accurately evaluate various investment options. Use this wisely and invest your way to success and profits."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ae8ddb09-4f56-488f-84ea-d0c87dc130d9>"],"error":null}
