{"question":"Eager STEM enthusiast here looking to integrate real-world phenomena into family activities! What's the scientific relationship between daily shadow patterns and UV protection requirements, and how can we track these measurements effectively? ü§ìüìè","answer":"The relationship between shadows and UV protection is directly connected to sun intensity. When shadows are shorter than a person's height (particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), UV rays are most intense, indicating a greater need for sun protection. This can be monitored through regular shadow measurements, which can include marking shadow lengths and tracking their changes over time. For effective measurement, families can establish weekly rituals, such as measuring shadows every Sunday at noon, which helps observe patterns in shadow length variations. During high UV intensity periods, comprehensive protection is necessary, including broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 15, protective clothing, and seeking shade. This is especially important near reflective surfaces like water and sand, which can increase UV exposure by up to 25%.","context":["Today, when (and if) the sun comes out, take a child outside and measure the shadow of something, and say, ‚ÄúToday, June 21st, is the longest day of the year. Let‚Äôs see how long the shadow is. Let‚Äôs pick something and mark the end of the shadow so that we can watch the shadow get longer as the summer goes on.‚Äù\nAll sorts of questions could come up depending upon the age of the child and the interests of the participants, for example:\nWhat could we use to measure?\nCould we use one of Daddy‚Äôs shoes?

This is a good thing. To read to your children before he or she goes to bed is the most important thing parents can do to ensure that their children will grow up to be readers. It not only models something that you value, it builds your relationship, and gives you a time to be with your child in loving, fun, calm, quiet, spiritually enriching ways. Stories are the staff of mental life and relationships.\nWhat if we had a curiosity ritual? This week we play around with sinking and floating; next week we notice the flight of balloons, or the creation of bubbles. What if parents were ritualistic about doing a cooking project with their kids every weekend?\nWhy do Americans do so badly in mathematics? Because mathematics is a foreign language in America. The vast majority of children grow up in a number-poor environment. We‚Äôve forgotten that the language of mathematics is founded in curiosity. We too often think of mathematics as rules rather than as questions. This is like thinking of stories as grammar. Being curious together can be a really special part of the relationship in families.\nTo learn any language it is best if the child swims in the milieu of the language. The reason bedtime reading is so important is not that it is a time to TEACH reading, but that it makes reading a part of a child‚Äôs reality‚Äîthe reality which their brains are constituted by nature to master. If we want our children to master mathematics, we need to make sure that the phenomena of the physical world (Science), tools (Technology), how they work (Engineering), and measurement (Mathematics) are a conscious part of their lives, not just something they take for granted and hope others (certain rare mathematical geniuses) will miraculously take care of.\nIf shadow measuring became a weekly ritual‚Äîsomething you did every Sunday at noon for no good reason except to give a nod to the god of curiosity‚Äîmany more questions would come up, be pondered and answered as the children got older. The questions would get more sophisticated as time went by:\nAs the days get shorter, what do you predict will happen to the shadows?\nDoes the length of the shadow increase by the same amount every day? (a core concept in calculus)\nIs the relationship between the length of the days and the length of the shadow an inverse relationship or a direct relationship?\nWhy do the shadows get longer, when the days get shorter?\nWhy does it look like the sun goes around the earth, when actually the earth goes around the sun?\nWhat is the height of the flagpole? How could we find out without climbing it?\n‚ÄúDaddy, who was Pythagoras?‚Äù\nKids ask these kinds of questions naturally (‚ÄúWhere do babies come from?‚Äù) all the time. All day long as they explore their world, they notice phenomena and try to make sense out of them. Most of the time, they ask and answer such questions in the privacy of their own minds. Every once in a while we get a glimpse of that mind, when they ask an adult. When they make what sounds like a statement of fact, the adult should take it as a question.\nFrom birth, children are natural scientists. From Birth! (Sorry for shouting.) Children want to understand the real world and organize it so that they can wrap their brains around it‚Äîalmost literally. Numbers, mathematical disciplines, scientific questions, tools and the way they work are the very stuff of the lives of children and adults alike.

While they provide us with essential vitamin D, overexposure to the sun can lead to skin damage, sunburn, and even skin cancer. Understanding the difference between UVA and UVB rays is crucial. UVA rays penetrate deep into the skin and are responsible for premature aging and skin cancer, while UVB rays affect the surface of the skin and cause sunburn. So, how can you protect your skin from the sun? Here's a comprehensive guide.\n- Always Use Sunscreen\nSunscreen is your first line of defense against harmful UV rays. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 15, even on cloudy days. Apply a thick layer on all exposed skin and reapply every two hours or after swimming, sweating, or toweling off. Sunscreens have an SPF number that rates their effectiveness in blocking UV rays. Sunscreen without an expiration date has a shelf life of no more than three years. For those with sensitive skin, look for formulas with ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.\n- Avoid Peak Sun Hours\nThe sun's rays are most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Try to schedule outdoor activities outside these hours or seek shade under an umbrella, tree, or shelter to reduce the risk of skin damage. Following the shadow rule can help determine sun intensity‚Äîif your shadow is shorter than you, seek shade. Limiting sun exposure during these hours can significantly reduce the risk of skin damage and sunburn.\n- Wear Protective Clothing\nLong-sleeved shirts, pants, and skirts made from tightly woven fabrics can provide excellent protection. Darker colored clothing offers more UV protection than lighter colors. Don't forget to wear a hat with a brim all around to protect your face, ears, and neck. Tightly woven fabric like canvas works best for hat material. Some clothing is certified as offering UV protection, and clothes made with special sun-protective materials are also available.\n- Sunglasses are Essential\nChoose sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays to protect your eyes from UV rays and reduce the risk of cataracts. Wrap-around sunglasses provide better protection by blocking UV rays from the side. Sunglasses with lenses that have high UV absorption (99% to 100%) are recommended. Protecting your eyes is vital as prolonged exposure to UV rays can lead to eye problems, including cataracts and macular degeneration.\n- Be Mindful of Reflective Surfaces\nWater, sand, and concrete surfaces reflect the sun's rays, increasing the risk of sunburn. Be extra cautious around these areas and ensure you are well-protected. Reflection from these surfaces can intensify UV radiation, making it essential to apply sunscreen even if you're under an umbrella or in the shade. This is especially important near water bodies, where reflection can increase UV exposure by up to 25%.\n- Protect Children and Babies\nKeep babies younger than 6 months old completely covered and in the shade. Teach children about sun safety and encourage them to wear hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen outdoors. Babies' skin is more sensitive, so it's best to keep them out of direct sunlight. For older children, education about sun safety and the importance of wearing protective clothing and sunscreen is vital for lifelong skin health.\n- Check Your Medications\nCertain medications, such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, antifungals, blood pressure meds, and chemotherapies, may increase sensitivity to the sun. Consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns. Being aware of medication interactions with sun exposure can prevent unexpected skin reactions and increase sun sensitivity.\n- Natural Protection\nWhile sunscreen and clothing are essential, you can also protect your skin naturally by eating foods rich in antioxidants and staying hydrated. Foods like berries, carrots, and spinach contain antioxidants that can protect skin cells from damage. Staying hydrated helps maintain skin elasticity and can aid in overall skin health.\nFinal Thoughts on Sun Protection\nProtecting your skin from the sun is vital for maintaining healthy skin and preventing long-term damage. By following these simple steps, you can enjoy the sun safely and keep your skin looking its best. Remember, it only takes 15 minutes in the sun to damage your skin, but following these guidelines can ensure that you are well-protected."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:afb54fd3-99eb-4279-ba9d-54af3cb04010>","<urn:uuid:aa18736e-02f5-4e79-9afe-0d8ffcfdd726>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How can grid operators measure the effectiveness of load flexibility implementations?","answer":"Grid operators can measure load flexibility effectiveness by developing unique impact metrics, specifically by: measuring the slope and magnitude of multi-hour demand ramps, tracking curtailed potential renewable energy output, and measuring the carbon intensity of electricity production.","context":["- What is driving the need for load flexibility as a resource?\n- How can load flexibility be used as a grid resource?\n- What can be done to determine the value of load flexibility?\n- Why is it important to accurately value load flexibility in energy markets?\n- What effect does load flexibility have on traditional utility business models?\nLoad Flexibility Valuation Is Critical to Grid Reliability\nThe energy industry is undergoing a foundational and necessary transition away from fossil fuels. The growth of variable renewable energy sources has increased supply-side volatility resulting in new net load shapes. Jurisdictions around the world are implementing aggressive clean energy targets and emissions reductions goals along with new market regulations for distributed energy resources (DER). The transportation and buildings sectors are increasingly electrifying end uses that once relied on fossil fuels, and advancements in digitalization are being used in the energy sector to improve operations.\nAs a result, load flexibility has been exposed as a valuable grid resource in the path to achieving zero emissions in the energy sector. Load flexibility plays a critical role in maintaining grid stability by reducing strain on the grid and allowing for continued reliable operation as the supply-side landscape trends toward renewables. To ensure load flexibility reaches its true potential and the grid remains balanced, load flexibility must be accurately valued in energy markets. Accurate valuation of load flexibility is expected to lead to fair competition with traditional generation sources as well as innovation.\nThis Guidehouse Insights report discusses the ongoing shift in the energy industry from fossil fuel sources to renewable sources, its impact on grid operations, and the ways in which load flexibility can address that impact. The report provides a formal definition for load flexibility and recommendations to key stakeholders for incorporating and valuing load flexibility in their portfolios.\n- Grid operators\n- Utilities (vertically integrated, TDU, and distribution)\n- Building equipment and DER manufacturers\n- Investor community\nSupply Volatility Increases with More Renewable Sources\nFossil Fuel Power Plants Have Historically Provided Grid Stability\nClean Energy and Emissions Goals Drive Renewables Growth\nElectrification and Digitalization Add Flexible Loads to the Grid\nNew Market Regulations Lead to Flexibility as a Resource\nLoad Flexibility Plays a Larger Role in Balancing the Grid\nLoad Shifting Reduces the Slope of Multi-Hour Ramps\nLoad Flexibility Reduces Daily and System Peak Demand\nLoad Flexibility Must Be Accurately Valued in Energy Markets\nTraditional Utility Business Models Need to Be Reformed\nLoad Flexibility Technology Must Be Correctly Classified and Regulated\nLoad Flexibility Must Be Integrated into Normal Grid Operations\nGrid Operators and Utilities Must Develop Unique Load Flexibility Impact Metrics\nMeasure the Slope and Magnitude of Multi-Hour Demand Ramps\nCase Study: CAISO Flexible Ramping Product\nTrack Curtailed Potential Renewable Energy Output\nMeasure the Carbon Intensity of Electricity Production\nRegulators Must Identify New Methods to Determine Utility Revenue\nGrid Operators and Utilities Must Adjust Expected Demand Profiles\nCase Study: Recurve‚Äôs Load Impact Analysis of OhmConnect‚Äôs DR Event in August 2020\nBuilding Equipment and DER Manufacturers Must Ensure Their Products Enable Load Flexibility\n- California Independent System Operator Net Load Chart (Duck Curve)\n- Theoretical Net Load Curve in a High Solar Generation Area"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a3c66ee9-f27f-4a99-9a07-3bbf3e62cf0a>"],"error":null}

They've also implemented watershed development programs and revival of traditional water systems. In Gujarat, however, the situation is particularly challenging as the government provides subsidized electricity for pumping, which inadvertently encourages overexploitation of groundwater. The subsidy system has become counterproductive - in some areas, the government's subsidy cost per agricultural hectare exceeds the value of crops produced.

It was the kick-off event of an ambitious project to find solutions to the groundwater crisis in Gujarat, funded by the PepsiCo Foundation. More details of the project will follow this overview post.\nFor more than three decades, the farmers in Northern Gujarat State, in India, have produced abundant food crops, and have had a thriving dairy industry. In order to make that happen, they have been using once plentiful underground water resources.\nBecause local aquifers are being replenished more slowly than the water is being withdrawn, groundwater tables have been falling throughout the period, and the situation has become so serious that North Gujarat‚Äôs future agricultural success is now in jeopardy. The more the water table falls, the deeper the wells must be, and the more electricity is required to pump the water out ‚Äì and the more the water table will fall.\nFarmers are the first to suffer: they have to continually invest in deeper wells and more powerful pumps, and even with these investments, the water is less plentiful and of poorer quality.\nThe state government and the utility companies, for their part, have had to finance and generate increasing amounts of expensive electricity for pumping, which they provide to the farmers at a subsidized rate. While the state‚Äôs expenditures on energy have been rising steeply, the benefit to farmers has stagnated or even declined, because the amount of water they have access to has in fact decreased.\nThe energy subsidy is currently structured so that farmers pay a flat rate, no matter how much electricity they use. While this type of subsidy provides for the immediate livelihood of the farmers, it also encourages overexploitation of water resources. Farmers have no motivation to do anything other than continue to deepen their wells and pump as much water as possible. The irony is that overusing the water will ultimately result in a complete collapse of the groundwater supply, putting them out of business entirely.\nThe futility of the system is already becoming apparent. In some places in Gujarat, the amount the government pays to subsidize groundwater pumping per agricultural hectare is more than the value of the crops produced.\nLet‚Äôs take for example the Mehsana district of Gujarat. In this semi-arid region, agriculture accounts for around 90% of the total water use, followed by domestic and industrial, and more than 80% of the land area is under cultivation. Based on datasets supplied by the Groundwater Resources Development Corporation (GRWDC), ground water levels in the region have declined by about 80 meters in the last 30 years. The current levels are anywhere from 100 meters to 200 meters below the surface. Declines in ground water levels already average about 3 meters/year, and if agricultural use intensifies, this could double in the next decade.\nSome of the water is being withdrawn from aquifers located below sea level. As a result, salt is already being detected as seawater seeps into the aquifers. This is a catastrophic turn of events, as once the seawater begins to intrude into the aquifer, it is irreversible.\nCrop choices in the region tend to maximize cash value, rather than minimize water consumption. Even though more water is being used for irrigation, the value of the crops in fact barely exceeds the energy cost of pumping.\nChanges in rainfall patterns due to climate change may also contribute to deepening the crisis.\nIt is in this setting that the Columbia Water Center and its local partners, including the Government of Gujarat itself, are actively looking for solutions. It is imperative to maintain local incomes and food production, but in the long run that won‚Äôt happen without major changes in policy and farming practice. In another blog post, we will look at a series of steps that are being taken in Gujarat this year to begin to reverse the groundwater crisis."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a0fafada-10d3-466b-a63e-b6dc9f8b0aa0>","<urn:uuid:563fe5c6-17fb-4ff4-a881-0ec56c606c5d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do both festivals, Christmas and Karwa Chauth, emphasize the power of storytelling through their sacred narratives? Tell me more! üìñ","answer":"Both festivals use sacred narratives to convey their spiritual meanings. Christmas narrative focuses on Jesus's genealogy through Matthew's Gospel, which includes three groups of 14 generations and shows God's salvation plan through various characters, including disreputable ones. Karwa Chauth features multiple sacred narratives, including the tale of Veeravati who lost and regained her husband through dedicated fasting, stories from Mahabharata about Draupadi's fasting for her husbands, and the story of Karwa who saved her husband from a crocodile through her devotion. These narratives serve to reinforce the spiritual significance of each festival.","context":["December 24, 2020 Vigil Mass\nIs 62:1-5; Act 13:16-17, 22-25; Mt 1:1-12 (or 18-25)\nAmrit Rai, S. J.\nThe first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew contains two distinct parts. Verses 1-17 list the genealogy of Jesus from Abraham to his foster father Joseph. The second part, beginning at verse 18, provides an account of the birth of Jesus Christ. Verses 18‚Äì25 fulfill Isaiah 7:14, the promise of a virgin mother. It is a rich place to begin Matthew‚Äôs gospel and it is a glorious reminder that the God who lives in a high and holy place also comes to dwell in the company of the lowly and contrite. We are celebrating the fulfillment of the prophecies about our merciful God who sent His own Son to save a sinful world.\nWhile Paul presents Jesus as a descendent of David in the second reading, Matthew traces Jesus‚Äô genealogy from Abraham. This genealogy not only shows Jesus‚Äô human ancestry, but also indicates that salvation history has reached its climax with the birth of the Son of God through the working of the Holy Spirit. Though we often skip over these lists of names, the Gospel writers took great pains to compile the genealogies and to make several theological points in the process. Our Lord Jesus Christ was born of a line of ancestors whom Matthew arranges into three groups, of 14 patriarchs, 14 kings and 14 princes. The three groups are based on the three stages of Jewish history: i) the rise of Israel to a great kingdom by the time of David, ii) the fall of the nation by the time of Babylonian exile and iii) the resurrection of the nation after the exile. Strangely enough, the list includes a number of disreputable characters, including three women. Perhaps the Lord God included these characters in His Son‚Äôs human genealogy to emphasize God‚Äôs grace, to give us all hope, and to show us that Jesus is sent to save sinners. Thus, God‚Äôs powerful work of salvation comes to us under the appearance of weakness. From the beginning, Matthew‚Äôs account challenges our human expectations as to how God will fulfill our hopes for endless peace, justice, and righteousness.\nThere is the story of a father putting his four-year-old son to bed. Having finished prayers and stories he kissed his son and turned the light off. Almost immediately his son started crying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me. I‚Äôm scared and don‚Äôt want to stay here alone.‚Äù The father tried to encourage the little boy by reminding him that they had just said the prayers and God‚Äôs presence was with him. To this the little boy said, ‚ÄúI want somebody with skin on.‚Äù This story sums up what Christmas is. This is the great message of the Incarnation; God coming in the flesh.\nThe shepherds found Jesus in the manger as told by the angles. The message of Christmas is we need to look for Jesus in unlikely places and persons. We need to look for Him in people that we might otherwise ignore ‚Äì the homeless, the sick, the addicts, the unpleasant people, the rebels, or the people of different culture and lifestyle from us. We will learn to discover Him in the most unlikely places, in the most distasteful people, in those who live in suffering or in distress, in poverty or in fear. During the Christmas season we, like the Magi, must give our most precious gift, our lives, to Jesus. We can truly find Jesus if we look in the right places, in the streets, in the slums, in the prisons, in the orphanages, in the nursing homes, in the refugee camps starting in our own homes, workplaces, village and town.\nTrue Christmas is about celebrating the coming of God among the poor, the homeless and the disadvantaged, with a message of hope and liberation for these sufferers in our world. It is about our responsibility to be part of that liberating process. It is about working to remove from our world the shameful blot of poverty, discrimination and exploitation that is the lot of too many in our environment of prosperity. God challenges us to be like the shepherds who overcame their fear in order to seek out Jesus, or like the Wise Men who traveled a long distance to find Him. Then we will have the true experience of Christmas and the joy of the Savior.\nWe need to allow the Savior to be reborn in our lives. Let us remember the famous lines of Alexander Pope: ‚ÄúWhat do I profit if Jesus is born in thousands of cribs all over the world during this Christmas, but is not born in my heart?‚Äù Let us allow Him to be reborn in our lives during Christmas 2020 and every day of the New Year 2021. How should we prepare for Christ‚Äôs rebirth in our daily lives? As a first step, John the Baptist urges us to repent daily of our sins and to renew our lives by leveling the hills of pride and selfishness, by filling up the valleys of impurity, and by straightening the crooked paths of hatred. Our second step in preparing for Christ‚Äôs rebirth in our daily lives is to cultivate the spirit of sacrifice and humility. It was by sacrifice that the shepherds of Bethlehem and the Magi were able to find the Savior. They were humble enough to see God in the Child in the manger. We, too, can experience Jesus by sharing Him with others, just as God shared His Son with us. Let us remember that the angels wished peace on earth only to those able to receive that peace, those who possessed the good will and largeness of heart to share Jesus our Savior with others in love, kindness, mercy, forgiveness and humble service.","Karwa Chauth ‚ÄìBlessings for an eternal married life\nA country filled with amazing customs, traditions, cultures, and festivals, with each festival having its own vibrancy and significance, India is a land of multitudes. While some festivals are celebrated to welcome prosperity and good wishes, some for divine blessings, and some to commemorate national spirit, seasons, and beliefs, Indians need a reason to celebrate life.\nThe Hindu customs are filled with various festivals of religious importance as well as to ensure the protection of marital prosperity and wellbeing of offsprings. Divine blessings can be gained by observing a vrat to show your faith.\nCelebrated by married women in the Hindu religion, Karwa Chauth is a significant one-day festival where married women observe a strict fast from sunrise to moonrise, praying for the safety, wellbeing, and long life of their husbands. Karwa Chauth signifies the eternal bond shared between a husband and wife and is one of the most loved and popular festivals in India\n. Karwa Chauth has been commemorated in most Bollywood films raising its popularity not just among North Indians but among South Indians too. Karwa Chauth is majorly celebrated in North Indian states, while it is observed in a few South Indian states.\nIn the Hindu belief, Karwa Chauth Vrat is observed on Chaturthi Tithi, the fourth day of Krishna Paksha\nduring the Hindu month of Karthik as per the Purnimanta calendar, coinciding in the month of October-November according to the Gregorian calendar. In the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and southern India, it is observed as per the Amanta calendar and is observed during the Hindu month of Ashwin. Karwa Chauth fast coincides with Sankashti Chaturthi\n, which is observed for Lord Ganesha.\nMarried women observe the fasting and rituals of Karwa Chauth for the long life of their husbands. They worship Lord Shiva and his family, including Lord Ganesha, and conclude the fast only after sighting the moon and making arghya or offerings to the moon. Karwa Chauth fast is also known as Nirjala fast as it is a strict fast observed without taking food or even a drop of water until the sighting of the moon.\nGet Your Free Marriage Predictions\nWhen is Karwa Chauth 2022?\nIn 2022, Karwa Chauth will be observed on Thursday, October 13, 2022.\n- Sunrise Timing: 06:21 AM on 13 October 2022\n- Upavasa Timing: 06:21 AM ‚Äì 08:09 PM on October 13, 2022\n- Sunset Timing: 05:54 PM on 13 October 2022\n- Moonrise Timing: 08:09 PM on 13 October 2022\n- Puja Muhurat Timing: 04:08 PM ‚Äì 05:50 PM on October 13, 2022\n- Chaturthi Tithi Begins 01:59 AM on October 13, 2022\n- Chaturthi Tithi Ends 03:08 AM on October 14, 2022\nEverything You Should Know\nThe biggest aspect about Karwa Chauth is this one-day Nirjala fast observed by married women, newly married or betrothed girls who pray for the long lives of their husbands or their fianc√©s. However, it is vital that one should perform the Karwa Chauth rituals in the correct manner to get the blessings.\nSargi -Love from Mother-in-law to Daughter-in Law\nKarwa Chauth begins by consuming the sargi gifted by the mother-in-law to her daughter-in-law. The sargi consists of a plate containing earthen pots, sweets made from vermicelli, fruits, matthri, and dry fruits. This food should be eaten before sunrise to begin the Nirjala fast so that it gives the energy to observe the fast.\nPuja items for Karwa Chauth\nThe puja items that are mandatorily required for the puja are small Karwa lamps, earthen pots, matthri, Mehendi, and the puja thali. Women apply beautiful Mehendi designs on their hands as this signifies prosperity, luck, and eternal marital bliss\nDressing for Karwa Chauth\nMost women dress like a bride on Karwa Chauth, in memory of their wedding days. Traditionally, red is the colour chosen for their attire as red dresses are worn as bridals; however, there is no hard and fast rule to stick to this colour code. However, women can wear the clothing of their choice and comfort, since it is a day filled with devotion and fasting.\nKarwa Chauth Fast\nWomen consume sargi after a bath before sunrise, and once sunrises, the upavasa begins. Women do not consume any food or even water throughout the entire day. This is to appease Karwa matha and gain her blessings for their husbands‚Äô long lives and marital happiness.\nBaya ‚ÄìLove from Daughter-in-law to Mother-in-law\nSimilar to the sargi, Baya is a gift from the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law. The Bays is prepared in a large thali (plate) containing a blend of gifts, savories like matthri, sweets like halwa and puri.\nReciting the vrat katha\nThe women observing the Karwa Chauth vrat recite and listen to the Karwa Chauth Vrat Katha, which is read by the elderly women folk, mainly the mother-in-law or elder sister-in-law. Women sit around in a circle, and an earthen pot is kept in the center of the ring. Puja thali is then prepared with all the puja items and karwa, and is then exchanged in a pattern among the women gathered in a circle for the puja.\nKarwa Chauth Puja Preparation\nDuring this festival, women light diyas or small lamps, and water is poured into a karwa which is a small earthen pot. The diyas are placed on a sieve which is covered by a transparent cloth or dupatta. Upon moonrise, women carry these items to the designated spot or terraces where the moon is clearly visible.\nArghya to the Moon\nWhen the moon comes up in the sky and becomes clearly visible, the lady initiates the puja ritual of offering water to the moon. This offering is known as ‚ÄúArghya.‚Äù This is done so to seek blessing from the lunar deity ‚Äì Chandra. According to Hindu mythology, observing a strict fast and prayer would help the woman defeat the Lord of Death, Yamaraj, and deter him from taking her husband away from her. The women then observe the reflection of the moon in the pot of water through the sieve\nBreaking the fast\nAs part of the tradition, after sighting the reflection of the moon through the sieve, the women then turn towards their husbands and fianc√©s and look at them through the sieve, at the same time praying for the long life of their husbands. When a woman performs the Karwa Chauth puja and sees her husband through the sieve, it is believed that all negative emotions are filtered and thrown away through the sieve. The husband then helps his wife break the fast by offering her a sip of water and a sweet, thus concluding the fast. The women then partake in the scrumptious feast prepared for the occasion.\nKarwa Chauth Vrat Katha\nTo fulfill the Karwa Chauth vrat, it is imperative that women must recite to each other and listen to the Karwa Chauth vrat Katha. Generally, there are different versions of Karwa Chauth Vrat Katha, which is read out in different regions. The main vrat Katha that is read out is given below.\nThe tale of Veeravati:\nThere once lived a beautiful girl named Veeravati. She was the only daughter of a wealthy merchant who had seven sons. The seven brothers doted on their sister and loved her very much. Veeravati was later married to a young Brahman who was traveling for work. On one Karwa Chauth, she visited her parents‚Äô house and observed the Karwa Chauth strictly without consuming a drop of water.\nShe waited eagerly for the moonrise as she started becoming weak and exhausted from the fast but refused to break her fast without sighting the moon. The brothers were pained to see their sister suffering, and they hung a mirror on a Peepal tree, making it look like the moon in the sky. They then called out to Veeravati, who, believing her brothers, broke her fast after offering prayers to the fake moon. The moment she broke her fast, she received the news of her husband‚Äôs death. Veeravati was inconsolable. Her sister-in-law informed her of the trick by her brothers, which led to the unfortunate events.\nVeeravati then kept a strict Nirjala fast on all Chaturthi throughout the year with complete devotion and dedication praying to Lord Ganesha. The following year during Karwa Chauth, she observed the fast with true devotion and completed the ritual by offering arghya to the moon and saw her husband‚Äôs reflection through the sieve. Seeing her dedication, Yamaraj restored the life of her husband, and she lived happily ever after.\nFrom the Tales of Mahabharata:\nIt is mentioned that Draupadi also observed the Karwa Chauth fast for her husbands. Once Arjuna, whom Draupadi loved the most, went to Nilgiri Mountains for offer penance. In his absence, the rest of the brothers faced a lot of challenges. Seeing all her husbands in distress, Draupadi sought the advice of Lord Krishna for overcoming the challenges. Lord Krishna narrated the story of Goddess Parvathi, who observed the Karwa Chauth fast rituals during a similar situation. Draupadi, too, observed the strict fast of Karwa Chauth and followed all traditions religiously. This helped the Pandavas to overcome all their challenges and gain victory.\nSatyavan and Savitri:\nWhen Yama, the god of death, took away Satyavan, Savitri begged Yama to grant back her husband‚Äôs life. However, Yama was adamant and took her husband away. Seeing this, Savitri stopped eating and drinking and followed Yama. Seeing Savitri‚Äôs persistence, Yama said to Savitri that she could ask for any other boon except for the life of her husband. Savitri, being a clever woman, asked Yama that she wished to be blessed with motherhood. Savitri was a devoted and loyal wife and would not commit adultery. Yama had no other option than to restore Satyavan‚Äôs life so that Savitri could fulfill her wish of bearing children.\nThe Story of Karwa:\nSimilar to Savitri, there once lived a woman named Karwa who loved her husband deeply and intensely. Her deep devotion and love for her husband gave her spiritual powers. Once while bathing in a river, her husband was attacked by a crocodile. Seeing her husband being attacked, the courageous Karwa bound the crocodile with cotton yarn and summoned Yama. Yama was afraid of being cursed by such a devoted wife, and so he sent the crocodile to hell and restored her husband‚Äôs life.\nSignificance of Karwa Chauth Vrat\nOne of the biggest occasions in the married lives of Hindu women, the Karwa Chauth vrat is of immense significance as observing this fast ensures the long life, wellbeing, and prosperity of their husbands. With rising commercialization, the popularity of this fast has become more prominent and grandiose in the country. This fast is of great prominence in North and Northwestern regions of India, where a considerable male population from these regions are engaged in the Indian Army and other defense services.\nHence women from these regions observe this fast for the safety and wellbeing of their husbands who are employed in the armed forces. The fast also coincides with the initiation of the Rabi crop season when wheat is sown in the fields. The women from the agricultural families fill the earthen pots or Karwa with wheat grains and offer prayers to the god for a bountiful Rabi season.\nNowadays, when traditions are being modernised, married women receive beautiful and expensive gifts from their husbands and in-laws on Karwa Chauth. This could include bangles, jewelry, Mehendi, lehenga choli, sarees, and other traditional offerings. This custom of gifting is a means to express their love for the women and strengthens the eternal bond of love between the husband and wife. Women feel pampered and loved while receiving gifts from their loved ones.\nAnother important fact is that Karwa Chauth marks the beginning of feasting and festivity of Diwali\n, which is a major Hindu festival and is celebrated nine days after Karwa Chauth. The Karwa Chauth fast has thus become an occasion filled with celebrations and joy, with the entire household participating in the festivities."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4d5b73b2-30f1-4b9a-a6f5-e11c2d366864>","<urn:uuid:b3d8b4c4-4f36-48a0-b65e-2d9480b8ea98>"],"error":null}

(BOCM n¬∫ 124, of 22nd of May)\n* Decree 58/2018, of 21 of May, from the President of the Community of Madrid, by which it is established the number and names of the ministries of the Community of Madrid (BOCM n¬∫ 121, of 22nd of May)\nM, certified product\nEThe trademark with which the Community of Madrid guarantees the origin and the quality of the agri-foods produced in its region are known as: M Producto Certificado.\nSince 2nd of May 2015, Conservas Cachopo, S.L. has been authorised the use of the Quality Trademark ‚ÄúM CERTIFIED PRODUCTS‚Äù since we meet all the demanded conditions and requirements. The objectives of this Trademark is to guaranty the differentiated quality of the food products produced and elaborated in the Community of Madrid and highlight the importance the professions linked to the agri-food sector as an essential part of the economic development of the regional territory. With this logo, the consumers can easily identify food products from Madrid, associated with values which the brand represents such as proximity, guarantee and confidence.\nNQA, auditing company specialised in the management system of food innocuousness has given Conservas Cachopo, S.L. since last April 2017 the certification in Fiven SSC22000, a quality standard comparable to other certifications such as IFS or BRC.\nAll the products produced in Conservas Cachopo, S.L follow strict quality and safety procedures and the whole company is highly committed with the quality, safety and development controls, because of which, in order to give more value to the products manufactured by the company and to improve the service given to the customers, Conservas Cachopo, S.L. has implemented the Management System of Food Innocuousness FSSC 22000.

(See section ‚ÄúDocuments of interest/ Legislation‚Äù).\nIn Spain, the control and certification of the organic production farming is the competence of the Autonomous Communities and it is normally carried out by public control authorities, through territorial Boards or Committees of Organic Agriculture which are organisms which depend directly from the corresponding Ministries or Departments of Agriculture, or directly by the General Directorate assigned to them.\nNevertheless, the Autonomous Communities of Andalucia and Castilla La Mancha, have authorised private organisms to carry out these functions and, in the case of Aragon, the competent authorities have appointed a public control authority as well as private control organisms.\nA trademark so that the consumer can recognise products coming from organic agriculture, all the packaged units, besides having their own brand and the mention of some of the specifications of organic agriculture, require to have printed the authorisation code and the control organism or the specific logo, with the name and the code of the control organism. Also, the community logo of the AE mentioned at the beginning of this page can also be stamped, which will be an obligation, in the new design, the 1st July 2010, under the conditions of the legislation.\nAll of this means that the farm or industry where the product has been grown or produced, is submitted to the corresponding controls and inspections of the Authority or the established Organism depending on the Autonomous Community. It also constitutes the only official guarantee that the product meets the quality expected by the consumer and that it complies to the legislation established in the Regulation (CE) 834/2007 and the provisions of application.\nFor more Information about the authorities and organic production control organisms in each Autonomous Community, refer to the section ‚ÄúDocuments of interest/general information of interest related to organic agriculture‚Äù.\nDevelopment and evolution of organic farming in Spain\nOur country gathers the conditions to develop this type of agriculture because of its favourable climate and the extensive production systems which are applied to many crops. In respect to animal production, the conservation of a patrimony of regional breeds of genetic importance, in general very rustic and adapted to the environment favouring the rearing in an extensive system.

{"question":"Could you compare the construction approach of the Carmelite Monks' monastery with Type 1 construction methods in terms of materials used?","answer":"The Carmelite Monks' monastery uses natural stone (Kansas Silverdale limestone and Colorado Buff sandstone) as its primary building material, chosen for its durability and longevity. In contrast, Type 1 construction uses non-combustible materials such as concrete and steel for walls, floors, and structural framework. While both approaches prioritize durability, they differ in their material choices, with the monastery following a more traditional, Gothic-style architecture using natural materials, whereas Type 1 construction typically employs modern industrial materials.","context":["Having outgrown their family style home in Clark, WY, the Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel were seeking a new place of solitude. With the majestic mountainscape of the Rocky Mountains nearby, it was the obvious choice for their relocation. Through the efforts of the New Mount Carmel Foundation and the generosity of a few benefactors, the monks were able to acquire mountain property in Meeteetse, WY, for their monastery in the fall of 2010. Seeking simple durable materials that will withstand the test of time, the monks chose natural stone for their spiritual retreat. Faced with cost provisions, the monks took on the impressive challenge of learning to operate a CNC stoneworking center and fabricate all of the stone needed for the project themselves.\n‚ÄúWe wanted to build a monastery that would last for many generations of monks,‚Äù explained Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúStone was the obvious choice since all of the monasteries and churches of Europe are built of stone and have been standing for a thousand years. Natural stone also has a beauty that lasts for centuries, unlike many other forms of architecture.‚Äù\nWhen the decision was made to build a new monastery, the monks embraced it whole-heartedly. Natural stone was the perfect complement to the Gothic-style of architecture that was chosen for the monastery.\n‚ÄúWe wanted to use a stone that was nearby, and researched and visited many quarries in the surrounding states to find the right stone that would be both lasting and beautiful,‚Äù said Brother Gabriel Marie, adding that after their extensive search a final decision was made to use Kansas Silverdale limestone for all of the cut stone and Colorado Buff sandstone for the field stone. ‚ÄúWe were mainly interested in the longevity and structural capabilities of the stone, as well as its natural beauty. We also wanted to make sure we could get large enough stone for the pieces we would carve. We have been working with Pray Stone for the Kansas Silverdale limestone and Arkins Park for the Colorado Buff sandstone. Both have fulfilled our needs admirably.\n‚ÄúAfter we realized the astronomical cost of paying a company to carve and install the stone on our monastery, we knew that was not an option,‚Äù Brother Gabriel Marie went on to say. ‚ÄúAs monks, we are not wealthy. We are supported by our own coffee roasting industry, Mystic Monk Coffee (www.mysticmonkcoffee.com), and the donations of generous people who believe in our way of life. We could not in good conscience spend the money given to us in paying someone else to build a monastery. The carving and installation of the stone was the most costly line item, so we decided to tackle that ourselves.‚Äù\nResearching machine manufacturers\nNo one in the monks‚Äô community had any previous experience with stone fabrication or working a CNC machine. ‚ÄúHowever, we knew we had to learn since we could not afford to pay someone else,‚Äù explained Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúSo we dove in and began researching how to carve stone in today‚Äôs world. CNC machines were a logical conclusion.‚Äù\nIn 2013, the monks conducted a very thorough research on the various manufacturers of CNC machinery. ‚ÄúWe were trying to find the one that was best for us, and also fit in our budget,‚Äù said Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúTwo of our monks visited several different stone fabrication shops to see the machines of different manufacturers in action. After this, we narrowed our options down to three [manufacturers]. All three made excellent machines that were capable of fulfilling our needs. Prussiani‚Äôs machines did stand out for their strong and beefy construction. The different parts of the machine, especially the bridge, were significantly thicker. In the end, Mario Prussiani gave us such an incredible offer on a New Champion Plus 1300 that we decided to purchase his machine. We have not been disappointed by that decision. Prussiani has been stellar over the years, helping us with any questions we might have, and there were a lot in the first year. We do owe a large portion of our success in learning how to use CNCs to Prussiani‚Äôs tech support.‚Äù\nBrother Gabriel Marie explained that the monks chose the Champion Plus 1300 because it was large enough to handle all of the different pieces they needed to carve for their monastery. ‚ÄúIn early 2016, we obtained two Champion Plus 700s to aid in carving the stone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt the time, we were looking into used machines, since again, our budget was tight. However, Mario offered us an unbeatable price on two new machines with full three-year warranties. These extra machines have been indispensable in continuing the fabrication of stone for our monastery.‚Äù\nBenefits from CNC technology\nThe majority of the pieces carved for the new monastery are very ornate and complex. ‚ÄúThere are only two real options for them ‚Äî carving by hand or using CNC machines,‚Äù said Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúCNC machines are significantly faster than hand carving. They also allow us to carve incredible three-dimensional pieces. Since all of the design is done in a computer in advance, you can tweak and change the design over and over again until it is perfect ‚Äî before you ever place the piece on the CNC. We also use Pegasus CAM, an excellent program that allows us to fully exploit the capabilities of our CNCs. It has an excellent simulation which we use to calibrate the exact amount of detail we put into each piece. Prussiani was indispensable in integrating their machines with Pegasus. It is also notable to mention that we do almost no hand finishing. By leveraging the full capabilities of the CNC, we are able to produce completely finished, complex, foliated pieces without any hand finishing.‚Äù\nAlthough the monks purchased the Champion Plus 1300 in 2013, they did not begin their project until the following year. ‚ÄúAfter a lot of learning, we started carving stone for our monastery in the summer of 2014,‚Äù said Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúWe are still working on the monastery today, and hope to be completed within the next few years.\n‚ÄúPrussiani was very helpful in teaching us how to use their machines, but all of the work of cutting and installing the stone was done by the monks,‚Äù Brother Gabriel Marie went on to say. ‚ÄúWe simply could not afford to pay someone else for this level of craftsmanship. So we learned how.‚Äù\nCurrently, 17 monks are working on the construction of the monastery. ‚ÄúWe cover a wide variety of roles ‚Äî from stonemason to CAM programmer, CNC operator to 3D modeling designer,‚Äù explained Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúWe also do all of our own excavation and heavy equipment operation, and roast coffee to help support ourselves. Actually the proceeds of our coffee business cover all the costs of the stonework on the monastery.‚Äù\nThe learning curve\nStarting with no previous knowledge, there was a significant learning curve, according to Brother Gabriel Marie. ‚ÄúSince the monks do every single part of the process, from design to installation, there was a lot that we had to learn,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe started off knowing that a CNC could do everything we needed it to; we just had to figure out how to talk to it. We are still learning today, but I think we have come a very long way. We‚Äôve definitely had our fair share of pieces that didn‚Äôt make it. Ones where you would walk away scratching your head, ‚ÄòHow did that happen?‚Äô But all of it has helped us to understand a little better how everything works. Everything from computer modeling to toolpath programming to handling such large pieces of stone has been tweaked and refined over and over again. We are very happy with the pieces we can produce now.\n‚ÄúEven though the monastery is not finished, it is mind blowing to think about what has happened over the past few years,‚Äù Brother Gabriel Marie went on to say. ‚ÄúWe can only thank God who has been so good to us, giving each monk the necessary abilities to make this endeavor successful. It is very rewarding to see it all come together in beautiful structures built to last centuries.‚Äù\nThe proposed monastery for the Carmelite Monks will be constructed of simple, durable materials that will last for generations. Indicative of the monks‚Äô traditional manner of living and their monastic roots in the middle ages, the monastery will be designed in a classical, gothic style.","What are the 5 types of building construction?\nBuildings can be categorized into five different types of construction : fire-resistive, non-combustible, ordinary, heavy timber, and wood-framed.\nWhat is meant by construction type?\nConstruction describes what material the building is made of. This does not include the foundation or finishing materials, but rather the structural components of the rest of the home. On a real estate listing, the type of construction is always listed.\nWhat is the difference between Type 3 and Type 5 construction?\nType III allows a mix of non-combustible and combustible materials, while construction Types IV and V can have combustible building materials. Multi-story wood construction generally falls under Types III and V . (However, Type IV multi-story construction , also known as Heavy Timber, is growing in interest.)\nWhat is Type 4 construction?\nType IV construction (Heavy Timber, HT) is that type of construction in which the exterior walls are of noncombustible materials and the interior building elements are of solid or laminated wood without concealed spaces.\nWhat is Type 3 Construction?\nBuilding constructed of non-combustible materials but these materials have no fire resistance. TYPE III -A‚ÄìProtected Combustible (Also known as ‚Äúordinary‚Äù construction with brick or block walls and a. wooden roof or floor assembly which is 1 hour fire protected). 2 Hr.\nWhat is Type 2 construction?\nType 2 construction is typically found in new buildings and remodels of commercial structures. The walls and roofs are constructed of non-combustible materials. Specifically, walls are usually reinforced masonry or tilt slab, while roofs have metal structural members and decking.\nWhat is Type 1 and Type 2 Construction?\nThis type of construction in which the building elements listed in IBC Table 601 are of non-combustible materials, such as concrete and steel. TYPE II ‚Äì This type of building has steel or concrete walls, floors, and structural framework similar to type I construction ; however, the roof covering material is combustible.\nWhat are some examples of construction?\n‚Äò Building a sand castle, a fort out of pillows, or a house of cards are all examples of constructing something. In engineering terms, construction is usually associated with large structures like houses, railways, and power plants.\nWhat is safe construction?\nsafe construction practices are those practices which should be followed in disaster prone areas while constructing houses or any type of buildings so as to avoid so much damage at the time of a disaster. Safer building procedures can minimize thevulnerabilities and risks in many areas.\nWhat is podium style construction?\nPodium buildings are comprised of multiple stories of light-frame wood construction over one, or in some cases, two levels of concrete podium construction . Often, the concrete podium comprises one-story above grade, with two or more parking levels below grade.\nHow are buildings classified?\nThe current 2018 International Building Code (IBC) requires that all buildings and structures , both existing and new, be classified under one of two categories: Occupancy Classification and Use (Chapter 3) Types of Construction (Chapter 6)\nWhat is wrap construction?\nThe wrap -around style is characterized by a central multi-story concrete parking structure surrounded by multiple stories of wood-frame housing. In a typical format, a five-story wrap -around will accommodate 60 to 80 units per acre, a density suited for large urban or suburban areas.\nWhat is Type 1a construction?\nClass 1a ‚Äì a single dwelling or attached dwellings (eg a terrace, duplex, etc) where each dwelling is separated by a fire wall.

{"question":"What capabilities do modern surveillance systems have for identifying vehicles and people, and what safeguards are needed to prevent misuse?","answer":"Modern surveillance systems can automatically identify vehicles through license plate recognition, using specialized cameras and OCR software to capture and process plate information for applications like parking control, toll collection, and stolen vehicle detection. These systems require specific camera specifications including proper resolution (25 pixels per character), lighting, and positioning. For identifying people, real-time facial recognition technology can be integrated into police body cameras to continuously scan and match faces against databases. To prevent misuse, several safeguards are needed: facial recognition should not be the sole basis for arrests, its use should be limited to serious crimes rather than minor offenses, and court approval should be required for location tracking. Without these protections, the technology could enable mass surveillance, discriminatory enforcement due to false positives, and disruption of constitutionally protected activities.","context":["How Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Works\nYou may not have realized it, but Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology is all around us. It is used for toll collecting, to control access to parking lots and even to capture criminals. The technology has improved over the years and has become more economical.\nBesides the analytic software that converts the image to computer characters, the system requires a good IP camera. It also requires proper lighting and the correct physical placement of the camera. The analytic conversion software is similar to optical character recognition (OCR) software. ALPR is available as a standalone LPR system or included as an option with some IP camera video management systems.\nHere are the details about how the license plate recognition system works.\nIP Cameras Capture the License Plate\nThe IP camera is a very important part of the ALPR system. It is critical that the camera provides the very best image. It has to have the right resolution, and be able to capture the license plate image day or night.\nDuring daytime, when there is enough light, most IP cameras will work, but at night the requirements are more challenging. If there isn‚Äôt standard lighting available, IR illumination can be added. This can be a separate light or provided by an IP camera that has a built-in IR illuminator. Many license plates have reflective paint that enhances the number when illuminated by IR. The camera should also support wide dynamic range (WDR) to handle the extreme lighting that may be present. If you would like to capture license plates from oncoming cars, then the IP camera needs the ability to block out headlight glare. For example, the Samsung X-series of IP cameras has Highlight Compensation (HLC) that blocks the glare from the headlights. Here‚Äôs an example:\nThe faster the vehicle moves the more challenging it is to capture and process the license plate images. The IP camera must have a fast frame rate and short shutter time to prevent image smear. The faster the vehicle moves, the shorter the shutter speed required. In many cases, a shutter speed of less than 1/1000 of a second is required to prevent blurring.\nThe camera should be positioned so the license plate is not viewed at an extreme angle. In most systems, the camera captures one lane at a time. The size of the car lane can determine the required camera resolution. The wider the field of view, the higher the resolution required.\nWe need enough resolution so that the license plate reader system can see the characters clearly. Many LPR systems will define the resolution required for their specific system to work reliability. This is usually defined by pixels across the license plate, pixels across a character, or pixels/ft.\nPeople can recognize a blurry character better than a computer. The computer requires more resolution than the human eye. How much resolution is required? For this analysis, it doesn‚Äôt matter how large or small the character is. The right resolution is determined by the number of pixels across a character. The camera‚Äôs field of view can be adjusted so that the pixels across the characters are correct.\nThe chart below shows the lettering used on the tail of an aircraft, and according to FAA regulations, is 12-inches high. The chart shows lettering displayed using 100 pixels high, 50 pixels high, 25 pixels high, 12 pixels high, and 6 pixels high resolution.\nAs you can see, the characters that are 12 pixels high are identifiable to a person, but the OCR algorithm requires more resolution. The software will be more reliable with characters defined by 25 vertical pixel resolution. Since these letters are 12 inches tall, we need 25 pixels/ft to read them correctly. We can use this information to determine the right camera resolution for reading license plates.\nA typical license plate in the US is 12-inches long. Each character is 2.5 inches high. Since we need 25 vertical pixels across the character, we need a camera that will provide 25 pixels / 2.5 inches or 10 pixels/inch.\nOnce we know the resolution across the license plate, we can calculate the resolution of the IP camera. Suppose we want to view a standard US highway. The width of a standard highway lane is 12 ft. (3.7 m). To calculate the total horizontal pictures required, we multiply 10 pixels/in. X 12 ft x 12in./ft = 1440 pixels. A 2-Megapixel camera provides 1920 x 1080 resolution, so this is more than adequate to cover the highway. It actually provides a maximum field of view of 16 ft.\nWe can also calculate the lens we should use. The lens will determine the distance from the camera. We use trigonometry to calculate the angle of the lens we need. Lenses for IP cameras are defined by their ‚Äúmm‚Äù or angle, so it‚Äôs easy to select the right lens. For example, a camera with a 20-degree lens can be placed about 46 ft. away from the point where the camera reads the license plate. For more about selecting the right lens, read our article, Calculating What You Can See With Your Camera.\nLicense Plate Recognition Algorithms\nThe primary technology is optical character recognition (OCR). Before using the OCR function, there are a number of preprocessing functions used to prepare the image for OCR.\nPreprocessing of LPR Image\n- To improve successful recognition, there are several processes used:\n- Plate location ‚Äì This process locates the license plate in the image\n- De-skew, orientation, and sizing ‚Äì The camera can capture a plate at various distances and locations within the field of view. This process corrects the skew, location, and size.\n- Filtering ‚Äì This filtering process removes small spots and anomalies.\n- Normalization ‚Äì License plates can be different colors, brightness, and contrast. The process normalizes the image so it can be used by the OCR function.\n- Character Isolation ‚Äì The process identifies and defines each individual character.\n- Pass the processed image to the OCR function\nThere are two types of algorithms used by OCR engines. The first technique matches the images. It stores all the pixels and matches the pattern of the image against stored images. The second method extracts features such as lines, curves, and intersects to create a match.\nIn all cases, the license plate image is converted to a coded computer character. This information can be compared to a database or just recorded for later use.\nALPR systems are used all over the world. The success of implementation in individual countries depends on the standardizations of the license plates used.\n- Parking entry control ‚Äì A gate controlled by an ALPR system can be used to control access to a garage. A list of allowed tenants can be used to restrict parking lot usage.\n- Automated Parking Fee collection ‚Äì Systems that use ALPR can be used to automatically collect the parking fee. This also requires a database of all people who can use the parking facility.\n- Electronic Toll Collection ‚Äì The ALPR system is usually used as a backup to long range transponders that are in each vehicle. The database is provided by the government so that fees can be billed.\n- Housing Area Gate Control ‚Äì This is similar to parking lot control. A gate is used to control access to a gated community, and automatically opened based on license plate match.\n- Stolen Car identification ‚Äì A list of stolen vehicles can be provided by law enforcement and compared to vehicles on the road.\n- Locating Vehicles against watch lists ‚Äì Locating a criminal, or tracking suspicious persons can be implemented using LPR.\n- Traffic enforcement ‚Äì These systems can be used to capture the license plate of vehicles that go through a red light, or that are speeding.\nAutomated or automatic license plate recognition requires a good camera that is designed for the environment. It requires the right resolution based on the size of the lane. The software requires the image to be preprocessed so it can be used by the optical character recognition software. ALPR systems have become more reliable and are now included with some video management recording systems. These systems are also called Car Plate Recognition (CPR), Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI), or just License Plate Recognition (LPR).\nTo make sure you get the right system, please contact us at 800-431-1658 in the USA, or at 914-944-3425 everywhere else, or use our contact form.","This post was originally published at the Project on Government Oversight. In a report published by The Century Foundation in October 2017, Jake highlighted the serious risks of facial recognition, including those created by adding facial recognition scanning to police body cameras.\nIn recent years, The Constitution Project has warned that adding facial recognition scanning to police body cameras poses serious risks that could undermine basic privacy and due process rights. Unfortunately, the time to prepare for these risks is running out. This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that body camera vendors are preparing body cameras with real-time facial recognition capabilities, and law enforcement agencies could potentially deploy them as soon as this fall.\nReal-time facial recognition is especially concerning because it means that body cameras will continuously scan the face of everyone passing police officers on the street, and immediately log and relay data. Before adding real-time facial recognition to body cameras, it‚Äôs critical that departments and lawmakers implement necessary measures to avert the unprecedented mass collection of the identity and location of individuals in public.\nSet Standards for Police Action That Do Not Depend upon Facial Recognition\nA major issue law enforcement must confront before deploying facial recognition is its inaccuracy. It is well-documented that despite its immense power, facial recognition technology is often wrong, especially when identifying racial minorities. Specifically, these systems are prone to generating false positives, in which the technology identifies a match (e.g., says a person on the street matches the face of a wanted criminal) when in reality the faces are of two entirely different people.\nIt‚Äôs not hard to see how this situation could spin out of control with real-time facial recognition on police body cameras. What if an officer‚Äôs camera misidentifies an innocent person as a dangerous fugitive at large, leading to a violent incident? Even a commonly accepted police use for facial recognition‚Äîsearching for a missing child‚Äîcould turn horribly wrong if a false positive leads an officer to confront a parent as an abductor. Body camera use has grown exponentially because many saw it as a means to improve community‚Äìpolice relations and reduce use-of-force incidents, but adding facial recognition could inflame these problems. Even if misidentifications do not result in use of force, a mere arrest has serious consequences for individuals. They can be detained, fingerprinted, and subject to strip searches‚Äîall merely because a computer program was wrong.\nAt a minimum, facial recognition should not be allowed to serve as the sole basis for an arrest or any use of force.\nIt‚Äôs critical that before police add real-time facial recognition to body cameras, they set proper limits on the degree to which officers can rely on the identifications provided by an imperfect system. At a minimum, facial recognition should not be allowed to serve as the sole basis for an arrest or any use of force. Officers should seek means of corroborating an identification, and in the event of conflict, base their decision on what action to take on the totality of circumstances rather than completely trusting the determinations of a facial recognition program. This principle is consistent with current practices; departments such as the NYPD already require human review to confirm results when facial recognition is applied to crime scene footage. These measures are necessary not just to prevent improper conflicts and arrests, but also to avoid a perverse incentive to build systems that generate more false positives, which would give police more pretexts to stop or arrest people, while limiting their liability for those actions because the identifications were based on the technology.\nLimit Facial Recognition Scans and Identifications to Serious Crimes\nAnother serious risk that facial recognition poses is giving police ‚Äúarrest-at-will authority,‚Äù and this potential is greatest when real-time facial recognition is incorporated into body cameras. Arrests may be a common police function, but they usually occur in response to specific assignments or situations, rather than in a random or opportunistic manner.\nIn some municipalities, a huge portion of the population has active bench warrants for minor violations, such as unpaid parking tickets (which people often don‚Äôt know can lead to an arrest warrant). For example, a 2015 Department of Justice investigation revealed that 16,000 out of the 21,000 residents of Ferguson, Missouri, had outstanding warrants.\nA patrol officer may be able to keep an eye out for the faces on a most-wanted listed, but they can‚Äôt memorize tens of thousands of people with outstanding warrants for petty offenses. Facial recognition changes that: This technology can take a face and scan it against millions of photos in a second. With this tool, every officer could be notified whenever they encounter an individual with any outstanding warrant, no matter how trivial the offense, and have free rein to arrest them.\nThis creates serious risk of abuse, as The Constitution Project‚Äôs comprehensive report on police body cameras‚Äîwhose signatories include both civil liberties advocates and former law enforcement officers‚Äîwarned. This ‚Äúarrest-at-will authority‚Äù could also be wielded to disrupt First Amendment-protected activities. Police could use real-time facial recognition to scan crowds at protests or political rallies, and then arrest anyone flagged for any potential offense‚Äìno matter how trivial. Fear of such abuse isn‚Äôt paranoid‚Äî we‚Äôve already seen it attempted. In 2016, police scanned for and identified any individuals with outstanding warrants among those protesting police brutality in Baltimore, using a social media scraping software tool called Geofeedia. The platforms Geofeedia scraped its data from (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) quickly cut off Geofeedia‚Äôs access in order to end the program, but with police using body cameras equipped with facial recognition, there is no such middleman to block misconduct. This will allow law enforcement to directly disrupt and chill participation in First Amendment-protected activities.\nThe solution to these issues is simple: Facial recognition incorporated into body cameras should only be used in relation to an enumerated set of serious crimes. This would set an effective balance, preventing potential abuses stemming from overbroad use while still allowing a system to flag serious threats for officers. Limiting use of powerful technological tools to serious offenses has precedent. The Wiretap Act, which sets the foundation for law enforcement surveillance of phone calls and electronic communications, is only allowed to apply to a list of serious crimes. The government cannot wiretap everyone suspected of parking violations, and it shouldn‚Äôt be able to deploy mass surveillance across American cities for such minor offenses either.\nProvide Oversight to Prevent Unfettered Location Tracking\nA final risk is that real-time facial recognition in body cameras creates a new avenue for location tracking that is devoid of accountability or oversight. Currently, law enforcement location tracking is mostly conducted by tracking cell phones; the United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing whether this should require a warrant. However, even if the Supreme Court does not impose a warrant standard, cell-phone location tracking still requires some court approval. Facial recognition and body cameras, which currently do not require court approval to use, could cut out this independent oversight entirely, circumventing a basic due-process protection.\nGiven the sheer scale of use of police body cameras in populated areas, facial recognition could allow law enforcement to rapidly scan and locate anyone they desire, and track their movements. This would circumvent privacy rights and independent oversight. It could also chill sensitive activities: If someone sees an officer near a protest, house of worship, political rally, or medical facility, they might (and should) worry that their presence at that location (along with every other attendee) is being logged.\nIn order to prevent abuse and preserve due process, its vital that a court approve any use of body cameras with facial recognition for location tracking, just as court approval is currently a key component of oversight of other forms of electronic location tracking. The best specific rules and standards for this activity may become more clear in light of the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on cell-phone tracking later this spring, but at a minimum police departments should begin preparing to incorporate independent oversight into any type of location tracking for body cameras with facial recognition. The technology is too powerful‚Äîand location information is too sensitive‚Äîfor law enforcement to be unchecked in its use.\nThere are a variety of avenues towards setting effective policies for body cameras. Some police departments have directly stepped up and adopted effective internal guidelines. In other locations, cities have established rules to ensure body cameras provide accountability rather than overbroad surveillance. State legislatures have also set limits to stop body cameras from becoming too pervasive as a surveillance tool. Individuals should consider engaging at all of these different levels of government, but now is the time to act. If we do not, we could soon be in a world where the government has an eye on every street corner, with little oversight or accountability about how it uses this immense power."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3414906f-773c-4964-8b6e-2f9ca041f703>","<urn:uuid:7e2d12ad-1170-4f17-ae35-51c23c7f38e7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does turbulence research rely on Richardson's and Kolmogorov's concepts?","answer":"Turbulence research relies on the concept of energy cascade, which was introduced by L. Richardson in the 1920's. This concept was later refined by A. Kolmogorov, and his ideas continue to dominate the turbulence research community. These frameworks are used to describe the random and multi-scale nature of turbulence.","context":["The week starts with 2 theoretical sessions dealing with multiscale approaches in mechanics and numerical and experimental tools and methods, followed by two practical sessions during which the attendants will be dispatched in the laboratories to manipulate some of the most up-to-date equipment used in research. The last day is dedicated to the specific problem of nanoscale mechanics.\n(click on the programme to go to the corresponding lecture / lab-course description)\n8:30 Welcome coffee\n8:50 Introduction to the winter school\n9:00 A brief introduction to fluid turbulence\nIn spite of centuries of active research Turbulence remains one of the deepest mysteries of fluid mechanics. The complexity relies on the random and multi-scale nature of the phenomenon. This lecture will review the origin and the characteristics of fluid Turbulence, as well as the phenomenological framework and statistical tools commonly used to describe the phenomenon. These rely on the concept of energy cascade, introduced by L. Richardson in the 1920‚Äôs, later refined by A. Kolmogorov, who‚Äôs ideas still dominate the Turbulence research community.\n10:30 Coffee break\n10:50 Multiscale approaches for the modelling and simulations of gas-particle reactive flows under dense\nDense gas-particle reactors are encountered in many industrial systems involving chemical reactions such as the polymerisation of PE and PP for plastic making, the chlorination of zircon in the metallurgical industry, uranium oxide fluorination in the nuclear power industry, as well as biomass gasification, fossil fuels conversion (chemical looping combustion of coal and gas), or crude oil processing in petroleum refineries by fluid catalytic cracking, amongst many others. The modelling of dense gas-particle reactive flows is a very challenging problem as many physical mechanisms need to be taken into account, in particular the numerous interactions between particles (collisions, agglomeration, attrition), between the particles and the fluid (with mass, momentum and energy transfer), and also between the particles and the walls (frictional bouncing, rough wall surface, deposition and resuspension), all of these being coupled with chemical reactions (gaseous and solid combustion, polymerisation‚Ä¶) This presentation will show how different numerical methods capable of describing the phenomena at the micro, meso and the macro scales, are coupled to provide relevant simulations of processes involving dense gas-particle reactive flows.\n12:20 Lunch break\n13:45 Rheology of suspensions - Structure and flow properties of colloidal suspensions\nCourses objectives are the characterization of the link between the flow mechanical properties (flow field, shear or extensional stresses, viscoelasticity moduli) and the structural organizations (aggregation, orientation, phase changes). The goal is to bring an understanding of the mechanisms controlling the flows properties of colloidal dispersions used in several processes (membrane separation, extrusion, film casting) involved in several industrial applications (chemical, bio- and agro-industries, pharmaceutical, water treatment...)\n14:30 Hydrodynamics of suspensions - When particles come to life\nSuspensions are encountered in nature as well as in various industrial processes. Suspensions refer to particles immersed in a liquid like mud, fresh concrete, blood, paints or ink to site but a few examples. A very recent interest with an exponential growing number of publications concerns active suspensions where particles can actively swim in the liquid phase like planktonic suspensions. Usually, the small size of the particles often means that the surrounding flow is dominated by viscous effects, and therefore that inertial forces can be neglected relative to viscous forces. This means that the Reynolds number associated with the particles is small and the flow can be considered as a Stokes flow. The present course aims at providing a physically based introduction to the dynamics of particulate suspensions and focuses on hydrodynamical aspects. We will also briefly summarize recent researches concerning active suspensions.\n15:15 Coffee break\n15:40 Homogenisation of coupled phenomena in heterogeneous materials\nThe macroscopic mechanical behaviour of heterogeneous material strongly depends on the arrangement of the constituents according to various microstructures (granular or porous media, fibrous network) and the physical phenomena involved at the microscale (heterogeneity scale). A fine scale description of such material is often impossible due to the large number of heterogeneities.\nIn practice, a macroscopic equivalent modelling is more efficient. An overview of the different methods that can be used to derived such equivalent macroscopic behaviour will be given.\n17:10 Cocktail and poster session\nAll participants are kindly asked to prepare a poster about their work that will be exposed over the whole school.\nPlease don't forget to bring your poster with you on Monday morning.\n9:00 A brief review of turbulence metrology\nBecause of its intrinsic multi-scale nature, the experimental characterization of turbulence requires dedicated metrological tools, capable to resolve (simultaneously if possible) the whole range of relevant involved scales (both in time and space). The present lecture will review the main contemporary instruments used by the scientific community for such high resolution and multi-scale disgnosis. These include Eulerian methods (such as hot-wire anemometry, laser-Doppler velocimetry and Particle Image Velocimetry) as well as new Lagrangian methods, based on acoustical and optical 3D particle tracking.\n10:30 Coffee break\n10:50 Numerical predictions of turbulent flows\nTurbulent flows are characterised by a large range of motion scales. When turbulent flows are studied by numerical simulations, the explicit discretization of the overall range of scales is still an issue, even with the exponential rise in computational capability over the last few decades. In this presentation, some methods to overcome this limitation will be presented. The methods can consist to model a part of the turbulent fields (RANS and LES approaches), but the methods can also consist to develop numerical algorithm to allow direct numerical simulation with a lower computational cost (hybrid method for turbulent mixing).\n12:20 Lunch break\n13:45 3D experimental micromechanics at the grain scale - What for?\nWith x-ray micro tomography it is now possible to acquire 3D full-field measurements of granular materials at suitable resolutions. In the first applications of x-ray tomography to soil mechanics, the distribution of porosity was investigated with the aim of analyzing the development of localization phenomena in the soil specimen. More recently, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) has been used to determine the distribution of strain in a specimen ‚Äì in a continuum framework ‚Äì and/or individual grain kinematics, i.e., displacements and rotations of individual grains. These works have provided a deep insight into the micro-mechanics of the processes governing the overall behavior of granular materials.\nThis lecture will present recent advances in experimental micro (geo)mechanics achieved thanks to x-ray tomography and digital image analysis. In particular, we will focus on some recent experimental measurements of a 3D fabric tensor and its evolution during shearing of granular materials. Triaxial compression experiments on natural sands are chosen to investigate the evolution of fabric. Two different subsets of the specimen are chosen for the contact fabric analysis: one inside and another one outside a shear band. Individual contact orientations are measured using advanced image analysis approaches within these subsets. Fabric is then statistically captured using a second order tensor and the evolution of its anisotropy is related to the macroscopic behaviour. Finally, some very recent results obtained on fabric evolution from triaxial compression of lentils (i.e., very anisotropic grains!) are also presented.\nMore generally, the lecture will try to convey the following two messages: 1) to convince the audience that x-ray imaging is a measurement tool, not only a way to provide fancy images, and 2) to discuss what sort of modeling applications these rather exotic data can help to inform or inspire.\n15:15 Coffee break\n15:40 Numerical investigations of macroscopic behaviour of heterogeneous materials\nThe macroscopic effective properties or behaviour of heterogeneous materials are commonly invstigated by solving specific boundary value problem on Representative Elementary Volume (i.e. at the microscale) arising from the homogenization process. Nowadays, these boundary value problems (BVP) are commonly solved on 3D images of the material obtained by microtomography or idealized microstructure. Different numerical methods (Finite volume differences, Finite Element method, Discret Element method‚Ä¶) can used to solved the BVP.

Angstrom-size capillaries are thus constructed out of 2D-materials, and we investigate properties of gas, liquids and ions confined in molecular scale. A core strand of the work that I will present is the development of Angstrom-capillaries as a platform to probe intriguing molecular-scale phenomena experimentally, including: water flow under extreme atomic-scale confinement  complete steric exclusion of ions [3,5], specular reflection and quantum effects in gas reflections off a surface [2,7], voltage gating of ion flows  translocation of DNA . Previously such phenomena were only modelled by theoretical simulations and this is the first robust experimental platform with controlled angstrom-scale dimensions made from atomically smooth building blocks, alleviating the surface roughness which usually predominates at this scale. Moreover these √Ö-capillaries represent two-dimensional analogues of artificial sub-nanometer fluidic conduits.\nFig. 1. a, General schematic of Graphene capillary device. b, Cross-sectional bright field image of a bilayer capillary (h about 7 √Ö) in a scanning transmission electron microscope.\n B.

In particular we have been interested in polymer-based systems, either with a nanoscale filler material or combined with other nanostructured materials, for applications at high strain rate. We have synthesized polyurethane composites with Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) at less than 1 wt%, and demonstrated that these materials show a 21% increase in fracture toughness and 35% increase in spall strength. More importantly, our characterization work elucidates the underlying mechanisms of this improvement, and shows that the HNTs are not behaving as a traditional toughening phase in a composite. Rather, they act to favourably modify the microstructure in the surrounding polymer matrix. We also make use of molecular dynamics simulation to understand the ballistic and spall behaviour of polymer and multilayer systems (polymer with metal or ceramic). Our simulations allow us to test some of the common assumptions made in spall experiments and show that at the nanoscale, extremely high ballistic penetration resistance can be observed. We also find that some nanoscale multilayers behave completely counter to our expectations. In this presentation, I will try to summarize the promise and limitations of these nanostructured materials, and convey an appreciation for how molecular dynamics can genuinely help us to design better ballistic materials.\n12:00 X-ray nanotomography from 3D to 4D\nNano-characterization is a key point in the study of microstructures for the understanding of material properties, evolution and degradation. Synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography is one of the key tools for 3D analysis. This presentation will give the characteristics of the technique as well as its limitations. Examples illustrating the use of 3D volumes to feed mechanical and electrochemical simulations will be given. The challenges for in situ experiments will be illustrated with examples of real studies.\n12:30 Lunch break\n13:45 Dynamics at interfaces: from nanoscale interactions to mechanical response\nTransport in nano confined systems is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems, and at the core of various classical fields among which membrane science. Yet a combination of improved technological and theoretical tools lead to the rapid emergence of nanofluidics as a field of its own showing specific properties with high potential applications. In this presentation, I will try to go through some basic elements ruling the transport in liquids at the nanoscale. A first key contribution is associated with the enhanced role of interfaces due to high surface-volume ratio. This includes frictional properties together with cross-coupling capabilities whereby a forcing in one field -say electrical field- generates responses in terms of various currents: electrical but also mass or solute. A second key to nanofluidic response are entrance effects associated with transitions between the nano confined regions towards the macro scale environment. There, conservation constraints are responsible for specific effects such as concentration polarization of large impact over the overall transport properties. Finally, if time allows I will briefly mention recent advances towards ultimate -molecular- confinements bringing in new regime away from continuum approaches.\n14:45 Experimental mechanics: a multiscale approach\nThe transition from the macroscopic to microscopic scales is a central question in mechanics. To address this question, we have developed an original approach based on a surface force apparatus to bridge macroscopic and molecular scales. During the presentation, I will discuss recent results obtained in fluid mechanics, rheology and solid mechanics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e0cfd823-4917-4037-b143-0dbb8f232bae>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the main differences between bread preparation in Jewish and Pakistani cultures?","answer":"In Jewish culture, the bread preparation methods vary based on cultural background - for instance, Ethiopian Jews make spongy sourdough bread called injera, while other Jewish communities make flatbreads like lafa or braided challah. In Pakistani culture, bread preparation primarily centers around the use of clay ovens (tandoors) that reach temperatures of 480 degrees Fahrenheit, where breads are stuck to the sides to bake. The dough is rolled out and retrieved with long rod tongs, with variations in ingredients and preparation methods for different types like tandoori roti, khameeri roti, naan, and specialty breads like sheermal and taftan.","context":["Jewish Culture explore the many musical, experiential and ceremonial expressions of the Jewish experience through culture.\nExplore various expressions of Jewish culture including biblical, Hellenistic, Judeo-Arabic, Sephardic, Ashkenazic, Eastern European, American and Israeli. As we analyze Jewish culture across time and space, we will discuss how Jews both adopted the cultural assumptions of their neighbors and adapted these traditions to preserve\na distinct identity.\nHistory of Jewish Culture\nJewish Culture and History is an inter-disciplinary journal which brings together the best of current research in Jewish social history with innovative work in Jewish cultural studies. The journal includes cutting-edge research by younger scholars as well as established specialists, reviews of recent publications, and a documents section in each issue reproduces selected primary materials from archives and lesser-known resources for the study of Jewish culture and history. The journal explores previously neglected areas of the Jewish experience from a range of different perspectives including Jewish popular culture, social and political history, literary and cultural representation of Jews, and the global contexts of Jewish culture and history.\nJewish Culture And Traditions\nThe Jews have rich culture incorporating assorted ethnic backgrounds, languages and geographic locations. If you are an inquisitive vacationer and looking to explore the historical opulence of Jewish culture in Morocco, planning an excursion to the country with Morocco-Jewish-Tours.com is an ultimate option for you. Morocco Jewry has progressed as an amalgam of several cultures that have created the country itself, namely Arab, Jewish, Spanish, Berber and French. Here are given some of popular Jewish traditions.\n‚ÄòMimouna‚Äô is celebrated on the night after Passover ends, by most Moroccan Jews. Usually the celebration is during evening, but afternoon barbecues and picnics are also common.\nConventional Henna parties are an important part of the Jewish culture in Morocco and take place before special occasions like baby showers, Jewish wedding and Bat Mitzvah. During a Henna party, any older member of the family, usually the grandmother applies henna on the palms of the bride and the groom to emblematically bless them good health, wisdom, and security. It is believed that the henna protects the newlywed couple from demons. After the henna is applied to the groom and the bride, guests can also apply henna on their palms to bring good luck. As per the Jewish culture in Morocco, the bride is not allowed to do household chores till her henna fades off.\nJewish holidays in Israel are traditionally accompanied by very special meals, when families gather together and retell the ancient stories of the land of Israel. The Passover dinner, for example, comes to remind us the story of Exodus. When Moses lead his nation out of the life of slavery in Egypt, the people had only one night to get prepared for the journey. The dough for the bread patties they were making for the road did not have enough time to rise with the help of yeast. In Passover dinner, Jews still eat flat crispy bread, much like crackers called matza. Bread especially made for Saturday night dinner is called challah. It is a sweet fluffy white sesame seed topped bun in the form of a braid. Jews, whose ancestors lived in Ethiopia make a spongy sour dough bread called injera. A large flat bread by the name of Lafa, similarly to quesadilla is used to wrap meat, salad and condiments inside it.\nThough the Jews dress up according to the style of adopted nation, they also love to wear traditional clothing during celebrations like Mimouna, weddings, Bar Mitzvahs or intimate gatherings like Shabbat dinner. As per the Jewish culture in Morocco, men mostly dress in a white jellaba (also known as jellabiya) and women wear ornate kaftans.","Pakistani Cuisine has a variety of breads commonly called ‚ÄúRoti‚Äù in Pakistan.

The program helped states and tribes acquire more than 400,000 acres for resident fish and wildlife, including conserving riparian habitat in Montana for sensitive species like bull trout.\nFor projects like the Chief Joseph Kokanee Enhancement project, more effort is going into the suppression and eradication of non-native invasive species, like northern pike.\nIn some cases, restoration efforts are coupled with harvest opportunities in closed ponds to reduce fishing pressure while habitat recovers. These projects are coupled with education and community engagement to make them successful cultural fisheries.\nTwelve hatcheries and ponds are managed through the Council‚Äôs Fish and Wildlife Program to mitigate anadromous fish losses and impacts to resident fish from hydropower development and operations. Hatchery programs work to recover species like the endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon; reintroduce burbot into the lower Kootenai River; and support efforts to recover westslope cutthroat trout in Montana. Another important purpose is to increase resident fish harvest of trout and sturgeon in Lake Roosevelt above Grand Coulee Dam, as well as provide resident fish for harvest on the reservation for the Shoshone Paiute Tribe, Nez Perce Tribe, Coeur d‚ÄôAlene Tribe, and the Burns Paiute Tribe.\nHatchery programs in Lake Roosevelt produce rainbow trout for sport and tribal subsistence fisheries that also improve ecological conditions in Lake Roosevelt and Banks Lake.\nLearn more about the Council's resident fish hatchery programs.\nOngoing evaluation of hydropower impacts, the effectiveness of habitat investments, and the performance of hatchery programs is a key component to successful programs.\nFor example, collaborative work is underway in the Upper Columbia to collect fishery, habitat, and water quality data to inform management actions and research.\nIn addition to ongoing work to address impacts, managers are monitoring new problems that could affect the region‚Äôs investments. Work to prevent northern pike, a highly invasive species, from overwhelming Lake Roosevelt and the Pend Oreille River is one example of this.\nKey Resident Fish\nBull trout are a char native to the Pacific Northwest and Canada. All populations of the bull trout were listed as Endangered in 1998 and reclassified as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1999. They are usually found in deep pools of large, cold mountain rivers and lakes. Bull trout are a migratory species. Some of these fish might spend their entire lives in the same stream or they may move to larger bodies of water to overwinter and then migrate to smaller streams to reproduce. On the other hand, some bulltrout are born in fresh water and then migrate to the ocean for their adult lives and return to fresh water to reproduce. (For more, see the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.)\nThe Kalispel Tribe is working to restore upstream passage of bull trout at Albeni Falls Dam, reconnect local bull trout populations, and provide access to habitat that has been fragmented.\nThe Idaho Department of Fish and Game implemented a predator suppression effort in Lake Pend Oreille to prevent food web collapse and sustain fish. The effort has a robust monitoring program.\nThe Burns Paiute Tribe is working to remove non-native brook trout to promote the recovery of native bull trout.\nThe Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation identifies habitat restoration needs and areas where extirpated populations can be re-established.\nThe burbot is native to most of Canada and the northern United States and is found in all three major river drainages in Montana. Burbot, also known as ling, are usually found in larger streams and cold, deep lakes and reservoirs. They are peculiar in that they spawn during winter under the ice. They are also largely nocturnal and have an enthusiastic following among fishermen. Burbot are voracious predators and opportunistic feeders. Like other codfish, burbot have livers that contain oils high in vitamins A and D. (For more, see the Montana Field Guide.)\nWhile native to Idaho‚Äôs Kootenai River, burbot were functionally extinct. The Kootenai Tribe and the University of Idaho discovered how to rear them in captivity. Their hatchery is the first successful aquaculture program for burbot.\nIn Lake Roosevelt, efforts to conserve and enhance burbot populations are designed to provide subsistence and recreational harvest opportunities. Stock assessment data and recruitment and early life history information is being gathered and evaluated to identify limiting factors.\nCutthroat trout are freshwater fish in the salmon family. Although inhabiting clear, cold streams in their native range in western North America, this species is becoming a popular sport fish stocked below federal water projects in the Southeast. (For more, see U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.)\nThe Coeur d‚Äô Alene Tribe is working to restore and protect the remaining westslope cutthroat trout populations by targeting watersheds and managing predators.\nSince 2004, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has implemented an intensive conservation management strategy in the South Fork Snake River to support one of the few remaining functioning populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, a culturally significant species to the Shoshone Bannock Tribes.\nWhite sturgeon are found in Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. They are an ancient fish affected by the construction and operations of dams that have altered natural flows, reduced river productivity, and impaired ecological functions. (For more, see our White Sturgeon page, also Idaho Fish and Wildlife.)\nThe Columbia Basin once supported a large and productive population of white sturgeon, with access to hundreds of miles of the Columbia and Snake rivers from the Pacific Ocean upstream far into Idaho and Canada. Sturgeon populations in the Columbia River system have declined from overfishing, dam construction, dam operations and flow regulation, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation.\nThe Yakima Nation is working to develop culture techniques and release juvenile sturgeon to restore existing stocks and to re-introduce sturgeon to areas in the mid-Columbia River. The fish will be reared on the Yakama Reservation at the Yakama Nation Sturgeon Hatchery (see NY Times story).\nThe Kootenai Tribe of Idaho‚Äôs program fosters healthy, productive populations of sturgeon, burbot, and other native fish. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game collects data to inform mitigation strategies. Conservation aquaculture has been used to preserve and protect genetic diversity.\nKokanee are the non-anadromous (non-migrating) form of sockeye salmon and like all salmon, they die after their first spawning. They have a limited range and are endemic to Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia. (For more, see Washington Department of Wildlife.)\nWork conducted by the Confederated Colville Tribe in the upper Columbia seeks to protect and enhance wild kokanee populations. Previous studies produced information on entrainment at Grand Coulee Dam, spawning habitat, development of a genetic database, habitat restoration, and non-native fish impacts.\nSome western mussels use native salmon to complete their life cycle, and benefit from the nutrient-rich salmon carcasses and diversity that healthy salmon runs provide. In turn, salmon and other aquatic species benefit from freshwater mussels. They serve a function like earthworms in your garden by allowing sediment to retain more organic matter and by increasing sediment porosity (For more, see Freshwater Mussels of the Pacific Northwest.)\nWork conducted by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation focuses on the long-term goal of restoration of freshwater mussels to the Umatilla River basin and other ceded subbasins as part of ongoing efforts to rebuild ecosystem diversity, function, and traditional cultural opportunities in the region."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4330ca2b-80d1-4335-b52d-02ced239eac2>","<urn:uuid:ed8b936b-33bd-454c-89a6-f7d49c13c26c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm planning a video shoot and wondering about crew sizes. What's the key difference between handling night scenes in a Hollywood-style production versus a microbudget film production?","answer":"In a microbudget film production, night scenes are handled by temporarily expanding the core crew, specifically by bringing in a dedicated gaffer for the required days while keeping the overall crew minimal. The crew might increase from 6 people to around 9 people just for those specific night shoots. In contrast, a Hollywood-style production (described as having 5-7+ crew members) maintains a full-time gaffer and complete lighting department throughout the production, regardless of whether it's day or night shooting. This difference reflects the broader contrast in approach - microbudget productions focus on strategic scheduling to minimize crew size and costs, while Hollywood-style productions prioritize having all specialized roles filled consistently to ensure every shot is pristine and perfect.","context":["These days, what distinguishes a flick produced on a shoestring is the professionalism and craft with which it‚Äôs made.\nThe audience doesn‚Äôt care about the scale of production; if the flick looks good, sounds good, takes place in believable locations, and has actors delivering credible performances, it will be taken seriously by distributors, press and the movie-going public. The challenge to the indie moviemaker is to figure out how to accomplish this with a tiny fraction of the resources Hollywood has at its disposal‚Äîincluding manpower.\nIf you‚Äôve ever worked on a studio production, been to film school, or watched making-of documentaries on HBO, you know that a ‚Äúproper‚Äù movie crew is divided into a number of complex departments with a multitude of positions. A big-budget flick has hundreds‚Äîsometimes thousands‚Äîof folks working on location. Even a stripped-down crew usually means a head count of 30 to 40 people.\nIn the microbudget realm, however, maintaining a crew of that size is completely cost-prohibitive. It‚Äôs not about paying salaries (at this budget level there probably aren‚Äôt any); you‚Äôll also be spending money you don‚Äôt have feeding, staging, and providing parking for dozens of people. Having a large crew increases your ‚Äúproduction footprint,‚Äù and if you want to minimize costs on things like location fees, permits, and insurance, then the smaller the better. A tiny crew also mobilizes faster, and can be more nimble if and when you choose to shoot guerilla-style. As most of your budget will be spent during production, working quickly and efficiently is critical.\nIn order to optimize your personnel for a shoestring production, you‚Äôre best served rethinking how a crew works and identifying the positions you absolutely must fill. If a studio crew is like an army, the members of a microbudget crew are commandos, each one with a specific role vital to the success of the mission. Of course, every movie is different and you should craft the crew positions structure to its specific needs. Below I‚Äôve detailed how we did this for my flick Favor, made for under $30,000 with a team of about six people.\nIdentify Your Labor Needs\nEvery movie needs someone to operate camera and sound, but beyond that, all other positions are, theoretically, optional. Edward Burns‚Äô microbudget rom-com Newlyweds took a cinema verit√© approach and was completed for $9,000 with a crew of two. Take a hard look at your script and determine what your labor requirements really are: If you‚Äôre doing a slasher flick with lots of gore and prosthetics, you can‚Äôt skimp on a dedicated makeup SFX person; if you‚Äôre doing a movie that‚Äôs largely improvised, you probably want to account for more than one cameraman.\nWhatever your specific needs, an important thing to remember is that your crew doesn‚Äôt have to be the same size every day. On Favor, we had a night when the crew swelled to nine people, shooting bloody practical effects in the desert, which required SFX artists and extra hands for lighting. Another day the crew shrank to one, with only myself behind the camera ‚Äústealing‚Äù a gas station scene with a single actor, sans permits. The trick is to schedule wisely so you can have as many days with a lean crew as possible. For example, if your shoot is three weeks long, identify the scenes that require the fewest crewmembers and tackle them all in the first week. Perhaps you only need a few people until week two, and then only five people until week three. In your last days your crew may balloon to a headcount of 10, but during your first two weeks, you‚Äôll pay for a production half that size.\nBecause we hired SAG actors for Favor and were therefore responsible for a mountain of paperwork, we needed a production manager to deal with all the legalities and logistics. The script called for a fair amount of specific props and some of our locations weren‚Äôt quite camera-ready, so we brought on a production designer who functioned as the entire art department. Every movie also needs a cinematographer, although on many microbudget productions, including ours, the director doubles as cameraman.\nLastly, it‚Äôs wise to have at least one production assistant available to make runs or fill in for any position needed at any given moment.\nGet Yourself a Joe\nOn Favor, we were able to boil down sound recording, boom operating, assistant camera and grip/electric into one position, a technical catchall-type job for which there is no proper name. The guy who did this for us was named Joe, so for the purposes of this article, I‚Äôm naming this position after him. A ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù works closely with the cinematographer setting up camera and lighting gear, which in the microbudget realm is usually very limited and simple. During rehearsals, Joe sets audio levels, and when the camera rolls, Joe‚Äôs running boom.\nI‚Äôve met a lot of shoestring moviemakers who‚Äôve redesigned their crews in a myriad of ways, but interestingly, nearly every single one of them has had a Joe. (On Zak Forsman‚Äôs action thriller Down and Dangerous, for example, their Joe was named Sam.) Joes do sometimes need additional help, but on an average microbudget shoot day, they can cover almost every technical department. Make sure you have a Joe.\nPositions You May Minimize\nDuring the day, microbudget productions can utilize natural and available light easily, but once you‚Äôre shooting at night or in complicated interior locations, you‚Äôll want to give your Joe some relief and bring in a dedicated gaffer. A wise scheduling move is to group together the days you need a gaffer, so you can keep the time you employ him or her to a tight minimum. With a shorter time commitment, you can potentially get a higher-quality gaffer to sign on.\nWhile your performers will likely provide most of their own wardrobes, it‚Äôs dangerous to let them handle the clothes selected for the shoot. What if your actor brings the wrong shirt to set, or forgets which dress you need for the second half of a scene you started shooting two weeks ago? While you don‚Äôt need to have a costume wrangler on set every day, it is wise to have a dedicated person to collect all these clothes and keep them clean and organized. In order to avoid continuity problems, the costume wrangler can create a notebook with photographs of all the clothes, each article assigned with a simple code which corresponds to the scenes in which it‚Äôs used. Then the director, production manager or actor can use this book identify what exactly needs to be worn on any given day, and the costume wrangler only needs to come in every so often to clean, steam and repair the wardrobe.\nLastly, every production, no matter how small, should capture extensive behind-the-scenes videos and photographs for later promotional use. You should have a unit photographer armed with a DSLR (for both stills and video), but you don‚Äôt necessarily need this person every day. Identify when you are shooting your most impressive stuff‚Äîthe shootout in the warehouse, the fireworks-on-the-beach scene, or the sequence when your two leads meet-cute on the Brooklyn Bridge‚Äîand make sure those are the times you have your unit photographer present. On the days with no UP, leave the DSLR out on set and let your crew know that, if anyone finds themselves with nothing to do, they‚Äôre free to pick it up and shoot whatever they like. (Only do this in controlled locations, of course. You don‚Äôt want the thing stolen.) Every time we did this on Favor someone would invariably grab the camera and capture additional behind-the-scenes material.\nPositions You May Eliminate\nThe most immediately expendable position on a ‚Äústandard crew‚Äù is the script supervisor. Because digital footage can be instantly replayed, almost all continuity questions can be answered by simply watching the previous takes. The actors, art and wardrobe departments should also have their own continuity protocols in place, and I‚Äôve never met a single editor who actually uses the script supervisor‚Äôs notes.\nYou can get by without make-up and hair artists, provided the performers are comfortable taking on this duty for themselves. (Most professional actors have theater experience and are asked to do this for stage productions.) The tasks of an assistant director can be divided up between the production manager and the director. Additionally, the production manager could absorb the responsibilities of location manager and utilize the production assistant for craft services. Catering can be completely farmed out to nearby restaurants, with food ordered by the production manager and put out by the production assistant. Just make sure thought and care is placed into acquiring quality meals, or your little crew is bound to mutiny.","Here's a multiple choice question for you. When a movie ends and the credits roll, what do you do?\n- Watch the credits and hope for a post-credit scene\n- Watch the credits because you're interested in who made the movie happen\n- Dash out the door when they start, hoping to beat the traffic\nAs a video producer, I'm ashamed to admit but I dash for the door. Yes, I make mini-movies, so to speak, for a living, but I just don't care who the best boy was.\nAnd really, does anyone (other than people in the industry) know the differences between the production assistant and the production coordinator? The prop maker and the prop master?\nRecently, I had a conversation with someone who was looking to create a promotional video.\nProspective client: \"I just don't like big productions. It doesn't need to be Hollywood.\"\nMe: \"What do you mean by big production?\"\nProspective client: \"There are all of these people standing around, and I don't even know what they do. It feels excessive for a two-minute video about our company.\"\nAnd you know what? This person is right. You often don't need a huge video production for your video.\nWith that said, here are three different types of video production team, all of which I've been a part of at one time or another\n- Basic Crew - Videographer and Producer\n- Expanded Crew - Videographer, Producer, Audio Technician, and Grip\n- Hollywood Crew - Too many to list here. I'll get to these shortly\nBasic Crew - Videographer and Producer\nAnyone who knows me professionally, knows I prefer the basic crew. Why? Because there are only two moving parts ‚Äî a videographer and a producer. This is often all that is needed when creating a highly effective, engaging, and professional corporate video. A talented videographer/producer team can efficiently capture the right content, and often more content, because there are fewer people to manage, and they can be more nimble and flexible.\nFor example, and this happens on many of my shoots, I'll be capturing footage and notice something unexpected that enhances my client's story. With a two-person crew, it's pretty easy to break from the schedule or plan and go capture the additional footage. With more than two people, it's much more difficult to choreograph this change in plans. Often, with a bigger crew, this spontaneity usually comes with a cost such as dropping other shots. With a smaller crew, you're much more likely to keep on schedule even when you're thrown a curve ball.\nHere is an example of a video produced with a basic producer and a videographer crew.\nEven though I'm partial to the basic crew, sometimes you just need more help. With an expanded crew, you can expect additional team members like an audio technician, a grip, or a makeup artist to go along with the videographer and the producer.\nAn audio technician is brought on board when capturing the sound is crucial to the story. In a basic crew, the videographer is also in charge of the audio. For the expanded crew, the videographer solely focuses on the images and the audio technician focuses on the sound. When location conditions are less than ideal for sound, I like to include an audio technician to make sure the audio is crystal clear.\nOften, an expanded crew includes a grip, or a person who helps in any way they can ‚Äî like setting up the gear, lights, etc. (Note, this is not an official definition. Some filmmakers might call me out on this, so please, see below for a list of unofficial titles and job duties.)\nHere is a video that included a grip and an audio technician along with the producer and videographer. The grip was vital because we were lugging gear up and down stairs with a lot of different setups for interviews. Some of the rooms were a challenge for audio because the acoustics were really tricky, so we also brought in an audio technician.\nThis title might be a bit of an exaggeration, but anything over 5-7 crew members I consider a Hollywood-type crew. The time to bring in a Hollywood crew is when each and every shot has to be pristine. Everything must be perfect. I've found more and more that this isn't always necessary for corporate videos, but there are always exceptions.\nI won't go into too much detail here and list the additional crew members, but this is where you'll start seeing people like craft services (they provide food), director of photography (the person who is in charge of the videographer), a gaffer (a person in charge of lighting) and so on.\nSo, when is it necessary to hire the Hollywood crew? When you're creating a national TV spot, I'd say go for it! Your image is everything, so don't skimp on the production. Keep in mind, the more professionals involved with your production, the higher the costs.\nHere is a video that would call for a Hollywood crew:\nUnderstading Video Production Crew Titles\nIf you're planning a video shoot, here is a short list of some crew titles and their responsibilities to help you understand what everyone does. But keep in mind, these are high-level definitions (so don't start throwing tomatoes, video production junkies).\nVideographer - The videographer is the person running the camera.\nProducer - The producer is in charge of the project. She/he often deals with the details and the money. For corporate videos, a producer often takes on the role of the director during the video shoot.\nDirector - The director is often the same person as the producer on smaller video shoots. The director's job is to make sure the shoot keeps moving forward and basically, tells everyone on the set what to do.\nAudio Technician - The audio tech captures the sound. On small crews, audio techs sometimes double as a grip.\nGaffer - The gaffer is in charge of lighting.\nGrip - The grip works with the gaffer to help adjust lights. On a smaller crew, the grip is like the utility player in baseball, helping out in a variety of ways. (Note, if there is more than one grip on set, the crew could have a key grip in charge of the grip team.)\nBest Boy - The best boy is the key grip's number one assistant. They do things like make sure the lights have power or rent the lights needed for the project. (FYI - I've never had a best boy on a single video project.)\nMakeup/Hair Stylist/Wardrobe - This one is self-explanatory.\nProduction Assistant - Production assistants work closely with the producer/director to do whatever is asked of them. Usually, it's things like printing scripts, picking up the gear, or bringing Diet Coke to the producer.\nCraft Services - Craft services is everyone's favorite. They provide the food and beverages.\nTalent - This is the person or people who will be on camera. Talent can be actors or company employees.\nI could go on and on, but these are some of the more common video crew members. This can be a lot to take in. Things get more complicated (and more expensive) when you add a larger crew to the video shoot. That's why I stick to the basic crew whenever possible."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d1baa14f-34a4-4cf6-b3be-6f8ccfd5d728>","<urn:uuid:03039c96-33f3-4056-8a5b-f420dfcb240e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities exist between how primates and humans process complex patterns versus face recognition?","answer":"Both primates and humans share fundamental pattern recognition capabilities. In complex situations, humans have an evolutionary tendency to seek and learn patterns for survival, like identifying safe berries or predicting animal behavior. Similarly, in face recognition, research shows that rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees exhibit the same Thatcher effect as humans, suggesting that these face processing mechanisms evolved in a common ancestor over 30 million years ago. This indicates that both complex pattern recognition and face processing abilities have deep evolutionary roots shared across primates.","context":["We probe, then sense, then respond.\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with Cynefin, you know that we categorize the obvious, analyze the complicated, probe the complex and act in chaos.\nYou might also know that those approaches to the different domains come with a direction to sense and respond, as well. In the ordered domains ‚Äì the obvious and complicated, in which cause and effect are correlated ‚Äì we sense first, then we categorize or analyze, and then we respond.\nIn the complex and chaotic domains, we either probe or act first, then sense, then respond.\nMost people find action in chaos to be intuitive. It‚Äôs a transient domain, after all; it resolves itself quickly, and it might not resolve itself in your favour‚Ä¶ and is even less likely to do so if you don‚Äôt act (the shallow dive into chaos notwithstanding). We don‚Äôt sit around asking, ‚ÄúHm, I wonder what‚Äôs causing this fire?‚Äù We focus on putting the fire out first, and that makes sense.\nBut why do we do this in the complex domain? Why isn‚Äôt it useful to make sense of what we‚Äôre seeing first, before we design our experiments?\nAs with many questions involving human cognition, the answer is: cognitive bias.\nWe see patterns which don‚Äôt exist.\nThe term ‚Äúepiphany‚Äù can be loosely defined as that moment when you say, ‚ÄúOh! I get it!‚Äù because you‚Äôve got a sudden sense of understanding something.\nThe term ‚Äúapophany‚Äù was originally coined as a German word for the same phenomenon in schizophrenic experiences; that moment when a sufferer says, ‚ÄúOh! I get it!‚Äù when they really don‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs not just schizophrenics who suffer from this. We all have this tendency to some degree. Pareidolia, the tendency to see faces in objects, is probably the best-known type of apophenia, but we see patterns everywhere.\nIt‚Äôs an important part of our survival. If we learn that the berry from that tree with those type of leaves isn‚Äôt good for us, or to be careful of that rock because there are often snakes sunning themselves there, or to watch out for the slippery moss, or that the deer come down here to drink and you can catch them more easily, then you have a greater chance of survival. We‚Äôre always, always looking out for patterns. In fact, when we find them, it‚Äôs so enjoyable that this pattern-learning, and application of patterns in new contexts, forms the heart of video games and is one reason why they‚Äôre horribly addictive.\nIn fact, our brains reward us for almost seeing the pattern, which encourages us to keep trying‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs why gambling is also addictive, because a lot of the time, we almost win.\nIn the complex domain, cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect.\nThis is pretty much the definition of a complex domain; one in which we can‚Äôt understand cause and effect until after we‚Äôve caused the effect. Additionally, if you do the same thing again and again in a complex domain, it will not always have the same effect each time, so we can‚Äôt be sure of which cause might give us the effect. Even the act of trying to make sense of the domain can itself have unexpected consequences!\nThe problem is, we keep thinking we understand the problem. We can see the root causes. ‚ÄúOh! I get it!‚Äù‚Ä¶ and off we blithely go to ‚Äúfix‚Äù our systems.\nThen we‚Äôre surprised when, for instance, complexity reasserts itself and making our entire organization adopt Scrum doesn‚Äôt actually enable us to deliver software like we thought it would (though it might cause chaos, which can give us other opportunities‚Ä¶ if we survive it).\nThis is the danger of sensing the problem in the complex domain; our tendency to assume we can see the causes that we need to shift to get the desired effects. And we really can‚Äôt.\nThe best probes are hypothesis-free.\nOr rather, the hypothesis is always, ‚ÄúI think this might have a good impact.‚Äù Having a reasonable reason for thinking this is called coherence. It‚Äôs really hard, though, to avoid tacking on, ‚Äú‚Ä¶because this will be the outcome.‚Äù In the complex domain, you don‚Äôt know what the outcome is going to be. It might not be a good outcome. That‚Äôs why we spend so much time making sure our probes are safe-to-fail.\nI‚Äôve written a fair bit on how to use scenarios to help generate robust experiments, but stories ‚Äì human tales of what‚Äôs happening or has happened ‚Äì are also a good way to find places that probes might be useful.\nParticularly, if you can‚Äôt avoid having a hypothesis around outcomes (and you really can‚Äôt), one trick you can try is to have multiple outcomes. These can be conflicting, to help you check that you‚Äôre not hung up on any one outcome, or even failure outcomes that you can use to make sure your probe really is safe-to-fail.\nHaving multiple hypotheses means we‚Äôre more likely to find other things that we might need to measure, or other things that we need to make safe.\nI really love Sensemaker.\nCognitive Edge, founded by Dave Snowden of Cynefin fame, has a really lovely bit of software called Sensemaker that collects narrative fragments ‚Äì small stories ‚Äì and allows the people who write those stories to say something about their desirability using Triads and Dyads and Stones.\nBecause we don‚Äôt know whether a story is desirable or not, the Triads and Dyads that Sensemaker uses are designed to allow for ambiguity. They usually consist of either two or three things that are all good, all bad or all neutral.\nFor instance, if I want to collect stories about pair programming, I might use a Dyad which has ‚ÄúI want to pair-program on absolutely everything!‚Äù at one end, and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to pair-program on anything, ever,‚Äù at the other. Both of those are so extreme that it‚Äôs unlikely anyone wants to be right at either end, but they might be close. Or somewhere in the middle.\nIn CultureScan, Cognitive Edge use the triad, ‚ÄúAttitudes were about: Control, Vulnerability, or Indifference.‚Äù You can see more examples of triads, together with how they work, in the demo.\nIf lots and lots of people add stories, then we start seeing clusters of patterns, and we can start to think of places where experiments might be possible.\nIn the fitness landscapes revealed by the stories, tightly-bound clusters indicate that the whole system is pretty rigidly set up to provide the stories being seen. We can only move them if there‚Äôs something to move them to; for instance, an adjacent cluster. Shifting these will require big changes to the system, which means a higher appetite for risk and failure, for which you need a real sense of urgency.\nIf you start seeing saddle-points, however, or looser clusters‚Ä¶ well, that means there‚Äôs support there for something different, and we can make smaller changes that begin to shift the stories.\nBy looking to see what kind of things the stories there talk about, we can think of experiments we might like to perform. The stories though have to be given to the people who are actually going to run the experiments. Interpreting them or suggesting experiments is heading into analysis territory, which won‚Äôt help! Let the people on the ground try things out, and teach them how to design great experiments.\nA good probe can be amplified or dampened, watched for success or failure, and is coherent.\nCognitive Edge have a practice called Ritual Dissent, that‚Äôs a bit like the ‚ÄúFly on the Wall‚Äù pattern, but is done in a pretty negative way, in that the group to whom the experiment is being presented critiques it against the criteria above. I‚Äôve found that testers, with their critical, ‚ÄúWhat about this scenario?‚Äù mindsets, can really help to make sure that probes really are good probes. Make sure the person presenting can take the criticism!\nThere‚Äôs a tendency in human beings, though, to analyze their way out of failure; to think of failure scenarios, then stop those happening. Failure feels bad. It tells us that our patterns were wrong! That we were suffering from apophany, not epiphany.\nBut we don‚Äôt need to be afraid of apophany. Instead of avoiding failure, we can make our probes safe-to-fail; perhaps by doing them at a scale where failure is survivable, or with safety nets that turn commitments into options instead (like having roll-back capability when releasing, for instance), or ‚Äì my favourite ‚Äì simply avoiding the trap of signalling intent when we didn‚Äôt mean to, and instead, communicating to people who might care that it‚Äôs an experiment we want to try.\nAnd that it might just make a difference.","The Thatcher effect or Thatcher illusion is a phenomenon where it becomes more difficult to detect local feature changes in an upside-down face, despite identical changes being obvious in an upright face. It is named after British former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on whose photograph the effect was first and most famously demonstrated. The effect was originally created by Psychology Professor Peter Thompson in 1980.\nThe effect is illustrated by two originally identical photos, which are inverted. The second picture is obviously altered so that the eyes and mouth are vertically flipped, though the changes are not immediately obvious until the image is viewed in normal orientation.\nThis is thought to be due to specific psychological cognitive modules involved in face perception which are tuned especially to upright faces. Faces seem unique despite the fact that they are very similar. It has been hypothesised that we develop specific processes to differentiate between faces that rely as much on the configuration (the structural relationship between individual features on the face) as the details of individual face features, such as the eyes, nose and mouth.\nThis effect is not present in people who have some forms of prosopagnosia, a disorder where face processing is impaired, usually acquired after brain injury or illness. This suggests that their specific brain injury may damage the process that analyses facial structures.\nThere is plenty of evidence that rhesus monkeys  as well as chimpanzees (Weldon et al., 2013) exhibit the Thatcher effect, raising the possibility that some brain mechanisms involved in processing faces may have evolved in a common ancestor more than 30 million years ago.\nThe basic principles of the Thatcher Effect in face perception have also been applied to biological motion. The local inversion of individual dots is hard, and in some cases, nearly impossible to recognize when the entire figure is inverted.\n- Thompson, P. (1980). Margaret Thatcher: a new illusion.

WebTrak is a system that allows you to watch the movement of flights and air traffic patterns within the greater Los Angeles region. This flight tracking system includes specific information about flights from LAX, Santa Monica (SMO), Long Beach (LGB), Hawthorne (HHR) and Torrance (TOA) airports, as well as information on air traffic transiting through the Los Angeles region. Information shown includes the aircraft‚Äôs type, altitude, origin/destination airports, and flight identification.\n- Green aircraft icons represent departures from LAX.\n- Blue aircraft icons represent arrivals to LAX.\n- Yellow aircraft icons represent aircraft operations to/from LGB, SMO, HHR or TOA.\n- Black aircraft icons represent aircraft operating to or from another airport in the region, or that are transiting through the region and bypassing local airports.\nReal time and historical flight and aircraft radar data originate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)‚Äôs National Offload Program (NOP). The NOP radar flight track data is downloaded and processed by LAWA‚Äôs Airport Noise and Operations Management System (ANOMS).\nReal time data is viewed in the Live Mode and is delayed up to 60 minutes for aviation security reasons and for preliminary system processing. Historical data is viewed in the Replay Mode and is the fully processed data available up to 90 days in the past. For more information, please refer to the Help section of the WebTrak website. Noise data from the numerous permanent noise monitoring terminals (NMTs) located in the vicinity of LAX are available in both the Live and Replay Modes.\nIf you are a first time user of this system, please take a few minutes to read the ‚ÄúStart Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúLegend,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù tabs in the upper left corner of the WebTrak site.

You do not have to identify a flight to submit a comment; however, the Comment tab will allow you to research the flight track data to find an aircraft operation that may have raised your concern. If you do find it, WebTrak allows you to submit a comment for that specific operation and fills in the information automatically.\nNoise Readings on WebTrak\nNoise readings shown on WebTrak at the numerous noise monitors in the vicinity of LAX are real time noise levels represented by the A-weighted sound pressure level reading. A-weighted decibels, abbreviated dBA, are an expression of the relative loudness of sounds in air as perceived by the human ear. These noise levels represent the actual real time sound level at that location at that moment in time, and may be the result of an aircraft flying over or near the noise monitor. These noise levels may also be attributed to community-based noise, such as vehicle traffic, lawnmowers, etc. or just the ambient noise at that location. When using the Replay Mode in WebTrak, the noise events that correlate to an aircraft operation are shown with a square icon.\nThe real time noise readings shown on WebTrak at the noise monitors should not be confused with the annual CNEL, or Community Noise Equivalent Level. The annual CNEL is a noise metric used to describe the average sound level during a 24-hour period, averaged over the course of a year, and does not represent the sound level heard at any particular time. In computing CNEL, the total noise energy for each aircraft noise event is counted, with extra weighting added for aircraft noise events occurring between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. (3 times), and 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. (10 times). This weighting is done to account for increased annoyance during noise sensitive hours when ambient noise levels are generally lower and people are more likely to be at home and/or trying to sleep.\nWebTrak is best viewed using a high-speed broadband Internet connection. A dial-up connection may also be used but loading the application and data will be much slower resulting in longer waiting periods, and it will not be possible to use high levels of acceleration when replaying flights.\nWebTrak requires that Flash 9, or higher, be installed on your computer. Flash should automatically update to the correct version. If you have difficulties with Flash then you should refer to the Adobe product page for Flash 9. Your computer should meet the following minimum specifications:\n- Windows 98 or later, or Mac OS/X\n- 128MB of RAM (256 MB recommended)\n- 500MHz processor (1 GHz recommended)\nInternet Explorer 6+ or Firefox 2+ are recommended for Windows users, and Safari on the Mac. Other browsers may work but they have not been tested.\nReliability of Radar Information\nThe intended use of this Web site is to display the general location and flow of air traffic in the greater Los Angeles region. WebTrak information is not intended for navigational purposes or airline schedule information. While ANOMS processes a large quantity of radar data with a very high level of accuracy, in a small number of cases, flight plan and noise data may not be correlated correctly. You may also notice aircraft icons sometimes \"dropping off\" and/or suddenly doing unusual things. This is especially true in the area immediately around LAX, but could also occur away from the airport as well. These \"ghost\" aircraft are due to radar and aircraft transponder reflections from the ground and high rise buildings around the airport, and possibly from terrain and meteorological conditions farther away from LAX.\nThis web page and the flight tracking information is a public resource of general information.

{"question":"I've been studying religious identity formation. How did early Christians develop their religious identity in relation to surrounding cultures, and how does this compare to modern evangelicals' identity formation in Northern Ireland?","answer":"Early Christians formed their identities through complex interactions with Greco-Roman culture and society, particularly in the second and third centuries. They developed diverging self-identities while navigating their relationship with the dominant culture, often through literature and social practices. In modern Northern Ireland, evangelical identity formation shows similar complexity but in a different context. Contemporary evangelicals form their identities through various journeys - from converting to evangelicalism, deepening their faith, maintaining steady beliefs, moderating their views, transforming their faith, or leaving entirely. Their identity development is influenced by factors such as childhood socialization, relationships with other evangelicals, crisis experiences, and their engagement with broader society, particularly in relation to Catholic-Protestant dynamics.","context":["Professor of Church History\nPhone: (805) 565-6834\nOffice Location: Porter Center 14\nMon. 11:30 - 12:30 p.m. (lunch) & 3:15 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.\nWed. 11:30 - 12:30 p.m. (lunch) & 3:15 p.m .- 4:30 p.m.\nFriday 11:30 - 12:30 p.m.\nGreco-Roman religions and society, Patristics--early Christian literature\nDr. Helen Rhee is an Associate Professor of Religous Studies at\nWestmont College, Santa Barbara, CA.

The audio from that evening is still available online. And just a few weeks ago, William Crawley interviewed Gladys and Claire on Sunday Sequence ‚Äì there‚Äôs a link to the audio on Gladys‚Äô blog.\nBased on each person‚Äôs description of their faith development and their spiritual turning points, the authors loosely categorise them into one of six journeys.\n- Converting to evangelicalism\n- Deepening evangelicalism\n- Maintaining a steady faith\n- Moderating evangelicalism\n- Transforming evangelicalism\n- Leaving evangelicalism\nThe main part of the book consists of a chapter per type of journey, dipping in and out of the individual stories, noting the similarity and diversity in the experiences.\nFor non-believers, we think these stories can provide insight into what it is like to be religious in the contemporary world. For those who are evangelicals, we think these stories may help in the process of reflecting on their own religious journeys ‚Ä¶ readers may also be able to identify with some of the people they meet in the book.\nBecause it‚Äôs peppered with the voices of those interviewed, Evangelical Journeys is a captivating read. There‚Äôs an element of spot-your-own-journey as you read, as well as a constant challenge to the tenets that prop up ‚Äì or are the foundations of ‚Äì your own faith as you grow to understand so many other people‚Äôs journeys.\nOne fundamental observation is that although someone‚Äôs initial denominational involvement tends to be an accident of birth (primarily their parents), subsequent decisions that ‚Äúchange and alter their religious views ‚Ä¶ are not random choices‚Äù but stem from conscious reactions to their physical and mental health as well as to their peers.\nThe authors steer clear of trying to define ‚Äòevangelicalism‚Äô or adopting stereotypes. They acknowledge that ‚Äúaspects of evangelicalism have contributed [enormously] to the conflict in Northern Ireland‚Äù but dismiss any simplistic notions that evangelicalism is either ‚Äúrigid and unchanging‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupied with politics‚Äù pointing to examples of change, diversification, political withdrawal as well as strong social action resulting from ethical outrage and conscience.\nConverting to evangelicalism. Unlike the other five journeys, nearly all interviewees described conversion as part of their religious journey, most commonly referring to one (or more) incidents before the age of ten. Childhood socialisation through attending church and Sunday schools ‚Äì even with only nominally Christian parents ‚Äì has a major influence on individuals.\nAll of those who converted as adults had some familiarity with evangelicalism from childhood. When they encountered evangelicalism in later life, this was not radically new information.\nRelationships with evangelicals (‚Äòadvocates‚Äô who initiate conversation), crisis and trauma were all noted as tipping points on the conversion journey.\nEven where conversion takes place in a dramatic or emotional way, it seldom occurs without a great deal of prior active deliberation on the part of the potential convert.\nDeepening evangelicalism. A subset of evangelicals become more deeply conservative. At the time of their interview, all identified themselves as DUP voters ‚Äì though remember it was a qualitative sample rather than demographically balanced (the chapter on methods explains more).\nQuite a number of people in this chapter identified themselves as fundamentalists ‚Ä¶ A smaller group ‚Ä¶ detailed study of biblical doctrine was paramount ‚Ä¶ Some ‚Ä¶ value Calvinistic interpretations of the relationship between church and state. Some people whose faith was deepening described themselves as ‚Äòright-wing conservatives‚Äô, ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô, ‚Äòsaved‚Äô and ‚Äòborn-again‚Äô.\nChurch activity fills the week of many of these people, surrounded ‚Äúwith godly people‚Äù, and a reduction of individuals‚Äô contact with non-evangelicals. The authors found that some of their interviewees saw the NI peace process as a sign of the end times. One forty-something policewoman (identified as ‚ÄòHelen‚Äô in the book) felt that it is getting harder for Protestant Christians and said the ‚Äúgreen [nationalist] victory‚Äù in Northern Ireland is ‚Äúa sign of the times‚Äù.\nFor her, the presence of ‚Äòmurderers‚Äô in the Northern Ireland Assembly ties in with predictions in the biblical book of Revelation that in the last days evil men will rule the earth.\nAt one time extremely politically active and vocal, Helen has withdrawn from political involvement. A keen home-decorator, she says that ‚Äúif she is doing anything in the house she will ‚Äòhurry up and get something picked‚Äô before Armageddon‚Äù. The authors note:\nWhilst we should not make more of this comment than was intended, it is interesting to note that Helen continues to improve those temporal things around her that she has control over, such as her home, and does not attempt to change things in areas of life where she feels powerless, such as Northern Ireland politics.\nMaintaining a steady faith. For these evangelicals, ‚Äútheir religious beliefs and practices as adults in mid or later life closely resembled their beliefs and practices as teenagers and young adults‚Äù. While all interviewees ‚Äúmentioned going through a period of finding out about faith for themselves rather than simply accepting what they had been taught without question‚Äù, some intentionally protected their faith ‚Äúby not studying certain subjects at university or only reading books that confirmed their faith‚Äù. Others ‚Äúchose not to dwell upon any difficult questions that arose‚Äù. Many described a faith that was ‚Äúpersonal and devotional, rather than being over focussed on doctrine‚Äù.\nI found some of the stories of buffering faith to shut out challenge quite disturbing. Colin explained his strategies for surviving university:\nYou are taught to think in university and investigate and look at things from a different point of view and what you have to be careful not to do is transfer that onto your Christ beliefs ‚Ä¶ because you are constantly taught to question and you could start doubting it.\nChoosing to compartmentalise and ring-fence fence their faith in the knowledge that other critiques of their faith exist.\nModerating evangelicalism. Interviewees in this category tended to describe themselves as ‚Äòliberal evangelicals‚Äô, ‚Äòprogressive evangelicals‚Äô, ‚Äòfollowers of Jesus‚Äô or just plain ‚ÄòChristian‚Äô. Some were uncomfortable with the term ‚Äòevangelical‚Äô point to heavy association with Paisley. Many had moved them ‚Äúaway from their conservative evangelical upbringings, but also away from strong forms of union ism, loyalism and range Order politics. The authors found that ‚Äúa significant minority of people on a moderating journey had come to see themselves as Irish‚Äù.\nWe found that many evangelicals on a moderating journey had progressed beyond [‚Äòsome of my best friends are Catholics‚Äô] and established deep relationships with, and genuinely positive attitudes about, Catholics. Rather than holding on to the strong religious unionism with which they were raised, and seeing Catholics as hell-bound sinners, their faith has become more open and inclusive ‚Ä¶ people on moderating journeys began to see that, rather than being the enemy, Catholics were actually ‚Äòfallow pilgrims‚Äô.\nBible study, ECONI, Evangelical Alliance, university Christian Unions and experiences at Bible College were all cited by individuals as tipping points onto a journey that better coped with alternative interpretations of evangelicalism.\nMost moderating evangelicals who were interviewed had experienced disappointment with their churches. Crucially, when leaving a conservative church they had ‚Äòoutgrown‚Äô they were able to find other churches ‚Äúthey could be happy in‚Äù. (This is not always the case for transforming evangelicals can be ‚Äúdisillusioned with all churches‚Äù.) Some remark on the scriptural grounding and protection they received from conservative churches in their youth.\nThroughout the stories, there‚Äôs an openness to challenge ‚Äì often through a wider range of books (Douglas Copeland gets a mention), films and music (U2). Some had experienced life outside Northern Ireland, often choosing to get away to seek out different experiences.\nThis chapter considers the stories of people who at one time considered themselves evangelical, but now think about and practise their faith in a radically different way. Although most continue to see their lives as part of a Christian story, they now interrogate and critique their former evangelical subculture. They have varying degrees of attachment to evangelical institutions, networks and friends.\nSome interviewees used the term ‚Äòpost-evangelical‚Äô or identified with the ‚Äòemerging church movement‚Äô to describe their journey. Highly educated, one interviewee described people of transforming evangelicalism as ‚Äúa sort of liberal, intelligentsia, middle ground‚Äù. Communities ‚Äì or ‚Äòsupport groups‚Äô to deal with ‚Äúthe trauma of their evangelical past‚Äù ‚Äì like Ikon, Zero28, names like Rollins, Tickle and McLaren and talk about ‚Äòtruth‚Äô abounds. Peter Rollins was amongst those interviewed for the book.\nFor him, evangelicalism reflects modern assumptions about being able to ascertain ‚Äòtruth‚Äô and to verify facts. For evangelicals this means constructing an overarching religious narrative that explains everything, from the formation of the universe to the most intimate details of people‚Äôs lives. People like Peter disagree with over-arching narratives and want to construct alternative, diverse, open-ended narratives that they feel are more helpful for having a meaningful spiritual life and authentic relationship with other people ‚Ä¶ But this openness to uncertainty and doubt by no means precludes religious seeking.\nSome transforming interviewees had found that evangelicalism ‚Äúforced them into a zealous public persona that they were not comfortable with‚Äù. Two interviewees explained:\nMelanie: You don‚Äôt have to get your neighbours saved ‚Äì what a relief.\nSophie: You can just make friends with people and be friends, you don‚Äôt have to think ‚Äòoh this person‚Äôs really nice, I want to be friends, oh, I wonder are they saved?‚Äô\nTransforming evangelicals found that ‚ÄúJesus has just become this formula for restricting people‚Äù. One interviewee Ross said that evangelicalism ‚Äúcan be reduced to agreeing with the penal substitutionary theory of the atonement, not doing conspicuously conservative moral things like smoking or being drunk or having the wrong kinds of sex, won‚Äôt let women drive cars, forms that won‚Äôt let people who have been divorced and remarried pray in church‚Äù.\nThere was a suggestion from one interviewee that churches, like cigarettes, should have ‚Äúa health warning: church can seriously damage your health‚Äù.\nPeople on a transforming journey also had a deep frustration with the churches‚Äô response to global issues. They said that evangelicals had become too caught up in narrow Northern Irish concerns and failed to see the bigger picture.\nKate explained her frustration:\nI think it‚Äôs quite amusing in a sick kind of way that those on the fringes of the church are those who seem to give a crap more than anybody else. The problem is that they give a crap but the church doesn‚Äôt change, you know it sits there. We worry about this stuff, it really matters. [But] this dominant [church] culture, it just carries on.\nWhile frustrated, doubting and questioning, transforming evangelicals have chosen not to leave religion behind altogether. Indeed ‚Äúbecause they seek to challenge and change mainstream evangelical culture, some have continued to attend church alongside their participation in groups like Ikon‚Äù.\nLeaving evangelicalism. The ten interviewees explained that leaving their faith was a gradual process.\nUnlike people who are transforming or moderating their faith, people who had left their faith found that there was nothing worth saving.\nSome got to this position by ‚Äúgranting oneself permission to question‚Äù and having passed the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô threshold found that there was no going back. Others like Liz who had a child outside marriage found that harsh moral judgments from fellow Christians ‚Äúdelivered a blow from which her faith could not recover‚Äù.\nThe authors discovered that some of the interviewees had ‚Äòrelapsed‚Äô and come temporarily back to religion. And more leavers than any other category had spent time away from Northern Ireland.\nWhile the ‚Äúhigh point for religiosity is the teens and twenties‚Äù, this is also the stage that interviewees tended to leave evangelicalism. The peak time for changing religious beliefs was in late twenties and thirties, particularly for moderating and transforming evangelicals.\nPolitics played its role as a basis for being interested in faith and ‚Äúdeepening in a conservative direction‚Äù. Yet politics was also reason for dissatisfaction: ‚Äúanger at evangelical churches‚Äô maintenance of the segregated status quo‚Äù. And people‚Äôs ‚Äúfocus on global political issues, social justice and peace-building led them to further deconstruct their faith‚Äù and distance themselves from previous expressions of faith.\nThroughout the book, personal choice jumps off the pages.

{"question":"Super interested in the statistical comparison of military casualties! What were the total American losses in the Civil War compared to WWII, and how did these conflicts' death tolls impact their respective societies' ways of commemorating the fallen? üìä üéñÔ∏è","answer":"The Civil War resulted in 625,000 American military deaths, significantly higher than World War II's 405,399 American casualties. The Civil War's impact was particularly devastating, claiming about 30% of all Southern white males and 10% of Northern males ages 20-45. This massive toll led to the spontaneous emergence of Decoration Days, where communities would honor the fallen by decorating their graves - a practice that eventually evolved into Memorial Day. The Civil War's proximity and extensive casualties meant nearly every American knew someone who died. In contrast, World War II, despite its significant toll, affected a smaller percentage of the American population (less than 0.4%) and was fought primarily overseas, which may have contributed to a more distant connection to the sacrifices for many Americans.","context":["10% off all Products and Services through 5/30 with the Coupon Code: MemorialDay\nMemorial Day is a federal holiday set aside to honor all American soldiers who have fallen in battle. In 1967, Congress and the President Lyndon Johnson set aside May 30th as Memorial Day, but the history of this day goes back at least to the end of the American Civil War. Americans remember our fallen soldiers by attending church services and praying for military families, visiting war museums, and remembering loved ones who died fighting by placing flowers on graves of deceased American warriors.\nMore Americans died in the American Civil War than in all other American wars. An estimated 625,000 American soldiers died, including about 30% of all Southern white males and 10 percent of Northern males ages 20-45. Nearly every American knew someone who died. The sheer numbers of death and casualties in America had a great impact on the living, and immediately, Americans spontaneously acted to honor those who gave their lives.\nIn the South and in the North, Americans strove to honor those who died fighting for their country. The United States government established national cemeteries for the Union dead. But what started the practice of Memorial Day was not an official governmental act, but thousands of individual acts of tenderness and care that survivors showed to the graves of fallen soldiers of the Civil War. Communities held ‚ÄúDecoration Days,‚Äù where everyone would walk to the cemetery to decorate the gravestones of the dead soldiers.\nOne of the first known observances of a mass Decoration Day was in Charleston, South Carolina, on May 1, 1865. 257 Union prisoners had died during the war in a Charleston war prison and had been buried there. Freed slaves, along with missionaries and others, organized a celebration in May. Some in the North have called this the ‚ÄúFirst Decoration Day.‚Äù On this day, more than 10,000 people, including 3,000 newly freed children, participated.\nThroughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, the American Army, the U.S. government, and individual states celebrated Decoration Day, usually on May 30th, a date chosen because no great battle fell on this day. In 1967, Memorial Day became an official holiday, originally set to May 30th. In 1968, Congress pass a law which moved four holidays to the closest Monday to create convenient three-day weekends. Unfortunately, this move has caused most Americans to view holidays such as Memorial Day as an opportunity for mere recreation, instead of trying to honor our fallen soldiers.\nOn June 6, 1984, on the fortieth anniversary of D-Day, President Ronald Reagan gave a speech in front of the U.S. Ranger Monument at Normandy, commemorating the Rangers‚Äô charge up Pointe du Hoc.\n‚ÄúForty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet, you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.\nThe men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was the deep knowledge ‚Äì and pray God we have not lost it ‚Äì that there is a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest.

The observance of holidays, and more specifically the importance placed on some celebrations by the community and society as a whole, is just one of the interesting comparisons you can make after having traveled abroad.\nMonday was Memorial Day in the United States. Its a holiday that has been observed on the last Monday in May since 1968 and honors the sacrifice of fallen soldiers. Memorial Day started out in the 1860‚Äôs as Decoration Day, a day where family, friends and sympathetic citizens adorned the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War with flowers. The tradition was later extended to honor all Americans who died serving in the military and it was officially recognized in Federal law as Memorial Day in1967. While great pride is taken by many to honor the sacrifice made by American soldiers on Memorial Day, there is some controversy surrounding the holiday.\nIn 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act which moved Memorial Day, previously observed on May 30th, and three other Federal holidays from their originally observed dates to specified Mondays in order to create three day weekends. According to some veteran‚Äôs groups, in recent years Memorial Day has become more of a holiday than a day of remembrance. Many people appear to have become more occupied with planning camping trips, organizing barbeques and ensuring there is enough ice in the cooler to keep all of the beer cold than actually taking time to stop and remember the sacrifices made by veterans. In 2002, one veteran‚Äôs group chided the decision to move Memorial Day stating that:\n‚ÄúChanging the date merely to create three-day weekends has undermined the very meaning of the day. No doubt, this has contributed a lot to the general public‚Äôs nonchalant observance of Memorial Day.‚Äù\nThe American media also frequently refers to Memorial Day as the official kickoff of the summer holiday and travel season.\nThe United States isn‚Äôt the only country to dedicate a day to remember their fallen heroes. In Russia, May 9th is –î–µ–Ω—å –ü–æ–±–µ–¥—ã or Victory Day, and it commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. This is a massively important day in Russia. National programming is dedicated to honoring the sacrifice of Soviet troops in World War II and sharing stories of their heroism. Nearly every motorist has the signature orange and black victory day ribbon tied to their antennae or hanging from rear view mirror of their vehicle. A massive military parade rolls through Red Square in Moscow and hundreds of thousands of people line the route to catch a glimpse of tanks, rocket launchers and troops marching in perfect unison. Smaller ceremonies take place in every city, town and village throughout Russia, and monuments to fallen heroes, which seem to stand prominently in every square, park and open space, are adorned with extravagant floral bouquets.\nThe importance placed on this day is easily felt and observed. Victory Day is not a day for partying or celebrating the fact that you have the day off work‚Ä¶ it is a day of reflection, honor and respect‚Ä¶ for everyone. Remembering military sacrifice in Russia is not just a one day event either‚Ä¶ in most Russian cities and towns, there is a central monument containing an eternal flame and in some cases, military cadets stand guard over this flame year round.\nI suppose one explanation for the heightened sense of significance I felt watching the Victory Day ceremonies in Russia is the fact that the battles between Soviet and Nazi troops actually took place on Russian soil. These battles took place in the next province, in the next town, just down the street, and in people‚Äôs own back yard, so everyone has some connection to and some memory of just how bad the war was and just how significant the sacrifices made by their soldiers were. Human losses in the Soviet Union during WWII were staggering, amounting to nearly 14 percent of the population‚Ä¶ an estimated 20-27 million people, of which 9-14 million were soldiers. The chances of a contemporary Russian citizen being related to someone who died in WWII, either civilian or military, are high, so the sense of gratitude and debt on Victory Day is equally high.\nBy comparison, US fatalities in WWII were about 500,000 (less than 0.4 percent of the population), the vast majority were soldiers, but aside from Pearl Harbor, the fighting never really reached US soil, and with the exception of the Civil War, it never really has. As a result, to a large percentage of Americans, WWII may feel distant or even seem insignificant, and there may not be any direct connection or relation to anyone who served in the military or someone who died serving in the military. The same can probably be said for other foreign wars like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. But just because the battles US troops have engaged in took place on the other side of the world, in places most people have never heard of, it does not mean their sacrifices were any less significant. Witnessing Victory Day in Russia helped me to see that more clearly than I ever had in the past. Maybe for the sake or our fallen troops, it is time we moved Memorial Day back to May 30th so it is not confused with fishing trips, pool parties and Tuesday hangovers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e313479-65cb-4b3b-bf7e-3a00365dcf6b>","<urn:uuid:44586864-9abc-456c-8c1f-85b46ac80d78>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a historian studying literary approaches to chronicling wars, I'm curious about the underlying motivations that drove Herodotus and Anna Comnena to document their respective conflicts. Can you compare their stated purposes?","answer":"Herodotus and Anna Comnena had different primary motivations for their historical works. Herodotus explicitly began his work to ensure 'that the deeds of men not be erased by time, and that the great and miraculous works‚Äìboth of the Greeks and the barbarians‚Äìnot go unrecorded.' He also aimed to explain what caused the Greeks and Persians to fight one another. Anna Comnena, on the other hand, was specifically motivated to record her father's deeds so 'they should certainly not be lost in silence, or swept away on the current of time into the sea of forgetfulness.' She emphasized that her purpose was not to show off her literary prowess, but to ensure that 'matters of such importance should not be left unattested for future generations,' believing that even the greatest deeds would be extinguished in obscurity if not preserved in written words.","context":["Time in its irresistible and ceaseless flow carries along on its flood all created things, and drowns them in the depths of obscurity, no matter if they be quite unworthy of mention, or most noteworthy and important, and thus, as the tragedian says, \"he brings from the darkness all things to the birth, and all things born envelops in the night.\"\nBut the tale of history forms a very strong bulwark against the stream of time, and to some extent checks its irresistible flow, and, of all things done in it, as many as history has taken over, it secures and binds together, and does not allow them to slip away into the abyss of oblivion.\nNow, I recognized this fact. I, Anna, the daughter of two royal personages, Alexius and Irene, born and bred in the purple. I was not ignorant of letters, for I carried my study of Greek to the highest pitch, and was also not unpractised in rhetoric; I perused the works of Aristotle and the dialogues of Plato carefully, and enriched my mind by the \"quaternion\" of learning. (I must let this out and it is not bragging to state what nature and my zeal for learning have given me, and the gifts which God apportioned to me at birth and time has contributed).\nHowever, to resume - I intend in this writing of mine to recount the deeds done by my father so they should certainly not be lost in silence, or swept away, as it were, on the current of time into the sea of forgetfulness, and I shall recount not only his achievements as Emperor, \"But also the services he rendered to various Emperors before he himself received the sceptre.\nII These deeds I am going to relate, not in order to shew off my proficiency in letters, but that matters of such importance should not be left unattested for future generations. For even the greatest of deeds, if not haply preserved in written words and handed down to remembrance, become extinguished in the obscurity of silence.\nNow, my father, as the actual facts prove, knew both how to command and how to obey the rulers within reasonable limits. And though I have chosen to narrate his doings, yet I fear that the tongues of suspicion and detraction will whisper that writing my father's history is only self laudation and that the historical facts and any praise I bestow on them, are mere falsehoods and empty panegyric. Again, on the other hand, if he himself were to supply the materials, and facts themselves force me to censure some of his actions, not because of him, but from the very nature of the deed, I dread the scoffers who will cast Noah's son. Ham, in my teeth, for they look at everything askew, and owing to their malice and envy, do not discern dearly what is right, but will \" blame the blameless \" as Homer says. But he who undertakes the \"role\" of an historian must sink his personal likes and dislikes, and often award the highest praise to his enemies when their actions demand it, and often, too, blame his nearest relations if their errors require it. He must never shirk either blaming his friends or praising his enemies. I should counsel both parties, those attacked by us and our partisans alike, to take comfort from the fact that I have sought the evidence of the actual deeds themselves, and the testimony of those who have seen the actions, and the men and their actions‚Äîthe fathers of some of the men now living, and the grandfathers of others were actual eye-witnesses.\nIII The reason which finally determined me to write my father's history was the following. My lawful husband was the Caesar Nicephorus, a scion of the clan of the Bryennii, a man who far outshone his contemporaries by his surpassing beauty, his superior intelligence, and his accurate speech. To look at him, or to listen to him, was a pure delight. But I must not let my tale wander from its path, so for the present let us keep to the main story. My husband, as I said, was most remarkable in every way; he accompanied my brother John, the Emperor, on several other expeditions against the barbarians ... as well as on the one against . . . who held the city of Antioch. As Nicephorus could not abide neglecting his literary work, he wrote several excellent monographs even during times of stress and trouble. But his task of predilection was that enjoyed by the Queen, to wit, a compilation of the history of the reign of Alexius, Emperor of the Romans, and my father, and to set out the doings of his reign in books whenever opportunity granted him a short respite from strife and warfare, and the chance of turning his mind to his history, and literary studies. Moreover, he approached this subject from an earlier period (for in this detail too he obeyed the will of our mistress), and starting from Diogenes, Emperor of the Romans, he worked down to the man about whom he had himself purposed to write.\nAt the accession of Diogenes my father had just entered upon his brilliant youth and before this was not even a full-grown boy, and had done nothing worthy of recording, unless, forsooth, the deeds of his childhood were made the theme of a panegyric.\nSuch then was the Caesar's intention as his own writing shews; but his hopes were not fulfilled, and he did not complete his history. He brought it down to the Emperor Nicephorus (III) Botaniates, and opportunity forbade his carrying it further, thus causing loss to the events he meant to describe, and depriving his readers of a great pleasure. For this reason, I myself undertook to chronicle my father's doings, that the coming generations should not overlook deeds of such importance.\nNow, the harmonious structure and great charm of the Caesar's writings are well-known to all who have chanced to take a look at his books. However, as I have already mentioned, when he had got as far as my father's reign, and sketched out a draft of it, and brought it back to us half-finished from abroad, he also, alas! brought back with him a fatal disease. This was induced, maybe, by the endless discomfort of a soldier's life, or by his over-many expeditions, or again, from his overwhelming anxiety about us, for worrying was innate in him, and his troubles were incessant. In addition to these causes, the varieties and severities of climate experienced, all contributed to mix the fatal draught for him. For he started hence on an expedition against the Syrians and Cilicians when seriously out of health; from Syria he went on ill to the Cilicians, from them to the Pamphylians, from the Pamphylians to the Lydians, and Lydia sent him on to Bithynia, who finally returned him to us and to the Queen of cities suffering from an internal tumour caused by his incessant sufferings. Yet, ill as he was, he was anxious to tell the tragic story of his adventures, but was unable to do so, partly because of his disease, and partly because we forbade it through fear that the effort of talking might cause the tumour to burst.\nIV Having written so far, dizziness overwhelms my soul, and tears blind my eyes. Oh! what a counsellor the Roman Empire has lost! Oh, for his accurate understanding of affairs, all of which he had gained from experience! And his knowledge of literature, and his varied acquaintance with both native and foreign learning! Think, too, of the grace of his figure and beauty of face, which would have befitted not only a king, as the saying goes, but even a more powerful, nay, a divine person!\nTo turn to myself‚ÄîI have been conversant with dangers ever since my birth \"in the purple,\" so to say; and fortune has certainly not been kind to me, unless you were to count it a smile of kind fortune to have given me \"emperors\" as parents, and allowing me to be born \"in the purple room,\" for all the rest of my life has been one long series of storms and revolutions. Orpheus, indeed, could move stones, trees, and all inanimate nature, by his singing; Timotheus, too, the flute-player, by piping an \"orthian\" tune to Alexander, incited the Macedonian thereby to snatch up his arms and sword; lout the tale of my woes would not cause a movement in place, nor rouse men to arms and war, but they would move the hearer to tears, and compel sympathy from animate, and even inanimate, nature. Verily, my grief for my Caesar and his unexpected death have touched my inmost soul, and the wound has pierced to the profoundest depths of my being. All previous misfortunes compared with this insatiable calamity I count literally as a single small drop compared with this Atlantic Ocean, this turbulent Adriatic Sea of trouble: they were, methinks, but preludes to this, mere smoke and heat to forewarn me of this fiery furnace and indescribable blaze; the small daily sparks foretold this terrible conflagration. Oh! thou fire which, though unfed, dost reduce my heart to ashes! Thou burnest and art ever kept alight in secret, yet dost not consume. Though thou scorchest my heart thou givest me the outward semblance of being unburnt, though thy fingers of fire have gripped me even to the marrow of my bones, and to the dividing of my soul! However, I see that I have let my feelings carry me away from my subject, but the mention of my Caesar and my grief for him have instilled devastating sorrow into me.\nNow I will wipe away my tears and recover myself from my sorrow and continue my task, and thus in the words of the tragedian; \"I shall have double cause for tears, as a woman who in misfortune remembers former misfortune.\" To have as my object the publication of the life of so great and virtuous a King will be a reminder of his wondrous achievements, and these force me to shed warm tears, and the whole world will weep with me. For to recall him, and make his reign known, will be a subject of lamentation to me, but will also serve to remind others of the loss they have sustained.\nNow I must begin my father's history at some definite point, and the best point will be that from which my narrative can be absolutely clear and based on fact.\n- Sophocles Ajax, 646\n- Romanus IV Diogenes\n- Euripides, Hecuba 518","The Early Life of Herodotus\nHerodotus was born in about 485 B.C. in the Greek city of Halicarnassus, a lively commercial center on the southwestern coast of Asia Minor. He came from a wealthy and cosmopolitan Greek-Carian merchant family. (The Carians, of Minoan descent, had arrived in that part of Asia Minor before the Greeks had.) In the middle of the 6th century B.C., Halicarnassus became a satrapy, or province, of the Persian Empire and was ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis. Herodotus‚Äô family opposed Lygdamis‚Äô rule and was sent into exile on the island of Samos. When he was a young man, Herodotus returned briefly to Halicarnassus to take part in an abortive anti-Persian rebellion. After that, however, the writer never returned to his home city again.\nOrigins of the Histories\nInstead of settling in one place, Herodotus spent his life traveling from one Persian territory to another. He crossed the Mediterranean to Egypt and traveled through Palestine to Syria and Babylon. He headed to Macedonia and visited all the islands of the Greek Archipelago: Rhodes, Cyprus, Delos, Paros, Thasos, Samothrace, Crete, Samos, Cythera and Aegina. He sailed through the Hellespont to the Black Sea and kept going until he hit the Danube River. While he traveled, Herodotus collected what he called ‚Äúautopsies,‚Äù or ‚Äúpersonal inquiries‚Äù: He listened to myths and legends, recorded oral histories and made notes of the places and things that he saw.\nWhen Herodotus was not traveling, he returned to Athens; there, he became something of a celebrity. He gave readings in public places and collected fees from officials for his appearances. In 445 B.C., the people of Athens voted to give him a prize of 10 talents‚Äìalmost $200,000 in today‚Äôs money‚Äìto honor him for his contributions to the city‚Äôs intellectual life. The Histories\nHerodotus spent his entire life working on just one project: an account of the origins and execution of the Greco-Persian Wars (499‚Äì479 B.C.) that he called The Histories. (It is from Herodotus‚Äô work that we get the modern meaning of the word ‚Äúhistory.‚Äù) In part, The Histories was a straightforward account of the wars. ‚ÄúHere is the account,‚Äù the work begins, ‚Äúof the inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassus in order that the deeds of men not be erased by time, and that the great and miraculous works‚Äìboth of the Greeks and the barbarians‚Äìnot go unrecorded.‚Äù It was also an attempt to explain the conflict‚Äì‚Äúto show what caused them to fight one another,‚Äù Herodotus said‚Äìby explaining the Persians‚Äô imperial worldview. The Histories also incorporated observations and stories, both factual and fictional, from Herodotus‚Äô travels.\nEarlier writers had produced what Herodotus called ‚Äúlogographies‚Äù: These were what we might call travelogues, disconnected tales about places and people that did not cohere into a narrative whole. By contrast, Herodotus used all of his ‚Äúautopsies‚Äù to build a complete story that explained the why and the how of the Persian Wars.\nAfter Herodotus died, editors divided his Histories into nine books. (Each was named after one of the Muses.) The first five books look into the past to try to explain the rise and fall of the Persian Empire. They describe the geography of each state the Persians conquered and tell about their people and customs. The next four books tell the story of the war itself, from the invasions of Greece by Persian emperors Darius and Xerxes to the Greek triumphs at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale in 480 and 479 B.C.\nHerodotus‚Äô encyclopedic method did not leave much room for analysis. He treats every piece of his narrative, from the main themes to the digressions and from the facts to the fictions, with equal importance. He shows how Persian hubris led to the downfall of a great empire, but he also places a great deal of stock in gossipy tales of personal shortcomings and moral lessons.\nThe Legacy of the Histories\nRival historian Thucydides, who relied only on ‚Äúfactual‚Äù evidence to provide a less subjective account of ‚Äúwhat had been done,‚Äù frequently criticized Herodotus for inserting ‚Äúfables‚Äù into his narrative just to make it more ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù and pleasant to read. Indeed, there are people who call Thucydides ‚Äúthe first historian‚Äù and Herodotus ‚Äúthe first liar.‚Äù But no matter how one judges his reporting, Herodotus will likely get credit for taking a dry political story and turning it into literature."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e6958fa-be9e-4b3f-9e31-3d530443f823>","<urn:uuid:b9dfd29f-7127-4606-85ce-8eed099b26d7>"],"error":null}

Not to be confused with the gutter, which is the combination of the inside margins of two facing pages.\nAscender: in typography, the parts of lowercase letters that rise above the x-height of the font, e.g. b, d, f, h, k, I, and t. See descender for headline implications of these\nAngle: The approach or focus of a story. This is sometimes known as the peg.\nBanner: The title of a periodical, which appears on the cover of the magazine and on the first page of the newsletter. It contains the name of the publication and serial information, date, volume, number. Bleed: when the image is printed to the very edge of the page.\nBlock quote: A long quotation - four or more lines - within body text, that is set apart in order to clearly distinguish the author‚Äôs words from the words that the author is quoting.\nBody or body copy: (typesetting) the main text of the work but not including headlines.\nBoost: picture boost (usually front page) pic promoting a feature or story in later pages\nStrap boost: as above, but with a strapline, not a picture\nBuried lede: when the main point of the story is hidden away deep in the text. It should come first.\nByline: A journalist's name at the beginning of a story.\nCallout: An explanatory label for an illustration, often drawn with a leader line pointing to a part of the illustration.\nCaption: An identification (title) for an illustration, usually a brief phrase.

Cropping allows the remaining parts of the image to be enlarged to fill the space.\nCross head: a heading set in the body of the text used to break it into easily readable sections.\nCross head: A few words used to break up large amounts of text, normally taken from the main text. Typically used in interviews.\nCutlines: Explanatory text, usually full sentences, that provides information about illustrations. Cutlines are sometimes called captions or legends.\nDeck: Part of the headline which summarises the story. Also known as deck copy or bank.\nDeck: a headline is made up of decks, each set in the same style and size of type.\nA multi deck heading is one with several headings each different from the next and should not be confused with the number of lines a heading has. A four line heading is not the same as a four deck heading.\nDescender: letters that descend below a line (q,p,g, j) Ascenders and descenders can create unused space in large headlines.... that is one reason why tabloid front page headlines use capitals... there are no ascenders or descenders in caps, so the lines can be crammed more closely together by adjusting the leading and therefore make better use of the space and add to the impact)\nDiscretionary hyphen: A hyphen that will occur only if the word appears at the end of a line, not if the word appears in the middle of a line.\nDouble page spread: magazine design layout that spans across two pages. Usually, the design editor will arrange to spread the layout across the centre pages of the magazine, so as to ensure that the design lines up properly.\nDrop cap: a large initial letter at the start of the text that drops into the line or lines of text below.\nDrop shadow: Drop shadows are those shadows dropping below text or images which gives the illusion of shadows from lighting and gives a 3D effect to the object.\nEditorialise: To write in an opinionated way.\nFeature: A longer, more in-depth article.\nFacing pages: In a double-sided document, the two pages that appear as a spread when the publication is opened.\nFiller: extra material used to complete a column or page, usually of little importance.\nFlatplan: A page plan that shows where the articles and adverts are laid out.\nFlush left: copy aligned along the left margin.\nFlush right: copy aligned along the right margin.\nGolden ratio: the rule devised to give proportions of height to width when laying out text and illustrations to produce the most optically pleasing result. Traditionally a ratio of 1 to 1.6.\nGrid: A layout grid is the non-printing set of guidlines that designers use to align images and text in a document layout.\nGrip-and-grin: A photograph of no inherent interest in which a notable and an obscure person shake hands at an occasion of supposed significance.\nHeadline: The main title of the article. Should be in present or future tense to add to urgency. Must fit the space provided. If it doesn‚Äôt, you are using the wrong words.\nHouse style : A publication's guide to style, spelling and use of grammar, designed to help journalists write and present in a consistent way for their target audience.\nJustify: (typesetting) the alignment of text along a margin or both margins. This is achieved by adjusting the spacing between the words and characters as necessary so that each line of text finishes at the same point.\nKerning: Adjustment of horizontal space between two written characters.\nKicker: The first sentence or first few words of a story's lead, set in a font size larger than the body text of the story.\nLead or Leading: (typesetting) Space added between lines of type to space out text and provide visual separation of the lines. Measured in points or fractions thereof. Named after the strips of lead that used to be inserted between lines of metal type.\nLeader: An article that shows the opinion of a newspaper.\nLeader: A line of dots or dashes to lead the eye across the page to separated copy.\nLeading: Adjustment of vertical space between two lines.\nLede: The phonetic spelling of lead, the beginning, usually the first paragraph, of an article. The importance of getting the main point of the story in the first sentence is regularly stressed to young journalists by editors. Don‚Äôt bury the lede. When we were taught to write stories at school we were urged to save the best for the climax. In journalism, get the climax in first, then give the context.\nMasthead: Main title section and name at the front of a publication.\nMasthead: Magazine term referring to the printed list, usually on the editorial page of a newspaper or magazine, that lists the contributors. Typically this would include the owners, publishers, editors, designers and production team. The masthead is often mistakenly used in reference to the flag or nameplate, which actually refers to the designed logo of the publication.\nNegative space (or white space): the area of page without text, image or other elements\nNoise: A noisy image or noisy scan is one where there are random or extra pixels that have degraded the image quality. Noise in a graphics image can be generated at the scanning stage, by artificially enlarging an image by interpolating the pixels, or by over-sharpening a digital photograph. Noise can sometimes also be found in photographs taken by some cheaper digital cameras.\nOrphan: First line of a paragraph appearing on the last line of a column of text. Normally avoided.\nOverline: introductory headline in smaller text size above the main headline\nPull quote: A brief phrase (not necessarily an actual quotation) from the body text, enlarged and set off from the text with rules, a box, and/or a screen. It is from a part of the text set previously, and is set in the middle of a paragraph, to add emphasis and interest.\nA quote or exerpt from an article that is used as display text on the same page to entice the reader, highlight a topic or break up linearity\nPull-out quote: Selected quote from a story highlighted next to the main text. Often used in interviews.\nPuff piece: A news story with editorialised, complimentary statements.\nRecto: Right-hand page.\nRivers: a river is a typographic term for the ugly white gaps that can occur in justified columns of type, when there is too much space between words on concurrent lines of text. Rivers are especially common in narrow columns of text, where the type size is relatively large. Rivers are best avoided by either setting the type as ragged, increasing the width of the columns, decreasing the point size of the text, or by using a condensed typeface. An often overlooked method of avoiding rivers, is the careful use of hyphenation and justification settings in page layout programs such as QuarkXpress or InDesign.\nRunning head: A title or heading that runs along the top of a printed publication, usually a magazine.\nSell: Short sentence promoting an article, often pulling out a quote or a interesting sentence.\nSerif and Sans serif: Plain font type with or without (sans) lines perpendicular to the ends of characters.\nSet flush: text set at the full width of the column with no indentation\nSplash: Main front page story.\nStandfirst: Lines of text after the headline that gives more information about the article, or about the author.\nStandfirst: will usually be written by the sub-editor and is normally around 40-50 words in length. Any longer and it defeats its purpose, any shorter and it becomes difficult to get the necessary information in. Its purpose is to give some background information about the writer of the article, or to give some context to the contents of the article. Usually, it is presented in typesize larger than the story text, but much smaller than the headline.\nStrapline: Similar to a subhead or standfirst, but used more as a marketing term.\nSubhead: A smaller one-line headline for a story.\nSubhead: A secondary phrase usually following a headline. Display line(s) of lesser size and importance than the main headline(s).\nTalkie headline: a quote from one of the people in the story used as a headline\nTag line: a short memorable line of cover text that sums up the tone of the publication (Loaded Mag has :For men who should know better)\nTombstoning: In page layout, to put articles side by side so that the headlines are adjacent. The phenomenon is also referred to as bumping heads.\nTop heads: Headlines at the top of a column.\nWidow: Last line of paragraph appearing on the first line of a column of text.\nWidow: In a page layout, short last lines of paragraphs - usually unacceptable when separated from the rest of the paragraph by a column break, and always unacceptable when separated by a page break.\nWob: White text on a black or other coloured background","This post is an introduction to alignment typesetting and an encouragement to look at the details of alignment choices out in the world. Regarding text alignment, there is left aligned, centered, right aligned, and justified text.\nIn left-aligned text, the words are in rows one right below the other on the left side of the page, and the right side of the text is uneven. This uneveness of non-aligned text is called a ‚Äúrag.‚Äù\nIn right-aligned text, the words line up on the right side of the page, and the left side is uneven.\n‚ô¶ left aligned = flush left = ragged right = rag right\n‚ô¶ right aligned = flush right = ragged left = rag left\nIn center-aligned text, text is equidistant from a center point.\nIn justified text, all the lines of type are the same length, so text on both the left side and right side are aligned.\nIn the West, most documents we write (type) today are left aligned, and we let our software take care of the rag. Word-spacing and letter-spacing are done automatically for optimal readability, no matter our software‚ÄîAdobe InDesign, Quark, MS Word, or other writing software application.\nYou can chose basic alignment settings in word processing applications, and there are more alignment options in layout applications such as InDesign.\nText Alignment and White Space\nAlthough most of your work will be with left-aligned text, there are times when a right-aligned block of text can serve you well. For example, when an image is placed on the right side of a page, right-aligned type anchors text and image. In the first example below, there is a gap between the text and the image, leading to ‚Äútrapped white space.‚Äù In the second example, the text is right-aligned, freeing up the white space and connecting type to image.\nThere are also times when right-aligned text balances an image on the left or adds a dynamic alternative to the predictability of left-aligned text. This is often seen in business card designs.\nLove the look of justified text? Just Hit the Justify Button?\nJustified text is what we are used to seeing in our newspapers, novels, and text books. However, these printed materials have been typeset by printers or designers, and there is skill involved. Yes, a quickie justify‚Äîjust hit the justify button‚Äîis possible, even in MS Word, and sometimes this will look just fine. However, automatic justification can result in some problems for your readers. See the three versions of justified text below of the quote from Designing with Type by James Craig and William Bevington, page 99.\nProblem #1: You could end up with words and letters too tightly packed together resulting in text that is hard to read.\nProblem #2: You could end up with distracting variations in word-spacing or letter-spacing or ‚Äúrivers‚Äù of white space making distracting columns running through the text, which can make for ugly and difficult-to-read pages.\nRivers are more likely to happen when you do not allow text to be hyphenated, when the line length produces a narrow column, and when word-spacing (tracking) and letter-spacing (kerning) are not adjusted. For more examples, google ‚Äúrivers in justified text.‚Äù\nFor those working with Adobe InDesign who want to know how to create well-justified text in long documents, see Designing a Book by Nigel French on Lynda.com. The entire video book course (4‚Äì5 hours) is well worth the time spent.\nThe three most relevant movies to this post are (1) Chapter 3: Creating and Applying Paragraph Styles, (2) Chapter 4: Styling the Text, and (3) Chapter 6: Finessing the Text.\nProper justified type takes time to master, but it is worth the effort to learn more about word-spacing, letter-spacing, orphans, widows, and other type elements if you want to craft beautiful readable typography.\nBefore I spent time learning from Nigel French how to set justification parameters within Adobe InDesign, I never used justified text for long documents. I had seen too many bad examples of sloppy justified text. I would, however, justify short paragraphs of text, but this could be time-consuming. In what was an agonizingly slow process, I have manually changed word-spacing, font size, and letter-spacing, and sometimes word choice for each line of text to get typography that worked. All to prevent the rivers or distracting white space between words.\nIn the HPV poster below (created in Adobe Illustrator), the justified text was done manually by changing the length of the lines, color, font size, word choice, letter-spacing (kerning), and word-spacing (tracking) to eliminate rivers and wide gaps between words.\n- Craig, James and William Bevington.

{"question":"What's the difference between Betta Graze and Kentucky Bluegrass in terms of growth pattern and maintenance?","answer":"Betta Graze and Kentucky Bluegrass have distinct growth patterns and maintenance needs. Betta Graze exhibits rapid early growth and quick recovery after grazing or cutting, requiring grazing or cutting when it reaches around 1 meter in height, leaving a 15cm residual for maximum regrowth. In contrast, Kentucky Bluegrass spreads aggressively but maintains a relatively shallow root system compared to other grasses. It requires supplemental watering during periods of limited precipitation and high heat, and while it can go dormant during drought, it rebounds strongly when watered.","context":["Summer Forage frequently asked questions\nWhat are the advantages of Summer Forage?\nSummer forage has many advantages:\n‚Ä¢ It can grow well in both high and even in low potential areas with poor soils.\n‚Ä¢ As a fodder crop it can be used in adequate supply when maize and other feed sources fail.\n‚Ä¢ Most varieties of summer forage produce much more forage than corn.\n‚Ä¢ Unlike corn, the lower leaves do not dry out as the plant matures; they remain green and therefore retain a higher crude protein content.\n‚Ä¢ Summer forage can regenerate (grow again) after cutting the stalks for fodder; The ratoon crop will mature early in the following season but yield slightly less than the first crop ‚Äì depending on level of plant feeds available. This way farmers can reduce the cost of replanting, land preparation, seeds and time.\n‚Ä¢ As animal feed, it has the same energy level as maize or other cereals.\n‚Ä¢ Summer Forage can withstand dry conditions and remain green at very low moisture levels.\nIs Summer Forage easy to plant?\nTo get a good Summer Forage crop a farmer needs to observe these guidelines:\nLand Preparation: For both forage and food varieties of sorghum, start preparing the land at the end of the rains following a crop season. Summer Forage does well in sandy soils. It can also be grown where the soils are not disturbed much (where conservation tillage is practiced).\nSeed rate and spacing: For information on seed rate and spacing please see the Summer Crop Variety Guide.\nSowing: Summer Forage should be sown at the onset of the long rains. Drill seeds along the furrows (trenches).\nManure application: Well-composted manure should be applied during land preparation and worked into the soil. Organic foliar feeds can be added when the plant is knee high.\nWeeding: Hand weeding should be done at least twice. A sorghum field should be kept weed-free especially at early stages of growth.\nPest and disease control: Control of cutworms, aphids, shoot-fly and stalk borer is important. Birds like sorghum especially at milk stage; they prefer white-seeded varieties. Sorghum is generally disease tolerant. Control disease when necessary.\nHarvesting: Summer Forage meant for feed can be cut when still green and fresh. Leave it in sun to allow wilting for 12 hours then chop and then feed the animals. To make silage, start harvesting at dough stage (between milky and hardening stage). For dual-purpose sorghum, cut the head with a knife or use a combine harvester.\nWhat is Pioneer¬Æ brand Betta Graze?\nBetta Graze is a tall late flowering, late maturing hybrid (sorghum x sudan hybrid) grown for high quality, high yielding summer feed for grazing in dairy, beef and sheep systems, and also for silage .\nRapid early growth, quick recovery after grazing or cutting along with delayed flowering means Betta Graze is a versatile, easy to manage summer feed. High sugar content, fine stems and a high leaf to stem ratio ensure excellent palatability and feed value.\nBetta Graze seed is available with bird repellent for an extra charge. This will reduce the risk of crop establishment problems due to bird damage of seedling crops.\nWhat is the best timing in order to maximize utilisation of Betta Graze?\nBetta Graze feed value is highest when the crop is less than 1.2 m in height. Graze Betta Graze behind a wire or cut it 35-45 days after planting when the crop reaches around 1 metre in height. Leave a residual of 15cm for maximum regrowth. Recut or graze after 4-5 weeks when the crop is at least 0.8m and no more than 1.2m in height.\nWhat are my feeding options for Betta Graze?\nBetta Graze can be grazed by break feeding to stock. Back-fencing is essential to minimise plant damage and allow quick re-growth in the grazed portion of the crop and to avoid crop toxicity.\nBetta Graze can be made into pit, bunker or round bale silage. It is always recommended to cut using a mower-conditioner and wilt in the paddock for a maximum of 48 hours.\nWhat is Pioneer¬Æ brand Super Sweet Sudan?\nPioneer¬Æ brand hybrid Super Sweet Sudan (SSS) is quick to graze and sustains multiple and intensive grazing. SSS produces high quality hay and round bale silage suitable for sheep and cattle. Adaptable for early or late planting.\nWhat is the primary use of SSS?\nCattle and sheep plus intensive or non intensive grazing. SSS produces highly palatable hay plus round bale silage.\nHow do i get the best result from SSS?\nPlease see our SSS Growing Guide","Establishing lush, healthy, beautiful lawn grasses demands diligence. Proper maintenance, mowing and nutrition all lead to achieving your goals; but success also rests on the grass itself. Whether establishing a new lawn or maintaining an existing one, matching the best cool- or warm-season grasses to your growing region is critical. Choosing the Pennington grass seed that's suited to your location and goals will help you achieve desired results.\nCool-season grasses yield vigorous growth in northern regions with cool spring and fall seasons, and moderate summers. Warm-season grasses flourish in southern regions where seasonal summer temperatures run high. They thrive on summer heat, but can't withstand northern winters. By choosing premium lawn grasses designed specifically for regional factors such as humidity, aridity and elevation, you ensure your lawn has every advantage for success:\nCool-season grasses, such as bluegrasses, ryegrasses and fescues, prevail in the Northeast region of the United States. Cold winters, cool summers and high humidity create challenging conditions for many plants, including lawn grasses. Northeast lawns need grasses that prefer cool temperatures and naturally resist diseases prevalent in this region.\nKentucky bluegrass flourishes throughout the Northeast and the entire northern tier of states. For generations of grass enthusiasts, Kentucky bluegrass has epitomized the ideal lawn. This cool-season, perennial grass delivers finely textured, deep-emerald-green blades and the hardiness needed for cold northern winters.\nKentucky bluegrass spreads aggressively, but its root system remains relatively shallow compared to many other grasses. The luxuriant color of this sun-loving grass depends on supplemental watering during periods of limited precipitation and high heat. Drought induces dormancy in Kentucky bluegrass, but the grass rebounds strong with watering. Though some are slow to green in spring, Kentucky bluegrass blends well with ryegrass for faster greening. However, perennial ryegrasses can sometimes overtake Kentucky bluegrass, so minimize mixing.\nThe New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers University, a Pennington university partner, recommends a mix of Kentucky bluegrass varieties with other cool-season grasses for successful Northeast lawns.1 Pennington Smart Seed Northeast Mix provides this desirable combination of grasses. Innovations behind Pennington Smart Seed Kentucky Bluegrass Blend and Pennington Smart Seed Fescue/Bluegrass Mix deliver increased shade tolerance, finer texture and desirable color.\nThe Midwest heartland is a cool-season growing region with humidity levels that vary. The Midwest's eastern states experience humidity similar to the Northeast, but in western states encounter arid conditions. Seasonal fluctuations across the region demand grasses that thrive in cool climates. Bluegrasses dominate, but ryegrasses and fescues also do well with sufficient irrigation in the region's more arid western portions. Some Turf-Type Tall Fescues do well under droughty conditions. Water Star Qualified Grass Seed by Pennington delivers water-conserving benefits, proven through stringent testing by the Turfgrass Water Conservation Alliance.\nPerennial ryegrass flourishes in full Midwestern sun, but tolerates light shade in this central climate. Valued for versatility, fast germination and easy establishment, cool-season perennial ryegrass forms a lush, finely textured, deep-green lawn. That color stays with ryegrass into winter, and returns quickly in spring. During periods of drought, perennial ryegrass does require additional watering or it may lose color or go dormant.\nDurable, traffic-tolerant ryegrass naturally resists insects and disease, and offers moderate drought tolerance suited to northern summers. Collaborative testing between the Cooperative Turfgrass Breeders Test and the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program pursues increasingly cold-tolerant varieties. Pennington Smart Seed Midwest Mix delivers cool-season grasses ideal for Midwest conditions, and Pennington Smart Seed Perennial Ryegrass Blend offers premium ryegrass varieties selected for optimal balance in Midwest lawns.\nHeat and humidity in the Southeast region create a warm, humid zone that stretches from the Atlantic Coast into Texas. Warm-season grasses dominate in this climate. Bermudagrass is the leading lawn grass in the Southeast and across the U.S. southern tier. Its tolerance for salt, heat and drought meet the challenging conditions of the region well.\nBermudagrass texture varies from fine to medium-coarse, depending on variety. Known for its persistent nature and aggressive spreading, Bermudagrass produces a thick, dark-green lawn. Like other warm-season grasses, Bermudagrass turns brown during winter dormancy where winter temperatures drop below 40¬∞F. In spring, it greens up quickly as the deep-rooted grass regrows from the crown each spring. Many homeowners throughout the South overseed Bermudagrass lawns with ryegrasses for winter color. The ryegrasses die in summer heat, but not before Bermudagrass turns green.\nPennington university partners at the University of Florida pursue improved Bermudagrass varieties for Southeast conditions. Premium Southern grasses in Pennington Bermudagrass Blend thrive in challenging Southern conditions.\nWhere high heat and humidity intensify in the Deep South and Gulf Coast, Bahiagrass and Centipede grass are common. Extremely drought and heat tolerant, these grasses stand up to the region's climate and water restrictions. Grass research at the University of Georgia, another Pennington university partner, leads research and development of new grass varieties for coastal conditions.\nBahiagrass provides homeowners in the Deep South and Coastal regions with low-maintenance, all-purpose lawns. More coarse than any cool-season grass, Bahiagrass has good disease- and pest-resistant qualities, establishes easily and offers outstanding drought and heat tolerance. Sun-loving Pennington Pensacola Bahiagrass is perfect for the Southern Coastal Plain and Gulf Coast. Lower growing and low-maintenance Pennington Argentine Bahiagrass wins favor from Florida through the Texas coast, as it teams finer texture, improved density and deeper color with durability and drought resistance.\nCentipede grass earns accolades for low and slow growth, medium texture and its medium- to light-green color. Very low-maintenance, this warm-season grass out competes weeds and tolerates nutrient-poor soil, so less mowing and less fertilizer are needed. Centipede grasses, such as Pennington Centipede Grass products, prefer full sun but tolerate more shade than Bermudagrass. Centipede grasses also lack a true dormant period, so they stay green nearly year-round except in extremely cold conditions. Centipede's low growth helps it tolerate drought well, and its denseness helps it endure foot traffic.\nThe warm, arid West/Southwest region presents extreme challenges to turf grasses in low- and high-desert climates. Beginning in Texas and stretching into Southern California, this region combines saline water and alkaline soil with intense sunlight, high temperatures and varying elevations.\nResilient Bermudagrass is widely used in the region, but sufficient watering is essential. The University of Nevada Cooperative Extension reports that Bermudagrass can require up to 40 percent less water than comparable tall fescue lawns in the desert climate.2 As across the South, overseeding Bermudagrass lawns with ryegrasses will often provide winter color.\nBermudagrass varieties such as Pennington Sahara Bermudagrass, with its fine texture and rich, dark-green color, are popular in the region. The dense grass stands up to foot traffic, flourishes under the Southwestern sun and resists drought, insects and diseases common to the region.\nLike the Midwest, the West/Northwest region presents diverse growing conditions. Cool, arid inland areas from Montana and Wyoming westward welcome cool-season grasses when adequately irrigated. In this area, east of the Cascade Mountain Range extending from Washington to Northern California, bluegrasses and tall fescues are preferred. West of the Cascades, cool temperatures and the humidity of the coastal Pacific Northwest create conditions similar to the Northeast. This wet, cool climate demands grasses resistant to lawn diseases the conditions encourage.\nOregon State University research shows ryegrasses are naturally resistant to cool-season diseases that strike grasses in rainy coastal winters. Fine fescues with greater cold and shade tolerance than tall fescue grasses also excel.3 Pennington Smart Seed Pacific Northwest Mix provides an optimal balance of these regionally-suited grasses.\nOne region presents special challenges for all lawn grasses. Known to lawn care professionals and enthusiasts as the transition zone, this area covers the central tier of states from the Atlantic Coast west through Kansas. Different climatic zones ‚Äîcool, warm, humid and arid ‚Äî collide in this region. Winters are too cold for warm-season grass survival, and summers are too hot for cool-season types. Pennington university partners at the University of Arkansas Agriculture Research and Extension lead research and development of heat-tolerant cool-season grasses and cold-tolerant warm-season grasses suitable for transition zone rigors.\nTall fescue, which is used extensively in the transition region, is a low-maintenance, heat-tolerant, cool-season grass with fine to medium blade texture. Its deep roots deliver drought and heat protection. In this zone, tall fescue can add season-long color to Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass mixes. Pennington Smart Seed Fescue/Bluegrass Mix combines fescue durability with bluegrass beauty. Tall fescue complements Bermudagrass farther south. Pennington Smart Seed Tall Fescue Blend provides improved, lower-growing tall fescue varieties that require less mowing and excel in transition conditions.\nZoysia grass is the warm-season alternative in the region. Its tolerance for cold earns it extensive use farther north. Low-growing and deep-rooted, water-wise Zoysia grass teams fine to medium texture with excellent traffic tolerance and low maintenance. It quickly forms a dense, cushiony turf that outcompetes weeds and naturally resists diseases and pests. Zoysia also stays green longer than other warm-season grasses. Its distinctive golden-beige dormant color is not unattractive, and Zoysia is among the first grasses to green in spring Pennington Zenith Zoysia Grass Seed & Mulch retains its green color even longer than other Zoysia varieties.\nBy matching your growing region's challenges with the grasses that suit them best, you can enjoy a beautiful lawn that complements your family activities, preferences for maintenance and appearance goals. Region-appropriate seed mixes and blends help provide every growing advantage. With improved disease, insect and drought resistance, grass seed by Pennington can help your lawn reach its full potential.\nPennington, Smart Seed, and Water Star are registered trademarks of Pennington Seed, Inc.

{"question":"Having worked with both air ejectors and dry-pit pumps, I'm curious about their respective maintenance advantages and disadvantages. Can you compare them?","answer":"Air ejectors and dry-pit pumps have distinct maintenance characteristics. Air ejectors, particularly steam jet air ejectors, are designed with heavy cast steel construction and contain diffusers, with newer designs having external diffuser arrangements and lighter vapor condenser shells. For dry-pit pumps, maintenance is relatively straightforward as they are not submerged in wastewater, allowing maintenance personnel to easily see, touch, listen to, and repair the pumps. This accessibility reduces diagnosis and repair time, and presents fewer health and safety risks. However, dry-pit pumps have the significant drawback of being below ground level, making them susceptible to flooding.","context":["Appliction of Air Ejectors:\n1.Steam Jet Air Ejector:\nIt is one of the types of air ejector which is used in the steam like near the condenser to remove the non condensable gases and some vapour entering into main condenser by an air ejector and it is cooled by the main condensate and released in the ejector condenser.\nA steam is used as the motive fluid to withdraw air and dissolved gases from the condenser by the ejector action. In each stage of the steam jet ejector, high pressure steam is expanded in a convergent /divergent nozzle. The steam leaves the nozzle at a very high velocity in the order of 1220 m/s and a proportion of the kinetic energy in the steam jet transferred by interchange of momentum to the body of air which entrained and passes along with the operating steam through a diffuser in which the kinetic energy of combined steam is re-converted to pressure energy.\nThe maximum pressure ratio that can be obtained with a single stage is roughly 5:1 and consequently it is necessary to use two or even three stages in series to establish a vacuum in the order of 724mm of Hg with reasonable steam consumption.\nThere are a variety of ejectors designed in service which work on the same principle. Older unit have heavy cast steel which serves as a vapour condenser and also contains diffusers. These are arranged vertically the steam entering at the top. More recent design has the diffuser arrangement externally and vapor condenser shell is some what lighter in construction.\nHorizontal singe element two stage air ejectors this unit comprises a stack u-tubes contained in a fabricated mild steel condenser shell on which is mounted a single element two stage air ejector.\nThe condensate from the main or auxiliary condenser is used as the cooling medium. High velocity operating steam emerging from the 1 st stage ejector nozzle entrains the non-condensable and vapour from the main condenser and the mix discharge into the inter condenser.\nMost of the steam and vapour is condensed when it comes into contact with the cool surface of the tubes, falls to the bottom of the shell and drains to the main or auxiliary condenser.\nThe remaining air and water vapour are drawn into the second stage ejector and discharged to the steam drain tank and non-condensable gases are at last discharged to the atmosphere through vacuum retaining valve.\n2.Fresh Water Generator:\nThe next main application of the air ejector in marine field is in fresh water generator as it is used to remove the air and non condensable in the evaporator chamber so as to maintain the vacuum inside the chamber. Thus the efficiency of the generation increases at low temperature of the sea water.\n3. Self Priming of Centifual Pumps:\nIt is also employed in priming of the centrifugal pumps by the air ejector, which removes the air inside the casing of the pump by the suction effect created by the air ejector thus by flooding casing with the liquid so that it helps in stating of the pump.","Types of Centrifugal Pumps in Wastewater, Self-priming pump, Dry-Pit Pumps & Dry-Pit Submersible Pumps\nPumps play a main role in water & wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations, Ease of maintenance & repair are an important consideration for those responsible for keeping pumps in good working condition, Pumps in pumping stations get waste from its source to the treatment plant, pumps are used to move influent, raw water, primary sludge, secondary sludge & return activated sludge through to final effluent.\nCentrifugal pumps are used in wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations, the dry-pit solids handling (or non-clog) pump with a flexible drive shaft and motor above grade was quite possibly the most popular style of the pump at the WWTP (Wastewater treatment plant) and PS (pumping stations).\nDry-pit pump stations\nDry-Pit Pumps are popular & found in operation across North America, They are built below ground, pumps (usually vertical) with flexible drive shafts and above grade air-cooled motors are installed in a dry well, adjacent to a wet well, There is a superstructure to allow personnel access to the dry well which houses electrical and other equipment required to run the station, these types of heavy duty centrifugal pumps have proven to be the rugged, reliable, work-horses of industry.\nDry-pit pumps (centrifugal) are not submerged into the wastewater, So, maintenance personnel can see, touch, listen to & easily repair the pumps, This makes them easier to repair, and reduces the amount of time required to diagnose and correct a pump failure, There are fewer health & safety risks associated with repairing dry-pit pumps as well.\nSince they are not submerged, they‚Äôre not covered in sewage, Dry wells themselves provide space required to manoeuver & provide protection from the elements, The drawback of the dry-pit pump is it is below ground level and always susceptible to flooding.\nDry-Pit Submersible Pumps\nDry-pit submersible stations are growing in acceptance & popularity for dry-pit applications, The dry-pit submersible pump station is not entirely different from a dry-pit station in that it still has a dry and wet well, however the pump configuration, particularly the motor is different, the motor is mounted directly to the pump, eliminating the intermediate shaft, The motor itself will circulate either sewage or glycol (superior to sewage) to cool the motor, which is designed to run continuously in air as well as submerged.\nDry-pit submersible pump (centrifugal) offers full protection against station flooding, The close coupled motor eliminates problems associated with flexible drive shaft breakages, Many conventional dry-pit pumps can be easily retrofitted to dry-pit submersible quickly & cost-effectively.\nSome drawbacks of dry-pit submersible can be related to motor failures in sewage cooled style motors, Particles from the sewage settle out and if not properly flushed/cleaned can lead to overheating of the motor, Glycol cooled CLC motors are far superior & virtually maintenance free, Retrofitting an old dry-pit pump installation with a new dry-pit submersible pump doesn‚Äôt always match up which can be inconvenient & expensive to change.\nSelf-priming pump will continue to move water like a standard centrifugal pump and it gets rid of the air, It can‚Äôt operate without water, It can handle a variety of fluids, it operates well with slurries, corrosive fluids, and solids, It is easier to operate, but it has its limitations, All centrifugal pumps need to be primed before operation, It can overcome the problem of air binding by mixing air with water.\nSolids handling is one of its most important benefits, as some self-priming pumps can handle solids up to 3-inches when compared to a submersible pump, Self-priming pump can continue pumping fluid while the pump is still situated out of the pit.\nSelf-priming pump disadvantages\nThe drawback is its inefficiency, as clearances often need to be larger to allow for better solids handling, also a larger volume to assist with self-priming, self-priming pumps come across various issues with continuous functioning, The main problem in a centrifugal pump occurs towards the pump‚Äôs suction side, and it needs re-priming.\nSelf-priming pumps need to be primed again following the initial priming, This is to ensure optimized operation due to multiple factors such as fluid evaporation during initial priming, The pump should be as close as possible to the suction source, Usually, 7.6 to 9 meter (25 to 30 feet) is the maximum recommended distance.\nThe suction line of a self-priming pump is always below the atmospheric pressure, So, some air leakage might occur, one should have a suction line at 0.5 metres (20 inches) of vacuum when the pump is functioning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with

{"question":"In terms of treatment duration and evidence base, what's the key difference between le traitement de Neurofeedback et la th√©rapie cognitivo-comportementale (CBT) for psychological interventions? #TherapyComparison","answer":"Neurofeedback treatment typically involves 40 half-hour sessions, as demonstrated in the study with fourth-grade students, while CBT is generally a shorter-term therapy lasting 2-3 months with weekly sessions. Regarding evidence base, CBT is well-established as an effective treatment for various mental health disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Neurofeedback, although used since 1976 for ADD, has not been sufficiently confirmed in its effectiveness and has never been regulated to replace medications like Ritalin, though research shows promise in improving reading comprehension and attention.","context":["Jeff La Marca, Ph.D., assistant professor of special education, has completed a study funded through a Seton Hall University Research Council Grant titled \"Evaluation of Artifact-Controlled Electroencephalographic (EEG) Training: A Pilot Study.\" The study provided further research into the use of EEG training, otherwise known as Neurofeedback, as a potentially useful non-medicinal method to improve focus and concentration for individuals diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. Specifically, Neurofeedback is used to train individuals to control their own brainwaves. In this study, La Marca evaluated how movements of the eyes and facial muscles (termed artifacts) affected the ability to accurately read brainwaves. Through potential future grant-funded research, La Marca aims to examine if Neurofeedback is a viable non-medicinal option to improve academic performance in students with attention deficits.\nNeurofeedback is a form of biofeedback, based on the principles of operant conditioning using EEG data, which trains individuals to control their own brainwaves. Although used to treat ADD since 1976, it has never been regulated to act in place of medications such as Ritalin. As such, its effectiveness has not been sufficiently confirmed. La Marca views his research of Neurofeedback as a potentially significant break-through in the safe treatment of ADD/ADHD, which may be used in schools.\nEssentially, individuals with ADD/ADHD experience an overabundance of theta brainwaves during many daily activities.. Theta is a frequency (4 to 8 Hz or cycles per second) that the brain usually produces when entering a light state of sleep. The ability to pay attention is optimum when a faster brainwave frequency, low beta brainwaves (15 to 18 Hz) are present. Neurofeedback has the ability to train the brain to reduce theta brainwaves and increase low beta when practiced during an extended period. This may help students with attention deficits to do better in school.\nLa Marca began his research in California, evaluating a group of fourth grade students during 40 half-hour sessions in which they played brainwave-activated video games while being monitored with electrode receivers. A car racing game was one of many different options where the students' opportunity to win was based on their ability to decrease their theta and increase their low beta brainwaves in order to compete against the computer and move the game forward. La Marca's findings found that Neurofeedback improved the group's reading comprehension, fluency, and speed at the conclusion of the training.\nThe next phase of La Marca's research sought to explore how the removal of artifacts, such as muscle and eye movements, would serve to improve the accuracy of the results. Fourteen New Jersey college students were selected for participation based on previous diagnoses of ADHD or for meeting inclusionary criteria suggesting an attention deficit. Those meeting inclusionary criteria were randomly assigned to either an artifact-corrected group or non-artifact corrected group. Participants and Seton Hall graduate research assistants were blinded to the purpose of the study and were told that the research was designed to measure changes in attention. Only La Marca knew which participants were assigned to each group. As anticipated, students who were trained with extraneous signaling due to muscle and eye movements were more successful in controlling their brainwaves and showed significant improvements in attention as measured by computer assessments.\nLa Marca has collaborated with colleagues in the fields of psychology to produce his research, yet is unique among them as an educator with a focus on neurological conditioning. He is now in the process of disseminating the findings of his research via journal publications and conference presentations and is pursuing grant funding that would allow him to replicate it on a larger scale. His future work could have implications for academic achievement, assessment, and intervention in schools.

To learn more about our program offerings and our various nationwide treatment centers, call\nWhat Is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a form of behavioral therapy and a well-established treatment intervention for people suffering from a wide range of mental health disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on cognition, or how your thoughts can influence your mood ‚Äì not vice-versa.2 CBT is a goal-oriented type of therapy that addresses cognitive issues such as dysfunctional automatic thoughts, maladaptive thinking (or cognitive distortions), and underlying core beliefs.2 Most therapists who use CBT customize the therapy to the specific needs of each patient.2\nCognitive behavioral therapy was developed in the 1960s by psychiatrist Aaron Beck.2 CBT originated when Beck‚Äôs perspective changed on mental health conditions from viewing depression and anxiety as mood disorders to viewing these conditions as cognitive disorders.2\nFor example, if a CBT patient‚Äôs automatic interpretation of a situation is seen through a negative lens of cognition (thoughts and beliefs), then it is likely to impact their mood negatively.2 Maladaptive thinking or cognitive distortions, such as overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, or personalizing situations, can cause errors in logic and misguided conclusions, sometimes resulting in or worsening of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.2\nUnderlying core beliefs can shape someone‚Äôs life and be the foundation for automatic thinking. Someone‚Äôs ways of thinking and perceiving can undoubtedly shape the way that they interpret the world around them (and their role in it).2\nBeck believed that dysfunctional, automatic thinking, even if it exaggerated or distorted, plays a significant role in mental and behavioral disorders.2\nThe ultimate goal of CBT is to address these negative patterns of thinking and subsequent behaviors to create positive change in a person‚Äôs life for the better.2\nAlthough CBT is effective in treating mental disorders, CBT can be helpful for anyone looking to make a shift in the quality and health of their thinking or improve their mood.\nHow Does CBT Work?\nThe fundamental principles of CBT are:1\n- Psychological disorders are based, in part, on inaccurate ways of thinking.\n- Psychological disorders are also based on learned patterns of negative behavior.\n- People suffering from psychological disorders can learn better ways of coping, thereby relieving their symptoms and subsequently creating positive changes in their lives.\nTherapists may also help clients by using role-playing techniques to develop a plan for how to deal with potentially problematic situations in the future.1\nFor example, creating a pros and cons list of reactions to various situations can help people gain an understanding of how their thoughts and actions may make things better or worse. It is important to play out those scenarios in therapy before they need to draw on them in life. Having a plan of action before a person needs this plan can help people feel more prepared and confident. Every person‚Äôs challenges in life are unique, so it is up to both the therapist and patient to develop a treatment strategy to address the patient‚Äôs needs. What works for one person may not work for another.1\nCBT with a trained therapist helps clients take control of their cognition and develop healthier ways to think, emote, and behave independently and through tangible exercises. The therapist and client work collaboratively to develop strategies to not only have an awareness of negative thought patterns and beliefs but to learn to problem solve and change their behaviors.1 It is a solution-based form of therapy focused less on the past and more on the present and what to do now to make things better.1\nGoals of CBT\nThe goals of CBT will include developing an awareness of one‚Äôs misguided thinking patterns that are creating problems in their life and re-evaluating such thinking in light of reality.1 CBT also encourages people to understand the motivation and behavior of themselves and others, as well as using realistic problem-solving techniques to solve problems.1 As a result, this should build a person‚Äôs confidence in their abilities to manage stressful situations.\nAnother goal of CBT treatment is to help people learn how to calm their mind and body and begin to face their fears instead of avoiding them.1 CBT can be an empowering tool to help people realize that they can manage their emotions and various situations they may encounter throughout their lives in a healthier manner.\nBenefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\nCBT is a practical, goal-oriented form of therapy. It is a collaborative effort between the therapist and patient that can help the patient improve many aspects of their life.2 Treatment is individualized, so cognitive behavioral therapy may look different for different people. CBT has been shown to be beneficial in treating anxiety, depression, and even ADHD.2 It is also a form of short-term therapy, with weekly sessions typically lasting 2-3 months.2\nIs CBT Covered by Insurance?\nThe short answer is yes, cognitive behavioral therapy is typically covered by insurance. The Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurance companies must cover mental health and substance use disorders on par with coverage for medical or surgical procedures.5\nHowever, individual plans and coverage will vary depending on carriers. If you have questions about your coverage, call the number on your insurance card to find out more information about your specific plan. Some cognitive behavioral therapists accept insurance, but others may not accept insurance. Others may be out-of-network (OON) but offer patients the option of paying their therapy costs up-front and then sending a superbill to their insurance company for reimbursement. In that case, the therapist gives the client the paperwork necessary to submit their insurance claim directly to their provider.\nIs CBT Covered by Medicare and Medicaid?\nMedicaid is the largest payer for mental health services in the United States.6 The Affordable Care Act also expanded Medicaid benefits to millions of Americans that didn‚Äôt previously qualify. All Marketplace plans cover both mental health and substance use disorder treatments as ‚Äúessential health benefits.7\nCBT is considered an evidence-based treatment option for mental health and SUDs.

In mining operations, however, the monitoring appears less effective, as demonstrated by the Mount Polley case where 'poor practices' and 'non-compliances' led to a major disaster, highlighting inadequate oversight despite the technical capability for environmental monitoring and waste management.","context":["The B.C. Ministry of Environment has quietly granted the Mount Polley Mining Corporation permission to drain mining waste directly into Quesnel Lake, B.C.‚Äôs deepest fjord lake and a source of drinking water for residents of Likely, B.C., as part of a ‚Äúlong-term water management plan.‚Äù\nThe wastewater discharge permit comes nearly three years after the collapse of the Mount Polley mine tailings pond spilled an estimated 25 million cubic metres of mining waste into Quesnel Lake, in what is considered the worst mining disaster in Canadian history.\nNo charges and no fines have been laid for the spill that cost B.C. taxpayers an estimated $40 million in cleanup costs and that B.C.‚Äôs chief mine inspector, Al Hoffman, found was the result of ‚Äúpoor practices‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-compliances.‚Äù\nSome critics feel the new wastewater discharge permit simply grants Mount Polley the permission to continue polluting Quesnel Lake.\n‚ÄúThe permit really adds insult to injury,‚Äù said Nikki Skuce, project director for Northern Confluence, an initiative based out of Smithers that aims to improve land-use decisions in B.C.‚Äôs salmon watersheds.\nThe permit grants Mount Polley, owned by Imperial Metals, permission to release diluted wastewater collected in the mine‚Äôs drainage ditches to be piped deep into Quesnel Lake 45 metres below the surface.\n‚ÄúTo the layperson that might sound okay, but in digging down deeper what Imperial Metals asked for was for a huge increase in the amount of heavy metals, like selenium, copper, arsenic and others, they can release into the lake,‚Äù Skuce said.\n‚ÄúThey come up with this plan and it‚Äôs to continue pollution, to allow for long-term pollution to go into Quesnel Lake.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only two years into the disaster and it is not clear what the impacts are. Salmon run in four year cycles and yet they‚Äôre permitting more pollution.‚Äù\nB.C. Government Unaware ‚ÄòWhat True Consultation Means,‚Äô Say Locals\nIn a press release, the B.C. Ministry of Environment said the permit was granted after extensive community and First Nations consultation.\nLocal municipalities as well as local First Nations were vocally against the permit, however.\n‚ÄúOngoing concerns raised by members of the Xat‚Äôsull (Soda Creek) and T‚Äôexelc (Williams Lake Indian Bands), as well as formal opposition taken by local organization such as the Likely Chamber of Commerce, Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake, and local members of the First Nation Women for Responsible Mining clearly indicate that [Mount Polley‚Äôs] long-term water management plan, as currently proposed, is unacceptable.‚Äù\nJacinda Mack from the Xat‚Äôsull First Nation gathered 250 signatures from predominantly local First Nations who opposed the plan.\n‚ÄúThere was extensive consultation,‚Äù Richard Holmes, fisheries biologist and resident of Likely, B.C., told DeSmog Canada, ‚Äúhowever, the government, who should be governing fairly for all, has lost its way.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe government is bound by extremely weak regulations and law that applies to mining and the company took full advantage of this in spite of the overall opposition by the First Nations and especially the local residents who call this area their home.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe provincial government has no idea what true consultation with action really means. Consultation to them remains a catchphrase term meaning ‚Äòthis is what we are going to approve‚Ä¶thanks for listening to our plan,‚Äô ‚Äú Holmes said.\n‚ÄúI would have supported their efforts to continue to mine if they were better environmental stewards,‚Äù he said.\nSkuce, who has participated in numerous community consultation processes related to B.C. mines, said communities often feel government engagement is one-sided.\n‚ÄúGovernment often speaks about robust public engagements with communities and First Nations but quite often it‚Äôs an extremely technical one-way engagement,‚Äù Skuce, who participated in the public engagement process, said.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a process that is meant to make people‚Äôs voices heard.‚Äù\nAfter submitting comments to the Ministry of Environment during the public consultation process, Skuce was told by the ministry to direct her questions about the permit directly to Mount Polley.\n‚ÄúWhat is not clear is where my questions go. Are they just sent to the company? Does the government monitor the company‚Äôs intake and response to those questions?‚Äù Skuce said.\n‚ÄúAnd who is holding this company to account? Just us, the public?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt really sheds a light on the extent to which there is regulatory capture in this province.‚Äù\nHolmes said the original permit for the Mount Polley mine in the 1990s prevented the company from discharging water from the site into nearby lakes.\n‚ÄúAnd look where we are now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe feel deceived.‚Äù\nImperial Metals Major B.C. Liberal Donor\nSince 2005 Imperial Metals and the Mount Polley Mining Corporation have donated $195,010 to the B.C. Liberals. B.C.'s political donation rules are some of the weakest in the country and place no limits on corporate donations.\nUgo Lapointe, MiningWatch Canada‚Äôs program coordinator, said it is concerning that major political donor Imperial Metals has not been held accountable for the tailings pond collapse.\n‚ÄúThe key message to Canadians is this was the biggest mining spill in Canadian history and there have been zero sanctions and zero fines, and certainly that‚Äôs not because of lack of evidence of damage to the environment,‚Äù Lapointe told DeSmog Canada in a previous interview.\nMiningWatch launched a private prosecution against Imperial Metals and the B.C. government for violation of the federal Fisheries Act. The company escaped those charges recently, after the case was blocked by federal government lawyers.\nHolmes said the lack of accountability in B.C. for companies like Imperial Metals, which are also major political donors, is troubling.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a worrisome trend in a democracy such as in Canada when the corporations dictate the outcome of government decisions through their lobbying for weaker regulations to say nothing of the scandalous practice of corporate donations to our Liberal government,‚Äù he said.\nSkuce said the high level of political donations in the province appear to give mining companies outsized political influence.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for the public to have confidence that the high contributions these companies make don‚Äôt have influence in the process,‚Äù she said, adding the circumstances make British Columbians suspicious of favourable industry permits.\n‚ÄúWhat we have in B.C. is a government trying to say to the public that everything is okay now, that they‚Äôve fixed everything. But the story on the ground is that they‚Äôve continued permitting pollution and aren‚Äôt going to hold the company accountable for the spill,‚Äù Skuce said.\nImage: Mount Polley mine tailings pond collapse, August 2014. Photo: Cariboo Regional District via Youtube","Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world‚Äôs surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

{"question":"Does ANSI have a similar international presence comme UL in terms of global standardization work?","answer":"ANSI and UL have different types of international presence. UL has a direct global operational footprint with 170 testing facilities and 11,615 employees across 40 countries, actively performing product evaluations worldwide. ANSI, while also involved internationally, functions more as an oversight organization that includes industry, standards developing organizations, and other stakeholders, focusing on enhancing US global competitiveness through promoting voluntary consensus standards and conformity assessment systems rather than direct testing and certification operations.","context":["We define prosperity as a thriving, abundant future for all. The role we play in helping secure this possibility is critical to our world and directly linked to our founding legacy to ‚Äúdo something for humanity‚Äù by helping create safer living and working environments for people everywhere.3\nOur everyday work finds UL employees engaging their expertise across a wide range of industries, helping to ensure the safety, security and sustainability of the products and processes we evaluate, test and certify.

SDG No. 17 reveals the need for cross-industry, public, private and civil society partnerships to accomplish sustainability goals. We embrace this SDG through participating in collaborative research and demonstration projects and working directly with partners across the circularity value chain. In 2019, UL sustainability experts contributed to the following organizations to share insights, progress innovations and collaborate on advancing the SDGs:\nBloomberg Sustainable Business Summit ‚Äî For the past two years, UL has been actively supporting the Bloomberg Sustainable Business Summits. In 2019, we shared how emerging technologies are driving sustainable action and measuring success. Key takeaways from the 2018 summit were captured here.\nCE100 ‚Äî UL became a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation CE100 in 2019, collaborating with industry leaders to advance circularity. One of the first projects UL worked on was a mass-balance approach to calculating recycled input generated through a chemical recycling process.\nGreenBiz ‚Äî UL co-hosted GreenBiz‚Äôs inaugural circularity-themed conference, Circularity19. Circularity offers innovative ways to operationalize sustainability into business. To learn more, listen to this GreenBiz podcast episode 177: ‚ÄúSounding off at Circularity19.‚Äù\nGlobal Cities, Inc. ‚Äî UL is a longtime partner of the annual Pritzker Forum on Global Cities. This event brings together mayors, academics, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and industry stakeholders from around the world to share knowledge and practices to address the challenges facing cities today. This year‚Äôs forum focused on sustainable growth.\nSharing research and scientific expertise\nU.S. Department of Energy (DOE) research ‚Äî In January 2019, UL completed work on two DOE three-year research grants to further understand the life of photovoltaic (PV) modules in collaboration with team members from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), academia and industry. These projects will inform the PV industry about the best ways to design and develop materials and PV modules, promoting more durable PV systems that exceed the current performance and financial aspects of solar power. In 2019, we were awarded another DOE three-year research grant to extend our work analyzing the condition of fielded PV modules installed and operating in different environmental conditions around the U.S., and ultimately the world.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and UL workshop ‚Äî In December 2019, UL co-hosted the first NIST/UL Workshop on PV Materials Durability at NIST‚Äôs campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This conference brings together leading scientific experts in solar power from around the world to address cutting edge ways to promote the best design, development, assessment and usage of solar power technologies.\nEnergy Storage System (ESS) Safety ‚Äî UL extended our thought leadership in energy storage system safety by developing key new requirements for safety. ESS supports renewables by capturing the energy from solar and wind, allowing it to be accessed when needed, even if the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. In late 2018, UL issued UL 1974, the U.S. and Canadian national safety Standard for Evaluation for Repurposing Batteries. This Standard promotes the safe reuse of EV batteries in the energy storage infrastructure, which helps extend resources, reduce waste and promote renewables. We followed our publication of the world‚Äôs first electrical energy storage (EES) safety Standard, UL 9540, the Standard for Energy Storage Systems and Equipment, with additional published requirements to address the fire safety of these systems. UL‚Äôs ESS and fire experts worked to issue new testing protocols that are being used by regulators around the country to help install ESS with confidence.\nBiofuel research and requirements ‚Äî UL worked with U.S. National Laboratories, automakers, the agricultural sector and industry stakeholders to proactively research, develop and publish requirements for new biofuels. Our work to establish requirements for mid-level ethanol fuel blends will lay the foundation for safety of fueling stations, support more rapid implementation of infrastructure and accelerate the ability to use more biofuels that burn cleaner than gasoline and produce lower levels of nitrous oxide (NOx) and other air pollutants.\nEV Charging ‚Äî UL has been advancing requirements for EV fast charging technologies as well as EV wireless charging. Both of these technologies offer easier and safer EV charging, which supports broader uptake of EVs and other zero-emission vehicles by the public. As we see increased deployment of renewables, this allows for clean electricity to increasingly charge zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and reduces emissions from fossil fuels. Through summits, technical analysis, modeling and collaboration with key stakeholders, UL has been highly active in advancing safe, sustainable and practical ZEV tech.\nPV Rapid Shutdown/Hazard Control ‚Äî As rooftop solar PV power becomes increasingly popular across the U.S. and the world, it presents challenges for the first responder community in carrying out their tactics in a building with rooftop PV. PV panels continue to generate electricity when exposed to light ‚Äî whether sunlight or even the artificial lighting used by fire departments at night ‚Äî that can generate enough electricity to injure or kill first responders if they come into contact. The presence of water in firefighting operations elevates the risk. UL has been working with the first responder community, the solar industry, the U.S. National Laboratories and others to help ensure the safety of new technologies that allow first responders to rapidly shut down the distribution of electricity from a rooftop PV array, keeping them safe as they carry out their critical missions. We conducted essential work with Sandia National Laboratories to assess the electric shock hazards for firefighters and are using that research to drive the optimal requirements for the use of that technology. This effort helps promote rooftop solar use while also protecting the lives of the firefighters.\nFirst hydrogen fuel station certification ‚Äî In 2018, UL issued the world‚Äôs first certification of the safety of a hydrogen fuel station. These stations are used to fuel hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) like the Toyota Mirai. HFCVs are extremely clean, as their byproduct is water. In 2019, these stations began being installed in the U.S., in southern California, to promote safe and clean transport in a region challenged by air pollution from vehicles using internal combustion and diesel engines.\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Renewable Energy Scheme (IECRE) First Solar Certificate ‚Äî The IECRE is a new conformity assessment scheme to promote easier global deployment of large scale wind, solar and marine power plants. UL has been deeply engaged in setting up the scheme since its inception, in all three sectors. In 2019, UL issued the first certificate under the solar sector for First Solar, a leading global manufacturer of innovative solar systems.\nEmpowering our customers‚Äô impact\nTesting, inspection, certification\nUL GREENGUARD ‚Äî According to the latest Global Burden of Disease study, 1.6 million people died prematurely in 2017 as a result of indoor air pollution.

Those discussed here include: American National Standards Institute (ANSI), ASTM International, FM Global, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Safety Equipment Institute (SEI), Underwriters‚Äô Laboratories Inc. (UL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Group.\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a diversified and unique nonprofit organization that includes industry, standards developing organizations, trade associations, professional and technical societies, government, labor and consumer groups. ANSI oversees the creation, promulgation and use of thousands of standards and guidelines that directly impact businesses in nearly every sector. ANSI is also actively engaged in accreditation ‚Äì assessing the competence of organizations determining conformance to standards. ANSI was formed originally as the American Engineering Standards Committee on Oct. 19, 1918. ANSI‚Äôs mission is to enhance both the global competitiveness of U.S. business and the U.S. quality of life by promoting and facilitating voluntary consensus standards and conformity assessment systems; and safeguarding their integrity.\nASTM International, originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, was formed in 1898, when a group of engineers and scientists got together to address frequent rail breaks. Their work led to standardization on the steel used in railroad construction. ASTM International is a not-for-profit organization that provides a forum for the development and publication of voluntary consensus standards for materials, products, systems and services. It is one of the largest voluntary standards developing organizations in the world. Standards developed at ASTM International are the work of over 30,000 members. Technical experts represent producers, users, consumers, government and academia from over 1400 countries. Members belong to one or more committees, each of which covers a subject area. These committees develop more than 12,000 ASTM International standards that can be found in the 77-volume Annual Book of ASTM Standards.\nFM Global is one of the world‚Äôs largest commercial and industrial property insurance and risk management organizations specializing in property protection. It was formed in 1835 by Zachariah Allen, who felt the need for an industrial insurance group to focus on loss control. FM Global has six business units:\n- FM Global Group ‚Äì Mitigating business risk through all its business units\n- AFM ‚Äì Commercial property insurance and property insurance expertise for the Middle Market\n- FM Approvals ‚Äì Third-party certification for company products worldwide\n- FM Global Cargo ‚Äì Comprehensive cargo coverage and risk engineering services\n- Mutual Boiler RE ‚Äì Provides breakdown treaty reinsurance and related support services for boiler systems\n- Emergency Response Consultants ‚Äì Offers hands-on emergency response training to all levels of fire brigades, hazardous material emergency responders, technical and confined-space rescue teams, emergency medical services and local fire departments\nEach unit helps its clients manage their property risks through a variety of products and services. The FM Approvals business unit certifies industrial and commercial products and services. When a product or service meets FM Approvals‚Äô standards, it is issued the FM Approved mark to signify it will perform as expected and support property loss prevention. The FM Approvals business unit backs its evaluations with scientific research and testing and lists more than 45,000 certified products in its approval guide.\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1896, devoted to eliminating death, injury, property and economic loss due to fire, electrical and related hazards. NFPA membership totals more than 60,000 individuals and more than 80 national trade and professional organizations. NFPA‚Äôs mission is to help save lives and reduce loss with information, knowledge and passion. NFPA‚Äôs 300 codes and standards influence every building, process, service, design and installation in the U.S. and many of those used in other countries. The National Electric Code (NFPA 70), Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) and Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA 30) are widely used.\nThe Safety Equipment Institute (SEI) was organized in 1981 and is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. It is a private, nonprofit organization with third-party certification programs to test and certify a wide array of safety equipment. SEI‚Äôs certification programs are accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) in accordance with ISO Guide 65 General Requirements for Bodies Operating Product Certification Systems. SEI has an alliance with INSPEC International, Ltd., a notified body located in the UK. Together, they offer a variety of testing services, CE Marking and ISO Registration.\nSEI certification programs include ongoing product testing and quality assurance audits of product models voluntarily submitted by manufacturers. All product testing is done in accordance with the selected voluntary, government or other standards available for the given product. SEI will certify the manufacturer‚Äôs product model and grant the right to use the SEI certification label when:\n- The testing lab has determined that the product model has been tested and successfully meets the appropriate product standard.\n- The quality assurance auditor has determined that the manufacturer complies with SEI quality assurance requirements.\nSEI publishes a certified product list and it is continuously updated to reflect the latest information. SEI does not offer a warranty for the performance of the product, but having a product certified by SEI shows that the manufacturer is taking responsibility for producing a quality product.\nUnderwriters' Laboratories Inc. (UL) is an independent, not-for-profit product safety certification organization that has been testing products and writing safety standards since 1894. UL publishes 1,614 safety standards, and performs approximately 96,000 product evaluations of components, materials and systems with 22 billion UL marks appearing on 71,000 manufacturers‚Äô products each year.\nUL‚Äôs mission is to conscientiously advance safety science through careful research and investigation, applying their efforts to prevent or reduce loss of life and property and to promote safe living and working environments for all people. This is supported by 170 testing and certification facilities and a staff of 11,615 employees located in 40 countries.\nThe Canadian Standards Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association) is an independent, not-for-profit, member-based association dedicated to advancing safety, sustainability and social good. It is an internationally accredited standards development and testing and certification organization. They also provide consumer product evaluation and education and training services.

{"question":"I'm a first-grade teacher and I've noticed some overlap between my English Language Learners' struggles and students with phonological processing difficulties. How do the manifestations of these two challenges compare in young students?","answer":"Both ELL students and those with phonological difficulties can show similar patterns in their struggles, but for different underlying reasons. Students with phonological awareness difficulties typically struggle with manipulating sounds, identifying rhymes, and breaking words into syllables regardless of language. Meanwhile, ELL students may show similar difficulties specifically with English sounds that don't exist in their native language, but demonstrate strong phonological skills in their first language. For example, in both Spanish and English, children with dyslexia consistently show trouble processing sounds, hearing sounds in order, and distinguishing between similar sounds. However, ELL students without learning disabilities may go through a normal 'silent period' while absorbing the new language, which could be mistaken for a learning difficulty but is actually part of normal second-language acquisition.","context":["Learning disabilities ‚Ä¶\nAre considered intrinsic to the individual Are presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction Last throughout the person‚Äôs life Involve significant difficulties in listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematics* To be considered learning disabled, the child must have average or above average intelligence.\n*Adapted from National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities. (1998). Operationalizing the NJCLD definition of learning disabilities for ongoing assessment in schools. ASHA 40 (Suppl. 18)\nWhat would make a teacher suspect that a child might have learning disabilities?\nA teacher would notice a student not making progress in the areas of: ‚Ä¢ Reading ‚Ä¢ Writing ‚Ä¢ Spelling ‚Ä¢ Comprehension ‚Ä¢ Math ‚Ä¢ Reasoning ‚Ä¢ Problem solving\nEnglish language learners with learning disabilities\nChildren who are English language learners (ELLs) sometimes have learning disabilities (LD). These children have two separate challenges as they learn in school. But those two challenges are intertwined to such an extent that it is often difficult to determine the difference between language difficulties and a learning disability.\nThere are similar patterns for learning disabilities across languages.\nIn both Spanish and English for example, children with dyslexia might have trouble: ‚Ä¢ Processing sounds ‚Ä¢ Hearing sounds in order ‚Ä¢ Distinguishing between two similar sounds ‚Ä¢ Playing with sounds (e.g., rhyming) ‚Ä¢ Reading single words\nSteps for distinguishing between language difficulties and a learning disability\n1. 2. Screen ELL students when they first come to school. Use that as a baseline. Employ research-based teaching strategies known to be effective with English language learners. Adjust and adapt these strategies as needed and monitor for progress. If progress is not adequate, seek expert evaluation.\nThis is an incredibly complex situation, and researchers are working to find a better understanding of the overlapping issues involved. Meanwhile, teachers and schools have to work with these kids; these steps can help.\nThe teacher is a detective who starts the process of identifying a learning disability.\nGather such information as: ‚Ä¢ What was the previous language of instruction? ‚Ä¢ Was this child exposed to English before? ‚Ä¢ How many years of educational opportunity have they had? ‚Ä¢ Have they been responding to that opportunity? Discuss this information with experts at the school: ‚Ä¢ ELL teacher ‚Ä¢ Special ed teacher ‚Ä¢ School psychologist Decide together if a formal assessment is a good idea.\nAssessment in both native language and English = gold standard\nGives a complete picture of what the student knows\nComparison of results can show whether the child‚Äôs difficulties reach across both languages or are an issue of acquiring a second language Called ‚Äúdual language assessment‚Äù\nWho can perform dual language assessments?\nIdeally, a bilingual school psychologist trained in assessment Other bilingual staff members or community members who are trained to work in tandem with the school psychologist\nA comprehensive dual language special education assessment looks at ‚Ä¶\nSpeech-language ‚Ä¢ how well children understand concepts ‚Ä¢ how well they understand words ‚Ä¢ how well they‚Äôre able to use words in their first language and also in the second language Reading ‚Ä¢ ability to process sounds ‚Ä¢ ability to read words ‚Ä¢ ability to comprehend what they‚Äôve read Writing Math\nIt is vital that the assessment instrument is ‚Ä¶\nCulturally sensitive, not culturally biased Accurate, that it really measures the skill it is assessing Vetted for reliability and validity with English language learners Administered by someone who is qualified and trained to do so\nFor more information on assessing ELLs for LD, please see this article on LD OnLine: Learning Disabilities in English Language Learners, by Dr. Louise Spear-Swerling.\nELL students often go through a non-verbal period in which they‚Äôre absorbing information. This ‚Äúsilent period‚Äù can be confused for a learning disability when, in fact, it‚Äôs just a part of the second-language acquisition process.\nFirst steps after the LD is identified\nOnce a learning disability is identified, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) must be formulated to figure out how to best help the student. For ELL students with LD, it is important that the plan includes what the language of instruction will be. And once that decision is reached, it is important to stick to it. Be consistent with the language of instruction, and give the student time to respond to that instruction model.\nEducators must consider certain adaptations when creating an IEP for an ELL student:\nHow can we make what we‚Äôre trying to teach more comprehensible? Do we need to take smaller steps in getting to the goal? Have we provided enough native language support so students can understand the information and reach their goals?\nExample: An IEP for third grade newcomer with dyslexia\nSimilar to an IEP for a native English speaker in calling for work in phonological awareness, phonics, and reading and requiring ongoing checks of a student‚Äôs progress toward goals. Dissimilar (perhaps) in specifying that the language used to conduct intervention match the language of instruction in the general education classroom; calling explicitly for teaching ‚Äúnew sounds‚Äù not prevalent in the native language; requiring teaching of cross-linguistic relationships ‚Äî the differences within and across languages.\nMost teachers will have an ELL student in their classroom at some point.\nWhat teachers should know: ‚Ä¢ Effective practices in the general classroom also work with ELL students. It‚Äôs important to give ELL students native language support and to explicitly teach the connections (similarities and differences) between the first language and the second.\nMonolingual teachers can still help their ELL students.\nYou don‚Äôt have to know the language to know the cross-linguistic relationships For example, in alphabetic languages a teacher can see some shared and unshared components. With Spanish, many consonants sound the same in English. But vowel sounds differ, an area in which the teacher can help students understand the patterns of differences.\nMake sure students are following what‚Äôs happening in the classroom.\nDefine basic vocabulary words. Use visuals. Use hands-on activities.\nUse lots of repetition, rehearsal, and practice.\nWays teachers can make themselves more easily understood by ELLs with LD\nSpeak slowly, clearly, and naturally. Face your students and avoid putting your hand in front of your face. Be careful using idioms, e.g., ‚Äúback-seat driver‚Äù; ELLs may take it literally. Alert your students when something is particularly important.

As students begin to understand the connection between speech and print, they are able to segment sentences into words, then syllables, and finally to phonemes, or the sounds in our language. Alliteration and rhyming are also two phonological awareness tasks. Phonological awareness is often referred to as a continuum, however, not all skills are developed sequentially. While students need to be able to break a sentence down into words before breaking the word into phonemes, rhyming can be developed in conjunction with some other skills. A child‚Äôs responsiveness to phonics is largely determined by the child‚Äôs phonological skills (Kilpatrick). Students that fail to develop phonological and phonemic awareness often struggle in their reading development. In fact, according to Dr. David Kilpatrick, phonological awareness is the single most important factor in differentiating struggling from successful readers. It‚Äôs a critical skill during early reading development in pre-school, kindergarten, and first grade. Explicit teaching of phonological awareness in young students can prepare students for future reading success.\nAnother important distinction to note- phonological awareness is oral. You may have heard the saying, ‚ÄúPhonological awareness can be done in the dark‚Äù. When it‚Äôs attached to print, it becomes phonics. But, it can be developed alongside phonics. It‚Äôs typical for beginning readers in kindergarten to work on learning letter names and sounds (phonics) while they‚Äôre also working on rhyming, alliteration, and segmenting onsets and rimes. To be successful with using phonics to read and spell words, students need strong phonological awareness to connect with their letter-sound knowledge. Phonological awareness, or more specifically phonemic awareness, continues to be built and supported through word building activities in conjunction with phonics. For some students, phonemic awareness work done in the context of phonics is enough to build their development. For others, however, not building a solid awareness of sounds without print will continue to inhibit their development of the skills necessary to become successful readers and writers. This post looks at phonological awareness as a whole. You can read more about phonemic awareness itself in my What is Phonemic Awareness and Phonemic Awareness Activities posts.\nPHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS CONTINUUM\nPhonological awareness work in kindergarten and first grade can result in significant benefits to children‚Äôs reading and spelling skills- even with as little as 5 hours of practice (Ehri, 2004). Some children, especially those with decoding difficulties or dyslexia, may continue to need instruction or intervention beyond first grade. This additional work should be targeted to the skill or skills students demonstrate deficiency. The phonological awareness chart below identifies some of the key skills moving from simple to complex. The earliest skills can begin to be worked on before traditional schooling- in pre-k or even at home. Skills like counting words in sentences, clapping syllables, listening for rhyming words, blending onsets and rimes are easily incorporated through oral word-play. More complex phonological awareness skills, like blending and segmenting phonemes, are more traditionally done in academic settings.\nAs mentioned above, phonological awareness is often done outside of print. Especially when working on skills beyond the individual sound, or phoneme, level. However, it is very beneficial for students to connect this work to something concrete. Using manipulatives like bingo chips, Unifix cubes, counting bears, and drawing lines helps young students connect that one word to something concretely one. It may also be helpful for students to use their fingers to count one-by-one. I have a more in-depth post on Phonemic Awareness Activities that continues where this one left off.\n- Counting Words in Sentences: While technically a language comprehension activity, it‚Äôs important for young students to hear that sentences are composed of individual words. Once students can hear the separation between the words in a sentence, they are ready to start breaking those words into syllables.\n- Counting Syllables: For many students, they are able to identify syllables based on the opening and closing of the mouth. Give one word, have students repeat it, and model how your mouth opens and closes as you say that word. Clapping also helps students identify the syllables within a word.\n- Segmenting and Blending Syllables: A good beginning step for this is using compound words- students can readily hear the separation of /rain/ and /bow/ since it‚Äôs a word they are familiar with. After students are able to separate compound words, the next step is with two syllable words such as begin and basket before moving onto 3 syllable words.\n- Manipulating Syllables: Beginning with adding, then deleting, and finally substituting, also is a bit easier to begin when using compound words. It helps young students hear the separation between syllables. After quickly moving to multi-syllable words, students add, remove, and replace syllables to form new or nonsense words. Using something tactile as a placeholder, such as a cube or counting bear, helps students think of each syllable separately. Have students repeat each syllable after you before completing the final task (i.e. removing).\n- Blending Onset and Rimes: A rime is the vowel and any consonants following. In short, you rhyme the rime. Blending onsets and rimes is a precursor to later segmenting and blending phonemes. I find picture cards to be helpful when working on this task so students have a reinforcement of the word. Begin by modeling as you blend an onset (use only onsets with one singular sound) and rime. ‚ÄúI can blend parts to make a word. /c/ /at/ /cat/.‚Äù\n- Identifying Rhymes: Identifying rhymes should be done much in the same way as blending onsets and rimes- with that separation between the two so students can hear that they‚Äôre the same. ‚ÄúWords rhyme when they have the end with the same sounds. Listen /c/ /at/ /cat/, /b/ /at/ /bat/. Cat and bat rhyme because they both end in the sounds /at/. Initial rhyme identification should include words that are easily identifiable as rhyming but should then move to more complex words. For example, don‚Äôt begin with ‚Äújam‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äù because the difference between /m/ and /n/ is not as easy to identify as /m/ and /t/, for example.\n- Generating Rhymes: Generating rhyming words can be a complex task for students still struggling with phonological awareness. With that said, nonsense words should be accepted for rhyming generation so that the focus is on hearing the rime.\nActivities for students to practice phonological awareness independently can be difficult to find. My favorite go-to resource is the Florida Center for Reading Research. I have used the activities from this site for almost years to target beginning reading skills. Here are some of the phonological awareness activities they offer.\nI also have a digital activity for rhyme identification: Odd One Out. To download it for free, fill out the form below. You will get the file with the link to create a copy for your own files along with directions on how to use the Google Slides activity. There are 30 Slides included- or easily break it apart into two smaller activities.\nIn primary grades, phonological awareness if not often assessed. It‚Äôs often only assessed in future years when students are struggling. As a deeper understanding of phonological awareness has grown, the push for assessments have also. My first experience with a phonological awareness assessment was the initial sounds assessment in DIBELS. However, that‚Äôs only one component. In most kindergarten and first grade classrooms, however, assessment of skills as they‚Äôre taught are often done. Assessments include identifying rhyming words and matching words that begin with the same initial sound. If you‚Äôre looking for a more comprehensive phonological awareness assessment, however, the links below are well researched and validated. They are especially helpful for identifying a students‚Äô weakness with phonological awareness- which is typically at the phoneme level.\nThe PAST Test from David Kilpatrick\nPhonological Awareness Assessments from Reading A-Z\nIf you‚Äôre feeling like you have a strong understanding of phonological awareness and want to take a closer look at phonemic awareness click the image below.

{"question":"As a cultural anthropologist studying religious festivals, I'm curious about the contrasting celebratory practices in Cusco. How do the religious celebrations in Az√°ngaro differ from the traditional Inti Raymi festival in Cusco?","answer":"The celebrations in Az√°ngaro center around their patron saint, the Virgen de Asunci√≥n, featuring packed cathedrals, marching bands, dancing cowboys in shiny boots, and early morning musical performances including Vivaldi's Four Seasons played from a hillside. In contrast, the Inti Raymi (Festival of the Sun) is a dazzling religious ceremony held at Sacsayhuaman fortress in honor of the Inca sun god Inti, marking the summer solstice on June 24th with a week of festivities.","context":["Full of gratitude from our experiences in Bolivia, it was time to head northwest to Cusco, Per√∫, on the final bicycle leg of our trip. It served up the best of everything bike-touring for us: lots of interaction with the locals, beautiful, mostly quiet roads, challenging ripio and mountain climbs (as well as some pushes), all through spectacular landscapes. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better cycle touring finish!\nThe ride from La Paz began by fixing a flat tire at the guesthouse, then rolling each loaded bike onto an aerial tram car and ascending 500 m (1,600 ft) to El Alto, then 7 km laterally over El Alto‚Äôs rooftops! From there, we climbed onto our bikes and headed out along the altiplano, treated to a spectacular view of the Cordillera peaks we‚Äôd just hiked among.\nWe chose the rural route along the northern edge of Lake Titicaca (link to a view of the lake from space), enjoying signs of country life, including a man-made reed island and hut. We stayed in and passed through a number of smaller Bolivian towns, reminding us why our bikes are our favorite mode of travel transport, even with occasional flat tires.\nWe spent our last night in Bolivia in Escoma, in one of the grimmest guesthouses of the trip, where we shared a bucket-flush toilet down the stairs with 4 burly truckers. We met a solo French bike tourer heading the opposite way, so over dinner we compared notes on the roads we‚Äôd each be traversing in the coming days. Being a regional border hub, Escoma is known for its large market, which was colorfully in swing as we left town.\nWe pedaled with almost no automobile traffic through small Bolivian villages along the lakeshore, and had some friendly kids run us down to take selfies with us as we labored up a hill.\nIn Puerto Acosta we found Bolivia‚Äôs border station closed, without explanation, so at the suggestion of locals, we set off into the village to look for the officer at his wife‚Äôs store. The store was closed, so we checked out the local church, and then returned to the station to find the jovial officer now ‚Äúin‚Äù. He has a portion of one wall devoted to photos/stickers/cards from passing bicycle tourists, to which we added our own.\nLeaving with our Bolivian exit stamps, the pavement ended and a challenging no-man‚Äôs-land ripio road took us up a mountain to panoramic views of Lake Titicaca. Pavement unexpectedly appeared when we crossed the invisible international border, and we coasted easily down into Tilali, Peru‚Äôs border town.\nWe found the Peruvian immigration office wide open to the town square, but it, too, was unoccupied!?! When the immigration officer returned, he couldn‚Äôt process our entry into Per√∫ due to a power outage, so he suggested we stay at the guesthouse next door, and said that the power would surely be on the following morning. The next morning we still had no power, but finally a can-do officer arrived and pulled out some old paper forms and stamped our passports.\nBack in Per√∫\nFour days after leaving La Paz, we had an incredibly scenic ride along the remainder of Lake Titicaca‚Äôs north shore, finishing at the town of Huancan√© where, even though it‚Äôs in Peru, a majority of the town‚Äôs 7,000 people still speak Aymara. Before going to bed, we tucked into a vintage ‚Äúchicken-thirty‚Äù dinner.\nThe next day we took a classic ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù to the town of Az√°ngaro on an extremely rural dirt road where we rolled through tiny altiplano villages with sheep, cows and alpacas; pushed up a steep jeep track alongside ancient stone walls; rolled over a 10-km long plateau pass; then dropped into the next valley, blinded by the setting sun. We were slowed down the entire day by wonderfully curious and welcoming residents, police, and shepherds along the way, all who wanted to take their picture with us.\nThe combination of challenging riding and everyone‚Äôs delightful interest made this day the first of our entire bike trip when we ran out of daylight before reaching our destination. We rode by headlights for the last hour down a sandy dirt road, passed occasionally by slow-moving motorcycles with dim headlights, or no lights at all. Even when we got to town, people‚Äôs curiosity remained high, so Clark ended up riding a few circles in the street so that the gathering group could figure out how those darn recumbent bikes work!\nEven though we were exhausted, we were compelled to stay up after dinner because the town had just begun their celebrations for their patron saint, the Virgen de Asunci√≥n. The cathedral was packed, and it was the staging area for marching bands and dancing cowboys in shiny boots, all heading out on parade.\nThe party resumed early the next morning. At 6:15am we were awoken by the sound of a marching band playing Vivaldi‚Äôs Four Seasons! The town‚Äôs band had hiked partway up the Stages of the Cross trail on a nearby hill and then pointed their instruments towards the town and delivered a concert for 20-30 minutes. Apparently no one is supposed to miss this important celebration!\nAnother beautiful day of riding, including an unexpected stop at a small-town church, ended in Ayaviri, which also had its own celebration going, this time a parade of giant plastic and paper mache dinosaurs made by the school children. Once again we‚Äôre finding that the Andean cultures never miss a chance for a party!\nAs we headed deep into the Peruvian Andes, we encountered a young couple of German cyclists at a natural hot springs resort near the top of a pass, where we all had a nice soak and camped for the night.\nThe heart of the Inca empire\nWe knew we were getting close to Cusco because of the ever-grander Andean mountains and valleys, more and more restaurant advertisements for ‚Äúcuy‚Äù (guinea pig), and the increasing number of historical and archaeological sites.\nThe first of these was Raqch‚Äôi, a primary control point on a road system originating in Cusco. It is a vast complex with dozens of round storage buildings, multiple small temples and the grand Temple of Wiracocha. The temple was built to appease the Inca creator-god, Wiracocha, who was believed to have rained fire on the community (via the nearby volcano Quimsa Chata). This was our first views of the amazingly precise Inca stonework, getting us excited for more to come in Cusco!\nNow within 100 km of Cusco, reasons to stop and sightsee along the way become frequent. We overnighted in the town of Checacupe with an Incan rope bridge and a statue sporting a striking Carnaval costume.\nIn a span of just 8 km, we visited three special churches in three separate villages, each with elaborate frescoes and carvings in the Andean Baroque style. They were periodically overrun by flocks of tourist buses visiting on day trips from Cusco. At the second church, during a lull, we got to see a funeral procession complete with marching band on a beautiful mosaic stonework plaza.\nAfter a welcoming greeting by curious locals in Andahualillas, we set off on our last riding day. The valleys were smokey from a runaway field fire. Along the way to Cusco we visited two archaeological sites: Rumicolca, a Wari aqueduct turned by the Inca into a ceremonial gate, and Pikillaqta, a large, pre-incan Wari walled settlement.\nAfter fixing our last flat tire of the trip (!!) we headed up the valley to Cusco, calming our mindset as the traffic increased. Along the way, dilapidated buildings hinted of an earlier time of flourishing industry, before tourism took over. We got onto a cycle-track as we hit one of the city‚Äôs main boulevards, and wound our way up through the ancient city to our Airbnb, located on a very narrow street in the Old Town.\nBefore diving into Cusco, we spent a couple days finding, customizing, and filling up boxes with our bikes and all of our gear, getting them ready for the upcoming plane flights.\nHaving visited Cusco and Machu Picchu about 9 years ago, we were surprised to see how much change has come to this UNESCO world heritage site. The old town has really gotten spruced up, with manicured buildings and well-lit streets. The amazing Incan stone work found at the base of so many buildings is now cleaned up and lit dramatically at night, on streets with every type of restaurant, from backpacker budget to international gourmet, and countless stores with everything from high-end mountaineering gear, to fine alpaca clothing, to funky bicycle shops, to artisanal metallurgy, and of course lots and lots of kitschy tourist schwag.\nAs touristy as it now is, we found the dressed-up Cusco to be a really special place, even compared with all of the wonderful cities we have visited over the last 15 months. A dramatic mountain setting, winding, narrow streets full of beautiful historic buildings, informative museums, plazas of all sizes and levels of grandeur, all steeped in history and culture -- we really enjoyed it here!\nEven though we‚Äôd seen it before, the Incan stone work blew our minds, again and again. It utilizes massive stones, some as big as small buses, interconnected in impossibly intricate shapes, with no mortar, and no spaces between the stones. We just couldn‚Äôt get enough (or take enough pictures) of this unique-in-the-world craftsmanship!\nEven though it‚Äôs known as the gateway to Machu Picchu (which we had the pleasure to visit years ago) Cusco‚Äôs valley has a vast array of amazing archaeological ruins in its own right, a host of which can be seen in a single day hike. We hiked up to the impressive Sacsayhuaman fort, and spent the rest of the morning walking around its vast grounds, dazed and amazed by the Inca‚Äôs ambition.\nA short taxi ride took us up to the water garden at Tampu Mach‚Äôay, at the top of the valley above the city. From there we walked down a loosely designated trail past the sites, all the way back into the city‚Äôs old town. We walked through Tampu Mach‚Äôay, Puka Pukara, Wayllarqocha, Chuspiyoq, Laqo (Templo de la Luna), Salapunco, Kusilluchyoq, Sillarumiyok, and Q‚Äôenqo (Grande and Chico). What an abundance of riches for a single day hike, mostly downhill, right back to Cusco‚Äôs Old Town!\nTransitioning... from bicycles to suitcases\nThe speedometer on Kacia‚Äôs bike computer gave up the ghost somewhere during our ride in Patagonia, but the odometer worked to the bitter end, logging every one of the 8,162 kilometers (5,072 miles) that we rode in South America.\nFrom Cusco we flew back down to Argentina to meet friends, beginning the ‚Äúsuitcase‚Äù phase of our trip. (Everything you see in the boxes eventually went home with our friends.) We spent time in Northeastern Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and finished the trip in Colombia, full circle from where we began in June 2018. We‚Äôll be covering those journeys in our next, and final post(s).\nWe‚Äôre currently at Kacia‚Äôs parents' house in Northern California enjoying their new puppy, Rosie, and will be moving back into our house in Portland in February.

Photo by Martin St Amant.\nWhy visit Cusco? (aka Cuzco)\nCusco, previously capital of the Inca empire is now capital of Peruvian tourism, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and primary destination for most tourists in the country, getting close to a million visitors a year. The official Quechua (Andean Indian language) name for Cusco is now Qosquo.\nAt an altitude of 3, 400m (11, 200ft) Cuzco (as the name is also spelled) is a chilly but charming town, half Inca, half Spanish. Built in the shape of a Puma with the hilltop fortress of Sacsayhuaman as the head, Cusco is one of the world‚Äôs prettiest towns and certainly Peru‚Äôs.\nWhite walls, three storey colonnaded buildings with terracotta tiled roofs and lots of woodwork make up the private sector, while the top section of many public buildings is Spanish colonial but the lower half is solid Inca stonework.\nIn one case there is a stone that is estimated to weigh 30 tons, has twelve sides, and fits perfectly into the middle of a wall of similar stones. Or was it 12 tons and 30 sides? Whatever, cement was never used and it is still impossible to get a knife blade into the cracks between the stones.\nPlaza de Armas, the heart of Centro Historico de Cusco, ringed by colonnaded walkways, magnificent architecture and several competing churches. Photo by Martin Lang.\nFood in Cusco is passable, especially if you are fond of Italian cooking as most of restaurants seem to be pizzerias or bistros. Pisco Sour is the traditional tourist drink and very tasty it is too, though usually made with a raw egg so beware if you have a delicate stomach.\nHotels range from quite expensive to very cheap while celebrations both big and small regularly offer bizarre spectacles.\nThe bugcrew stumbled into a firework show where men were holding up bamboo frames shaped ‚Äì among other things ‚Äì like ships and planes, loaded with rockets, which they fired at each other from a range of two or three metres. The encore was to put on paper mache bulls heads with variously fused rockets in place of horns and lunge repeatedly at the crowd, firing rockets at random. Cue for much shrieking and laughing and smell of burning hair.\nCuzco is not an good place to arrive at by plane direct from sea-level Lima, particularly for older, less fit travellers who may not enjoy altitude sickness.\nTry to arrange a gradual ascent such as taking a land route via Nazca, Arequipa (2, 400m) and possibly Lake Titicaca (3, 800m) if time permits. By the time you arrive in Cusco you will then be fitter, more comfortable in your environment and well acclimatised, ready to enjoy the holiday of a lifetime.\nNote that Cuzco has few attractions aimed at kids.\nPlaza de Armas and a closer look at the colonnades and Jesus‚Äô Company Church.

This is the heart of Cusco. The Inti Raymi festival takes place here in June.\n‚Ä¢ Cusco Cathedral, otherwise known as the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin. Built in 1654 it‚Äôs situated in Plaza de Armas, on the left in the photo above. Unlike most churches in the rest of the world tourists have to pay to enter but the interior is magnificent, loaded with gold (stolen from the Incas), fine woodwork and encompasses 13 varied chapels.

How?\nSpanish conquistadors arrived in Cusco in 1533, destroying many Inca structures but using Inca stone bases for adobe Spanish buildings that still stand today.\n‚Ä¢ Wandering the streets to stumble upon stuff like The Twelve Sided Stone. An amazing bit of showmanship, this large and superbly cut is embedded in a wall in Calle Hatum Rumiyoc.\n‚Ä¢ Barrio San Blas is the arty-farty neighbourhood uphill and north of Plaza de Armas, writhing with artists-manqu√©, neo-hippies, temporary settled backpackers. A great place to pick up unique souvenirs, eat alternative, smoke alternative and rhapsodise with bohemians.\n‚Ä¢ Inca Museum, Unsaac Museo Inca, displays a fantastic collection of items and information from pre-Inca civilisations through to the Spanish conquest, including the largest trove of Inca objects in the world. All this is located in one of Cusco‚Äôs best, half-Inca, half-Spanish Colonial buildings. A bit crude in places but essential for anyone interested in the Inca.\nYou may consider paying a modest sum for one of the private tour guides standing outside Coricancha or similar locations, they are well worth the money and can explain many interesting facts about Inca construction methods such as how they made their structures earthquake-proof, how they fitted the stones together without cement, about the traditional ceremonies that happened in these temples and so on.\nDon‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôll be avoiding the ubiquitous llamas just because you‚Äôre in an urban area. Actually the disgruntled one on the left (not the one with the hat) is an Alpaca. Of course this kind of photo costs a little, but be sure to negotiate beforehand to avoid absurd demands!\nThe Inti Raymi, ‚ÄòFestival of the Sun‚Äô, is a dazzling religious ceremony held in Sacsayhuaman in honour of the Inca sun god, Inti, marking the summer solstice.

{"question":"I work in agricultural policy and I'm interested in understanding modern farming solutions. What are the effectiveness of Hartz IV reforms in addressing unemployment, and how does vertical farming present a sustainable alternative for job creation?","answer":"The Hartz IV reforms had minimal impact on unemployment reduction in Germany, contributing only a 0.1 percentage point decline in unemployment rates. The reform's reduction of unemployment assistance benefits proved largely ineffective, particularly for high and medium-wage earners who typically found jobs before benefit cuts took effect, while the impact on low-wage earners was negligible due to small differences in benefits. On the other hand, vertical farming presents a promising alternative for sustainable job creation, utilizing innovative techniques like hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics. As of 2020, there were approximately 30 hectares of operating vertical farms globally, achieving crop yields ten times higher than traditional farming methods. The sector offers employment opportunities in high-tech farming operations, requiring workers skilled in automated systems, computerized monitoring, and specialized growing techniques, while simultaneously addressing urban food production challenges with 95% less water consumption than conventional agriculture.","context":["The Hartz IV reform of the German labor market has been one of the most controversial reforms in the history of the reunited Federal Republic of Germany. It has been widely seen as the end of the welfare state leading into poverty.\nAt the same time, Germany has been able to reduce its unemployment rate over the last years more than almost any other European or OECD member country. What role did the Hartz reforms, and the Hartz IV reform in particular, play in this success story?\nA recent publication by Junior Professor Andrey Launov and Professor Klaus W√§lde of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) shows that the Hartz IV laws had indeed no noteworthy impact on the decrease of unemployment in Germany. Just in contrast to that, the Hartz I to Hartz III reforms appear to have been more helpful.\nThroughout decades unemployment benefits continue to remain an important tool used by policy makers to regulate performance of the labor market. In the recent past many economists have argued that too high unemployment benefits in the most of the European countries have led to too rigid and inefficient labor markets. They reduce incentives of unemployed workers to look for jobs and largely contribute to high and persistent unemployment.\nWith unemployment rates crossing the benchmark of 10 percent in nearly all major European economies between the early 1990s and the early 2000s, a number of European governments have responded with various labor market reforms. Not surprisingly, a reduction of unemployment benefits has become the core part of these reforms.\nGermany was not much different form its European neighbors. Between 2003 and 2005 it implemented a series of so-called Hartz reforms of the labor market. Among these the notorious Hartz IV reform of 2005 was reducing unemployment assistance benefits for the major part of the German workforce. It was also cutting the time period during which unemployment insurance benefits were to be paid.\nWhile the government aspired to curb unemployment, the danger of Hartz IV was obviously in hurting the least socially protected, such as for instance the long-term unemployed with low chances of finding a job. Indeed, the reform has quickly assumed a negative image in the perception of the general public. It was widely felt that Hartz IV is really \"the end of the welfare state\" and overall harmful to workers.\nThe new study by Launov and W√§lde, published in the renowned International Economic Review, looks into various impacts of the Hartz IV reform on the entire German labor market and on the different groups of workers. This study finds that contrary to initial aspirations the contribution of the Hartz IV reform to reducing unemployment in Germany as a whole has been exceptionally low. In fact, the reform can explain only 0.1 percentage point of the post-Hartz decline of the unemployment rate.\nThe reason for that is to be seen in the reform‚Äôs changes to replacement of employment income. The threat of ending up with lower unemployment assistance benefits once unemployment insurance expires is very low for high- and medium-wage earners. These workers as a rule find new jobs much faster than they would need to face the benefit cuts arranged under Hartz IV. So for them Hartz IV was virtually inessential. For low-skilled low-wage earners, who constitute the main part of long-term unemployment, the difference between their benefits before Hartz IV (\"Arbeitslosenhilfe\") and after Hartz IV (\"Arbeitslosengeld II\") turns out to be often too small to make any impact. Objective difficulties with regard to the employability of such workers make the benefit reform even less useful.\nThe reform has scored a stronger impact on the labor market in the East Germany compared to West Germany, though even here it was lagging behind the initial expectations.\nNevertheless, unemployment in Germany has sharply fallen after the whole set of Hartz reforms became legally effective. Launov and W√§lde point out that the impulse to this success comes most likely from the earlier packages of the reform, such as for instance from restructuring of the Federal Employment Agency as part of the Hartz III reform. The creation of job centers, the introduction of a single contact address for all claims by unemployed, the lowering of the number of unemployed per case worker, and other actions and measures under arrangements of Hartz III helped to reduce the unemployment rate by 1,3 percentage points. The reform of the Federal Employment Agency as such was thus considerably more effective than the reduction of benefits by Hartz IV. The Mainz economists conclude that the labor market indeed needed reforms but the particular composition of such reforms is the most crucial element of their success. ‚ÄúIt has been proven that aspects such as a reduction of unemployment assistance benefits, which is difficult to deal with in terms of distribution policy, have brought us to rather negligible consequences,‚Äù emphasize Launov and W√§lde.Publication:\nPetra Giegerich | idw\nGeographers provide new insight into commuter megaregions of the US\n01.12.2016 | Dartmouth College\nSustainable Development Goals lead to lower population growth\n30.11.2016 | International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)\nIn recent years, lasers with ultrashort pulses (USP) down to the femtosecond range have become established on an industrial scale.

Vertical farming is one such method that has been used all around the world. Food crops may be conveniently farmed in urban settings using Vertical Farming by planting in vertically stacked layers to conserve space and require little energy and water for irrigation.\nVertical farming is the process of producing crops in layers that are vertically stacked. Controlled-environment agriculture, which tries to maximise plant development, and soil-less farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics, are frequently used.\nBuildings, shipping containers, tunnels, and abandoned mine shafts are among popular structures used to host vertical farming systems. There are approximately 30 hectares (74 acres) of functioning vertical farms around the globe as of 2020. Vertical farming, in conjunction with other cutting-edge technology such as customised LED lighting, has resulted in crop yields that are more than ten times greater than those obtained by standard agricultural methods.\nVertical farming is still in its early stages in India, but there are a few entrepreneurs and agri-tech enterprises aiming to revolutionise the area.\nVertical Farming Background and Concept\nGilbert Ellis Bailey originated the phrase ‚Äúvertical farming‚Äù and published a book named ‚ÄúVertical Farming‚Äù in 1915. William Frederick Gerick pioneered hydroponics at the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 1930s.\nke Olsson, a Swedish ecological farmer, devised a spiral-shaped rail system for growing plants in the 1980s and proposed vertical farming as a method of raising vegetables in cities.\nProfessor Dickson Despommier invented the concept of vertical farming in 1999. His idea was to grow food in urban areas, utilising less distance and saving time in transporting food produced in rural regions to cities.\nHe aimed to produce food in urban areas in order to have fresher goods available sooner and at a reduced cost. As a result, vertical farming is defined as the cultivation and production of crops/plants in vertically stacked layers and vertically inclined surfaces.\nThe plants are vertically piled in a tower-like form in the physical arrangement. This reduces the amount of space needed to cultivate plants. Following that, a combination of natural and artificial lighting is employed to ensure an ideal atmosphere for the plants‚Äô effective growth. The third component is the plant‚Äôs growth medium. Aeroponic, hydroponic, or aquaponic growth media are employed instead of soil as the growing medium.\nAs the methodology gets more scientific, the process‚Äôs efficiency grows, and as a result, vertical farming becomes more sustainable, consuming 95 percent less water than previous agricultural methods.\nAlso Read, Oxagon: The World‚Äôs First Floating City in the World\nVertical Farming Techniques\nIt is a method of producing food in water without the use of soil by employing mineral fertiliser solutions.\nThe primary benefit of this strategy is that it lowers soil-related cultivation issues such as soil-borne insects, pests, and illnesses.\nAeroponics was inspired by NASA‚Äôs (National Aeronautical and Space Administration, USA) endeavour in the 1990s to develop an effective technique to grow plants in space. There is no growth medium in aeroponics, hence there are no containers for growing crops. Instead of water, mist or nutrient solutions are utilised in aeroponics. Because the plants are attached to a support and the roots are sprayed with nutritional solution, there is very little space, very little water, and no soil required.\nThe name aquaponics is derived from the combination of two words: aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (the process of growing plants without soil in order to develop symbiotic interactions between the plants and the fish). The symbiosis is established by feeding nutrient-rich waste from fish tanks to hydroponic production beds called ‚Äúfertigate.‚Äù\nIn turn, the hydroponic beds act as biofilters, removing gases, acids, and chemicals from the water, such as ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates. Furthermore, the gravel beds serve as a home for nitrifying bacteria, which aid in nutrient cycling and water filtering. As a result, the newly cleansed water may be recirculated back into the fish tanks.\nThe Benefits of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming offers various advantages, making it promising for agriculture‚Äôs future. The land need is fairly minimal, water usage is 80% less, water is recycled and stored, pesticides are not used, and in the case of high-tech farms, there is no true reliance on the weather.\nA vertical farm makes farming possible within the constraints of a metropolis. When the farms are close by, the food is delivered swiftly and is always fresh, as opposed to the chilled stuff commonly seen in stores. Transportation reduction minimises the cost of fossil fuels and the accompanying emissions, as well as transportation spoilage. Vertical farming, like anything else, has its limitations. The biggest issue is the initial capital expenses for building the vertical farming system.\nThere are further expenditures associated with building the structures as well as their automation, such as computerised and monitoring systems, remote control systems and software, automated racking and stacking systems, programmable LED lighting systems, temperature control systems, and so on."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:88c976b5-81f0-42ff-9b24-31c5d4b3d227>","<urn:uuid:38abc93f-c15d-442d-abe3-4bcfbd141419>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the eligibility criteria differences between an IRS streamlined installment agreement and an HMRC Time to Pay arrangement?","answer":"An IRS streamlined installment agreement is easier to obtain and requires less documentation than non-streamlined agreements, allowing for monthly payments until the tax debt is paid in full. On the other hand, HMRC Time to Pay arrangements require specific criteria to be met: the business must show reasonable prospects of returning to financial stability, tax returns should have been submitted on time, and paperwork must be up to date. HMRC may refuse arrangements if tax returns are late, the debt isn't due to short-term financial difficulty, previous arrangements weren't kept, there's insufficient financial information, or if the proposal is deemed unachievable.","context":["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for enforcing tax laws in the United States. It can be stressful and overwhelming if you owe back taxes, penalties, or interest to the IRS, it can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. However, the good news is that the IRS offers tax resolution services to help individuals and businesses resolve their tax issues. This article will discuss how IRS tax resolution services can help you.\nUnderstanding IRS Tax Resolution Services\nIRS tax resolution services are designed to help taxpayers who owe back taxes or have other tax issues. These services are available to individuals, businesses, and other entities. Several types of tax resolution services are available, including installment agreements, offers in compromise, and currently not collectible status.\nAn installment agreement is a payment plan that allows you to pay off your tax debt over time. The IRS offers several installment agreements, including streamlined and non-streamlined agreements. A streamlined agreement is typically easier to obtain and requires less documentation than a non-streamlined one. With an installment agreement, you‚Äôll make monthly payments to the IRS until your tax debt is paid in full.\nOffers in Compromise\nAn offer in compromise is an agreement between you and the IRS to settle your tax debt for less than the total amount owed. To qualify for an offer in compromise, you must demonstrate to the IRS that you cannot pay your tax debt in full. When evaluating your request, the IRS will consider several factors, including income, expenses, and assets.\nCurrently Not Collectible Status\nCurrently, not collectible status is a temporary status that the IRS may grant to taxpayers who cannot pay their tax debt due to financial hardship. When you are not collectible, the IRS will not attempt to collect your tax debt. However, interest and penalties will continue to accrue on your tax debt until paid in full.\nHow Can These Services Help You?\nThere are several ways that IRS tax resolution services can help you resolve your tax issues.\nReduce Your Tax Debt\nOne of the primary benefits of IRS tax resolution services is that they can help you reduce your tax debt. This can be accomplished through offers in compromise or installment agreements. By working with the IRS to negotiate a lower tax debt amount or a payment plan, you can reduce your financial burden and get back on track.\nStop Collection Actions\nIf you owe back taxes to the IRS, they may take collection actions against you. This can include wage garnishments, bank levies, and property seizures. IRS tax resolution services can help you stop these collection actions and protect your assets.\nAvoid Penalties and Interest\nWhen you owe back taxes to the IRS, penalties and interest can quickly add up. This can make paying off your tax debt difficult and even lead to further financial hardship. IRS tax resolution services can help you avoid penalties and interest by negotiating a lower tax debt amount or a payment plan that works for you.\nNavigate Complex Tax Laws\nTax laws can be complex and confusing, especially when you owe back taxes to the IRS. IRS tax resolution services can help you navigate these laws and understand your options for resolving your tax issues. They can also help you avoid future tax issues by guiding tax planning strategies.\nProvide Legal Representation\nIf you face an IRS audit or other legal issue, IRS tax resolution services can provide legal representation. This can help ensure your rights are protected, and your tax issues are resolved fairly and equitably.\nIn conclusion, if you owe back taxes to the IRS, it can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. However, IRS tax resolution services can help you resolve your tax issues and get back on track.","Falling behind on payments to HMRC can easily occur, often a result of bad debt or unexpected expenditure having an immediate negative effect on business cash flow. In order to continue trading, essential payments such as suppliers, wages, rent and utilities are often prioritised above payments to HMRC. If not repaid quickly, this situation can easily spiral out of control and become unmanageable.\nWhat is a Time to Pay Arrangement?\nThe Time to Pay arrangement is a government initiative implemented in 2008. It was initially an attempt to combat the effects of the recession. It works by allowing struggling businesses to repay their outstanding corporation tax, PAYE/ NI or VAT liabilities in instalments, rather than in one go. Usually, Time to Pay arrangements last either 6 or 12 months. However, they may last longer if there is a realistic prospect the debt will be repaid eventually.\nWhat are the advantages of a Time to Pay Arrangement?\nHMRC liabilities will not simply disappear overnight but seeking a Time to Pay arrangement has its advantages.\n- You will be spreading out the repayment of your debt over a period of time, rather than all at once. This will improve cash flow and ensure your business has money to pay other outgoings such as rent, wages and suppliers.\n- Opting for a Time to Pay arrangement will demonstrate a willingness to repay liabilities. This helps your business remain on good terms with HMRC.\n- Proactively seeking Time to Pay will decrease the likelihood of HMRC taking enforcement action against your business.\nOur process of a Time to Pay Arrangement\n- Assess the situation\n- It is important to explore the financial situation of the business and what will be suitable for your business. If you would like some help to establish if a TTP is viable, contact us now for an initial informal chat.\n- Repayment proposal\n- We will assess your business‚Äô finances and any correspondence with HMRC and will then devise a repayment proposal to be put forward to HMRC. Included within the proposal would be details of the circumstances surrounding your cash flow difficulties.\n- Our staff have years of experience working with HMRC and utilise the strong relationships built over time. An experienced consultant will negotiate a structured repayment plan on behalf of your business. It demonstrates to HMRC that you fully intend on repaying your debt. The proposed repayment plan will outline the suggested repayment amounts and term requested.\n- Arrangement starts\n- If HMRC accepts the proposal, the Time to Pay arrangement will commence. The Time to Pay arrangement will conclude once all repayments have been made. Additionally, any interest will have been paid and tax returns submitted.\nIs a Time to Pay arrangement right for me?\nA Time to Pay arrangement is ideal for any type of business ‚Äì a sole trader, partnership or limited company. It is useful for businesses where tax arrears have accrued during a cash flow shortage. This may be as a result of a bad debt or an unexpected expenditure. As a consequence of this cash shortage, NI contributions/ VAT or PAYE arrears may have accrued with HMRC. However, if the business has reasonable prospects of returning to financial stability, HMRC will usually accept a Time to Pay proposal. It will also assist with the proposal if the submitting of tax returns have been on time and paperwork is up to date.\nWhat if HMRC refuse to accept my proposal?\nHMRC may refuse to accept a Time to Pay arrangement. Factors which could work against you could include:\n- Tax returns being late or overdue\n- The debt has not arisen due to short term financial difficulty\n- Previous arrangements not kept\n- Lack of financial information to support your request\n- Proposal considered unachievable by HMRC\nShould HMRC refuse your proposal, we will be able to discuss alternative solutions for your business. This is with the intention of turning around the business and return it to profitability.\nWhat if I‚Äôm nearing the end of a Time to Pay Arrangement and have missed some instalments?\nYour business may be approaching the end of a Time to Pay arrangement with some repayments missing. A failure to take pro-active steps is likely to result in HMRC seeking to carry out enforcement action.\nIf you have missed any of your TTP payments, it‚Äôs crucial to make contact with HMRC as soon as possible. With our help, you may be able to renegotiate an extension of the TTP. This could buy your business that extra bit of time which allows you to get your finances on the right track and maintain a strong liquidity position.\nTime to Pay Arrangements are solely for debts to HMRC. If you have debts to other creditors, or you‚Äôve previously been in a TTP which has failed, you could benefit more from other debt-relief options.\nIf you‚Äôre looking to continue trading while paying off your debt, there are several options open to you: You can apply for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which allows you to stay in control of the company and continue trading while paying off your debts. Alternatively, if your business would benefit more from restructuring, you can explore administration as a solution.\nIf the company‚Äôs debt has reached such a level that it‚Äôs not possible to continue trading, you may be better off closing the company through a Creditor‚Äôs Voluntary Liquidation (CVL), selling off the assets before creditors force the company into compulsory liquidation.\nA Time to Pay Arrangement will give your business a chance to repay any missed tax liabilities such as PAYE, VAT, NI or corporation tax. If your business is genuinely viable, an arrangement could be made which enables you to pay in monthly instalments. It‚Äôs critical not to miss any payments as it could mean the arrangement breaks down.\nHow we can help\nIf you are looking to negotiate a Time to Pay Arrangement with HMRC, or are concerned about your current arrangement, we have the experience and expertise to help you through the process. We have developed strong relationships with HMRC, to put us in a great position to negotiate. If HMRC refuses to accept to terms of the TTP, we can still give advice on alternative solutions which could help salvage your business."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3777d2a5-361b-494e-a2ca-c89b1bafe2fd>","<urn:uuid:78fb5bf6-e083-49dd-9637-964460a2493d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching manufacturing processes - what's the moisture reduction methodology et proc√©d√© de s√©chage in chocolate vodka versus raw cocoa production?","answer":"In raw cocoa production, moisture reduction follows a specific natural process: first through a 2-week fermentation period on the forest floor where cocoa beans are covered with palm fronds, followed by a 2-week sun-drying process on large racks that reduces moisture content and improves flavor. For chocolate vodka production, moisture control occurs during the standard vodka-making process where the mixture is heated into vapor, cooled, and collected as new moisture. Specifically, 360 Vodka uses six distillation cycles to ensure proper moisture levels, while Van Gogh employs a double distillation process in copper pot stills.","context":["Chocolate is one of the most recognizable flavors out there, and for good reason. It is rich and decadent, making it the perfect treat or ingredient for a host of food items.\nMeanwhile, vodka is among the top alcohol options on the market, with every third drink ordered at an American bar being vodka.\nIt would make sense then, to combine these two signature items to make chocolate-flavored vodka.\nThere are a host of vodka companies out there with flavored options, but we will be looking at two specific chocolate vodka brands available on the market.\n360 Double Chocolate Vodka or Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate Vodka\nVodka 360 first launched its Double Chocolate Vodka in 2010 having been made in Western Missouri.\nThe brand is owned by the McCormick Distilling Company in Weston Missouri. Having been founded in 1856, the distillery is considered the oldest business in the Kansas City area.\n360 Double Chocolate Vodka is eco-friendly. The distillation process used maximizes efficient energy and the bottles used are made from recycled glass. The bottles have swing-top closures and are ideal for reuse and the labels are printed on recycled paper with eco-friendly ink.\nFinally, any leftover byproducts are dried and used as feed for local farms leaving zero waste at the end of production.\nVan Gogh Vodka is a brand of vodka owned by the Distillery Cooymans International in Tilburg, Netherlands. It was first introduced in 2000 and currently has sixteen flavored vodka options available.\nThe brand continues to create new flavors that live up to the name Van Gogh and the ‚ÄúArt of Vodka‚Äù. Master Distiller, Tim Vos, has worked with the brand since 2001 to create spirits that are celebrated and enjoyed worldwide.\nHow Are They Made?\nVodka is made universally with a simple method although some brands may alter it along the way.\nInitially, the base ingredient is harvested and broken down to make it easier to blend. Water is added to the base ingredient, and it is blended to combine them. Next, yeast is added to ferment the base ingredient, converting the natural sugars to alcohol.\nNext, it is distilled which is a process that heats the mixture, turns it into vapor, cools down the vapor, and collects the new moisture. After that, the vodka-like product is filtered to remove any impurities that may affect the vodka-making process.\nSome brands will at this point choose to bottle it to age in old casks which will give them a deeper flavor and alter the color. Other brands will add flavoring to their vodka, either at the pre-bottling stage or during the distillation process.\nVodka 360 uses an energy-efficient distillation process that ensures eco-friendly vodka production. The distillation is down six times to ensure all impurities are removed and the resulting vodka is the ideal alcohol content and flavor.\nVan Gogh Vodka is distilled twice in traditional copper pot stills to produce quality vodka. Copper stills are used as copper removes the harshness of the vodka product.\nWhat Are They Made of?\n360 Double Chocolate Vodka is made from locally sourced corn, making the final beverage naturally gluten-free. The corn is sourced from farms in Missouri. The flavored vodka has small amounts of added sugar with the flavor of the vodka coming from a range of proprietary sources.\nVan Gogh vodka is made in small batches with a combination of barley, wheat, and corn as the base product. The chocolate flavoring comes from fine cocoa beans which leave light notes of coffee and caramel.\nHow Are They Similar?\nBoth Vodka 360 and Van Gogh Vodka use corn as a base ingredient for their vodka production. However, Van Gogh uses it as a base in small batches, with other small batches made using wheat and barley.\nBoth vodkas have the same alcohol content making them the same strength although Van Gogh has a higher price point than Vodka 360.\nDirect Comparison of 360 Double Chocolate Vodka and Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate Vodka\n|Item||360 Double Chocolate Vodka||Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate Vodka|\n|Production Area||Weston, Missouri, United States of America||Tilburg, Netherlands|\n|Raw Materials||Locally sourced American corn, chocolate flavoring||Corn, wheat, and barley base product.

The process takes around 6 weeks.\nCocoa beans are actually seeds found inside a cocoa pod.\nThere are perhaps two dozen cocoa beans in each pod.\nThe pods grow on cocoa trees (taxonomic name: Theobroma cacao) which are relatively small ‚Äî about the size of a typical apple tree.\nEach cocoa tree can produce anywhere from 60 to 80 pods or more, if the tree is pollinated by hand ‚Äî a meticulous process that increases yields substantially. Two crops are harvested each year in Ghana, so fertile is the soil and hospitable the climate. Cocoa, which is sometimes referred to as cacao is not to be confused with the coca tree.\nThe cocoa beans are harvested and then placed in small mounts interleaved with palm fronds right on the forest floor to begin a process of what is termed fermentation ‚Äî a two week period during which the moisture content of each cocoa bean is slowly reduced and the flavor is thereby concentrated. This fermentation process is a hallmark of Ghana cocoa production as it enhances the flavor and aroma of the cocoa. Furthermore, it is a quality benchmark required in order for the farmer to merit top prices paid by Ghana‚Äôs Cocoa Board.\nAfter the period of fermentation, the beans are spread on large racks to slowly dry in the warm African sun ‚Äî again, this is slowly reduces the moisture content of the bean and greatly improves the flavor profile of the bean. This drying process, lasting two weeks or more, causes the white film that protects the bean to slough off and the beans take on the lustrous maroon color that most people associate with cocoa beans. The fermentation and sun-drying processes are not universally used in the chocolate industry. Some chocolatiers ‚Äî in order to save money and time ‚Äî mechanically dry the raw cocoa beans, an artificial process that does nothing at all to bring out the rich and subtle flavor attributes of the cocoa bean.\nOnce the cocoa beans are finished drying, they are graded and then taken to the factory where the beans are crafted into finished chocolate.\nThe first major process that occurs at the factory is roasting cocoa. It is only after roasting that the distinctive, chocolate aroma becomes pronounced. Prior to this stage, a person with a developed sense of smell will be able to detect a slight chocolate scent but following roasting the aroma becomes nearly intoxicating ‚Äî beautiful, rich and laden with the heady, euphoric scent of pure chocolate.\nAfter roasting, the cocoa beans are kibbled or chopped into small pieces called cocoa nibs. While some people eat cocoa nibs, we are a long way from finished chocolate. Most people who visit our office and are given a chance to inhale the aroma of nibs are nearly overwhelmed by the power of the chocolate aroma ‚Äî it is almost alcoholic in intensity. Nibs have a rather bitter flavor, however; no real sweetness at this stage of the process.\nFollowing the kibbling process, the nibs undergo the grinding process whereby heat and pressure are used to express nearly every drop of liquid inside each nib. Two liquids are expressed: cocoa liquor and cocoa butter. Cocoa liquor is not alcoholic; it is so named because it flows out in liquid form. Cocoa liquor is a deep, dark brown color, extremely aromatic with a rich, bitter taste. Cocoa liquor can rightfully be thought of as the ‚Äúessence of the bean‚Äù. Cocoa liquor contains over 300 chemical compounds that give chocolate its addictive, aphrodisiac and euphoria-inducing attributes. The liquor imparts the distinctive flavor and aroma to finished chocolate.\nCocoa butter, by contrast, imparts no flavor or aroma at all to the finished chocolate. It is a fat and imparts the wonderful smoothness ‚Äî what is termed ‚Äúmouth feel‚Äù to chocolate. Cocoa butter has a very low melting point (it melts at body temperature) and is expressed as a clear liquid that floats to the top of a vessel while the dense cocoa liquor settles to the bottom much as oil and vinegar separate with a clear line of demarcation between the two ingredients. Cocoa butter is often used in the cosmetic industry due to its renowned moisturizing properties. Some chocolatiers substitute other types of fats such as vegetable fat in place of the much more expensive cocoa butter in order to save money. At Omanhene, we use only 100% cocoa butter made from Ghana beans in our chocolate.\nWhat is left when all of the liquid in the form of cocoa liquor and cocoa butter has been expressed from the cocoa nibs? The answer is cocoa cake, s chalky, dry material that is pulverized to make natural cocoa powder ‚Äî they key ingredient in Omanhene hot cocoa mix. Cocoa powder, used in beverages and in baking, is merely pulverized cocoa cake. So hardly any part of the cocoa bean is wasted in the manufacture of chocolate.\nMaking chocolate is recombining the constituent parts of the processed cocoa bean. Fine chocolate should only have four or perhaps five ingredients: cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, sugar and a miniscule amount (on the order of one-tenth of one percent) of a natural emulsifier such as soy lecithin which acts to bind the cocoa liquor and butter together ‚Äî recall how they naturally repel each other much like oil and vinegar? A fifth ingredient ‚Äî milk ‚Äî is used to make milk chocolate. We can dispel one misconception about milk chocolate: on labels of milk chocolate you‚Äôll often see a pitcher of milk being poured into a cauldron of burbling chocolate. Liquid milk is not used in commercial chocolate production due to spoilage concerns. Milk powder is used. In our case, Omanhene uses a full cream milk powder."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:78e576c9-aa4f-4575-abda-c8a236c6c77d>","<urn:uuid:a41f181c-4adb-4307-9f87-82099d586676>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can DGL extract and caraway powder be used interchangeably as digestive aids?","answer":"No, DGL extract and caraway powder cannot be used interchangeably as digestive aids. DGL extract has specific recommended dosages for treating peptic ulcers (0.4-1.6g or 300-400mg, 3 times daily 20 minutes before meals). Caraway powder, while used in cooking, is primarily a culinary ingredient that provides a more concentrated flavor than whole caraway seeds. The documents don't mention any specific digestive benefits of caraway powder, though it's mentioned that it can easily overpower dishes and is harder to find in grocery stores compared to whole caraway seeds.","context":["Next time your bread calls for caraway seeds, try one of the below caraway seed substitute options. While creating rye bread without delicious caraway seeds may seem challenging, plenty of alternatives can provide an excellent taste in their place.\nCaraway seeds are not actually seeds. Instead, they are dried fruit from the parsley/carrot family. This ‚Äúseed‚Äù is commonly used in European-inspired meat recipes, bread, sauerkraut, and cheese flavoring agent.\nThese ‚Äúseeds‚Äù are harvested from the caraway plant. Caraway seeds taste warm and spicy; many liken the flavor to anise seed because of its licorice notes. While these seeds are not as popular as other spices, they work well in plenty of dishes. Caraway seeds also pair well with dill and cumin.\nThere are two caraway plants, though they do not have separate names. The difference lies in the way each is grown. Biennial caraway plants take two seeds to create the tasty caraway seeds, while annual caraway plants produce caraway seeds each year. While the taste is similar, more sweetness is found in the annual plants.\nHowever, you‚Äôll find the biennial version in stores. This is the commonly used version in recipes, whereas the annual variety is mainly used in the kitchens of those who grow it.\nThe best caraway seed alternative is ground caraway seeds. As they are the same plant, they provide the same flavors as whole caraway seeds. Like most powder versions of spices, ground caraway has a more robust flavor than the seeds. This strong taste can make it easy to overpower dishes while using caraway powder.\nBesides potentially overpowering dishes, finding caraway powder in grocery stores is challenging. However, one can easily grind caraway seeds at home for a more concentrated flavor. You can use ground caraway seeds in the same recipes as whole caraway seeds. This ground version will not produce the same aesthetic appeal as whole seeds in recipes like bread.\nCaraway powder provides a similar yet more robust flavor making it an excellent choice for all recipes that call for whole caraway seeds. It‚Äôs an excellent alternative for those seeking a more pungent caraway taste in recipes.\nUsing ground caraway can take away from the other milder flavors present in recipes. Plus, it is not easy to find in grocery stores, so home cooks will likely need to grind caraway seeds, adding a step to the recipe.\nUse ¬Ω the amount required by the recipe and adjust to your taste preference.\nFennel seeds are an excellent substitute for caraway seeds. These seeds are in the same carrot family, providing a similar taste in recipes. They are more versatile than caraway, as you can also use fennel seeds in sweet dishes and desserts.\nLike caraway, fennel seeds provide a licorice flavor. This swap also provides intense aromatics in recipes and is part of the Chinese five-spice blend. While you can use fennel seeds whole to mimic caraway seeds in recipes, they are also delicious ground into a powder or toasted in the oven before use.\nThis substitution is easy to find in grocery stores and tastes like caraway. Plus, it‚Äôs more versatile, and you can use them in sweet and savory recipes.\nThe fennel flavor is not an exact match for caraway; there will be a taste difference that will be more pronounced in some recipes.\nUse a 1:1 ratio to replace caraway with fennel seeds.\nLike whole fennel seeds, ground fennel seeds are also an excellent sub for caraway seeds. They also provide a similar licorice taste in recipes. Ground fennel seeds are an excellent replacement for ground caraway and are much easier to find in stores.\nYou can use ground fennel seeds in anything that calls for caraway. Remember that the powder version is more potent, so you need less in recipes. Like caraway powder, using ground fennel alters the appearance of recipes. If you‚Äôre creating bread and want the aesthetic that whole seeds offer, opt for whole fennel seeds instead.\nGround fennel is easy to find in grocery stores and is more affordable than ground caraway. It offers a similar taste as caraway to recipes.\nFennel is known for its sweetness, which can be overwhelming in recipes if too much ground fennel is used.\nUse ¬Ω the amount required by the recipe; add more if needed.\nAnise seeds are the next best option after fennel when searching for the best substitution for a caraway seed. The taste of caraway is often compared to anise because of the licorice taste that both offer.\nWhile caraway has a more complex flavor, anise seeds maintain a licorice flavor and sweetness for a more straightforward tasting seasoning. Like caraway, anise is aromatic, though it emotes the scent of licorice, which can be a turn-off to some.\nAnise seeds are an excellent swap if you‚Äôre looking to replace only the licorice taste in recipes. Use these seeds in sausages for flavoring and add a pop of flavor to roasted vegetables.\nAnise seeds have a strong aroma and a licorice flavor, and you can use them in sausages and as a seasoning for vegetables.\nSince the taste of anise seeds provides mainly a strong licorice taste, it limits the number of recipes. As mentioned above, this taste is not for everyone, so it‚Äôs best to consider who will be consuming the meal before reaching for this swap.\nUse ¬Ω the required amount when swapping anise for caraway.\nDill seeds are in the same family as caraway seeds, making them an excellent option as a caraway replacement. They offer a licorice flavor to recipes and have a similar taste to caraway, including a slight bitterness.\nThese seeds are best fresh, as they offer a closer taste to caraway. However, you can use them dried instead and still achieve a similar flavor. You‚Äôre more likely to find these seeds dried at the store as they have a longer shelf life.\nUse dill seeds for any recipe that calls for caraway seeds, though keep in mind the flavor is milder, so you may need to add more. Dill is an excellent swap in bread, sausage, and European-inspired recipes.\nThis replacement has a flavor that mimics caraway seeds well. It‚Äôs easy to swap as you will use the same quantity of dishes. You can use dill seeds to replace caraway seeds in all recipes.\nDue to a milder taste, you may need to add a higher quantity of dill seeds to recipes. It may take some experimentation to find the exact amount needed, adding time to the recipe.\nUse a 1:1 ratio to replace caraway with dill seeds. Add more for a bolder licorice flavor.\nCumin seeds are also related to caraway seeds. These seeds provide an earthy, nutty, spicy flavor to dishes. It‚Äôs more common to see ground cumin available in stores, though you should also be able to find cumin seeds. This ingredient is more common in Middle Eastern and Asian recipes due to its aromatics and taste. These seeds also offer a similar appearance to caraway seeds, making them an excellent choice in bread for a unique flavor.\nYou can also use cumin seeds in curry, soups, and flavor vegetables. Keep the seeds as-is, or toast them for a more complex taste before including them in dishes.\nThis replacement is another excellent option to replace caraway seeds due to their similar flavor and appearance. It‚Äôs easy to find at grocery stores and provides a complex flavor.\nCumin seeds have a slightly different flavor, limiting the number of recipes.\nUse a 1:1 ratio to replace caraway seeds with cumin seeds.\nStar anise has a licorice taste accompanied by sweetness. Beyond these flavor offerings, it provides a similar earthy, slightly bitter taste. It has a strong scent in cooking, like caraway seeds. Even though this spice is different from anise seeds, you can use it for the same applications.\nYou‚Äôll need to grind it up to use this ingredient as the star-shaped spice is challenging to chew as-is. If you‚Äôre considering using star anise to flavor soups or marinades, you can leave it in whole and remove it before consuming.\nThis swap offers a licorice taste to dishes, along with an earthy, bitter flavor. You can use anise for both sweet and savory dishes, allowing it to have more versatility than anise seeds.\nThe flavor of star anise is much stronger and sweeter than caraway seeds; this spice can easily overpower other flavors in recipes and may not bode well with certain other seasonings. Test a smaller quantity first, then adjust as needed to avoid an unpleasant taste.\nUse ¬Ω the amount required by the recipe when using star anise as a swap.\nNigella seeds are a less commonly used seasoning, though they work well as a replacement for caraway seeds. They offer a complex flavor between an onion, oregano, and cumin with a slight licorice taste. This delicious seasoning is best in savory recipes.\nThis swap is known by multiple names, including black caraway and black onion seeds. When hunting these small seeds down in the grocery store, look for tiny, black seeds similar in appearance and size to black sesame seeds.\nAs the size of nigella seeds is similar to caraway seeds, you can use them in recipes to create a similar appearance.\nThis replacement provides a delicious, complex flavor to recipes and mimics the licorice taste of caraway seeds. Use nigella seeds for stews and bread.\nFinding these seeds at local grocery stores may be challenging, so you may need to order them online in advance. While they share some flavor similarities, nigella seeds offer many flavors notes not present in caraway seeds, creating a different taste in dishes.\nUse a 1:1 ratio to replace caraway seeds with nigella seeds.\nMany wonder what the difference is between fennel vs. caraway. While they both belong to the same plant family, they offer different flavor notes. Fennel has a sweeter taste than caraway; it also lacks the earthy, nutty flavor. Caraway is excellent for use in savory dishes, while fennel works well in sweet and savory recipes. Despite their differences, they typically are suitable substitutes for each other.\nTechnically, you can omit caraway seeds. However, they offer a strong taste, and skipping them will leave your recipes lacking flavor. Instead, opt for an alternative that creates a similar flavor to fennel seeds.\nYes, you can use ground cumin as a ground caraway substitute. Both spices are in the same parsley family and even look similar. Cumin has a bolder flavor than caraway, so you need to use ¬Ω the amount in recipes.\nInstead of reaching for caraway seeds, try using fennel seeds as an alternative. These seeds are aromatic and produce a warm, licorice-like flavor similar to caraway seeds. They most closely mimic the taste of caraway, making them the top choice for this food.\nCaraway seeds offer a strong flavor and aroma. They offer a licorice flavor in combination with earthiness and nuttiness. Besides the mentioned flavor notes, they also provide a spicy, peppery taste and a subtle mint flavor.\nCaraway seeds provide a unique, complex flavor that livens up dishes. If you‚Äôve run out while baking bread or making sauerkraut, use any of the above options as a replacement. For the most similar flavor profile, use fennel seeds, anise seeds, or ground caraway seeds if they‚Äôre available.\nFor those looking for a milder flavor, use dill seeds. This swap is the best option for chefs who don‚Äôt enjoy caraway‚Äôs strong licorice taste. Next time you create a recipe that includes caraway, use the above list for easy alternative options.","By: Nikki Nies\nLicorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) is a plant, most commonly associated with flavorings in food, beverages and tobacco.

These changes can antagonize the action of diuretics and antihypertensive medications. Some herbs have a stimulant laxative effect (i.e. aloe vera, castor oil, senna and rhubarb) should be avoided to lower potassium in body.\nFurthermore, use of certain medications can negatively interact with licorice.\n|Medication||Use||Potential interaction with licorice|\n|Warfarin (Coumadin)||Slow blood clotting||Licorice may increase breakdown; decrease effectiveness of warfarin, which may increase the risk of clotting|\n|Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ)||Treat cancer||Licorice may decrease how well cisplatin works|\n|Digoxin (Lanoxin)||Treats atrial fibrillation and heart failure||Large amounts of licorice can decrease potassium levels, which can inhibit digoxin‚Äôs effectiveness|\n|Ethacyrnic Acid (Edecrin); Furosemide (Lasix)||Treats edema; diuretic||When etharynic and licorice are taken together, may cause potassium to become too low|\n|Furosemide (Lasix)||Treats edema||When furosemide and licorice are taken together, may cause potassium to become too low|\n|Medications associated with the liver (i.e. cytochrome P450 2C9, cytochrome P450 3A4, CYP3A4, phenobarbital, dexamethasone)||Liver issues||Licorice may change how the liver breaks down medications, may increase/decrease effects of medications|\n|Antihypertensive drugs (i.e. captopril, enalapril, losartan, valsartan, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix)||Treats high blood pressure||Might decrease effectiveness of medications for high blood pressure|\n|Corticosteroids (i.e. hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisone, prednisone)||For inflammation||Some medications for inflammation can decrease potassium in the body; when corticosteroids are taken in conjunction with licorice, can decrease potassium in the body too much|\n|Diuretics (i.e. Lasix, Diuril, Thalitone, HCTZ, Microzide)||Water pills||In conjunction with licorice, diuretics can decrease potassium in body too much|\nLastly, when taking licorice, drinking grapefruit juice may increase licorice‚Äôs ability to cause potassium depletion.

{"question":"As an avid angler exploring Norwegian fjords, I'm curious - how do the depth ranges of sea trout and blackmouth catsharks compare in these waters? üé£","answer":"While sea trout can be caught in shallow coastal brackish waters along Norwegian fjords, blackmouth catsharks are typically found much deeper, between 200-500m. However, in certain Norwegian fjords like Namsen Fjord and Trondheim Fjord, blackmouth catsharks can be encountered unusually shallow at 25-40m due to surface run-off creating silty water that reduces light penetration.","context":["Salmo trutta trutta (nor.: sj√∏√∏rret; swe.: havs√∂ring; fin.: meritaimen; dt.: Meerforelle)\nSea trout is actually a freash water fish and basically a form of brown trout that converted to an anadromous lifestyle (migrates on a regular basis between river and sea).\nIt is not an easy catch BUT since you can catch it from all coastal shores it is free and you do not need a license ‚Äì great news! Be aware though that there is also a minimum size ( usually around 35cm) required in order to keep your catch. Otherwise you have to carefully release it. Sea trout have a very similar look to salmon and grow much bigger than their river dwelling counterparts. On a quick glance you might even mistake them for a salmon but there are some distinct features that can tell you the difference (straight tale fin, position of the eyes). However they are actually ordinary trouts that have adapted their feeding habits. They can be caught all year round but usually spring and early autumn are the best times.\nFishing and Fishing Methods\nBrakish coastal water with low salt content is usually the place to be. Sea trouts up to 4 kg are considered a normal catch in certain parts and they can grow even bigger. They are a great game for spin fishing, fly fishing and trolling alike but a spinning rod is the most common way to catch them from shore. Sea trouts are well known torpedoing out of the water catching insects. For more experienced anglers this can be a great opportunity unwrapping their fly rod.\nDepending on the waters and your gear a 10g ‚Äì 30g range of lures along with a rod, reel and line should be sufficient to get you started. There is sheer infinite number of lures to choose from and we had great success with Toby, Zigge from Abu Garcia. However, it might be wise to switch through your stack until you find something that works best for you.\nThey have a similar red meat like salmons and are a very delicious fish, not too far of from salmon. All the Fjord areas of Norway are suitable to go after sea trout but the most promising areas are those close to the rivers. Be aware though that there are regulations of how close to a river you can fish. Usually the estuary is off limits. If you are in the far north, a great (inside) spot for tackling this fish is the coast area in Kunes (70.350202, 26.506585). Stay away from the river mouth of the Austa river (Austaelva) though since this is a popular salmon river. We had some great results close to the boat houses and trouts up to 4kg are common.\n- Finland: 13,1 kg\n- Sweden: 15,2 kg\n- Norway: ~13 kg (inofficial)\nSometimes it can be difficult to distinguish sea trouts from salmon. In addition to a smaller, sharper head and a thinner tail stem, the notch in the salmon tail is usually much deeper than that of a sea trout. Similarly, in salmon, the upper jaw extends approximately to the edge of the eye, while in sea trouts it goes well behind it. On salmon flanks, dark spotting rarely extends below the rib line, whereas in sea trout, this spotting is common all over the body. In addition, salmon has clearly fewer teeth than sea trout.","Slender body. Snout pointed. First dorsal origin approximately level with pelvic fin insertion. First and second dorsal fins of equal size, with a pointed apexes. Pectoral fins large. Anal fin very long; extending from level of first dorsal insertion to origin of caudal fin. Caudal fin has a distinct row of enlarged dermal denticles along upper margin. Dorsal coloration predominantly brown with a vivid pattern of large and small brown circles, edged in white. Circles form rows extending from head to tip of tail. Larger animals have more intricate patterns with a greater amount of circles within each row. Fins dark blueish-grey with vague pale circles and pale margins.\nGaleus melastomus is one of the largest sawtail catsharks. Maximum length 90cm (Compagno et al. 2005). This record is questionable since other researchers list vastly smaller maximum sizes of 62-67cm (Rey et al. 2002, Costa et al. 2005). Size at birth unknown.\nRocky, sandy or muddy substrates on outer continental shelf. Usually remains on bottom or close to it. Mostly found between 200-500m. Listed as occurring between 55-1000m, but regularly encountered in certain Norwegian fiords between 25-40m even when no chum is used.\nThe blackmouth Catsharks is present in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. From the Faroe Islands and Southern Norway southward to the Azores and Senegal.\nThis species is taken as bycatch by demersal trawls and longlines throughout large areas of its geographic range. It is generally discarded, but is retained and utilised in some areas.\nAlthough a large portion of the population of G. melastomus avoided most of the commercial fishing pressure associated with the 1970s deepwater trawl fishery for Blue Ling (Molva dypterygia) in the northeast Atlantic at >600 m, it is concerning to note that mature individuals of this species are found at similar depths to the shallowest depth range of this fishery, and that commercial deepwater trawl vessels are now targeting these sharks. The targeting of mature individuals of this species may lead to similar detrimental impacts experienced by other deepwater species in this area (Crozier 2003).\nOff the south coast of Portugal (Algarve), this species is captured in high quantities as bycatch of the bottom trawl fishery that targets the Norway Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), Red Shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) and Deepwater Pink Shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), and by the near bottom longline fishery that targets European Hake (Merluccius merluccius), Conger Eels (Conger conger) and Wreck Fish (Polyprion americanus). In both fisheries, most captured specimens are discarded (Coelho et al. 2005). Most specimens are captured and returned to the sea alive, but usually with severe injuries (due to the long trawling periods or hooks) that are likely to impair their survival. However, declines in traditional target species during the last few years mean it is likely that fisherman are now landing larger quantities of ‚Äúalternative‚Äù species, such as this catshark, so it may be increasingly retained and sold.\nThe species is caught as bycatch by trawl nets and bottom longlines on slope bottoms. The species appears to suffer greater fishing mortality in the Ionian, south Adriatic and Aegean Seas, compared to along the coasts of Morocco, Spain, France and around Crete. Length Frequency Distributions (LFD) show that along the coasts of Morocco, Spain, France and around Crete specimens were mostly larger than 30 cm (78% of the total), while only 23% of the specimens around the coasts of Corsica, Sicily and in the Ionian, South Adriatic and Aegean Seas were over 30 cm (Serena et al. 2005).\nIt seems that this species suffers relatively moderate effects from fishing pressure in the south Ligurian and northern Tyrrhenian sea, although it is an important bycatch of the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishery.\nG. melastomus constitutes a significant portion of the bycatch of the Viareggio fleet‚Äôs fishing efforts, but most of the individuals are discarded due to the limited market demand and low commercial value. Only a fraction of the larger individuals (TL>40 cm) are landed at Viareggio (about 700 kg in 2002) (Abella and Serena 2005). Considering the depths at which G. melastomus is caught (250‚Äì800 m) and the observed poor condition of the individuals immediately after their capture, it is likely that only a small fraction of the discarded individuals survive. However, it should be noted that the fishing grounds for the Viareggio fleet coincide only partially with the areas where G. melastomus is known to be abundant, and that higher densities of this species are found in deep waters off northern Corsica, where the fishing pressure is moderate. These areas could therefore act as a refuge for this species (Abella and Serena 2005).\nIn the Alboran Sea, where this species is very abundant, G. melastomus is the most important bycatch species in the recently developed bottom trawl fishery targeting the Deepwater Shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) (Torres et al. 2001).\nThe recently developed ban on bottom trawling below depths of 1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea probably offers this species some refuge from fishing pressure.\nCitations and References\nSerena, F., Mancusi, C., Ungaro, N., Hareide, N.R., Guallart, J.,Coelho, R. & Crozier, P. 2009.

{"question":"Do the International Council of Nurses and the Red Cross Movement use the same symbolic color in their emblems?","answer":"No, they use different colors. The International Council of Nurses uses a white heart as their unifying symbol, with white being chosen because it brings together all colors and demonstrates nursing's acceptance of all races, religions and communities. In contrast, the Red Cross Movement uses a red cross as their symbol, which represents neutrality and protection under the Geneva Conventions.","context":["‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be well soon. But you need to take this medicine.‚Äù\nCan you relate these words to that gentle angelic face smiling at and comforting you?\nYes, you‚Äôre right. When we are sick and hospitalised or even at home, there‚Äôs this kind person looking after us day and night- whom we call ‚Äònurse‚Äô. They work selflessly to make the world a better place.\nNurses are licensed healthcare professionals who practise independently or are supervised by a physician, surgeon, or dentist and care for the sick. They play a vital role in looking after those injured or affected during any pandemic, war or any kind of affliction.\nDo you know the etymology of the word nurse?\nIn brief, the term nurse originates from the Latin word nurture ‚Äònourish‚Äô, which means to suckle. It‚Äôs because in bygone days, this was referred to the wet-nurses who cared for other‚Äôs children. It evolved in the late 16th century into a person who cares for the sick.\nSome people describe the word as Noble-Understanding-Responsibility-Sympathy-Efficient= NURSE. This description covers all the aspects of promoting health, preventing disease, and providing care to the ill, afflicted, and dying.\nInternational Nurses Day was established in 1974 by the International Council of Nurses (ICN) to be celebrated on May 12 each year. The day has been selected to mark the birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale, who is widely considered the founder of modern nursing.\nFlorence Nightingale became well-known during the Crimean War. She trained nurses and also tended to wounded soldiers. She became known as ‚ÄòThe Lady with the Lamp‚Äô as she used to look after the wounded soldiers at night with a lamp. In 1860, Nightingale established a nursing school at St Thomas‚Äô Hospital in London. The Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses and the highest international distinction for a nurse, ‚ÄòFlorence Nightingale Medal,‚Äô was named after her in recognition of her pioneering work in nursing.\nThe day is celebrated to highlight and honour the invaluable contributions of nurses in health care and global health security. On this day, promotional and educational materials raising issues and challenges faced by the nursing profession are produced and distributed. Many countries celebrate National Nurses Week, where International Nurses Day is a part of the weeklong celebration.\nThough white uniforms have been associated with nursing for a long time, this uniform has evolved over time.\nThe first professional nurses were nuns. They wore traditional blue or grey dresses. The original uniform colours changed from blues and greys to white in the 1900s to signify cleanliness, purity, innocence, honesty, faith, goodness, and empowerment. However, eye fatigue in the operating room led to the use of green uniforms. Gradually, other colourful uniforms have become accepted.\nA white uniform enhances the nurse‚Äôs image and gives them a professional appearance, and commands great respect.\nSome symbols are found on pins, jewellery and scrubs on display and have great significance in the healthcare industry.\nSome of the popular nurse symbols are:\n1. The Caduceus is one of the most used symbols featuring a staff wrapped by two snakes and a pair of wings. This is one of the oldest symbols dating back to Ancient Greece. The depiction had different connotations of different gods.\nIn 1902, the Caduceus was used as the medical symbol in the US Army Medical Corps. Since then, it has been used by many health organisations.\n2. The Staff of Asclepius closely resembles the Caduceus, but the picture has one snake wrapped around the staff. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the Staff of Asclepius without the wings.\nCaduceus is used in 76 percent of healthcare organisations, whereas the Staff of Asclepius is used in 62 percent.\nThough the snake symbolises destruction in many places, the snake symbol on the staff signifies healing. The reason? Well, the answer lies deep down in history when around 1400 BC, Moses used a bronze serpent erected on a pole to cure the people who were bitten by a snake. Another reason is that a serpent sheds its skin, which indicates longevity and immortality. Many experiments on snakes have also proved that they can cure many diseases.\n3. The oil lamp is a lesser-known symbol in the medical field. It‚Äôs used to remember Florence Nightingale, known as ‚ÄòThe Lady with the Lamp‚Äô.\nThe light of the lamp symbolises the light that a nurse becomes to her patients: a symbol of hope and comfort to those who are suffering. It also represents nurses‚Äô dedication, selfless work, compassion, reliability, goodwill, and everything relating to nursing. The lamp is also used as the logo for International Council for Nurses.\n4. Globally, the white heart is a unifying symbol for nurses. White was selected because it brings together all colours, demonstrating nursing‚Äôs acceptance of people of all races, religions and communities.\n5. The red cross of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement represents neutrality and protection under the Geneva Conventions and is still used by nurses in times of armed conflict.\nEach year there‚Äôs a new theme for International Nurses Day. The theme for 2023 is ‚ÄòOur Nurses. Our Future‚Äô.\nICN President Dr Pamela Cipriano explained the theme as what ICN wants for nursing in the future to address the global health challenges and improve global health for all campaigns. It will help the policymakers, the public, and all those who make decisions affecting the delivery and financing of health care to focus on the importance of the invaluable contributions of nurses in the future and to extend support to them. She also highlighted the need to learn from the pandemic‚Äôs lessons and translate these into actions for the future to ensure that nurses are protected, respected and valued. This year‚Äôs campaign will also highlight how global health systems must be strengthened to address growing health demands.\nShe also mentioned that it would capture key actions that ICN believes are essential to address both the profession and health systems and which are, of course, mutually beneficial.\nWHO has estimated that an additional 9 million nurses and midwives are needed if the world is to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. UHC will ensure access to preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health services of quality to everyone, whenever and wherever they need them, without any financial hardships. The stark realisation of the unequal distribution of healthcare during COVID-19 has made it mandatory to focus on this.\nThough actions have been taken to strengthen the nursing profession and some progress has been made, most countries still need more qualified and competent nurses to effectively address increasing health challenges.\nCountries need to prioritise investing fully in strengthening and diversifying the nursing workforce based on measurable, transparent and realistic actions; It will help build a highly qualified and resilient nursing workforce that will be able to respond to the changing technologies and advancing models of integrated health and social care; and needs of the population and communities it serves to ensure safe health for all.\nReinforcing nurse leadership is also essential to aid nurses in having an influential role in health policy formulation and decision-making to contribute effectively to health and social care systems.\nThe nursing profession is highly respected and honoured worldwide. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt the case in many countries, including Bangladesh. Though the government has given the nursing profession second-class status and some first-class posts have also been created, it‚Äôs still quite a neglected profession in Bangladesh.\nThe selfless work and skill the nurses provide in taking care of the patients deserve praise, support, and recognition.\nTheir presence itself works wonders in healing during a patient‚Äôs sickness.\nLet‚Äôs salute all those compassionate angels who contribute to making our lives worth living.\n[Tasneem Hossain is a multilingual poet, columnist, op-ed and fiction writer, translator and training consultant.

It is additionally a delicate nod to all the volunteers who have made unparalleled contributions to individuals in duress or need. By chance, the day is likewise the birthday of Swiss businessman Henry Dunant, who had created the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863 in Switzerland, Geneva. He was born on May 8, 1828, and was likewise the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.\nHenri Dunant began this movement in the wake of seeing the horrors on the battlefield during the Battle of Solferino in 1859 in Italy between the Austrian army and the Franco-Sardinian alliance. The Red Cross Flag, which seems as though an inverted Swiss Flag, was designed by Henri Dunant to honor his country.\nThe day is celebrated every year to honor the principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Post World War I, Red Cross was acquainted all together with a call for peace as part of the international commission of the 14th International Conference of the Red Cross.\nThe day is praised annually to diminish the suffering of individuals and empowering them to lead a dignified life. It is recommended by Red Cross Organizations over the world by helping individuals with independence, humanity, impartiality, universality, unity, and neutrality ‚Äì the major principles of the association.\nFacts about World Red Cross Day\n- The Red Cross was officially settled in the year 1863 when Jean Henri Dunant, alongside Gustave Moynier, Louis Appia, Theodore Maunoir, and Guillaume-Henri Dufour, set up the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, which later became the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n- The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was established in 1919 in Paris in the aftermath of World War I.\n- Red Cross incorporates the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which has societies in 186 member nations.\n- There are presently 189 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the globe with over 97 million staff and volunteers.\n- While the Red Cross, the reverse of the Swiss flag was perceived as the association‚Äôs symbol in many nations, the Red Cresent was widely perceived as the symbol in Islamic nations. To neutralize this, the Red Crystal was declared as a neutral and extra symbol in 2005.\n- Red Cross is an active participant in a wide number of programs and services, including crisis reaction, disaster preparedness, community-based health and care, first aid training and activities, reestablishing family contact for disaster victims, and youth and volunteer activities.\n- The Red Cross has won the Nobel Peace Prize three times ‚Äì in the year 1917, 1944, and 1963, while Henry Durant got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.\n- The main aim of the Red Cross Society is essential to inspire, start, and encourage a wide range of humanitarian activities under all times and conditions.\n- Programs directed by the Red Cross Society can be extensively classified into four sections including the promotion of humanitarian standards and values; disaster response; disaster preparedness; and health and care.\n- The Red Cross Society depends on 7 principles in particular; humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary, unity, and universality.\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on microblogging webpage Twitter stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already World Red Cross Red Crescent Day in some countries around the (globe)!!

{"question":"Could you compare the success rates of traditional police investigations versus encryption backdoors in solving criminal cases? Based on available data, how effective would encryption backdoors be for law enforcement compared to existing investigative methods?","answer":"Research shows that encryption backdoors would not significantly improve law enforcement's ability to solve cases. Out of 50 criminal cases studied involving encryption, 25 were solved without breaking the encryption at all. In only 3 out of 50 cases did police neither solve the crime nor crack the encrypted files. When law enforcement did access encrypted data, it was primarily through circumvention (like finding written passwords) rather than breaking the encryption itself. Additionally, even without backdoors, law enforcement has multiple other options - they can obtain emails/texts from service providers, access cloud backups through legal process, and potentially compel suspects to decrypt information with a search warrant. Meanwhile, implementing backdoors would severely undermine cybersecurity for all users, leaving them exposed to malicious hacking and crime, while also harming US businesses by reducing consumer trust and imposing technical burdens.","context":["SAN FRANCISCO‚ÄîWhile Apple faces down the FBI in court and law enforcement calls for backdoors to encryption services, a researcher at the RSA Conference here asked an important question: Would backdoors actually help?\nCrypto expert Klaus Schmeh, currently a consultant at Cryptovision used his knowledge of cryptography and some lengthy Googling to see if backdoors could have made a difference in criminals cases. His answer: probably not.\nThe CasesAfter 20 days of combing through news websites, Schmeh found a corpus of 50 criminal cases that involved encryption in some way. Of these, the majority (16 cases) were about child pornography.\nAnother seven cases were murders, six were terrorism-related, and five involved espionage.\nThe other 16 cases fell into various other categories.\nIn 33 of the 50 cases, the police were not able to break or bypass the encryption.\nIn fact, they were only successful in 11 cases, with several unaccounted.\nIn all the cases, the encrypted files were obtained by confiscating a device of some kind.\nThis surprised Schmeh, who expected to find at least a few cases of wiretapping or data interception. However, it might simply be that in those cases, law enforcement did not wish to discuss the use of such controversial tactics. ‚ÄúIn most cases the police lost, and this is certainly one of the reasons why [FBI Director] Comey wants to have backdoors in encryption products,‚Äù said Schmeh.\nAn interesting point is that in two of the 50 cases Schmeh profiled, it was the victim of the crime and not the suspect or perpetrator who held encrypted information.\nDo Backdoors Work?In all the cases Schmeh looked at, 25 were solved without the police breaking the encryption.\nIn only three out of the 50 cases did police neither solve the crime nor crack the encrypted files.\nThis, said Schmeh, revealed that backdoors are not a ‚Äúmagic bullet‚Äù for investigations.\n‚ÄúIt would have been crucial, but would not have been a guarantee,‚Äù said Schmeh.\nIn the cases where law enforcement was able to decrypt the files, it was primarily by circumventing the encryption.\nIn the case of Anna Chapman, the Russian spy captured in the U.S., investigators found a piece of paper where Chapman had written her passwords.\nIn another case, an FBI agent downloaded the contents of an encrypted Personal Digital Assistant that the suspect had left unlocked.\nSchmeh also mentioned one case, where it seemed like Canadian law enforcement successfully brute-forced a password with random guesses, but it took 2.5 years to complete.\nCall for HelpSchmeh proposed one alternative to adding a backdoor to encryption system, or forcing companies to create specialized tools to break open secured devices. He suggested the police could publish the ciphertext‚Äîthat is, the encrypted text‚Äîand ask the public for assistance in breaking it.\nEncryption systems that use a password-derived key (and not a public key), Schmeh explained, frequently have an encrypted keycheck string before the ciphertext.\nThat keycheck string can be separated from the ciphertext and subjected to a brute-force attack that will eventually yield the correct key and, in turn, the password to decrypt the rest of the ciphertext.\nThis approach, said Schmeh, would allow law enforcement to crowdsource a solution while still keeping the ciphertext secret.\nInterestingly, Schmeh had several historical examples of law enforcement having published ciphertext in an effort to help an investigation. While many of these were fascinating (and mysterious!) they were all examples of classical or manual encryption.\nBasically codes written out by hand, and not the complex algorithm-driven encryption used in digital devices today.\nDon‚Äôt Open the DoorIt‚Äôs important to note the distinction between backdoors in encryption and what Apple is currently fighting in the courts.\nApple‚Äôs complaint hinges on being asked to create a special version of iOS that would allow the FBI to unlock the phone themselves.\nA backdooor for encryption, on the other hand, would create some kind of mechanism for law enforcement to decrypt files without the key.\nThe research Schmeh presented focused on encrypted drives and files, and scenarios where police would want backdoors, not the kind of tool the FBI wants from Apple.\nThat‚Äôs not to say that there aren‚Äôt those in Washington calling for the creation of backdoors.\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch said during her speech at RSA that encryption could thwart law enforcement. Using the phrase often used when attacking encryption, she said that ‚Äúgoing dark is a very real issue.‚Äù On the opposite side, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at RSA that he did not support backdoors and that he support strong encryption.\nSchmeh was humble in his presentation, taking pains to point out the limitations of his research. He was, for example, limited to reports in the public press and in languages he could read.\nThere were also several cases where the press had insufficient details.\nBut still, he concluded that backdoors were too much of a risk to employ.\n‚ÄúThere will be some cases where police might profit from backdoors, but there aren‚Äôt too many of them in my collection.\nThey might be helpful in some cases, but the price we pay for them is too high,‚Äù concluded Schmeh.","Encrypting smartphones and other devices helps protect against malicious hacking, identity theft, phone theft, and other crimes. However, a government mandate requiring companies to build a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù into encryption for surveillance would put consumers at grave risk and impose heavy costs on US businesses. The government can obtain information for investigations from other sources, and may be able to compel an individual to decrypt information with a search warrant.\nWhat companies have done recently: Apple and Google recently announced that their smartphones will be ‚Äúencrypted by default.‚Äù All the data stored on the phone itself will be unreadable to anyone who accesses the phone without knowing the device passcode, in order to unlock the encryption. Weak encryption (or obvious passwords) can be broken, but Apple and Google will apply strong encryption to their devices. Many other companies and nonprofits have long offered products and services secured by strong encryption to the public.\n- The primary impact: Mobile devices increasingly mediate the most sensitive of our online transactions, from health to finance to authenticating to secure systems. Encrypting mobile devices by default will increase security from cybercriminals for regular smartphone users. Encryption by default ensures that if criminals steal or attempt to hack into a phone, they will be unable to access the owner‚Äôs sensitive data on the device, such as credit card information, photos, emails, medical records, social media accounts, and authentication credentials. The principle objective of securing smartphones with strong encryption is to protect against cybersecurity threats faced by millions of American smartphone users ‚Äì identity theft, phone theft, and cybercrime.\nWhat the FBI wants: The FBI wants a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù into encrypted products ‚Äì not just phones, but other communications services as well. FBI Director Comey has called for companies to build security flaws into their encrypted products so that the government can break through and wiretap consumers or seize data stored on their devices. In the case of the San Bernardino shooting, the FBI has sought to force Apple, Inc. to produce an insecure version of its mobile operating system, which would vastly increase the security and privacy risks to hundreds of millions mobile devices.\n- A backdoor for government surveillance: Director Comey has stated the FBI is not seeking a backdoor because he is proposing that companies intentionally build into their products a means of breaking encryption for the purpose of government access. However, this conflates a legal backdoor with a technical one: as a technical matter, creating a path through encryption to provide access that the user does not authorize is, by definition, a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù security vulnerability. It is impossible to build encryption that can be circumvented without creating a technical backdoor.\nBackdoors create major problems: Backdoors severely weaken cybersecurity, leaving users exposed to malicious hacking and crime. A government-mandated security vulnerability in tech products would also be a huge burden on businesses and an obstacle to innovation.\n- User security undermined: A fundamental problem with a backdoor is that there is no way to control who goes through it. If the US government can exploit a backdoor security vulnerability to access a consumer‚Äôs device, so will malicious hackers, identity thieves, and foreign governments. This will devastate the security of not just individual consumers around the world, but also the many businesses that use American commercial tech products day-to-day. Ultimately, this mandate would have the effect of actually enabling cybercrime and undermining national security.\n- US businesses harmed: Consumers outside of the US may be much less inclined to purchase American tech products that facilitate government surveillance. Consider, for example, the difficulty US companies would have selling smartphones or network servers in the EU that are built to enable easy access for the NSA. As a technical matter, it is difficult and expensive to both build a backdoor security vulnerability and then defend that vulnerability against unauthorized use. This burden would be heaviest on small businesses and innovators of new communications services, which may be create a disincentive to encrypt their products and services, which would reduce the overall security of users.\nGovernment is not ‚Äúgoing dark‚Äù: There is no doubt that some communications are more difficult to intercept than others, and that the FBI has a legitimate concern that criminals and terrorists will gravitate to communications technologies that are more difficult to surveil. However, taken as a whole, the digital revolution has made more data about us available than ever before, and the government has more tools to obtain and analyze that data than ever before. The volume of government surveillance increases almost every year. The claim that companies‚Äô increasing adoption of strong encryption by default will suddenly lead to government ‚Äúgoing dark‚Äù and unable to access critical information is not accurate.\n- Encryption is not new: Products and software with strong encryption have been freely available to the public ‚Äì including criminals ‚Äì for many years, and have not rendered law enforcement helpless to investigate crimes. By recently choosing to encrypt popular smartphones by default, companies are making this security feature easier to use and more accessible to regular smartphone users who do not seek out increased security protection. This change will reduce overall crime by protecting all smartphone users, rather than just those who are already security-conscious.\n- Government has multiple options: If information is encrypted in one place, it is often available from another source. For example, emails or text messages on an encrypted phone can be retrieved from the email service provider or the phone company. Many smartphones are backed up to the cloud, where the data can be obtained from the service provider through legal process. In addition, law enforcement may be able to compel a suspect to decrypt information or devices with a search warrant.\nCompelled decryption: The Department of Justice takes the stance that the government can compel the owner of encrypted devices or account, such as a phone or an email account, to decrypt the information it seeks. The government has successfully argued in a number of cases that a warrant permits it to compel decryption. Whether compelled decryption is permissible or is barred by the Fifth Amendment hinges on a range of issues, including whether decryption is ‚Äútestimonial,‚Äù whether the existence of the information sought by the government is a ‚Äúforegone conclusion,‚Äù and whether immunity for the act of decryption is provided.\n- Contempt: If an individual refuses an order to decrypt an electronic device, she could be held in contempt of court. When suspects refuse to testify or answer questions, courts can impose coercive and punitive punishments for contempt, including fines and imprisonment. Imprisonment for civil contempt can last for years, or until the order is obeyed. For example, the Third Circuit approved a contempt sentence that lasted 14 years, maintaining that individuals can be confined as long as they refuse a court order they are capable of obeying.\nFor more information, please contact Joseph Lorenzo Hall, Chief Technologist, at [email protected].\n Joe Miller, Google and Apple to introduce default encryption, BBC News, Sep. 19, 2014, http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29276955.\n Dan Goodin, Why passwords have never been weaker ‚Äì and crackers have never been stronger, Aug. 20, 2012, http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/passwords-under-assault.\n See, e.g., Heidi Hoopes, Apps to easily encrypt your text messaging and mobile calls, Gizmag, Sep. 27, 2014, http://www.gizmag.com/secure-text-messaging-phone-clients-comparison-ios-and-android/34000/.

Doping in sports is not the realm of the ‚Äòrogue‚Äô athlete. These findings show that when most athletes dope it is because they are part of a system that promotes doping and shields them from sanctions. All the ethically-based ‚Äòeducation‚Äô programs for athletes will not change that reality.\n2) Athletes equals cycling. The system at the heart of international athletics was almost exactly the same as professional cycling. Doping was at heart of the organizations that organized the sports.\n3) Words mean nothing. Officials in these corrupted sporting institutions spouted clich√©s like ‚Äòdrug-free sport‚Äô, ‚Äòwe are turning over all stones in our fight to provide a clean sporting environment‚Äô or ‚Äòwe must all work together in a broad alliance of stakeholders to provide a dope-free sporting world‚Äô. Meanwhile, the system effectively enabled cheating athletes and coaches.\n4) Strong punishment works. The only way to really stop corruption in sport (be it doping or match-fixing) is to properly punish the guilty. If this means banning Russia from international athletics for the Rio Olympics, then do it.\n5) Richard Pound. Can the man do much more in fighting doping and corruption in international sport? If we had a dozen Richard Pounds we could clean up sport for good.\n6) Canadians punch above their weight in anti-corruption in sports. Bob Munro, Laura Robinson, Alexandra Wrage, Richard McLaren, Richard Pound and others have all brought an extraordinary perspective to this field. This is not to downplay other nations ‚Äì German and British journalists were instrumental in breaking this particular story. However, what is different is that in other nations, their heroes are celebrated. In Canada, most of those people are not known to the general public. It is the problem of the colonial spirit at the heart of Canada. The idea that our own are never as good as foreigners.\n7) The links between the non-functioning fight against doping and match-fixing is clear. Below is a blog post from March about the report into doping in cycling and the non-fight against match-fixing. Replace the words ‚ÄòUCI‚Äô/‚Äòcycling‚Äô with ‚ÄòIAAF‚Äô/‚Äòathletics‚Äô and it is a very similar situation with the non-functioning fight against match-fixing.\nIt is a tale of two reports.\nThe first was released by the investigators of the Cycling International Report Commission (CIRI). They examined the actions of Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) who govern elite cycling.\nTheir report is a review of the colossal failure of anti-doping efforts in cycling over the last twenty-years. This failure came about despite tens-of-millions of dollars being spent in anti-doping and the deaths of a number of riders. The former cyclist Nicole Cooke brilliantly described the failure as, ‚ÄúThe wrong people using the wrong tools in the wrong way.‚Äù The CIRI report itself says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶from the early 1990s to the mid/late 2000s, it would have been hard to overestimate the prevalence of drug use in the peloton.‚Äù (23)\nThe second report is one of a series of secret documents about purported investigations into match-fixing in international sport. The documents were leaked to me by a number of sources. I will write about one specific report in my next blog. I do so because both reports show a disturbing similarity in the attitude of officials towards corruption in their sport. It seems the sports world has learned little from the failures of the anti-doping campaign. The fight against match-fixing is just starting, but it is repeating almost exactly the errors of the anti-doping fiasco.\nHere are some of the similarities between the two campaigns:\n1) The real problem is very small\nAccording to the CIRI report there is actually a very small number of doctors who provide most of the drugs for the elite cyclists. You could wipe out doping for the next few years by stopping these doctors. Get them banned from their medical practices. Put them in jail if possible. Cause them, and their many sporting clients, the maximum embarrassment possible.\nWe know their names and their addresses. Yet comparatively little action is spent stopping them. When there is action, like the Spanish police investigation on the Madrid doctor who allegedly provided drugs for hundreds of top-level Spanish athletes, his client list was never revealed. This allowed many top athletes to escape punishment or even embarrassment.\nIt is the same thing in match-fixing. Currently, there is a small group of match-fixers based in Asia who act as brokers to fixers around the world. These Asian fixers help put the cash of the fixers on to the gambling market. Most of these Asian fixers are well-known. Officials know who they are, where they live, what they do, their photos, their identities ‚Äì almost everything. Yet they are allowed to work. When there is action, like the detention of the Singaporean fixer Dan Tan, he is not allowed to testify in a public trial allowing many top sports officials and athletes to escape punishment or even embarrassment.\nThere is a red-herring of an argument made about this situation: ‚ÄúIf we prosecuted these people seriously they would just be replaced by others.‚Äù\nActually, if authorities really prosecuted the doctors/fixers and their clients it would be a serious disincentive for any one to replace them. Currently, doping doctors and gambling match-fixers know that many officials will not prosecute them with any seriousness.\n2) The Dopers are Welcomed Back\n‚Ä¶the more common issue now appears to be the return to the sport of riders who doped in the past and take up roles as directeur sportif or trainers. Many interviewees commented that they felt that it was difficult for the sport to change whilst individuals who rode in the doping era continue to have such a strong influence on the sport. This was also seen as a reason for the existence of the last remnants of the omerta, as older attitudes were to shun whistleblowers‚Ä¶\nCIRI, page 79\nPlayers, coaches and officials who fixed are also welcomed back in the sport. The issue is particularly strong in Asia and Africa where a slew of coaches and athletes who were involved in fixing are now at senior level. Possibly the worst of many examples is a quote from an interview that I did with a senior Asian football official who was in charge of fighting fixing in his country:\nHill: Did you match-fix when you were a player?\nOfficial: Oh yes. But it was different‚Ä¶ there was nothing obvious. Some of the senior players would tell us the difference should be in the goal difference. In other words, don‚Äôt win by three goals just win by a few goals less.\nInsider‚Äôs Guide to Match-Fixing, page 224.\n4) Ethics vs. Rational Choice\nIn the anti-doping world the blame was often pushed on to the athletes rather than officials who administered a system that covertly encouraged doping. Millions of anti-doping dollars were put into projects to ‚Äòeducate‚Äô athletes. In particular, there was an attempt to portray doping in cycling as an ethical failure on the part of a very few cyclists.\nHowever the findings of the CIRI report are very explicit. The decision to dope in the 1990s and early 2000s was mostly rational choice ‚Äì ‚Äòif you want to win, you have to dope.‚Äô If a young cyclist had another income stream or profession, they usually left cycling rather than dope. The cyclists who had no other career choices stayed and, if they wanted to win consistently, they doped.\nAgain there are similarities in match-fixing. Currently, there are groups of consultants and gambling companies who go about giving lectures to players about the ‚Äòethics‚Äô of match-fixing. Quite how a group of well-paid outsiders have the gall to lecture often unpaid, exploited athletes on ethics is a mystery. Particularly, when some of the consultants have received funding from organizations that suffer credibility issues on integrity like FIFA or the Qataris.\nTo be clear, most athletes hate fixing. They fix because they are badly paid or because they have been ordered to fix by their coaches or owners. There are a few genuine scumbags who fix because of a lack of integrity ‚Äì but no FIFA-sponsored ethics course will get them to stop.\n5) Investigations trump reports\nThe most effective way of cleaning up the sport is to pursue individuals through investigations as soon as a suspicion is raised‚Ä¶ CIRI notes that major doping scandals were uncovered due to investigative powers of public authorities.\nCIRI Report, page 15 & 212\nThe CIRI report demonstrates that external investigation were better than internal sporting authorities in finding out the truth about doping. It is the same issue in the fight against match-fixing. There is a dangerous myth being peddled by some sports officials and misled academics ‚Äì that police are reluctant to intervene in the sports world.\nToday, almost everything factual that we know about match-fixing comes from a series of well-resourced police investigations (and, to be fair, my books The Fix and The Insiders Guide to Match-Fixing and some parts of Wilson Raj Perumal‚Äôs excellent book Kelong Kings). The idea that police do not want to investigate match-fixing is countered by the words of many of the investigators that I spoke to. For example,\nWe [the law enforcement agencies] received no help from the football association. In fact quite the opposite, they closed ranks. They do not want to admit publicly that it [match-fixing] goes on.\nThe Insider‚Äôs Guide to Fixing, Page 253\n6) Image over reality\nThe emphasis of UCI‚Äôs anti-doping policy was, therefore, to give the impression that UCI was tough on doping rather than actually being good at anti-doping. UCI portrayed itself as always being at the forefront of the fight against doping.\nCIRI report, Page 10\nThere is a similar issue in match-fixing. Witness the countless conferences and reports brought out by the professional consultant brigade and sporting officials. The sporting world is often more concerned with giving the impression that they are doing something to clean up the problem. Often sports officials see match-fixing as a marketing issue, rather than an existential threat to the sport they administer.\n7) Appropriation of heroes and language\nFinally, is the use of noble language and postures by the very people engaged in corruption. A whole generation of the ‚Äògood guys‚Äô in the anti-doping war were deliberately sidelined by an establishment some of whom were complicit with dopers.\nThe one person who emerges from the CIRI report with absolute credibility is Richard Pound, the former President of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In the long sorry story of anti-doping efforts in cycling he was correct in almost everything that he said. Yet the UCI tried very hard to discredit Pound (they also sued him for libel). They even commissioned an ‚Äúindependent report‚Äù into Lance Armstrong after Pound suggested an investigation into Armstrong. However, when writing the ‚Äúindependent report‚Äù they actually got Lance Armstrong‚Äôs lawyer to help shape it.\nThe same phenomenon exists in match-fixing. Almost every single genuine hero of the fight has been systematically attacked, appropriated or discredited by the sports authorities and their dreary sidekicks. There has been a deliberate attempt to create a series of establishment ‚Äòheroes‚Äô and ‚Äòanti-fixing‚Äô institutions who have been ruthless in trying to steal the credit for the good work of law-enforcement against match-fixers.\n8) The Importance of the Media\nThe other winner (aside from Richard Pound) to emerge from the CIRI report is press freedom. It is difficult to think that any of the doping scandals in cycling would have ever been dealt with properly, without someone, somewhere leaking the information to the media.\nThe authors of the CIRI report write about the need for privacy and chastise WADA and their American counterparts USADA for publicly attacking UCI and/or leaking information to the media. The CIRI report claims that the critics should have taken their problem to a higher, competent authority in the sports world. And which organization would that have been? Sadly, their own report shows that there few other credible institution in sports ready to take anti-doping seriously.\nThe next blog will examine one of the ‚Äòinvestigations‚Äô into match-fixing at the highest level of international sport. Sadly, it seems to show disturbing similarities into the failed anti-doping campaign."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4762f12d-255b-4d80-938f-481f29b96fcc>","<urn:uuid:076479c4-68d3-4839-9df3-6ed08e7fb954>"],"error":null}

Baron de Kalb showed ultimate loyalty to his American comrades - in his final moments after suffering eleven wounds at Camden, he used his last breath to praise and bless the Maryland Line troops who fought alongside him.

Lee's loyalty was more complex - despite opposing both secession and slavery (even freeing 300 slaves), he chose loyalty to his state of Virginia over loyalty to the Union during the Civil War, leaving his beloved home at Arlington to fight for the Confederacy.","context":["The famed Maryland 400 were not the only soldiers Revolutionary War soldiers hailed as heroes. Indeed, the throughout the war, the Maryland Line (as the state‚Äôs contribution to the Continental Army was called) developed a reputation for skill and bravery. They were celebrated for years after the war, including in poems like this one, which first appeared in Washington, DC‚Äôs Daily National Intelligencer on October 2, 1828.\nNewspapers often contained poems and songs, which were prominent parts of popular entertainment. Its language is perhaps overly flowery to modern eyes, and may seem too enamored with the romance of combat, but it is an excellent example of the place that the Marylanders held in the nation‚Äôs imagination.

Custis, Esq. of Arlington1\nFounded on the celebrated Toast of General Lafayette, given to the Cincinnati of Maryland, viz: ‚ÄúThe memory of Gen. Greene, who used to say that the Maryland Line could stand cutting.‚Äù Inscribed with profound esteem and veneration to the surviving Officers and Soldiers of the Old Maryland Line.\nTune: ‚ÄúRemember, whenever your goblet is crowned‚Äù\nGeneral Greene used to say, with his soldierly air,\n(And few soldiers like him did such merits combine)\nThat for troops who‚Äôd stand cutting2, and would cut their full share,\nGive him forever, the Old Maryland Line.\nAt Guilford, Cowpens and Eutaw3, all field that were gory,\nFame wove many a chaplet4, brave brows to entwine,\nAnd full many were earned, by those true sons of glory,\nThose gallant gay veterans, the Old Maryland Line.\nHoward5 and Williams6 at Eutaw7 cried advance, let them feel, boys,\nOur bayonets‚Äô points, and they‚Äôll know by that sign\nThat we mean to stand cutting, and we‚Äôll give them our steel, boys,\nTill they‚Äôll find we can cut in the Old Maryland Line.\nThe Baron de Kalb8, while his wounds were a dressing,\nAnd his enemy cheered his faint spirit with wine,\nEmployed his last moments imploring a blessing\nOn his gallant dear comrades, the Old Maryland Line.\nHow few now survive of that famed band of brothers,\nWho so often our arms caused a glory to shine,\nSmith9, Read10, Anderson11, Beall12 and ah! how few others,\nForm the ‚Äútime-honor‚Äôd remains‚Äù of the Old Maryland Line.\nWhen beleagueredly for men on those days in September,\nMaryland called on her heroes the battle to join,\nHer Donaldson‚Äôs13 fall made her freshly remember\nThe hard stuff which composed her Old Maryland Line.\nWhen McCulloch14 lay wounded his enemies heard\nThe grey soldier of Washington say, with courage divine,\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought in two wars for my country, and I‚Äôd fight in a third.‚Äù\nWas not this a worthy a veteran of the Old Maryland Line?\nYoung Soldiers of Maryland, Children of Freedom,\nFrom the fame of your Fathers, oh! do never decline;\nWrite these words on your colors that your enemies may read them:\n‚ÄúThe true Sons of their Sires of the Old Maryland Line.\n1. George Washington Parke Custis (1781-1857) was the adopted stepson of George Washington, the father-in-law of Robert E. Lee, and the builder of Arlington House, now the site of Arlington National Cemetery. He was an avid writer of poems and songs, like this one. Read more about him here and here.\n3. Three of the key American victories during the Southern Campaign in the Carolinas in 1780-1781. After the disastrous defeat at Camden in August 1780, where one third of the Marylanders were killed or captured, the Americans rallied to beat the British back at Cowpens (December 1780), Guilford Courthouse (March 1781), the siege of Ninety-Six (May-June 1781), and Eutaw Springs (September 1781). While the Maryland troops already had a reputation for bravery, their place in history was cemented during the Southern Campaign, where their steadfastness and courage were critical to the American success.\n5. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúOf the lamented Colonel John Eager Howard, a volume of eulogram is contained in a few lines from the letter of Greene, and the memoirs by the eloquent author of the Southern Campaigns, Greene says: ‚ÄòThis letter will be handed to you by Colonel Howard, as good an officer as the world affords. He deserves a statue of gold no less than the Roman or Grecian Heroes.‚Äô And Lee [General Henry ‚ÄúLight Horse Harry‚Äù Lee, father of Robert E. Lee]: ‚ÄòHe was always to be found where the battle most raged, pressing into close action, to wrestle with a fixed bayonet.‚Äô‚Äù\n6. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúGeneral Otho Holland Williams. Maryland, in the recollections of her Revolutionary chivalry, must be justly proud of the fame and memory of her Williams. Young Williams marched with the first detachment of hunting-shirts from Maryland, and joined the Army of Liberty before Cambridge, in the dawn of the Revolution [Maryland sent two companies of riflemen to Boston in the summer of 1775 whose frontier dress, including hunting shirts, was much remarked upon]; was promoted to Major in Rawling‚Äôs Rifle Regiment in ‚Äò76, and taken prisoner at the surrender of Fort Washington, where his sharp-shooting corps literally heaped the ground with the Hessian dead. Major Williams suffered all the horrors and privations of captivity during a long confinement, and, through the intercession of his friend, the late General Wilkinson, was at length exchanged for Major Ackland, of the British Army. Williams rejoined the American Army with the rank of Colonel of the Sixth Maryland Regiment, marched to the South, was appointed Adjutant General to both Gates and Greene, and consummated his military glory in the severe actions of the Carolinas, from Camden to Eutaw. Admired by Washington, beloved by Greene, to whom he was a most valued and confidential advisor, he was, at the close of the war, recommended by those illustrious patriots, to Congress, for promotion, to the rank of Brigadier [General]. Congress declined the promotion on the score of rank, but granted it on the better consideration of eminent talents and services. On the adoption of the present Constitution, General Williams received from the Father of his Country the appointment of Collector of Baltimore [i.e. head of the Customs House, a lucrative government patronage job], one of the very best appointments in the gift of the new Government. ‚ÄòToo soon for his country,‚Äô but in the full meridian of his fame, General Williams sunk under the effects of disease, contracted during the sufferings of his captivity, and expired in 1794.‚Äù\n7.The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúAt the battle of Eutaw Springs, the Old Maryland Line, led by Howard and Williams, rushed upon the enemy with the bayonet; and so fierce and deadly was the encounter, that, after the action, many of the Marylanders, and the third British Regiment, or Old Bluffs, were found transfixed [i.e. impaled or stabbed] by each others weapons.‚Äù\n8. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúThe Baron De Kalb fell under eleven wounds at Camden. He received the kindest attentions from Cornwallis, and other Chiefs of the British. Lee says, ‚ÄòNever were the last moments of a soldier better employed.‚Äô He dictated a letter to General Smallwood, who succeeded to the command of his division, expressing his admiration of their late noble though unsuccessful stand, and reciting the eulogy which their bravery had extorted from the enemy. Feeling the pressure of death, he stretched out his quivering hand to his friend Du Buysson, proud of his 27 generous wounds, and breathed his last in benediction on his faithful, brave division, the Old Maryland Line, and the regiment of Delaware, which latter, nearly annihilated in the battle of Camden, was reduced to two companies, and which formed the ‚Äòrenowned Delawares,‚Äô commanded by the ‚Äòbrave, meritorious, and unrewarded Kirkwood.‚Äô‚Äù The letter from Charles-Fran√ßois, vicomte Du Buysson, a French officer fighting with the Americans, to Washington, can be read here.\n9. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúGen. Samuel Smith, distinguished in the defense of the Delaware in ‚Äò77; probably the oldest survivor in years and rank, of the Old Maryland Line.‚Äù\n10. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúGen. [Philip] Reed of the Eastern Shore. Was severely wounded at Camden. In the last war [of 1812], this veteran, a cripple from his Revolutionary wound, turned out again in arms, and successfully opposed the enterprises of the enemy in the Chesapeake, thus showing that neither age nor wounds had changed or impaired ‚Äòthe rare stuff which composed the Old Maryland Line.‚Äô‚Äù Reed commanded the Maryland militia who defeated the British at the Battle of Caulk‚Äôs Field in August, 1814, one of the militia‚Äôs only victories during the war.\n11. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúCol. Anderson [probably Maj. Archibald Anderson, killed at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, March, 1781]. A gallant officer in the regiment of Howard, and distinguished himself at the battle of the Cowpens.‚Äù\n12. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúCol. William Dent Beall. Served from nearly the first to quite the last of the Revolutionary War, having been engaged in the action on the Combahee, in 1782, where the chivalric and lamented [Col. John] Laurens fell.‚Äù Beall‚Äôs military service began in July, 1776, as a lieutenant in the Flying Camp.\n13. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúAdjutant Lowry Donaldson, who fell at North Point, 1814, saying ‚ÄòI die, but let not the battle die with me.‚Äô‚Äù The Battle of North Point was part of the American defense of Baltimore during the British attack 12-14 September 1814, the ‚Äúdays of September‚Äù the poem refers to.\n14. The text of the original poem includes this note: ‚ÄúJames McCulloch, Collector of Baltimore, a soldier of the Revolution. When the British landed at North Point, the veteran McCulloch shouldered a musket as a volunteer, and marching to meet the enemy, some young men were discovered on an elevation, looking through a spy-glass. ‚ÄòWhat are ye looking at?‚Äô asked McCulloch. ‚ÄòAt the British‚Äô was the reply. ‚ÄòPshaw,‚Äô said the heroic old man, ‚Äòcome along with me and I‚Äôll ensure ye a better view of them.‚Äô Shot through the thigh, and lying on the field, the British were astonished to see a frosty-haired grandfather among young soldiers, and asked ‚ÄòWhat are ye doing here, Grandada‚Äô? ‚ÄòFighting the enemies of my country,‚Äô was the reply. ‚ÄòWhy, you are too old.‚Äô ‚ÄòNot a bit,‚Äù replied the heroic veteran; ‚ÄúI have fought you twice, and if, with the blessing of God I recover from my wounds, I shall be ready for you a third time.‚Äô‚Äù","Lee, Robert E. (1807‚Äì1870)\nOne of the tragedies of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) was that men were forced to decide which was their greater loyalty ‚Äì to their state or to their country. Robert E. Lee was opposed to the two main causes for which the southern states had gone to war: secession and slavery. About secession he had written, \"I cannot anticipate a greater calamity for the country than the dissolution of the Union.\" To show his dislike of slavery, he freed the 300 slaves which belonged to his family. And yet, when the choice had to be made, he decided to fight for his native southern state, Virginia.\nJust as Lincoln is the hero of the northern cause, so is Lee the hero of the southern. Winston Churchill wrote of Lee: \"His noble presence and gentle, kindly manner were sustained by religious faith and an exalted character.\" Robert E. Lee came from a distinguished, well-established family. His father had been a general in the War of Independence. He lived at Arlington, a magnificent house overlooking the new capital of Washington. It belonged to his wife, whose family were closely connected with the Washingtons. The house was full of souvenirs of George Washington ‚Äì furniture, silver, camp equipment, and the bed in which he died at Mount Vernon.\nLee was already 54 years old when the Civil War broke out. After graduating at West Point, he had served for nearly 20 years in the United States army ‚Äì in Mexico, against Comanche Indians along the Texan border, and as superintendent of the West Point military academy.\nWhen, on that fateful April day in 1861, Lee resigned his commission, he said goodbye for ever to his beloved Arlington, where his three sons and four daughters had grown up, and across the Potomac bridge for Richmond, the Virginian capitol.\nThe warLee at once became one of the five chief generals of the Confederacy, as the southern states were called, and an adviser to President Jefferson Davis. In the spring of 1862, when the North invaded Virginia, Lee planned a brilliant defensive stategy which not only saved Richmond, the Confederate capitol, but sent the Union forces into retreat. Lee now took full command of the Southern army and proceeded to win the Battle of the Seven Days, at the cost of losing 20,000 men as opposed to 17,000 on the Union side. With the support of such excellent officers as 'Stonewall' Jackson, James Longstreet, and Jeb Stuart, Lee won the second battle of Bull Run and began to invade the North. He was stopped, however, in September of 1862 at the battle of Antietam in Maryland. But in December of the same year he won a decisive victory at Fredricksburg and another the following spring at Chancellorsville.\nLee was now the hero of the Confederacy. His men adored him. They called him 'Marse Robert' and cheered him wildly wherever he went. Lee was a tall, handsome man, his hair and beard turned silver. On his horse Traveller he looked every inch a conquering general. But besides being a good general, he was gentle and kind to his men, and they loved him for these qualities.\nIn the summer of 1863 the fortunes of the South began to decline. Lee's armies had driven deep into Pennsylvania, but they were driven back at Gettysburg after the bitterest battle of the war. In the spring of 1864 Lincoln appointed Ulysses S. Grant to take charge of the Union army. Several desperate but indecisive battles followed. The resources of the South were far smaller than those of the North; Lee had fewer troops and was running short of supplies. He realized that further resistance would mean needless bloodshed and suffering. On 9th April 1865 Lee surrendered at the Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia.\nHome ‚Ä¢ Copyright ¬© The Worlds of David Darling ‚Ä¢ Encyclopedia of Science ‚Ä¢ Encyclopedia of Alternative Energy ‚Ä¢ Contact"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5d62bd53-1c99-47d6-a1ab-3af681cbfde2>","<urn:uuid:028d4235-d6da-4572-8fb5-eb4317a06b1a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key ecological differences between Galanthus peshmenii and Galanthus nivalis in terms of their preferred habitats and growing conditions?","answer":"Galanthus peshmenii and Galanthus nivalis show distinct habitat preferences. G. peshmenii grows in limestone areas, particularly on north-facing slopes of river valleys and cliffs, often among rounded limestone boulders, with vegetation dominated by pines and plane trees. It can be found growing just meters above sea level in rich, red soil pockets. Meanwhile, G. nivalis most frequently occurs in moist conditions in deciduous woodland (with Fagus silvatica, Quercus spp., Carpinus spp.), occasionally in coniferous woodland, and can also be found in meadows, pasture, amongst scrub, near rivers and on stony slopes, particularly on calcareous soils. While G. peshmenii is found in Turkey, G. nivalis notably does not occur in Turkey, being distributed throughout Europe from Spain to Ukraine.","context":["Planning the snowdropathon has been an exercise in logistics that would have had the Fedex mainframe scratching its circuits in frustration. The dates around which snowdrop species flower in cultivation provide only the sketchiest of guides to corresponding dates in the wild. What‚Äôs more, every year is different and fluctuating patterns of rainfall and temperature can cause emergence dates to shift by weeks. Inevitably, the result is sometimes a busted flush, as with my attempt to see Galanthus transcaucasicus in Iran. Occasionally, however, the stars align and extreme snowdropping becomes a doddle.\nI was in SW Turkey a little over a month ago, hoping to see early flowering Galanthus peshmenii but found that the sites where it occurs were bone dry and only a handful of plants had emerged at the highest elevation population I know.\nReturning to the same valley, west of Kemer, on 23 November, I found a population of thousands of plants in spectacular flower, running like a seam of quartz along the north-facing slope of a steep-sided river valley. Here they were completely shaded from the blazing autumn sunshine, which had me sweating in my thin tee-shirt, as I clambered over the rounded limestone boulders of the river bed. Despite heavy recent rains, the river bed was almost dry. After the snow melts in spring, it will be flowing fast.\nHaving been invisible only five weeks previously, many of these plants had now already finished flowering (indeed, at the highest elevation site, all the plants were beginning to set seed). Enough late ones were in peak condition, however, to give a fine impression of the variation within the population.\nThe vegetation in these sites is dominated by pines, but magnificent plane trees mark out the courses of seasonal rivers and streams, often growing within the river bed. The understory is a rich mix of Cotinus coggyria, Bay (Laurus nobilis), Oleander (Nerium oleander), Myrtle (Myrtus communis), spiny, evergreen oaks (Quercus spp.) and other leafless, deciduous shrubs that defeated my improving but still woefully inadequate field botany. The spurge, Euphorbia characias and Butcher‚Äôs Broom (Ruscus aculeatus) are ubiquitous at low elevations, E. myrsinites replacing the former higher up. In the deep shade of the river bed grow numerous ferns, including great clumps of a Polypodium species, the new fronds startlingly vibrant against the white limestone. The infinitely variable leaves of Cyclamen maritimum, their flowers over, mingled with less frequent Cyclamen alpinum, which will flower in spring, the latter starting to appear only above about 500m elevation. A few plants of Crocus cancellatus subsp. lycius (plain C. lycius, according to some botanists) were flowering, on the same shady rocks as the Galanthus.\nGalanthus peshmenii is known in cultivation only from a handful of collections, including one made in this very valley above Kemer, by Bob and Rannveig Wallis and another from the Greek island of Kastellorizo by Martyn Rix. The few named selections that have been made, including one or two with rather feeble green tips to the outer segments, have not yet been widely distributed.\nIn wild populations this species is, of course, as variable as any other snowdrop.\nIn stature G. peshmenii is rather small. The scapes (flower-bearing stalks) of a small sample I measured ranged between 10cm and 20cm but some plants, especially those growing in crevices in boulders, were even shorter, perhaps dwarfed by the conditions in which they grew. The flowers varied greatly in size, the outer segments measuring from less than a centimetre to 2.5cm in length. The combination of relatively large flowers and short scapes is rather pleasing, to my eye, creating an impression of a neat and vigorous plant. I fancy that the absence of leaves at flowering time further enhances the beauty of a clump of a single clone, focusing one‚Äôs attention on the pristine flowers.\nUnlike the morphologically similar Galanthus reginae-olgae, G. peshmenii displays a noticeable tendency to form small clumps, by the offsetting of bulbs. Conversely, whereas the former species quite often produces two scapes per bulb, this appears to happen only rarely in G. peshmenii in the wild.\nHaving said that the leaves are absent at flowering time, I should note that this feature is also variable. In some cases the leaves had already emerged by several centimetres while the plants were in flower. Most plants that had finished flowering already had well-developed leaves. These will go on to become extraordinarily long ‚Äì up to 40cm ‚Äì hanging like seaweed from the rocks*. The leaf colour was noticeably glaucous (having a waxy, blueish bloom) or glaucescent (midway between glaucous and green). A prominent pale median stripe on the adaxial (upper) surface was present on all the plants I examined.\nAll snowdrop species have a single pair of leaves per bulb (leaving aside occasional freaks with three or more leaves). The manner in which the two leaves are pressed together at the point where they emerge from the sheath** ‚Äì a feature referred to as their ‚Äòvernation‚Äô ‚Äì is of some diagnostic value in separating species. The books say that in G. peshmenii the vernation is ‚Äòapplanate‚Äô, which is to say that the upper surfaces of the two leaves are pressed flat together at the neck of the bulb and the margins of the leaves are also flat. This broadly concurs with my observations but, in many specimens, the edges of the leaves, especially at their bases, were rolled back on themselves, in a manner that is referred to as ‚Äòrevolute‚Äô or ‚Äòsubrevolute‚Äô, if you want to hedge your bets, which I do.\nThe outer segments are shaped like a concave paddle, with a short, but variable handle, the ‚Äòclaw‚Äô of the segment.\nThe segments are widest near their apices but the edges are typically almost parallel for most of their length. The ends of the segments are often rather ‚Äòsquare‚Äô, with a small, acuminate tip, which reflexes as the flower ages, creating the (false) impression that the outer segments possess a sinus. This shape, difficult to describe, gives the segments a distinctive, almost oblong outline, especially when the flowers are viewed from above.\nA very small proportion of plants have small green markings towards the tip of the outer segments though, in all the cases I saw, this was distinctly subtle. Occasional mutants with four or five inner and outer segments were rarer still.\nThe inner segments are roughly triangular, narrowest at the base and have a distinctively small notch (sinus) at their apex. The green mark at the apex of the inner segment is typically V-shaped, diffuse and small, sometimes reduced to a pale green smudge or two dots either side of the sinus. Occasionally, however, the inner segment mark is larger, sometimes extending over most of the apical half of the segment and/or assuming a pleasing inverted heart shape.\nUntil I had had an opportunity to study both species carefully in the wild I would have said that flowering G. peshmenii and G. reginae-olgae are impossible to tell apart reliably, without knowledge of a plant‚Äôs provenance. The remarkable morphological similarity of these two species appears to be an interesting case of convergent evolution. Whereas G. reginae-olgae is closely related to G. nivalis, the affinities of G. peshmenii lie with the morphologically dissimilar G. elwesii, and it sits on a different branch of the genus‚Äôs phylogenetic tree (the branching tree purporting to describe the evolutionary history of the genus)***. Now I think that a combination of various rather subtle differences make it possibly to distinguish the two species, though not with absolute conviction.\nIn comparison with G. reginae-olgae, flowering G. peshmenii is generally shorter in stature; the leaf colour is more glaucescent and the outer segments more oblong in outline, with a shorter claw, compared with the typically slender and elegant, often strongly unguiculate G. reginae-olgae. The flowers of G. peshmenii often have a characteristic pyramidal shape, whereas those of G. reginae-olgae are more bulb-like. The most consistent differences, however, are in the shape and markings of the inner segment. The sinus much less pronounced in typical examples of G. peshmenii. Whereas, in G. peshmenii, the apical margin of the inner segment is completely flat, the corresponding margin in G. reginae-olgae is usually slightly flared. Furthermore, whereas the inner segment of G. peshmenii is roughly triangular, with the vertices of the triangle rounded, the inner segments of G. reginae-olgae are usually somewhat constricted near the apex, so that the two lobes either side of the sinus resemble teeth. In pronounced examples, this give the flower a ‚Äògoofy‚Äô appearance. On average the apical mark on the inner segment is smaller in G. peshmenii, and more likely to be V-shaped. It should be noted that these differences are all evident at a population level but that some plants of both species overlap with the other in all the above respects. While it should be possible to cautiously assign an unknown plant to one of the above species, using a combination of all the characters, complete certainty is unlikely.\nA quick aside: Galanthophiles (including me) get ridiculously excited over minute variations in the combinations of the various features of snowdrop flowers and this behaviour is thought distinctly odd by non-initiates. No-one, however, finds it strange to admire human faces, nor to attribute the beauty of a particular face to a subtle combination of, say, small nose, full lips and high cheekbones. Just as connoisseurs of human diversity enjoy looking at faces, so galanthophiles appreciate the infinite combinations of stature, shape, colour, markings and other features that the simple snowdrop flower throws up. In fact, it seems highly likely that the facial recognition ‚Äòsoftware‚Äô in human brains is responsible for our ability to detect and remember the tiny differences between snowdrops that excite the admiration of enthusiasts.\nHaving spent a happy day wandering about in the snowdrop population near Kemer, I returned next to G√∂yn√ºk Canyon, a few miles to the east. On my previous visit, in late October, Cyclamen maritimum had been in full flower but there was no sign whatsoever of G. peshmenii. By late November the Cyclamen was over but the Galanthus was in flower at various elevations from 80m to 600m. Interestingly, the plants at lower elevations were only just coming into flower and all the plants I saw in G√∂ynuk Canyon were less advanced than those above Kemer. I had noticed on my previous trip that Cyclamen maritimum does not go higher than 150m inG√∂yn√ºk, whereas above Kemer it is still abundant at 700m. Whereas there had been plenty of rain near Kemer,G√∂yn√ºk remained bone dry. Clearly there are significant microclimatic differences between these two valleys. The pattern of plants flowering earlier at higher elevations also occurs in G. reginae-olgae on Corfu. Presumably the colder nights and, perhaps, higher rainfall at higher elevations is responsible for this phenomenon. It would be interesting to conduct experiments to resolve the issue. Another time!\nLovely though the newly opened Galanthus flowers were, especially when seen against the backdrop of the stark limestone mountains, they played second fiddle to a stunning Crocus species, C. wattiorum, which has gone into my book as the prettiest member of this genus that I have ever seen. In a couple of places the two plants were flowering together. I almost died while dangling off a cliff trying to secure a photograph illustrating this magical combination, when a large limestone boulder I had dislodged decided to roll downhill, through me. I would have made a satisfying splash among the tourists milling around on the valley floor, had the gods decided my time was up.\nNot enough plants were flowering in G√∂ynuk Canyon for me to form a clear impression as to whether they differed systematically from those near Kemer. The habitat in which they were growing was very different, however: north-facing limestone cliffs, among rocks, far from the river or its tributary streams.\nAlthough seven months travelling constantly in search of snowdrops might seem a long time, in fact there is never remotely enough time to explore as thoroughly as one would like. Presumably, if one were to examine all the patches of suitable habitat in the canyons running from the coastal mountains of this part of Turkey to the Mediterranean, one would find numerous populations of G. peshmenii, but the roads and tracks are few and the terrain difficult to move about in. One of these days I should like to walk the Lycian Way, a clearly marked long-distance trail through these mountains, but that will have to wait for another year****.\nIt has been known since the 1970s that G. peshmenii occurs on cliffs on the north-facing side of the Greek island of Kastellorizo (Megisti). This outpost of Europe lies just a couple of miles off the Turkish coast at Ka≈ü, an attractive town 150 km to the west of Kemer, not yet utterly wrecked by mass tourism, as Kemer has been. I was curious to see whether I could find Galanthus on the mainland. But a generous and well-informed friend advised me to take a trip out to the small, uninhabited island of Kekova where, he said, I would see snowdrops. To this end I made my way to the marina at √ú√ßaƒüiz and wandered around until I found a boatman willing to ferry me over to the island. Ramazan, skipper of the Ko√ß II (I didn‚Äôt care to ask what had happened to the Ko√ß I) took me across the narrow strait and obligingly allowed me to jump ashore at various places to explore.\nApproaching the island from the north, the rounded limestone rocks start to assume puzzlingly geometrical shapes. Gradually it becomes clear that one is looking at the remains of an abandoned ancient city, carved into the cliffs and now partially submerged. As we drifted through gin-clear water, the stone walls of ruined buildings were clearly visible beneath the calm surface. Here was a bona fide Atlantis*****, a city sunk beneath the waves. One half expected Patrick Duffy to haul himself onto a rock, wearing 1970s speedos. On shore the signs of this vanished civilisation were everywhere, in stone doorways and niches carved into the rock, where wooden joists had once slotted. Ramazan kept up a running commentary, displaying a particular obsession with cisterns, huge stone caverns that would have been used to capture and store fresh water.\nAlmost immediately I saw big clumps of G. peshmenii, flowering beautifully in eroded pockets in the limestone cliffs. Ramazan nosed the boat towards a set of ancient steps and I leapt ashore, feeling a bit like Neil Armstrong. Amazingly, some of the snowdrops were growing just a metre or two above sea level, on rocks wet with salt water spray. Closer investigation revealed that the pockets in which the snowdrops grew contained a considerable depth of rich, red soil. A few metres higher up, within the tumbled-down walls of ancient rooms, more snowdrops grew on level ground and here they were still in bud. The population was rather small, but contained within it all the variation I had seen near Kemer.\nAlso in flower was Narcissus tazetta, which typically flowers in spring but, just like the snowdrops, here occurs in an autumn-flowering form. Daphne gnidioides was festooned with orange fruit and large shrubs of Euphorbia denrdoides mingled with an attractive blue-leafed rue. Growing in exactly the same situation as the Galanthus were big patches of Arisarum vulgare. Dusk was approaching and, reluctantly, I accepted Ramazan‚Äôs suggestion that we head back to√ú√ßaƒüiz. The hauntingly beautiful underwater city and its cliff-dwelling snowdrops shall stay in my mind long after the snowdropathon is also ancient history.\n* I visited this same colony in February 2015 and saw the leaves at their maximum extent.\n** Technically, vernation refers to the manner in which the developing leaves are held together in bud but, for practical purposes, it can be observed by checking the arrangement of new leaves as they emerge from the sheath at the top of the bulb. In Galanthus there are three basic forms of vernation: applanate, in which the leaves are pressed flat against one another, with flat margins; explicative, in which the leaves are held flat against one another but with the margins folded back on themselves; and convolute or supervolute, in which one leaf clasps the other. G. peshmenii exhibits the first of these patterns, but many plants have leaf margins that are slightly or markedly revolute, or rolled back.\n*** The relationships among recognised Galanthus species are slowly being clarified by ‚Äòmolecular phylogenetics‚Äô, the new science of deducing the evolutionary history of groups of organisms by decoding and analysing divergences in short sequences of their DNA. Facinatingly, this is showing that several recognised species, including G. elwesii and G. transcaucasicus are ‚Äòpolyphyletic‚Äô, which is to say they probably actually comprise several independent lineages, with similar morphologies. The state of the art in this field suggests that G. peshmenii belongs in a ‚Äòclade‚Äô, a lineage with a single common ancestor, comprising G. elwesii, G. gracilis, G. cilicicus and G. peshmenii.

Baker\nGalanthus umbricus Dammann\n|Taxonomic Notes:||There are over 50 synonyms for Galanthus nivalis and this is due to several reasons: it is a variable species and throughout its distribution a number of taxa have been named in an attempt to record this variation; because of its long history in cultivation, a large number of taxa and cultivars have been recognised, leading to an even greater proliferation of names; and before many other species had been described, most Galanthus were referred to or associated with G. nivalis, probably because it was the best known and most ubiquitous species (Davis 1999).|\n|Red List Category & Criteria:||Near Threatened ver 3.1|\n|Assessor(s):||Crook, V. & Davis, A.P.|\n|Reviewer(s):||Bilz, M. & Lutz, M.L.|\nGalanthus nivalis has an extensive distribution across Europe. There is some uncertainty, however, concerning the extent of native subpopulations due to widespread naturalisation. Many native subpopulations of G. nivalis occur in small relictual forest/woodlands and further loss of suitable habitats would lead to a definite decline in the species. Climate change is also likely to threaten G. nivalis due to the loss of suitable micro- and macro-habitats, where it is currently found. The species is listed as Near Threatened, Vulnerable or even Critically Endangered in several European countries and is included on nearly every country's Red List, suggesting the subpopulations in each of the countries are under threat. Harvesting and trade of the species is still occurring on a local scale, even though international trade is restricted by CITES. A rating of Near Threatened at the global level is suggested here due to all the above factors threatening the population as a whole, and the possibility of G. nivalis qualifying for a threat category in the near future (VU A3cd).\n|Range Description:||Galanthus nivalis is found throughout Europe: eastwards from the Pyrenees and northern Spain to the Ukraine, and southwards from Germany and Poland to southern Italy, Albania and northern Greece. Galanthus nivalis does not occur in Turkey or in the Caucasus mountains. It is doubtfully native in many locations in northwestern Europe above 50¬∫N latitude and is introduced and naturalised in the UK, Netherlands and other countries of northern Europe. Although found over a wide altitude range, most populations are found below 900 m asl.|\nNative:Austria; Belarus; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Czech Republic; France; Germany; Greece; Italy; Moldova; Montenegro; Poland; Romania; Russian Federation; Serbia (Kosovo); Slovakia; Spain; Switzerland; Ukraine\nIntroduced:Canada (New Brunswick, Newfoundland I, Ontario); Netherlands; Norway; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States (Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia)\n|Range Map:||Click here to open the map viewer and explore range.|\n|Population:||Native populations are believed to be relictual. Galanthus nivalis has been described as a relict species in the community of Valencia, Spain, where only three wild populations are known (Estrelles et al. 2001). Specific population data is available for several subpopulations, such as that in the East Carpathians (Budnikov and Kricsfalusy 1994):|\nSeed productivity studies of various populations of G. nivalis in the East Carpathians showed that population age structure remains stable due to regeneration through seed. Lowland-foothill populations appear to have the highest generative reproduction capacity. Lowland populations are also predominated by juvenile plants (about 40%), with mature plants in lower numbers. This is thought to be caused by a large amount of harvesting in these lowland areas. The upper mountain belt has a much higher percentage of mature (58%) than juvenile (11%) plants. These populations are considerably less ‚Äúaffected‚Äù by human pressures and likely to represent a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù age structure.\n|Current Population Trend:||Decreasing|\n|Habitat and Ecology:||Most frequently occurring in moist conditions in deciduous woodland (Fagus silvatica, Quercus spp., Carpinus spp. etc.), and occasionally in coniferous woodland (Abies spp.). Also occurring in meadows, pasture, amongst scrub, near rivers and on stony slopes, particularly on calcareous soils. |\nGalanthus nivalis is a cross pollinating plant, but sometimes self-pollination takes place. It is pollinated by bees. Seeds have elaiosomes which are eaten by ants and they carry seeds through underground tunnels, helping to distribute them.\n|Use and Trade:||\nSnowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) is an outdoor ornamental spring flower widely grown around the world. It is one of the most popular of all cultivated bulbous plants. Galanthus nivalis is ubiquitous in cultivation, and hundreds of thousands of individuals are sold each year in horticultural trade.\nFive alkaloids are contained in the above-ground part of G. nivalis and five also in the underground part. One is Galanthamin which is a strong poison and is used in medicine to relieve traumatic injuries to the nervous system. Another is Lycorine, which can also cause poisoning. Some individuals were poisoned after ingesting the bulbs as emergency food in Holland during World War II. Large amounts of bulbs need to be ingested to produce toxic reactions, such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The plant is also an emmenagogue - it promotes or increases menstrual flow or can induce an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.\nThe mannose-binding specific lectin from Snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) is an effective insecticide against a wide variety of pest insects in the orders Homotera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera with hardly any effect on non-target insects and soil bacterial communities. GNA is regarded as a potential insecticidal gene to be engineered into cultivated plants to increase the range of pests affected and to delay the development of insect resistance. Researchers have advocated transgenically transforming crops such as grapefruit, tobacco, tomato, potato, rice and wheat with GNA in order to increase their resistance against insect pests. Beyond being investigated for its uses as an insecticide, GNA lectin is also being investigated for its use in antibody and HIV research.\nThe survival of many Galanthus species is threatened in nature due to habitat destruction and collecting for the horticultural trade. Galanthus is the most heavily traded wild-collected bulb genus in the world. However, all species have been listed in CITES Appendix II since 1990 and trade in wild specimens is now heavily restricted. In addition, most nurseries are selling stock which has been raised from selected reliable clones, therefore avoiding the use of wild populations (Davis 1999). Reported trade in wild specimens of G. nivalis virtually ceased in 1995, with the cessation of reported exports from Hungary.\nCITES-reported exports of live/bulbs of Galanthus nivalis:\nHungary: 200,000 (1992), 120,000 (1993), 150,000 (1994)\nRomania: 41 kg (2000)\nTurkey: 28,670 (1994) [not G. nvalis]\nNetherlands: 300 (1995), 1,325 (1998), 219 (1999)\nSome populations are more threatened than others, an example from Ukraine is outlined below:\nGalanthus nivalis was formerly widely distributed in the East Carpathians but during the last decade its area has been considerably reduced as a result of destruction of its primary habitats (particularly the lowland-foothill zone where populations are close to populated areas or recreational areas) and direct destruction by picking its flowers and digging out bulbs. Threatened by extinction in certain areas, it has been included in the \"List of Rare and Disappearing Species of the Ukrainian Flora\" and listed as a species in decline in the ‚ÄúRed Data Book of the Ukraine‚Äù (1996). Galanthus nivalis is protected, and has been included in the national Red Data Books or lists of all the neighbouring countries of the Carpathians region ‚Äì Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Illegal exports of Galanthus plicatus and G. nivalis were reported from the Ukraine in 1997, however.\nGalanthus nivalis is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), under Annex B of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulation 318-2008 and on Annex V of the EC Habitats Directive 92/43.\nGalanthus nivalis is included in the Red Data Books of the following countries: Austria (Niklfeld 1999), Italy (Conti et al. 1997), Italy / Sicily (Conti et al. 1997), Italy / Sardinia (Conti et al. 1997), Netherlands (van der Meijden 2000), Romania (1994), It has been assigned different threat ratings in several countries:\nGalanthus nivalis populations are found in several protected areas throughout Europe including:\n|Citation:||Crook, V. & Davis, A.P. 2011.

Fetch This Document","A beautiful back porch with ip√™ wood flooring, a massive fireplace, and adjoining patio was added to this two-story, historic home to turn the backyard into the perfect place for outdoor entertaining.\nSince the house was located in a historic district, the addition had to be approved and comply with local regulations. Architect Nick Holmes of Holmes and Holmes Architects incorporated many of the architectural features found on the existing home into the design of the porch.\nPorch and Patio FoundationAfter the footprint of the addition had been established, holes were dug for the concrete footings and steel rebar added for reinforcement. Once the footings had been poured, concrete blocks were laid, then filled with concrete to provide a solid core for the foundation.\nConcrete slabs were also poured for an adjoining patio, with wooden forms used to create troughs in the concrete for a brick border. A decorative diagonal pattern was cut into the concrete patio with a circular saw.\nOnce the foundation was complete, sheet metal termite shields were placed on top of the concrete block piers. Pressure treated floor joists were used to frame the 17‚Äô wide by 24‚Äô long porch. To make sure rainwater runs off the porch floor, the floor joists were installed with the center of the porch a bit higher than the edges.\nPosts to support the ceiling and roof were attached to the joists and notched at the top to accept beams. Ceiling joists were then installed across the porch between the beams.\nA decorative scroll pattern was cut into the bottom of the exposed ends of the rafters to match the design on the house. The roof framing was then covered with plywood decking followed by roofing.\nThe firebox and chimney were assembled from precast masonry material made by FireRock, so it would have exactly the right shape to draw properly. The fireplace and concrete block foundation piers were then covered with brick that had been chosen to match the house.\nPorch Columns and TrimTo match the recessed panel columns on the front of the house, the pressure treated posts were covered with:\n- A layer of plywood.\n- Trim boards to form the center panels.\n- Corner boards made from 1√ó4 lumber.\n- Plinth blocks on the column tops.\n- Crown molding around the capitals.\n- Bases on the bottom of the columns.\nThe ceiling on the porch was then covered with wood beadboard to mimic the ceiling found on the front porch of the house.\nIp√™ Porch Flooring\nThe flooring for the porch was made from a dense, tropical hardwood called ip√™. Native to South America, ip√™ is naturally resistant to moisture, fungus, insects, and rot. The tongue and groove flooring was installed using stainless steel screws in predrilled holes. A small gap was left between every few rows of flooring to allow for expansion.\nAdded AmenitiesOther amenities on the porch included:\n- Cabinets for an outdoor kitchen were constructed.\n- Pressure treated lattice panels were installed around the foundation.\n- Mahogany door with glass was installed on the back of the house.\n- Mantel and flat screen TV were installed above the fireplace.\nOther Tips from This Episode\nSimple Solutions with Joe Truini:\nCleaning a Grill with Vinegar\nTo clean the cooking surface on an outdoor grill, spray the metal grate with white vinegar, allow it to sit for a few minutes, then rub the surface with crumpled up aluminum foil. The acid in the vinegar will cut through grease and food residue while the abrasive foil cleans it away.\nBest New Products with Jodi Marks:\nHampton Bay Solar Rope Light\nThe Hampton Bay Solar Rope Light is great for accenting porch and deck railings or as a border on outdoor walkways.

{"question":"How do the core competencies differ between physiotherapy education in Australia/New Zealand and the remedial massage therapy curriculum at the Institute? Looking for a detailed comparison.","answer":"The Australian/New Zealand physiotherapy education has shifted away from technical skills toward personal qualities of graduates, emphasizing competencies like advocacy, conflict management, empowerment, and physical/mental health resilience, while de-emphasizing traditional divisions between musculoskeletal, neurological and cardio-respiratory physiotherapy. In contrast, the Institute's remedial massage therapy curriculum maintains a strong technical focus with specific units covering remedial massage techniques, musculoskeletal assessments, sports injury management, and taping skills, along with practical business management competencies. Both programs incorporate client relationship management and professional practice elements, but their primary focus differs significantly in terms of scope and approach.","context":["This tweetchat on Monday 31st August at 8pm BST invites academic, clinical and student tweeters, as well as members of the general public, to discuss how the pre-registration curriculum for Physiotherapy in the UK could develop. It is hosted by @QMUphysio although you should see a number of lecturers from Queen Margaret University participating during the chat including @JudithLaneQMU\nAs delivery of health and social care becomes increasingly more complex, the skills and knowledge required of a newly qualified physiotherapist are changing. As well as ensuring that their graduates are fit-for-practice, there is a need for universities to understand the drivers that are likely to shape the development of practice.\nThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy describe physiotherapy as a profession which is able to identify and address the physical, psychological, social & environmental factors that can limit movement & function. Physiotherapy practice is described as person-centred, ethical, and effective and evidence based. Traditionally, most UK universities have based pre-registration programmes on biomechanical, biomedical orthodox principles delivering foundational sciences and technical skills before undertaking practice placements in the key clinical theme areas. Despite the packed curricula, universities often hear feedback from clinicians and practice based educators who lament the lack of focus in their own specialist area. How should universities respond?\nThe Australian Physiotherapy Board and the Physiotherapy Board of New Zealand recently launched a new set of graduating competencies for physiotherapists which, it is claimed, represent a radical shift away from the technical skills of physiotherapy towards to personal qualities of graduates. Traditional divides between musculoskeletal, neurological and cardio-respiratory physiotherapy are de-emphasised. University educators are challenged to replace the focus of curricula which are based on techniques of assessment, diagnosis, rehabilitation and treatment with key competencies of advocacy, managing conflict, empowering, physical and mental health resilience.\nThe tweetchat invite participants to unpack the current focus of pre-registration physiotherapy curricula and to explore how we can support students to develop person-centred, ethical, effective and evidence based practice which is fit for the future.\nQuestions to consider before the chat\n- How important is it that students grasp the basic underpinning sciences of anatomy, physiotherapy and biomechanics before learning other skills/knowledge?\n- Are the traditional themes of musculoskeletal, neurological and cardiorespiratory physiotherapy still appropriate ways of defining contemporary physiotherapy practice?\n- What key skills are most important for contemporary physiotherapy practice?\n- What, if anything, is currently missing from pre-registration physiotherapy curricula ‚Äì and of course what may need to be added?\nPre chat resources\n- Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, 2013. Physiotherapy Framework\n- Blog post from the Critical Physio on ‚ÄòRadical new graduating competencies\n- Australia and New Zealand Physiotherapy Practice Thresholds\nChat host biography\nThe physiotherapy programme team at QMU currently comprises 13 lecturers and 2 assistant lecturers. We have a long and successful tradition of physiotherapy education since the first physiotherapy diploma students commenced in 1977. We introduced an undergraduate honours degree programme in 1993 and in 2000 one of the first MSc pre-registration Physiotherapy programmes in the UK began.

{"question":"What is the relationship between angle of attack and stalls in aircraft, and how can volcanic ash affect an airplane's stall behavior?","answer":"An airplane stalls when it exceeds its critical angle of attack (AOA), which is the angular difference between where the airplane is pointing and where it is going. The critical AOA is typically around 16-18 degrees, and when exceeded, the airflow over the wing separates causing a stall. This is independent of airspeed - an airplane can stall at any speed if it exceeds the critical AOA. Regarding volcanic ash's effects, it can significantly impact stall behavior because it contains highly abrasive particles that damage forward-facing surfaces and engine components. The ash particles can melt in the engine's high temperatures, stick to turbine vanes, and disturb the flow of high-pressure combustion gases, which can lead to engine stall. Additionally, dense ash deposits can clog bleed system filters, potentially causing total bleed loss and loss of cabin pressurization.","context":["Eye of Experience #12:\nUnderstanding the Stall\nStall entry and recovery is one of the most discussed √≥ and cussed √≥ portions of a flight training syllabus. Yet, AVweb's Howard Fried believes that stalls remain one of the most misunderstood aspects of safe and knowledgeable flying. His dissection of stalls, spin entry and maneuvering speed in this Eye of Experience is a must-read for students, instructors and grizzled veterans alike.\nF light schools and flight instructors are doing it all wrong. We are teaching our students how to make a stall and recover from it when what we should be teaching is stall recognition. Ask 100 pilots what makes an airplane stall and at least 70 of them will tell you it got too slow. The majority of the remainder will tell you that the nose was pitched up too high. And a very few will say the airflow over the wing separated, so the wing quit flying and an aerodynamic stall resulted. Possibly one, or even two, will give you the correct answer. An airplane stalls for one reason and one reason only. It has exceeded its critical angle of attack (AOA), period. That√≠s all she wrote. Exceed that angle and the airplane will stall. Don√≠t exceed it and it can√≠t stall. Very few pilots, and this includes air carrier airplane drivers as well as general aviation people, really understand AOA, what it really is, and how it is affected by airplane configuration.\nA picture is worth a thousand words.\nReduced to its simplest terms, the AOA is the angular difference between where the airplane is pointing and where it is going. An angle, any angle, is formed by the intersection of two lines and the two lines that form the AOA are the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC)* of the wing and the relative wind. Normally, wind is thought of as air in motion, but in this case, it is the motion of the airplane through the air that creates what we call \"relative wind.\" The AOA at which any given airplane will stall is a built-in, fixed number (usually around 16 to 18 degrees) and when that number is exceeded, the airflow over the wing separates and the stall occurs. This concept of gearing our thinking to AOA seems to be particularly difficult to get across to students, perhaps because we can√≠t see the two lines that form the angle of attack.\nWhere pilots, particularly student pilots, are being misled is in the fact that airplane manuals publish \"stall speeds.\" Somehow the pilot gets it in his or her head that as long as the airplane is above that speed, then it won√≠t stall. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The airplane can and will stall when going faster than the published stalling speed, a great deal faster. This is why \"accelerated maneuver\" stalls are demonstrated and practiced during training. Even so, what many pilots fail to realize, occasionally with rather severe consequences, is that the published stalling speed is valid only under a very narrowly-prescribed set of circumstances, including configuration, weight, airplane attitude and others. The only effect that speed has on the stall is in the fact that at a reduced speed a high angle of attack results. I do wish, therefore, that those involved in aviation education would quit teaching stalls as being related to speed. This approach seems to firmly plant in the student√≠s head the idea that if he/she just keeps the airplane going above the published stalling speed, it simply will not stall, when, of course, it can and will. I believe that more emphasis should be placed on the so-called \"accelerated maneuver\" stall, although this has more to do with weight than speed.\nCorporate jets and air carrier airplanes have angle of attack indicators, but we in general aviation have to struggle along without them. Although the trigger for the stall warning device is really a sort of angle of attack indicator, we still relate the stall to the factor of speed. I do wish the general aviation fleet was equipped with AOA indicators. They√≠re cheap, simple, and they give us really useful information. If our airplanes were so equipped, it would be a lot easier to teach our students to think of AOA rather than speed as being related to stalls.\nEven less understood by many pilots is the effect of power on AOA. If an airplane√≠s pitch attitude does not change, an increase in power will always result in a reduction in the angle of attack. Think about this for a moment. The best way to visualize AOA is to think in terms of the relative wind striking the bottom of the wing rather than crawling over the top of the wing. Visualize yourself on final approach maintaining a level attitude with reduced power and the airplane is descending. The relative wind is striking the bottom of the wing at a fairly high angle. Now, without changing the pitch attitude of the airplane, add power. What happens? You are now driving the airplane straight ahead, no longer descending, the relative wind has aligned itself with the direction of flight and you have zeroed out the angle of attack.\n\"It is a lot easier and more practical to think of the relative wind striking the bottom of the wing rather than crawling over the top of the wing.\"\nNow try this: In level flight, at a nice, safe altitude, reduce the power. The airplane will tend to pitch down, but don√≠t let it do this. With the application of up elevator, maintain level flight. The airplane will slow down and will ultimately stall (the angle of attack has gone beyond the critical point). When the stall occurs, the airplane will want to pitch down. Do not permit it to do this. Hold the same attitude with elevator pressure. Add power. The airplane will want to pitch up. Again do not permit it to do this. Hold the same attitude with elevator pressure. What do you think will happen? The airplane will recover from the stall without ever lowering the nose! Don√≠t get me wrong. I√≠m not advocating this as the way to recover from an inadvertent stall, but merely using it as a means of demonstrating the effect of power on angle of attack. To recover from a stall you still want to lower the nose, keep the wings level, and add all available power.\nTo paraphrase Gertrude Stein, a stall is a stall, is a stall. Anytime the critical AOA is exceeded the airplane will stall; don√≠t exceed that critical AOA and it can√≠t stall. However, over the years, we have put a bunch of fancy names on the stall series for training purposes, all of which are really meaningless if we can get our students to think in terms of angle of attack. It is a lot easier and more practical to think of the relative wind striking the bottom of the wing rather than crawling over the top of the wing. When I was trained, we had what we called the approach to a stall, now known as the imminent stall. We had the stall out of a climbing turn, which we call today the takeoff-and-departure stall, and the stall out of a gliding turn which today is called the approach-to-landing stall. Back then, the accelerated maneuver stall was called a loaded-up stall or a high-speed stall. The bottom line is still, anytime the critical angle of attack is exceeded, the airplane will stall.\nRarely taught anymore, but extremely useful, is the \"delayed recovery\" stall. It is accomplished like this: At a good, safe altitude and after carefully clearing the area to determine that there is no traffic around, the power is reduced and the pitch increased until the airplane stalls. The stick (or yoke) is held fully back against the stop. When the stall break occurs, the wings must be kept level, and the nose pointed straight with the rudder. The airplane will pitch down, recover itself, pitch down and recover itself all the way to the ground (if permitted). This exercise is a great confidence builder.\nIt is not marked on the airspeed indicator (although it may be placarded on the panel) but one of the most important speeds for the pilot to know and be aware of at all times is maneuvering speed (Va). The definition of maneuvering speed is the fastest speed at which an abrupt full control deflection will not engender structural damage. By \"abrupt control deflection\" is meant all the controls, but it is the elevator on which the emphasis is placed. Visualize this situation: You are charging through the air above Va and you suddenly reach out and give the stick (or yoke) a hard yank, right to the stop. What happens? The airplane will attempt to stand on its tail and go straight up. But the forward momentum, opposing the attempt to go vertical, will exert so much force that the wings will bend or break. And we all know that airplanes don√≠t fly very well when the wings fall off!\nNow let's cruise along at or below maneuvering speed. Again, brutally haul back on the yoke (or stick) right to the stop. What happens this time? The airplane will zoom up until it runs out of poop and then stall. In other words, maneuvering speed (or below) is the speed at which an airplane will stall before it bends or breaks. What would you rather do, recover from a stall, or try to fly an airplane from which the wings have just departed? Simple question, simple answer.\nI knew an old instructor who taught maneuvering speed by comparing it to an automobile driving down a road and encountering a rough railroad track crossing the road. If the driver fails to slow down, he/she might very well damage the car as it bounces over the tracks. But if the car is slowed to a moderate speed before crossing the rough tracks, it will ride right over them taking the bumps in stride. This is why we instantly go to maneuvering speed when we encounter rough air. In heavy chop with vertical gusts, the air can be striking the underside of the wing with considerable force. If this happens while the airplane is progressing at a very high speed (above maneuvering speed), this force could bend or break the wings. However, if such an updraft is encountered at or below Va, the airplane will have exceeded its critical AOA and stall instead of bending or breaking. In this case, the stall is so brief, so transitory, that recovery technique is not required. If you have ever been flying along in light to moderate turbulence in an airplane with an aural stall warning device, you have heard it occasionally going beep, beep, beep What it is telling you is that the relative wind has momentarily struck the bottom of the wing at an angle above the critical AOA. Did you apply recovery technique? No. It wasn√≠t necessary because the airplane flew right out before a stall could fully develop.\nFor an airplane to spin, two elements must be present: a) it must be stalled and, b) a yaw moment must be introduced. It follows, therefore, that if an airplane is not permitted to stall, it can√≠t spin. And if we recognize an incipient stall before it happens, we can prevent it from happening, and we have a whole bunch of cues to make us aware of this situation. This brings us back to the angle of attack. If we are constantly aware of the difference between where we√≠re going and where we√≠re pointing, we have a pretty fair grasp of the angle at which the wing is meeting the relative wind.\nAs far as the second element in the formation of the spin is concerned, the yaw is almost invariably the result of misusing the rudder. On a tight turn from base to final, we have increased the load factor on the wing drastically, thus increasing the speed at which the critical angle of attack will be reached. (There we go again, thinking about speed.) Simultaneously, we are holding a lot of back pressure on the elevator control, and if we have not properly coordinated rudder with the bank, we are inviting a disastrous spin, because we are low and close to the ground, with little or no space for recovery. And this is a situation we must seek to avoid at all costs.\nAlthough I do enjoy getting personal email in response to my columns, I do wish that those readers who have comments to make regarding this column would post them in the comments section following the column so that others might share in their input.","A cloud of ash from Iceland‚Äôs erupting volcano has stopped all flights over the UK, Ireland and the Nordic countries on a scale not seen since the 9/11 attacks in 2001.\nBritain‚Äôs Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) said that flights would be grounded from midday and it is unclear when the planes will be safe enough to fly again.\nThe measures have been taken based on guidelines that advise pilots not to fly through an ash cloud because of the serious problems it can cause to the plane‚Äôs engines.\nSheffield University‚Äôs Prof Haydn Thompson explained: ‚ÄòVolcanic ash is very abrasive, which can damage the front-facing parts of the aircraft and that includes the front compressor or fan of the gas turbine engine.\n‚ÄòBut the other problem with ash is that it melts and if you get high temperatures in the combustion sections of the engine it can actually melt and stick to the combustion sections and clog things up.‚Äô\nDr Tim Fox, head of Energy and Environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, added: ‚ÄòModern jet engines are highly technological machines that work by sucking air in through a large fan and using it in a combustion process to generate thrust.\n‚ÄòIf, for example, foreign objects such as the introduction of large amounts of grit or volcanic ash were to be sucked into the air, this would result in serious damage to the fan blades and internal surfaces of the engine. In turn, this would interfere with combustion, ultimately resulting in engine failure.‚Äô\nIn June 1982, a British Airways 747 flight from London to Auckland faced a cloud of ash from Mount Galunggung in Java, Indonesia. The plane‚Äôs four engines failed, however, three reignited and the plane was able to make an emergency landing.\nMore than 80 aircraft are reported to have flown into volcanic ash cloud between 1980 and 2000, with consequences ranging from increased wear of engines to simultaneous power loss in all engines.\nVolcanic ash is made up of highly abrasive particles that may damage aircraft components, particularly forward-facing surfaces of external parts and engine components. They are made of sharp rock fragments that will easily erode plastic, metal and even glass pieces.\nIn-service events show that aircraft may suffer from extensive damage after volcanic ash encounter. In some cases, all the following parts were removed and replaced, after they were sand blasted:\n‚Ä¢ Forward cabin windows\n‚Ä¢ Navigation and landing lights cover\n‚Ä¢ Wing, stabiliser and fin leading edges\n‚Ä¢ Engine nose cowls and thrust reversers\n‚Ä¢ All pitot and static probes\nIngestion of volcanic ash by engines may cause serious deterioration of engine performance due to erosion of moving parts and/or partial or complete blocking of fuel nozzles.\nVolcanic ash contains particles, whose melting point is below engine internal temperature. In flight, these particles will immediately melt if they go through an engine. Going through the turbine, the melted materials are rapidly cooled down, stick on the turbine vanes, and disturb the flow of high-pressure combustion gases.\nThis disorder of the flow may stall the engine, in worst cases.\nVolcanic ash may carry high static charge that makes it difficult to remove from electronic components.\nAsh deposit easily absorbs water and can cause arcing, short circuits and intermittent failures of electronic components.\nDense ash deposit can clog bleed system filters and may lead to total bleed loss, with associated loss of cabin pressurisation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5dc5aa42-8b1f-42b6-b1ac-456aad3db9d3>","<urn:uuid:d778ede8-a270-46a6-843a-8a6edfd50cf2>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Is the final cooling and resting process similar between freshly baked bread and Shrinky Dinks, or are there important differences to consider?","answer":"The cooling processes are quite different. Shrinky Dinks must cool thoroughly before handling to prevent accidental bending, with no specific time given. In contrast, bread requires a more precise resting period of between 20 and 45 minutes after baking for optimal results. Both items need to cool, but bread's resting time is more strictly defined and crucial for the final product.","context":["When you hear the word ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù you probably think of a science lab, factory, or other formal scientific environment. But really, chemistry‚Äîthe study of the what substances are made of and how they interact‚Äîis all around us. If you‚Äôve ever made slime, baked a brownie, or washed your hands with soap, you‚Äôve used chemistry. What does chemistry have to do with art? It is used to make paints and pigments, and it controls the way that different substances interact. That leads us to our STEAM Week art project: Shrinky Dinks!\nWhat is a Shrinky Dink? It‚Äôs a piece of plastic (#6 or polystyrene, to be exact) that you can cut, color, and make into whatever creation you want. You can make jewelry, a bookmark, a keychain, a sun-catcher, a mobile, or whatever you can imagine! When you‚Äôve got your design perfected, you heat the plastic and it shrinks to about 1/3 its original size. The end result is something hard and durable.\nPeople who get really into creating Shrinky-Dinks often use special ‚Äúpaper‚Äù purchased at an arts and craft store. However, you can use materials you may already have around the house! You might see #6 plastic in the clear plastic containers restaurants use for takeout, clear plastic cups, or in old CD jewel cases. Not any old plastic will do, though. Each type of plastic, from #1-7, has its own unique properties.\nWhat you‚Äôll need:\n- polystyrene #6 plastic (limited quantities available with the Teen Crafts Pick-Up 7/16)\n- felt tip/permanent markers, colored pencils, or gloss acrylic craft paint with brush\n- scissors (and maybe a hole-punch, depending on your design)\n- piece of cardboard or parchment paper\n- baking pan\n- a grown-up to help supervise\nStep 1: Get Creative\nUse your markers, colored pencils, or paint to make a design on one side of the plastic. I like using permanent markers, but you should use whatever you (and your adult) are comfortable with. When you‚Äôve finished coloring, cut around the edges of your design to trim off the extra plastic. If you‚Äôre making something that needs a hole, like a necklace or a tasseled bookmark, punch the hole now.\nRemember: Shrinky Dinks really shrink! The finished size of your project will be approximately 1/3 the size it is while you‚Äôre decorating.\nNeed a little design inspiration? We have a printable PDF with some design ideas you can trace.\nStep 2: Get Hot!\nHave your grown-up help you with the oven. Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the cardboard or parchment paper on the baking sheet. Place the Shrinky Dink on the covered baking sheet, decorated side up. Once the oven is at the correct temperature, place the baking sheet inside. (If you have an oven light, be sure to turn it on! You can watch the shrinking happen!)\nThe plastic is going to look like it‚Äôs doing nothing, then it will shrink one one side, then another, until the edges start to curl. Pretty soon the whole thing will curl up tightly, and it may even fall over to one side. This is normal! As the Shrinky Dink continues to bake, the edges will lay back down again.\nThe whole process should take only 1-3 minutes, depending upon the size of your design. After it lays flat again, bake for another 30 seconds or so before you or your grown-up (carefully!) remove it from the oven.\nUse the cardboard or parchment paper to lift the shrunken Shrinky Dink off of the baking pan. Allow it to cool thoroughly before handling‚Äîif you pick up a Shrinky Dink too soon, you can accidentally bend it.\nStep 3: Finishing Touches\nDepending upon your design you could be all finished after Step 2. If you punched a hole in your design to thread a string through, now‚Äôs the time to do it! If you have rough edges that you‚Äôd like to be rid of, you can gently sand your creation (I like using a nail file). You can glue things to your Shrinky Dinks, hang them on hooks, string them together in a chain‚Äîyour imagination is the limit!\nTo read more about the science of Shrinky Dinks, check out this article from Smithsonian Magazine.","- What temperature should finished bread be baked at?\n- What is the best temperature to bake white bread?\n- Can I open the oven door when baking bread?\n- How long do you bake bread at 350 degrees?\n- Can you bake bread at 300 degrees?\n- Should bread be baked in the middle of the oven?\n- Can you bake bread at a lower temperature?\n- Should you put water in the oven when baking bread?\n- How many minutes do you bake bread?\n- How long should Bread rest after baking?\n- Why is my bread not rising in the oven?\n- How do I bake bread without burning the top?\nWhat temperature should finished bread be baked at?\nCorrect Bread Temperatures I mentioned earlier that the ideal temperature range for the center of a baking loaf is usually between 180¬∞F and 200¬∞F.\nHowever, 20¬∞F is a large range (and not even a definitive one); depending on your type of dough and the consistency you prefer, you can adjust the temperature accordingly..\nWhat is the best temperature to bake white bread?\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.\nCan I open the oven door when baking bread?\nThe heat of the oven transforms the moisture in the bread dough into steam causing the bread to rise rapidly. The yeast in the dough continues to produce carbon dioxide gas, contributing to the rising action of the baking bread. ‚Ä¶ The oven door should not be opened before this stage is completed.\nHow long do you bake bread at 350 degrees?\nAllrecipes says: * Most bread is baked in a moderate oven, 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Baking time depends on a lot of factors: loaf size.\nCan you bake bread at 300 degrees?\nShe baked bread loaves at 300 degrees for almost exactly 45 minutes. ‚Ä¶ Immediately, invert bread loaves onto wire racks. They should come out of the pans easily if you have greased and floured them ahead of time.\nShould bread be baked in the middle of the oven?\nBottom rack: The oven‚Äôs heating element is on the bottom, so if you want to brown the underside of a dish (like pizza, bread, or a pie), move the rack to its lowest position, because it‚Äôll be closest to the source of heat. Middle rack: Generally, this is the safe spot for making sure food is cooked evenly.\nCan you bake bread at a lower temperature?\nBut low temperature cooking is also very useful in baking bread. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs possible to bake bread at home in 30-45 minutes at higher temperatures. However, by lowering the temperature and adding an hour or two, you can bake bread that is not only tastier, but also much better for you.\nShould you put water in the oven when baking bread?\nWhen you put your bread in, pour about a half cup of water onto the sheet pan. You have to do this without pulling the rack out because you want the steam to stay in the oven, so be careful. Using a spray bottle, spritz the sides of your oven with water a few times and close the door.\nHow many minutes do you bake bread?\nloaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Bake at 375¬∞ until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal temperature of 200¬∞, 30-35 minutes.\nHow long should Bread rest after baking?\nbetween 20 and 45 minutesLet the bread rest between 20 and 45 minutes, depending on if your will is of bronze or of iron. If you can make it 45 minutes, you should have about as lovely of a loaf of bread as you can bake.\nWhy is my bread not rising in the oven?\n2 Answers. Oven spring is caused by the air pockets in the dough expanding from the heat. ‚Ä¶ After the shaping and final rise, often times there is a light, dry ‚Äúskin‚Äù over the dough. By slashing a dough before it goes into the oven, you break this skin, and the bread is able to expand.\nHow do I bake bread without burning the top?\nElectric, gas, and convection ovens all have their own idiosyncrasies that affect everything from what pan to use to how to adjust the timing. And don‚Äôt underestimate the use of foil. A simple strategy is to use a sheet of foil to lightly cover the tops of your rolls if they begin to over-brown."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f7f3232f-ba14-48ba-bab3-fa6a1add360b>","<urn:uuid:854ba6dd-f32f-4d51-9ca5-f567a382df39>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should I dry mes v√™tements en coton, and what happens if wool gets both warm and wet?","answer":"Cotton clothing should not be dried at too high temperatures as they might shrink. It's better to remove cotton items from the dryer before they are completely dry for easier ironing.

{"question":"How do the response times of PTCs compare to circuit breakers when dealing with overcurrent protection?","answer":"PTCs (Positive Temperature Coefficient thermistors) have a response speed similar to time-delay fuses. In contrast, circuit breakers exhibit mechanical operating times that can vary based on several factors including ambient temperature, control voltage, and drive mechanism force. Circuit breakers typically aim for a scatter (variation in operating times) of less than ¬±1ms, where 99.8% of operating times will fit within this range.","context":["Introduction to controlled switching system in the grid:\nControlled Switching Systems (CSS) for circuit breakers have become an economical solution and are commonly used to reduce switching surges for various switching applications. Recent developments of transformer switching taking account of the residual flux can realize an effective means of mitigating severe inrush currents and temporary overvoltage that may lead to false operation of protective relays and degradation in power quality.\nCSS combined with metal oxide surge arresters can reduce undesirable overvoltage caused by the energization of a long transmission line to meet the insulation coordination. The limited number of applications for line switching may arise from initial difficulties due to insufficient technical considerations including idle time compensation.\nControlled switching system is based on the synchronization of the mechanical operation of the circuit breaker to the power system in order to switch it at the ideal electrical instant that mitigates undesired power system disturbances and stress on the electrical apparatus. Rather than reducing the transients by adding devices such as pre-insertion resistors and/or surge arresters, the Controlled switching principle is based on the optimum electrical switching instant of the load.\nCircuit breaker mechanical characteristics and dielectric behaviour in Controlled switching systems(CSS):\nThe performance of a controlled switching scheme depends greatly on the consistency of the circuit breaker mechanical characteristics and dielectric behaviour. Also, the ability of the Controlled Switching Device (CSD) to accurately predict the behaviour of the circuit breaker during its lifetime is an important factor.\nDesirable characteristics of a circuit breaker for use in controlled switching applications are:\n- consistent operating (Open/Close) time with mechanical reliability.\n- Excellent dielectric properties i.e. a steep RDDS/RRDS Slope.\nThe circuit breaker is a rather complex and bulky mechanical device. Fortunately, its behaviour based on its operating conditions is quite predictable. Knowledge of a CB‚Äôs electrical performance and network electrical operating condition is also of the utmost importance for an optimum CSS. These considerations are a key factor to the success of this mitigation technique to make the arc appear or disappear between the circuit breaker main contacts only by sending the CB mechanical command order at the right timing, taking as a reference the network voltage or load current.\nMechanical operation characteristics of circuit breakers :\nA practical circuit breaker exhibits some variation of its operating times. Since these variations may be relevant for the operating conditions, different approaches for corrections are used since they differ considerably for different types of circuit breakers.\nFirst, it is important to distinguish between predictable and purely statistical changes in operating times since any changes in operating times that can be predicted with sufficient accuracy by the controller do not reduce the effectiveness of controlled switching.\nThe operating time (??????????) of a circuit breaker can be expressed as:\n?????????? = ???????? + ‚àÜ???????? + ‚àÜ??????????\n‚àÜ???????? = ‚àÜ????? + ‚àÜ??????\nT operating: Operating time predicted by the controller before emitting the command\nT nominal: Mean operating time under nominal operating conditions which are readily measured and programmed into the controller.\nŒîTpredict: Predictable variation of the operating time (in relation with T nominal) that can be corrected by the controller\nŒîTstatistic: Purely statistical variation of the operating time that cannot be corrected by the controller\nŒîTcomp: The variation of the operating time with predetermined features, those depending on the operating conditions\nŒîTdrift: The variations of the operating time with adaptive features, such as long term drift and wear-related changes\nThe predictable variations of the operating times (ŒîTpredict) can be further split into those variations for which predetermined compensation can be applied (ŒîTcomp) and those which can be dealt with adaptive features (ŒîTdrift).\nThe following are the main influencing factors that can be compensated:\n* Ambient Temperature: Temperature can influence the open/close coil resistance. Also with temperature variation, the viscosity of lubricants changes resulting in friction between sliding or moving parts in the circuit breaker mechanism.\n* DC Operating Voltage: Opening and closing coil control voltage affect the operating characteristic of the plunger which releases the spring mechanism.\n*Idle Time: This is the amount of time the circuit breaker mechanism has been left idle between operations. This can differ significantly between circuit breaker operating mechanisms. Spring mechanisms have a more consistent operating time typically +/- 1ms while hydraulic mechanisms can deviate above 2ms depending on the idle time.\nInfluence of operating conditions on CB mechanical switching times :\nThe variations related to predetermined compensation (ŒîTcomp) are readily measured by appropriate sensors and transducers in the field which result in defined changes of the operating times that can be compensated for. Typical parameters such as control voltage (V control), stored energy of the drive (e.g. hydraulic pressure, Edrive) and ambient temperature (T temp) are often compensated by the controller.\nThe operating time used by the controller on any given occasion is adjusted, on the basis of the sensor inputs, according to a known set of operating characteristics, which has been determined under well-defined operating conditions during the testing for each circuit breaker type.\n‚àÜTcomp = f(Vcontrol, Edrive, Ttemp)\nThe example shown in Figure 1 illustrates typical variations of the mechanical opening and closing times of a CB with a hydraulic drive according to three independent operating conditions: temperature, voltage and hydraulic pressure.\nFigure1: typical variations of the mechanical opening and closing times of a CB((photo from CIGRE 757 brochure)\nGenerally, the lower the ambient operating temperature, coil voltage or drive mechanism force, the slower is the CB operation time. These characteristics are generally published by CB manufacturers who perform type tests at the factory on a single CB pole.\nEach circuit breaker model and technology behaves differently and has normally a different ‚Äúmesh map‚Äù figure that should be evaluated according to IEC relevant publications. For some types of CBs, modelling is simplified because they are influenced by a smaller number of conditions. This is the case for most currently available spring-type CBs, which are mainly influenced by the ambient temperature and operating voltage.\nIdle time influence on CB mechanical switching times:\nThe idle-time dependence of the drive is another factor that can influence the mechanical switching time of each CB operation. It is one of the major causes of target missing for CBs that exhibit large variation for idle time and where the CSS has no idle time compensation function.\nThis CB characteristic, which is different for the opening and for the closing operation, makes more difficult the extraction of the contribution of each operating condition factor during a timing measurement, especially for some CBs with hydraulic operating mechanisms. A timing deviation estimation method has to be developed for factory and/or field measurement to extract the contribution of each variable.\nCB mechanical timing scatter:\nConsistently repeatable performance of the circuit breaker in relation to open/close times along with excellent voltage withstand properties are of upmost importance when used in conjunction with a control switching device (CSD).\nOperational times probably won‚Äôt always be the same as there are a number of external influencing factors such as ambient temperature, control voltage level, idle time of the circuit breaker mechanism as well as the operating mechanism technology that can affect repeatable operation times.\nStatistical scatter of the operating time presents an inherent limitation to the use of controlled switching.\nIt is best described by a standard deviation (œÉmech) and can be assessed by performing operations under operating conditions identical to those experienced in the field. The maximum scatter may be approximated by ŒîTstatistic = 3œÉmech.\nSome inherent statistical scatter of the operating times will occur even at identical operating parameters and ambient conditions.\nEven though the operating conditions and the idle time are the same, a real CB will not behave exactly the same from one operation to the other: the mechanical operating time will vary slightly. These small variations are normally compiled under a Gaussian distribution curve from which a circuit breaker characteristic could be extracted: the CB scatter. This characteristic is design-dependent and different for the opening and for the closing operations.\nIn probability theory and statistics, ‚Äúvariance‚Äù (dispersion or scatter) is a measure of how far a set of numbers are spread out. A small variance indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean (expected value) and hence to each other, while a high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around the mean and from each other. An equivalent measure is the square root of the variance, called the standard deviation (œÉ). The standard deviation has the same dimension as the data and hence is comparable to deviations from the mean.\nFigure 2: circuit breaker scatter curve (photo from CIGRE 757 brochure)\nWhen selecting a CB for a controlled switching application, the CB scatter should be lower than a specified value of ‚Äú3œÉ‚Äù where the majority of operating times will fit (99.8%) as shown in Figure 2.\nA typical value of the CB scatter to specify for a CS application is less than ¬±1ms.","Protecting against overcurrent incidents\nWhen it comes to overcurrent protection ofelectronic equipment, fuses have long been the standard solution.They come in a wide variety of ratings and mounting styles to fitvirtually any application.\nWhen they open, they completely stop the flow ofelectricity, which may be the desired reaction. The equipment orcircuit is rendered inoperable, which draws the user‚Äôsattention to what may have caused the overload condition so thatcorrective action can be taken.\nNevertheless, there are circumstances andcircuits where autorecovery from a temporary overload without userintervention is desirable. Positive temperature coefficient (PTC)thermistors ‚Äî also called resettable fuses or polymericpositive temperature coefficient devices (PPTCs) ‚Äî are anexcellent way of achieving this type of protection.\nHow a PTC works\nA PTC consists of a piece of polymer materialloaded with conductive particles (usually carbon black). At roomtemperature the polymer is in a semicrystalline state and theconductive particles touch each other, forming multiple conductivepaths and providing low resistance (generally about twice that of afuse of the same rating).\nWhen current passes through the PTC itdissipates power (P = I2R) andits temperature increases. As long as the current is less than itsrated hold current (Ihold), thePTC will remain in a low-resistance state and the circuit willoperate normally.\nWhen the current exceeds the rated trip current(Itrip), the PTC heats upsuddenly. The polymer changes to an amorphous state and expands,breaking the connections between the conductive particles.\nThis causes the resistance to increase rapidlyby several orders of magnitude and reduces the current to a low(leakage) value just sufficient to keep the PTC in thehigh-resistance state ‚Äî generally from around tens toseveral hundred milliamps at rated voltage (Vmax). When the power is shut off thedevice cools down and returns to its low-resistance state.\nPTC and fuse parameters\nLike a fuse, a PTC is rated for the maximumshort-circuit current (Imax) itcan interrupt at rated voltage. Imax for a typical PTC is 40 A, and mayreach 100 A. Interrupt ratings for fuses of the sizes that may beused in the sorts of applications we are considering here can rangefrom 35 to 10,000 A at rated voltage.\nThe voltage rating for a PTC is limited. PTCsfor general use are not rated above 60 V (there are PTCs fortelecom application with 250 and 600 V interrupting voltage, buttheir operating voltage is still 60 V); SMT and small-cartridgefuses are available with ratings from 32 to 250 V or more.\nThe operating current rating for PTCs ranges toabout 9 A, while the maximum level for fuses of the typesconsidered here can exceed 20 A, with some available to 60 A.\nThe useful upper temperature limit for a PTC isgenerally 85C, while the maximum operating temperature forthin-film SMT fuses is 90C, and for small-cartridge fuses is 125C.Both PTCs and fuses require derating for temperatures above 20C,although PTCs are more sensitive to temperature.\nWhen designing in any overcurrent protectivedevice, be sure to consider factors that may affect its operatingtemperature, including the effect on heat removal of leads/traces,any air flow, and proximity to heat sources. The speed of responsefor a PTC is similar to that of a time-delay fuse.\nCommon PTC applications\nMuch of the design work for personal computersand peripheral devices is strongly influenced by the Microsoft andIntel System Design Guide which states that ‚ÄúUsing a fusethat must be replaced each time an overcurrent condition occurs isunacceptable.‚Äù And, the SCSI Standard for this largemarket includes a statement that ‚Äú....a positivetemperature coefficient device must be used instead of a fuse, tolimit the maximum amount of current sourced.‚Äù\nPTCs are used to provide secondary overcurrentprotection for telephone central office equipment, customerpremises equipment, alarm systems, set-top boxes, VOIP equipment,and subscriber line interface circuits. They provide primaryprotection for battery packs, battery chargers, automotive doorlocks, USB ports, loudspeakers, and PoE.\nSCSI plug-and-play applications that benefitfrom PTCs include the motherboard and the many peripherals that canbe frequently connected to and disconnected from the computerports. The mouse, keyboard, printer, modem, and monitor portsrepresent opportunities for misconnections, and connections offaulty units or damaged cable. The ability to reset aftercorrection of the fault is particularly attractive.\nA PTC can protect disk drives from thepotentially damaging overcurrents resulting from excessive currentfrom a power supply malfunction. PTCs can protect power suppliesagainst overloading; individual PTCs can be placed in the outputcircuits to protect each load where there are multiple loads orcircuits.\nMotor overcurrents can produce excessive heatthat may damage the winding insulation and for small motors mayeven cause a failure of the very small diameter wire windings. ThePTC will generally not trip under normal motor start up currents,but will act to prevent a sustained overload from causingdamage.\nTransformers can be damaged by overcurrentscaused by circuit faults, and the current limiting function of aPTC can provide protection. The PTC is located on the load side ofthe transformer.\nFuse or PTC?\nThe following procedure will help in selectingand applying the correct component. Help is also available fromdevice suppliers. For unbiased advice it‚Äôs wise to lookfor a company that offers both fuse and PTC technology.\n1.

{"question":"Did both John Galliano and Oscar de la Renta have experience working at Christian Dior?","answer":"Yes, both designers had connections to Christian Dior. John Galliano was announced as the designer at Christian Dior in September 1996, creating collections there for many years. Oscar de la Renta, in contrast, had received a job offer from Dior in 1959, but ultimately decided not to take it, choosing instead to work at Lanvin-Castillo.","context":["|In Sept of 1996, Bernard Arnault announced that John Galliano was going to be the new designer at Christian Dior. The fashion world was amazed, he had been at Givenchy just one year and no-one (least of all me), had any inkling that he would be going to Dior, the most prestigious Haute Couture House in the world.\nThe announcement was greeted with praise by some and scepticism by others (quell horreur, an Englishman at the helm of France's most famous fashion house etc.), but as soon as he showed his first collection all realized what a winning combination this could be. John's wild talent combined with Dior's resources resulted in some of the most beautiful and extraordinary fashions of the decade, whilst reviving the name and style of Christian Dior to a new generation worldwide.\nI had been working with Amanda Grieve, the late Steven Robinson, and Bill Gaytten at Givenchy, and was invited to join the team and be the Milliner at Dior. For me it was a dream come true. Walking onto the grey carpet and up the staircase in the Avenue Montaigne, remembering all those famous pictures of Marlene Dietrich, Rita Hayworth, Cocteau and Monsieur Dior himself sitting on those stairs. Continuing up to the Atelier Mode in the attics, where wooden hat blocks dating from the New Look collection of spring '47 were stored in serried ranks. Since then I have made hats for diverse collections; Pr√™t-a-porter, Cruise, pre-collection, Golf, Ski, Surf and not forgetting Baby Dior too. But without question the most important is the Haute Couture where millinery dreams come true. Here I could give my imagination extravagant rein. A two metre hat of paradise feathers? No problem. Taxidermied game? Perfect for Versailles. One hundred hours of embroidery on a minxy beret? Pourquoi pas? I always say that the most beautiful hat can be made from a twist of tissue paper, but how much nicer it is in Kolinsky sable.\nFor me, the design process started about six weeks before the show. There would have frequently been a research trip (Peru, Italy, China etc.), and I would have started to think about a head which might fit with the season. It might be the ethnic hats of the country, but equally the culture, customs or fine arts. Alternatively it might be regional TV programmes or a candy wrapper. The collection is then in its embryonic state and I go to Paris for a meeting with the crew. First of all it's chit-chat and catching up, because great hats are based in friendship and trust, for although on the programme for the show the credit reads; \"Chapeaux cr√©e par Stephen Jones\", they are a group effort. On my return to London I will start my research too. Leafing through my library, trawling the internet, talking to experts and doing interviews, I compose concept boards of different themes divided by silhouette, texture, fabric, inspiration or just millinery frivolities. And sketch. Hundreds of sketches. Sketches that blend all those disparate elements together. After this, I will go to Paris and I'll present my ideas to the team. A collection is always work in progress, so I might be on target or over the weekend the mood of the collection might have changed from 19th century African to techno/literary. However we select toiles to be made and a few days later show maybe twenty possible silhouettes. At the same time I am researching materials and trims. One of the joys of working in Paris are the artisans with which I work. Monsieur R√© who sculpts the wooden blocks on which we mould fabrics, Monsieur Carel who is a carcassier and constructs wire filigree shapes which can exist as their own delicate tracery or form the superstructure of a hat. Atelier Veroliv who with computer-like accuracy work in resins and plastics, Cherie Bibi who stretch felts and cottons and Joscar who are wizards with organza and tulle. This work is co-ordinated from my workroom by my premiere Silvana which is where the hats are assembled and trimmed.\nOver the weeks leading to the collection I am in fittings, changing crown heights and tweaking brims. Especially important and unique to the design process is the day of 'Dressing Up', where the silhouette and overall look of the collection is confirmed. About ten days before the show I have a very early morning meeting when we finally decide on the hats, fabrics and trims. Crazily enough this time also coincides with the showing of the mid-season Dior Pr√™t-a-porter collection, men's shows; the days blur into one. Two days before the show the model girls arrive in Paris from all over the world. We all rush to get the hats ready for the fitting which is decided by when her dress will be ready. By this time I am working on autopilot with total concentration. Each girl is pinned into her outfit by the premier of the workroom responsible, then shoes. Jewellery and furs are added. Last of all it is my turn, and I pin on the hat or headdress and try various angles and adjust veiling flowers and feathers. The hat becomes totally different when it is worn and I must fit it to the personality of girls outfit. Then she sweeps into the main studio dressed for approval. If all goes well the hat can then be finished but often things need to be re-worked or re-trimmed up until the very last second before she takes her place on the haute couture runway...\nAfter John's sad departure from Dior the talented Bill Gaytten was brought forward from the ranks to be the creative director. I had worked side by side with Bill since '93 when I first encountered him throwing a glass of red wine on white satin to find the exact colour of pink. His architectural taste and respect for Monsieur Dior was a hit with the clients and sales soared.\nHowever Bill's tenure was only ever temporary and on the 11th of April 2012 it was announced after much speculation that Raf Simons would become the creative director of Dior. I was thrilled as we had known each other for a long time and had recently collaborated at Jil Sander in Milan. His modernist aesthetic captured the fashion world, desperate for something new and exciting. A new era was upon me of veils, bonnets and even scarves!\nExtravagant shapes; the essence of haute couture.\n1) For John's first Haute Couture show in the Grand Hotel, Shalom Harlow models an exclamation mark of lily of the valley, Monsieur Dior's favorite flower, but brought up to date in lacquer red.\n2) This wooden trilby incorporating Congolese figures was sculpted by Monsieur R√©, Dior's blockmaker, from a single piece of samba wood.\n3) Extravagant pr√™t a porter too repeating the Haute Couture shape, a trilby fashioned from hair and antique lacquer combs.\n4) This fabulous picture in French Vogue by Helmut Newton sums up the heady eroticism of the Bagatelle show.\n5) She's in Paradise.\nRomantic sweeping shapes, hats that are lyrical and beautiful.\n1) A huge painterly straw perched on the head of a lovely in the Opera show. Vaporous 'tulle maline' from the '30's softens the silhouette.\n2) Carmen Kass in pr√™t-a-porter. Just. A similar silhouette but in glass beads.\n3) Vintage paradise feathers and Beatonesque flowers from the flea market coif Ayako.\n4) John and girls in front of the Diorent Express. Tudor gaufr√© velvet in voluminous berets in 40 degrees!\n5) At the same show Naomi bagged this native American headdress of eagle feathers and Lesage embroidery.\nSmaller more funky, the new couture.\n1) Erin in a surrealist jacket and geometric trilby. When Celine Dion wore this to the Oscars she was ridiculed!\n2) An amazingly simple Chairman Mao cap, in this evocative drawing by Gladys Pereint Palmer.\n3) This was the start of the new couture, both in cut and attitude.\n4) Big trouble at Versailles. At this innovative show I made hats out of vintage taxidermied animals. Anti-fur groups in the UK were not happy, but I thought the animals and birds looked beautiful.\n5) The debut of Dior commercial hats too. Mr. Galliano's flat cap worn by Michele Hicks.\nWild & artistic.\n1) Volumes get bigger in this deconstructed hand painted top hat.\n2) The jockeys and I. Jockey caps mixed with 17th century fontages in '30's fabrics and military detailing. Phew!\n3 & 4) The most beautiful of shows. The Freud collection was shown on different characters. In mauve straw, flowers and tulle, is 76 year old supermodel Carmen Dell'Orifice.\n5) Bling! Love those initials, this time in pav√© rhinestones.\nPop Bang Whizzzz. Crazy Colour.\n1) J'adore that Haute Couture plastic Rainmate!!!\n2) Fairy light haloes. Why not?\n4) Made the mask too.\n5) Inspired by Thai hill tribe headdresses, but worn with Japanese doll outfits, this hat was snapped backstage by Martin Parr and later by Patrick Demarchelier for American Vogue using a naked Ben Stiller as a model!\nThe most fabulous textures.\nSilk petals, yak fur, pheasant feathers, metal quills and uncarded wool for the most photographed hat of the year. It referenced a Peruvian helmet but John & I couldn't stop and just carried on knitting!\nHeadlights and headlines.\nWhat is it about doing something twice that makes it ten times as good?\n1) Giant cotton daisies at the Chinese Haute Couture show.\n2) Flippy fake fringe in black plastic. Suzy Menkes said of this show, \"sometimes going to a Dior show is like surfing the internet too quickly\"!\n3) Giant Toulouse Lautrec horns of feathers with wild make-up by Pat McGrath for the Dance fashion show.\n4) Rubber sweet peas anyone? Again with Pat's genius make-up.\n5) The first ski collection for Dior. Glam X 2.\nThe wildest extravagances; haute haute haute.\n1) Woof! The most over the top show ever, The Egyptian. Here a resin and gold leaf Anubis is clad in turquoise crocodile and a Lesage collar.\n2) An Egyptian Ra headdress in metal, made by Monsieur Carel my fabulous carcassier.\n3) Also in metal and pearls this Crown from the Queen's winter Haute Couture. It was so expensive to make, it might have as well been real!\n4) By now a classic Dior silhouette. A giant Russian Chapka in silver fox on Brazilian babe Gisele.\n5) Ghettofabulous. Fur but now in print. From a mid season collection, gold dice trim a '50's leopard print trilby.\nA year of soft silhouettes. Velvet, felt, shearling and feathers.\n1) In a Renaissance velvet beret, Malgosia looks picture perfect.\n2) Riley Presley in a simple upturned felt.\n3) Stella Tennant as the ghost of Dior's mother.\n4 & 5) Pr√™t-a-porter hats have a simpler aesthetic but no less attitude.\nMoodswings. Did you really think it would be predictable?\n1) This show was based on the writings of the Marquis de Sade. Can't you tell?\n2) A simple cap repeats the detailing of the It bag the 'Gaucho'.\n3) Baby Dior. A cute denim cap with fluo orange detailing.\n4) Superstar. Cate wears the armor that John asked me to make (that almost killed me) and a fabulous glass crown of seahorses decorating a Rococo grotto.\n5) Love that lobster. Move over Salvador, this is much more chic.\nMore hats than ever. Beautiful fantasies.\n1) From the staggering Madame Butterfly show this bundle of resin origami with a gilded Japanese knot is effortlessly worn by Raquel Zimmerman. Pat's make-up is wild!\n2) Dior's 60th anniversary show was staged in Versailles. Michaela looked simply ravishing as Picasso's Rose Period Harlequin.\n3) My fave silhouette in homage to artist R√©n√© Gruau who illustrated many of Dior's iconic perfume advertisements of the 50's. A palette in grey suede is pierced with a lacquer brush with the initials CD/JG/SJ. Its paint daubs are in fact deluxe paillette embroidery by Cecile Henri.\n4) Pr√™t-a-porter but superglam. From the 40's inspired winter show, a wartime turban in black raffia.\n5) A nod from the cruise collection to Spring 2008. Tart lemon straw sweetened with silver sugar bead embroidery.

But Thursday night, the Dominican-born designer divulged his thoughts, dreams and fears at New York City's 92Y \"Fashion Talks\" series, just days after winning the CFDA Founder's Award on Monday.\nModerated by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Executive Director Fern Mallis, 80-year-old de la Renta opened up about his battle with cancer, his true feelings for Michelle Obama, the future of his business and rumors of retirement, John Galliano, his childhood, and of course, life in general.\nWith his charming smile and debonair nature ‚Äì or as Mallis described him as \"'the sultan of suave' ‚Ä¶ he is after all Latin and will charm us\" ‚Äì the designer took the audience down memory lane from the beginning of his fruitful career spanning more than half a century to his thoughts on his brand, which was created in 1967, and designers today. These were some of the topics that had the audience at the Y in thralll:\nHis first ‚Äúbusiness:‚Äù\n\"My first client was my mother. But what I sold her was the corn and spinach that we grew in our garden.\"\nSpeaking of food ‚Ä¶\n\"I used to cook. I like to get involved. My wife [Annette], of course, never eats. If I didn't get involved, I wouldn't eat at all.\"\nOn his father‚Äôs wishes for his only son of seven children:\n\"My father had different aspirations for me than I had for myself. As the only boy in the family ‚Ä¶ If I ever told my father I would become a fashion designer, he would drop dead on the spot.\"\nHis mother‚Äôs support for him to study in Spain at age 18 in 1951, just before she died:\n\"My mother said, 'I will always back you.‚Äô A lot of what I am is because of my mother. To go to Paris was unthinkable. My mother really twisted my father's arm for letting me go to Spain because I'd never see her again. That is a sacrifice.‚Äù\nWhat he told his parents as a young boy:\n\"Please, please, please buy me a man's suit.\"\nTasks at his first job training under Crist√≥bal Balenciaga in Spain in 1957:\n\"You ask me what I was doing? I was picking pins off the floor.\"\nHis first job offers in Paris at Dior and Lanvin in 1959:\n‚ÄúI'm in Paris less than 24 hours and I was offered a job. I was so excited I was going to get a job.‚Äù [Then Lanvin came knocking ‚Ä¶ ] ‚ÄúI have a job at Dior. I already accepted another job. Mr. [Antonio del] Castillo said, 'How much are they paying you?‚Äô I‚Äôd been in New York for less than one week and now I had offers for two jobs.\"\n[Editor‚Äôs note: He ended up taking the gig at Lanvin-Castillo in 1961.]\nHow he lied his way into getting a job at Elizabeth Arden in 1962:\n\"I said, ‚ÄòIt was not my best work.‚Äô I had been working on my book for a month.\"\nOn lying in general:\n\"I never tell lies because you have to cover a big lie with a little lie. Of course, I lied then.\"\nWhen former Vogue editor-in-chief, Diana Vreeland, told him to ditch Dior for Arden:\n‚Äú[She said] ‚ÄòIf you go to Dior you will be working behind a big name. It will be hard to make a name for yourself.‚Äô‚Äù\nHow he became successful after his deal with Jane Derby in 1965:\n\"I had become a little smarter then. My name has to be on the label and my name has to be bigger than the name on the label. In six months, the label was changed to just 'Oscar de la Renta.'\"\nWhat he feels about New York then and now:\n\"I felt the future of fashion was changing. Ready-to-wear was becoming the future of fashion. ‚Ä¶ There were things happening in New York that were very important. There are many opportunities here. I feel that New York today is no doubt the fashion capital of the world.‚Äù\nWhy the Americans were victorious in infamous ‚Äúfashion showdown‚Äù in Versailles in 1973 against Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Cardin and Emanuel Ungaro:\n‚ÄúOur show was bound to be a disaster. The show was fun, but we [Anne Klein, Stephen Burrows, Bill Blass, Halston and de la Renta, which was the order he insisted upon] were so unbelievably unprepared. We only had Liza Minelli. One thing happened: They had never seen, in Paris, black models. They had never seen girls moving to music. By the end, everyone was standing. It was sheer luck.\"\nHis feelings on the America vs. Paris debate now:\n‚ÄúIt's quite extraordinary how the roads have reversed. We went to France to learn the trade, now France comes to America to get the talent.\"\nOn current designers Alber Ebaz of Lanvin, Raf Simons of Dior and Alexander Wang at Balenciaga, three of the brands for which he worked:\n\"All three of them are such great designers. Alber is doing an extraordinary job at Lanvin. Really, very talented. Raf, I have never met really. Alexander Wang I think is extraordinary talented.\"\nOn John Galliano, the ousted former designer of Dior who joined his atelier for the Fall 2013 season:\n\"John came to me because he wanted to re-enter the business. We are not going to talk about John‚Äôs problems because John's problems are his problems, not my problems. John is a very talented guy. I was asked if I would have John into my studio so he can re-immerse into a world that he knew. We had a wonderful time. It‚Äôs important to have someone who challenges you. 75 percent of the collection was done by the time he got there. I strongly feel, regardless what he did, everyone in life deserves a second chance and I was very happy I was able to give John that second chance. John is making all the public amends that he needs to make. It would be a shame if the industry would be deprived of such talent.‚Äù\nWould he work with Galliano again?\n\"I don't know. I would love to, perhaps.\"\nOn rumors of the selling of the ODLR brand:\n\"The business is not for sale, no question. If somebody comes to us with a huge, big offer, it's for sale. Everything is for sale. But, the business is strong. The business is growing. The business is healthy. The business is going very well.‚Äù\nWhat about an IPO?\n\"A lot of companies are going public. I don't see this is the way we are going to go. We are very happy.‚Äù\nOr a mass collaboration line?\n\"I am not about gimmicks. I'm about dressing a woman who can afford my clothes.\"\nHis much-talked about opinions of Michelle Obama, who has famously never worn de la Renta:\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any strong opinions about Michelle Obama. I think she is a very good-looking lady and it‚Äôs her own right to wear what she wants to wear. Would I like to dress Michelle Obama? I would like to dress everybody. I think I have been critical but ‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs not an elected official. She happens to be the wife of the president. This is the only country where that happens. And this is the only country where the first lady does play a very important public role. I see it differently. I see, in fact, a lot of lost opportunities. For example ‚Äì again it is for a first lady, as well, a learning process ‚Äì when the Chinese prime minister came for an official visit, she was wearing a dress from a foreign designer. What a lost opportunity to promote an American industry. I‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt do it on purpose, but she was not well-advised.‚Äù\nHis ballot for the 2016 election:\n\"I have a wonderful relationship with Hillary Clinton. I hope that she will be our next president. She is an extraordinary lady. I am so unbelievably proud to say she is my friend.\"\nOn his cancer diagnosis in 2006:\n\"Yes, I had cancer. Right now, I am totally clean. The only realities in life are that you are born, and that you die. We always think we are going to live forever. The dying aspect we will never accept. The one thing about having this kind of warning is how you appreciate every single day of life.\"\nOn his rumored retirement and the future of the brand:\n\"People ask me, ‚ÄòAt your age, when are you going to retire?‚Äô I think every single day there is a learning process. For a long time ‚Ä¶ I wondered what would happen to the brand when I am no longer here. But I will be here for a very, very long time.‚Äù\nHow old the 80-year-old designer feels:\n\"Depends on the day. Age, in my case, is your mind. My passion, my spirit, my joyful life that remains.\"\n\"Life is a little bit like a garden. I love to garden. There is a time when you plant. There is a time when you weed. You have to weed so that the beautiful flowers will grow. I'm having a fun time and I love every single day.\"\nHis advice to fashion students and aspiring designers:\n\"I tell fashion students, you don't need the introduction. You need to have good work. Work hard. Believe in yourself. It's not the publicity to sell the clothes, it's the woman.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5128916c-c4be-4800-8529-944ee9f03c98>","<urn:uuid:c8f0561e-5c95-4ec0-a416-97ce5d7a7669>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey, as an art student I wanna know how manga artists show movement in zero gravity - how's that done in space scenes?","answer":"The artist has developed a specific technique for depicting movement in outer space, particularly during EVA (extra-vehicular activity) tasks. They successfully convey the disorienting nature of moving through space, where traditional concepts of up and down don't exist, while still maintaining clear, readable panels. This is achieved through a combination of highly-detailed props and backgrounds alongside stylized figures and faces.","context":["In today‚Äôs review: Dark Horse Manga‚Äôs omnibus-style reissue of Makoto Yukimura‚Äôs award-winning science-fiction comic Planetes.\n- Paperback/black & white (with color sections)/$19.99 (US)\n- NOTE: Book is oriented for right-to-left reading\n- In stores 09 December 2015\n- Story & art: Makoto Yukimura\n- Translation: Yuki Johnson\n- English adaptation: Anna Wenger, Brendan Wright\n- Lettering and retouch: Susan Daigle-Leach\n- ‚ÄúIn the 2070s, increased interplanetary travel has led to crisis-level amounts of dangerous space debris, and someone has to clean it up.Planetes follows the space-garbage crew of aspiring explorer Hachimaki, mourning Yuri, and secretive Fee, collected in two omnibus editions, printed from the original files and complete with bonus color pages!‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúWinner of two Seiun Awards, Japan‚Äôs highest honor for science fiction.‚Äù\nMany contemporary comics and graphic novels tagged with the science-fiction label, at least in North America, are short on the science and long on the fiction. What are often marketed as science-fiction comics these days would probably be described by those more particular about genre distinctions as ‚Äúscience fantasy‚Äù: Pulp-styled adventure narratives with little in the way of rational speculation of the effects of scientific and technological advances on society at large, functioning, for all intents and purposes, as sword-and-sorcery tales or westerns with ray guns, spaceships, and oddly humanoid aliens. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that, of course, but it does leave a bit of a gap in the market for those readers looking for more traditional science-fiction fare in comic book form.\nDark Horse Manga‚Äôs recent omnibus-style reissue of Makoto Yukimura‚Äôs Planetes helps fill that gap. The first volume collects the first twelve chapters of Yukimura‚Äôs critically-acclaimed near-future space exploration-themed work, which were first released in English across multiple paperbacks in 2003 and 2004 by TokyoPop. More than just a compilation of the TokyoPop material, the Dark Horse book has slightly larger page dimensions, art scanned from the artist‚Äôs original files, extensive color inserts, a tweaked English script (editor Brendan Wright is credited with the adaptation, along with the original TokyoPop edition‚Äôs Anna Wenger), and new lettering by Susan Daigle-Leach that is a significant improvement over that seen in the earlier English presentation.\nThe short stories featured in Planetes, Vol. 1 follow the exploits of a small, international crew of space debris collectors, astronauts tasked with removing the accumulated space junk in orbit around the Earth that pose a threat to space travel and space-based technologies such as satellites and space stations. The stories are presented in a linear, chronological fashion that, taken together, constitute a much larger overarching, character-driven narrative. Each story, however, is structured in such a way that it can serve as self-contained character sketch that also provides sufficient background exposition about the state of space travel and space exploration in the 2070s.\nYukimura is a master of mood, seamlessly transitioning from slapstick comedy to sentimental drama to high-stakes action with ease‚Äîalthough the most successful stories are those which focus foremost on character relationships and the mundane and not-so-mundane details of life in the space-based communities of the future. Especially notable are the stories ‚ÄúA Stardust Sky,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Girl from beyond Earth,‚Äù ‚ÄúTanabe,‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Cat in the Evening.‚Äù It‚Äôs not all perfect, however. The author misses an opportunity to thoughtfully address the topic of terrorism in space, with the Space Defense League (an eco-terrorist organization devoted to keeping mankind from further exploring space) serving as wan, caricaturish antagonists in the stories ‚ÄúA Cigarette under Starlight‚Äù and the two-part ‚ÄúA Black Flower Named Sakinahoka.‚Äù Still, all the stories collected in the volume have their strengths and are thoroughly engrossing and entertaining in their own way.\nThe art in the book features a blend of expressive, stylized figures and faces and highly-detailed props and backgrounds, which should be no surprise to those familiar with Yukimura‚Äôs meticulously-researched work on the popular historical manga Vinland Saga. Planetes‚Äò spacecraft, space station, and spacesuit designs are extrapolated from current models and real-world concepts, lending the book‚Äôs future tech a level of plausibility rarely seen in ‚Äúsci-fi‚Äù comics. Worth noting, too, are the scenes that involve astronauts engaged in EVA (extra-vehicular activity) tasks: Yukimura has a knack for imparting the disorienting feeling of moving through outer space, where conventional notions of up and down don‚Äôt exist, without rendering the panels a confusing, hard-to-read mess.\nDark Horse Manga‚Äôs Planetes, Vol. 1 is a well-executed reissue of one of the best contemporary science-fiction comics published in English to date. Very highly recommended."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:63fced6b-d7bb-48f4-96db-d9afce56d64e>"],"error":null}
