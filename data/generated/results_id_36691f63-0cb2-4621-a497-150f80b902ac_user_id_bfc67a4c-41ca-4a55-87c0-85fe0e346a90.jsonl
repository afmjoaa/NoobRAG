{"question":"What are the best methods to seal air leaks in my home to improve energy efficiency?","answer":"There are several effective methods for fixing air leaks: You can use caulking, spray foam, and weather stripping to close smaller cracks and gaps. For larger holes, plywood/drywall and rigid foam insulation can be used as plugs. When dealing with gaps around chimney and furnace flues, sheet metal and high temperature caulking are the appropriate materials to use. Proper air sealing helps you get full performance from your insulation and heating & cooling system.","context":["Properly Insulating Your Home Will Not Only Help Reduce your Heating and Cooling Costs but Also Make your Home More Comfortable\nThe R-Value of Insulation:\nAn R-value indicates an insulation’s resistance to heat flow. The higher the R-value, the greater the insulating effectiveness.\nThe R-value depends on the type of insulation and includes its material, thickness, and density. When calculating the R-value of a multilayered installation, add the R-values of the individual layers. Installing more insulation in your home increases the R-value and the resistance to heat flow.\nThe effectiveness of an insulation’s resistance to heat flow also depends on how and where the insulation is installed. For example, insulation that is compressed will not provide its full rated R-value. The overall R-value of a wall or ceiling will be somewhat different from the R-value of the insulation itself because some heat flows around the insulation through the studs and joists. Therefore, it’s important to properly install your insulation to achieve the maximum R-value.\nThe amount of insulation or R-value you’ll need depends on your climate, type of heating and cooling system, and the section of the house you plan to insulate.\nRecommended Levels of Insulation\nRecommended Insulation Levels for Retrofitting Existing Wood-Framed Buildings\nInsulation level are specified by R-Value. R-Value is a measure of insulation’s ability to resist heat traveling through it. The higher the R-Value the better the thermal performance of the insulation. The table below shows what levels of insulation are cost-effective for different climates and locations in the home.\nWhere to Insulate\nAdding insulation in the areas shown here may be the best way to improve your home’s energy efficiency.\nFirst, check the insulation in your attic, ceilings, exterior and basement walls, floors, and crawl spaces to see if it meets the levels recommended for your area. Insulation is measured in R-values – the higher the R-value, the better your walls and roofs will resist the transfer of heat.\nImproving your Home Envelope\nThe exterior of your home is called the “envelope” or “shell”. The envelope is made up of the outer walls, ceiling, windows & floor. By proper Air Sealing & insulating you can improve your “envelope” and make your home more comfortable and help lower your energy bills.\nHidden Air Leaks and Lack of Proper Insulation\nAir leaks can make your home uncomfortable. In the winter, drafty windows, doors, cold walls or ceilings & ice build-up or ice dams on the roof are all symptoms of air leaks or poor insulation in attic. In the summer, ceilings that are hot to the touch & upstairs rooms that are uncomfortably hot, no matter how the A/C is set , can also be a sign of air leaks & insufficient insulation. Fixing air leaks can make your home more comfortable & help you get full performance from your insulation and your heating & cooling system.\n*If you add up all the hidden air leaks in your home they can equal a hole the size of an open window.\nThere are many ways to fix air leaks, such as Caulking using spray foam and weather stupping for closing smaller cracks and gaps. Plywood/drywall & rigid foam insulation may be used for plugging larger holes. Sheet metal and High Temperature Caulking can be used to close gaps around chimney and furnace flues.

{"question":"What is the key difference between durability features in bivy sacks compared to waterproof garments, particularly regarding their long-term maintenance needs?","answer":"Bivy sacks tend to be more durable because they have simpler designs with fewer parts that can break, particularly having few or no poles that could snap in high winds. In contrast, waterproof garments rely heavily on their DWR (durable water repellent) coating, which requires regular maintenance and will eventually wear out. Once a garment's DWR is completely gone, it can't be restored and the entire garment becomes compromised. While both types of gear are made from high-end materials, the simplicity of bivy sacks gives them an advantage in long-term durability compared to the more complex maintenance needs of waterproof garments.","context":["Looking for a shelter for your next camping trip but not sure if a bivy sack or a tent is right for your needs?\nIt can be tricky to determine precisely what kind of camping shelter you need for your adventures, so we’ve put together this guide to doing just that.\nUp next, we’ll walk you through the differences between bivy sacks and tents so you can decide which one best suits your specific camping style, whether that’s car camping in Acadia National Park or backpacking in Yosemite.\nBivy sacks are a solid choice for solo campers heading out on fast and light trips where weight savings and packability are your chief concerns. However, tents offer more for campers in terms of comfort, weather-resistance, durability, and overall versatility.\nLet’s take a closer look at the differences between a bivy and a tent, and how they stack up against each other.\nWhat's a bivy sack?\nA bivy sack, or a bivouac sack, is a type single person camping shelter that’s designed to be lightweight and highly portable.\nHistorically, bivy sack-type shelters have been used by militaries around the world for hundreds of years, but the modern bivy sack came into existence within the last half-century.\nModern bivy sacks were designed for climbers and mountaineers who needed an ultralight shelter system for use in high alpine environments where there just wasn’t enough space to pitch a tent.\nBivy sacks are essentially miniature tents that are just large enough to cover a single person, their sleeping bag, and their sleeping pad. There are many different types of bivy sacks out there, including both waterproof and not waterproof models, for use in different terrain.\nWith that in mind, bivy sacks are most appropriate for ultralight backpacking, mountaineering, and alpine climbing trips where you want to keep weight and bulk to a minimum, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of comfort in the short term.\nWhat's a tent?\nPerhaps the most commonly used shelter for outdoor recreation, tents have been used by humans for thousands of years.\nAlthough humans have and continue to live full-time in tents in many parts of the world, the modern camping tent has its roots in the various shelters used by militaries during wars and other campaigns.\nTents are designed to provide you with a small, yet comfortable living space that’s warm and dry, even in foul weather.\nCamping tents come in a wide range of different sizes, though the one-person and two-person tent models are most comparable to a bivy sack.\nUnlike bivy sacks, tents have enough room for one to two campers, their sleeping pads, sleeping bags, and most of their other gear. They’re an ideal shelter for any outdoor adventure where comfort and functionality are the chief priority and where weight savings are important, but not essential.\nBoth bivy sacks and camping tents come in a wide range of different prices, so there are models out there to suit nearly any budget, from $50 to $900 or more.\nHowever, while it’s possible to get a decent, waterproof camping tent for under $100, it can be difficult to find a truly weatherproof bivy sack for a budget-friendly price.\nSo, for situations where affordability is your top concern, you’ll likely get a better value with a tent than with a bivy sack.\nWinner : Tent because you can find reliable tents that don’t break the bank. While there are certainly some affordable bivy sacks out there, they’re not always the best value for the money.\nEase of set up\nWith a bit of practice, neither a tent nor a bivy sack is exceptionally difficult to set up, though some models are certainly trickier than others.\nThat being said, if we compare a standard tent with a standard bivy sack, you’ll often find that the bivy sack is faster to pitch.\nThis is simply because bivy sacks tend to be simpler pieces of gear with fewer parts that need to be assembled when you arrive in camp.\nIn fact, some bivy sacks don’t even have any poles to pitch or tent stakes to place. Instead, you simply need to slide your sleeping bag and sleeping pad inside and climb in to start snoozing.\nAlternatively, most tents require that you set up two to six tent poles, tension multiple guylines, and place lots of tent stakes in order to pitch your shelter for the night.\nDepending on the tent model and your comfort level with camping, the set-up process can take upwards of 10 or 20 minutes to complete.\nWinner : Bivy sacks because most models require minimal, if any set up before you can crawl inside and get some rest after a day of hiking.\nAlthough most people think of camping as roughing it, it’s more than possible to be comfortable while snoozing in the outdoors. However, tents and bivy sacks offer drastically different experiences when it comes to your comfort level while in the mountains.\nSince bivy sacks are meant to be lightweight and ultra-compact, they offer little by the way of extra space for tossing and turning.\nIn fact, most bivy sacks are designed to be mummy-shaped, just like a sleeping bag, so some campers find that they feel a little claustrophobic inside. This is particularly true if you’re tucked into your bivy sack with a thick winter sleeping bag or other bulky gear, like a heated jacket, which can make you feel very constrained inside your shelter.\nTents provide a very different camping experience. Although we’ll stop short of saying that backpacking tents are exceptionally spacious, they do usually offer enough space for you to sit upright and toss and turn at night.\nWinner : Tents because they offer plenty of headroom and extra living space for lounging and snoozing while outside.\nInsulation and warmth\nBoth bivy sacks and tents are meant to help you stay warm and dry in inclement weather while you’re outside.\nAlthough most tents and bivy sacks aren’t insulated like your sleeping bag is, you’ll often find that you stay warmer inside a tent than inside a bivy sack.\nWell, it all has to do with condensation.\nIn general, bivy sacks tend to be very prone to condensation build-up at night because they are usually made from a single piece of fabric that’s not as breathable as the mesh and rain fly combination that you find on traditional two wall backpacking tents.\nAs a result, many campers find that they wake up in the morning with lots of condensation on the inside of their bivy sack, which soaks their sleeping bags and leads to decreased warmth on cold nights, especially with down sleeping bags.\nOf course, condensation can also be problematic in tents, but it tends to be less of a concern than in bivy sacks.\nWinner : Tents because they are less likely to have significant condensation build-up, which means they’re less likely to soak your sleeping bag at night and impede its ability to keep you warm.\nPackability and portability\nPortability is of the utmost importance when you’re camping or backpacking, so having a lightweight and highly packable shelter is key.\nWhen it comes to portability, bivy sacks generally have the edge over tents.\nThat’s because bivy sacks are purposefully designed to be a lightweight, highly packable shelter option for backcountry adventures.\nIndeed, your standard bivy sack will often weigh just a fraction of what you can expect from a standard one-person tent.\nOf course, there are now some very lightweight solo tents on the market, so it is possible to get a tent that’s just as light as a bivy sack if you’re willing to spend a bit of extra money. But, in general, a bivy sack is usually lighter and more packable than a tent.\nWinner : Bivy sacks because they are smaller, lighter, and have fewer parts than their tent counterparts, which makes them a solid choice for ultralight camping.\nModern tents and bivy sacks have come a long way from their humble origins. These days, many tents and bivy sacks are crafted from high-end fabrics and materials that are lightweight, yet oh-so durable.\nAlthough any piece of gear can break when used incorrectly or in very harsh conditions, most tents and bivy sacks are strong enough to withstand years of regular use.\nWith that in mind, bivy sacks are usually the better bet for all-around durability, just because they’re simpler pieces of gear with fewer parts that can break.\nThis is especially true when you consider that most bivy sacks have very few poles, which are the most likely part of any tent to snap in high winds.\nWinner : Bivy sacks because they have few, if any poles, which are often the weak link in any tent design.\nOne of the main roles of a camping shelter is to protect you from the wind and the rain, so it should come as no surprise that weather-resistance is a key concern when deciding between a bivy sack and a tent.\nAs far as weatherproofing goes, most tents are two wall tents that have a waterproof nylon or polyester rainfly and an inner mesh canopy for added breathability. They also tend to be fairly sturdy in the wind, though this depends on quite a bit on the design of the tent model in question.\nBivy sacks, however, are usually made with either a water-resistant fabric or a waterproof-breathable membrane. Although there are certainly some bivy sacks that are fully waterproof, these aren’t as common as you might think.\nIndeed, you’ll usually find that most bivy sacks just don’t keep you as dry as tents do in very rainy or windy conditions.\nWinner : Tents because they are all made with waterproof rainflies while some bivy sacks have only water-resistant outer fabrics.\nGaby is a professional mountain guide with a master’s degree in outdoor education.

But it doesn’t have to be.\nStaying under the safety of your tent’s rainfly isn’t the only option when a storm rolls in, unless of course all you brought was that beautiful 800-fill down puffy. That jacket may be the warmest garment in your closet, but anyone who’s spent more than ten seconds in one during a torrential downpour knows it will just turn you into a human sponge under those conditions. Thankfully, dragging around more rubber than a dominatrix isn’t the only alternative anymore!\nTahoe Mountain Sports put this waterproof gear guide together to help you navigate the modern plethora of sleeker, lighter, more-comfortable, water-shedding, moisture-wicking, wind-breaking and all-around-adventure-slaying wet-weather gear out there.\nOuterwear fabrics these days almost all have some built-in (or coated on) resistance to getting wet, but there’s a big difference between water-resistant or water-repellent and truly waterproof outerwear. Under harsh conditions, water-resistant/repellent quickly translates to absorbent. It won’t take those types of jackets, pants, boots etc. long to become saturated in heavy rain (e.g., the aforementioned puffy).\nHow Waterproof is It?\nLegitimately waterproof means sealed seams, welded or storm-flap-protected zippers and waterproof membranes. These items are rated based on how well they resist the entry of pressurized moisture in a laboratory setting. Most are measured in millimeters, but what the heck do those numbers actually mean?\nThe “mm rating” of a waterproof garment tells how much rainfall the item can withstand over a 24-hour period without any moisture leaking in. The higher the “mm rating”, the more waterproof the garment is. There are just shy of 305 mm in a foot, so a 20,000 mm waterproofing is pretty darn waterproof (withstanding 64 feet of water in 24 hours). Some garments, however, might also (or instead) provide a “psi rating” (pounds-per-square-inch).\nA higher “psi rating” means a garment can handle more pressure. Rainfall can range between 1 and 7 psi. So, why do you see ratings of 25 or even 40? It’s because other forms of pressure can try to squeeze that moisture through the waterproof membranes in your outerwear (e.g., pack weight on your shoulders/back or sitting in the snow). That must be why my butt always gets wet when I’m snowboarding!\nBreathable vs. Non-Breathable Outerwear\nOkay, now that you’ve calculated the pressure of your bottom, let’s talk about those pits. Non-breathable fabrics are going to be the most bomber of waterproof materials, but that’s not going to help much if you’re moving around a lot.\nLook at it this way: Breathable fabrics (e.g., Mountain Hardwear Dry.Q Elite) let moisture move from the inside out, but not from the outside in. Non-breathables don’t let moisture move in either direction. That’s why Old Yellow, your raincoat from the 90’s, keeps you dry until you start exercising, then the inside turns into a steam room.\nBreathability is measured by how many grams of water vapor will pass through a square meter of your garment’s fabric, from the inside to outside, in a 24-hour period (g/m2/24 hours). The pores the vapor passes through are thousands of times smaller than a raindrop, which is why something waterproof can also be breathable. Waterproof membranes also usually incorporate materials resistant to oils, like those from your body, sunscreen, etc., that might compromise the waterproofing over time.\nIn summary, the rubber raincoat you grew up with, or a more stylish modern version made from polyurethane-coated nylon, will always keep you the driest if you are only doing things like hanging outside or walking a short distance to school, the store or across town on an errand-run.\nBut if you are backpacking through the Sumatran rainforest, jogging in Seattle or backcountry skiing the Sierra Nevada, you’ll want something that is both waterproof and breathable.\nHey, That’s Not Waterproof!\nLeather is not fully waterproof, ever. Neither are water-repellent coatings. But many waterproof products do use water-repellent coatings, because the waterproof membrane is usually sandwiched between other layers. This is generally called the DWR or “durable water repellent” coating/finish. Washing your Levis in some Nikwax, however, does not make them a pair of ski pants.\nNikwax is, however, a great way to extend the life of your waterproof garments. You see, your garment’s DWR will wear out before its waterproof membrane does. And if you revitalize it before that happens, the garment lives on. Once the DWR is completely gone, though, there’s no bringing it back. And the rest of that garment is now compromised. But please, read each item’s care instructions before playing Scientist. Then try either NikWax Tech Wash for in-laundry care or NikWax TX Direct for spray-on pre-wash care.\nHere are some of our favorite industry-leading waterproof-breathable membranes:\n- The North Face HyVent\n- Helly Hansen Helly Tech\n- PolarTec NeoShell\n- Marmot PreCip and Marmot MemBrain\n- Mountain Hardwear Dry.Q Elite\n- Gore-Tex (used in many brands)\n- eVent Fabrics (used in many brands)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:76f74d14-8ca8-4040-b2cc-8759f02a3ffb>","<urn:uuid:f9925b6d-0e0a-4bca-8379-2720e1ebf7a4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone dealing with constant headaches, I'm curious - how does a spinal tap help diagnose both newborn sepsis and chronic headache conditions? What's similar and what's different? 🤔","answer":"For newborn sepsis, a lumbar puncture is specifically done as part of a broader diagnostic process to check for meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord) by testing the cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, for chronic headaches, a lumbar puncture is performed after evaluation by a doctor and head imaging to diagnose specific inflammatory conditions that can cause headaches. It can also help diagnose conditions like pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension), where pressure within the subarachnoid space is elevated. In both cases, the procedure involves collecting cerebrospinal fluid through a hollow needle inserted into the lower back, but the analysis and diagnostic purposes differ based on the suspected condition.","context":["Click a letter to see a list of conditions beginning with that letter.\nClick 'Topic Index' to return to the index for the current topic.\nClick 'Library Index' to return to the listing of all topics.\nSepsis in the Newborn\nWhat is newborn sepsis?\nNewborn sepsis is a severe infection in an infant younger than 28 days old. The infection is in your baby’s blood. But it may affect any body system or the whole body.\nWhat causes newborn sepsis?\nNewborn sepsis is most often caused by bacteria. But other germs can also cause it. A baby may become infected before birth if your amniotic fluid is infected. During delivery, the newborn may be exposed to germs in the birth canal. Once born, a baby may be exposed to germs in the hospital or at home.\nWhich babies are at risk for newborn sepsis?\nThese things make it more likely that your newborn will have sepsis:\nYour baby is born too early (premature). This means before 37 weeks of pregnancy.\nYour amniotic sac breaks (ruptures) more than 18 hours before birth.\nYou have the strep germ in your vagina or have symptoms of infected amniotic fluid, such as a fever.\nYour baby needs a medical procedure. This includes a urinary catheter or a central intravenous line.\nWhat are the symptoms of newborn sepsis?\nSepsis in newborns can be hard to identify. Symptoms depend on what’s causing the infection. They also depend on how severe the infection is and where it is. The newborn may have:\nSigns of distress during labor or delivery, such as a rapid heart rate\nChanges in temperature (often fever)\nBreathing problems, such as very fast breathing and grunting\nDigestive problems like poor appetite or an enlarged liver\nNervous system problems, such as drowsiness or trouble staying awake\nHow is newborn sepsis diagnosed?\nThe symptoms of sepsis are similar to some other health conditions. Your baby will need tests to make a sepsis diagnosis and to rule out other illnesses. These tests may include:\nBlood culture. This is done to check for bacteria in the blood. Results take a few days, but treatment will start right away. This is the main way sepsis is diagnosed.\nUrine culture. This checks for bacteria in the urinary system.\nOther cultures. This checks for bacteria in other places, such as in a wound.\nBlood tests. These check for signs of infection and for possible effects of sepsis on the kidneys, liver, and blood cells.\nLumbar puncture. This is done to check for infection of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). A small amount of cerebrospinal fluid is tested.\nX-rays or other imaging tests. For example, a chest X-ray is used to check for a lung infection.\nHow is newborn sepsis treated?\nTreatment will depend on your baby’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment is the best way to stop sepsis. If your baby’s healthcare provider thinks it may be sepsis, your baby will get antibiotics right away, even before test results are available. Once the provider has the test results, they may change the treatment.\nA newborn with sepsis may be very ill. The baby will need to stay in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). In the NICU, your baby will be watched very closely. In addition to the antibiotics, they will get fluids, other medicines, oxygen, nutrition, and help with breathing, if needed.\nWhat are possible complications of newborn sepsis?\nSepsis is life-threatening for newborns. It can affect any body system. It often affects more than one system at the same time.\nCan newborn sepsis be prevented?\nNewborn sepsis can’t be completely prevented. But you can lower the risk. Regular prenatal care can find and treat many problems that put a newborn at risk for sepsis. One example of this is that all pregnant women are screened for group B strep infection and treated if they have it.\nHospitals and other facilities have practices in place to prevent the spread of infection. These include:\nWhen should I call my baby’s healthcare provider?\nCall your baby’s healthcare provider right away if your newborn has:\nA fever above 100.4°F (38.0°C) rectally\nA fever lasting more than 1 day\nA change in behavior, such as being very sleepy, fussy, or not eating well\nKey points about newborn sepsis\nNewborn sepsis is a severe infection in an infant younger than 28 days old.\nA newborn may become infected before, during, or after birth.\nNewborn sepsis can be hard to diagnose.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment are the best ways to stop sepsis.\nAntibiotic medicine is started as soon as possible.\nTips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider:\nKnow the reason for the visit and what you want to happen.\nBefore your visit, write down questions you want answered.\nAt the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.\nKnow why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are.\nAsk if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways.\nKnow why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.\nKnow what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.\nIf your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.\nKnow how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours.

For this procedure, your doctor inserts a hollow needle into the space surrounding the spinal column (subarachnoid space) in the lower back to withdraw some cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or inject medication.\nCSF is a clear fluid that bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord. CSF is continuously made and reabsorbed in the brain.CSF is made up of cells, water, proteins, sugars, and other substances that are essential to maintain balance in the nervous system.\nWhy might I need a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture may be done for various reasons. The most common reason is to remove a small amount of CSF for testing. This can help in the diagnosis of various disorders. The fluid is tested for red and white blood cells, protein, and glucose (sugar). The clarity and color of the fluid are also checked and it is tested to see whether bacteria, viruses, or abnormal cells are present. Excess CSF may also be removed in people who have an overproduction or decreased absorption of the fluid.\nA lumbar puncture procedure may be helpful in diagnosing many diseases and disorders, including:\n- Meningitis. An inflammation of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. The inflammation is usually the result of a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.\n- Encephalitis. An inflammation of the brain that is usually caused by a virus.\n- Certain cancers involving the brain and spinal cord\n- Bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it (subarachnoid space)\n- Reye syndrome. A sometimes fatal disease that causes severe problems with the brain and other organs; Although the exact cause of the disease is not known, it has been linked to giving aspirin to children. It is now advised not to give aspirin to children during illnesses, unless prescribed by your child's doctor.\n- Myelitis. An inflammation of the spinal cord or bone marrow.\n- Neurosyphilis. A stage of syphilis during which the bacteria invades the central nervous system.\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome. A disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system.\n- Demyelinating diseases. Diseases that attack the protective coating that surrounds certain nerve fibers - for example, multiple sclerosis or acute demyelination polyneuropathy.\n- Headaches of unknown cause. After evaluation by a doctor and head imaging if necessary, a lumbar puncture may be done to diagnose certain inflammatory conditions that can result in a headache.\n- Pseudotumor cerebri (also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or IIH). In this condition,pressure within the subarachnoid space is elevated for reasons that are not clear. A lumbar puncture is only done in this condition after evaluation and head imaging.\n- Normal pressure hydrocephalus. A rare condition affecting mainly older people in which there is a triad of loss of urinary control, memory problems, and an unsteady gait. A lumbar puncture is done to see if the pressure of the CSF is elevated or not.\nIn addition, a lumbar puncture may be used to measure the pressure of the CSF. The doctor uses a special tube (called a manometer) to measures the pressure during a lumbar puncture.\nFinally, a lumbar puncture may be done to inject medicine directly into the spinal cord. These include:\n- Spinal anesthetics before a surgical procedure\n- Contrast dye for X-ray studies - for example, myelography\n- Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer\nYour doctor may have other reasons to recommend a lumbar puncture.\nWhat are the risks of a lumbar puncture?\nBecause this procedure involves the spinal cord and brain, the following complications may occur:\n- A small amount of CSF can leak from the needle insertion site. This can cause headaches after the procedure. If the leak continues, your headache can be severe.\n- You may have a slight risk of infection because the needle breaks the skin’s surface, providing a possible way for bacteria to enter the body.\n- You may have temporary pain or numbness of your legs or lower back pain.\n- Bleeding may occur in the spinal canal.\nYou may have other risks, depending on your specific medical condition. Be sure to discuss any concerns with your doctor before the procedure.\nHow do I get ready for a lumbar puncture?\nHow do I prepare for a lumbar puncture?\nCheck with your healthcare provider about what you should do before the procedure. Below is a list of common steps that you may be asked to do:\n- Your doctor will explain the procedure to you. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the procedure.\n- You will be asked to sign a consent form that gives permission to do the procedure. Read the form carefully and ask questions if something is not clear.\n- Generally, you won’t need to fast before a lumbar puncture unless a sedative is prescribed. Follow your doctor’s instructions.\n- Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.\n- Tell your doctor about any medications (prescribed and over-the-counter) and herbal supplements you take.\n- Tell your doctor if you have a history of seizures or if you are taking any prescribed medications for seizures.\n- Tell your doctor if you have a history of bleeding disorders or if you are taking any anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medications, aspirin, or other medications that affect blood clotting. It may be necessary for you to stop these medications prior to the procedure.\n- If the procedure is done on an outpatient basis, you may be asked to remain in the hospital for several hours following the procedure. You should plan to have another person drive you home.\n- Based on your medical condition, your doctor may request other specific preparation.\nWhat happens during a lumbar puncture?\nA lumbar puncture procedure may be done on an outpatient basis or as part of your stay in a hospital. Procedures may vary depending on your condition and your doctor's practices.\nGenerally, a lumbar puncture follows this process:\n- You will remove any clothing, jewelry, or other objects that may interfere with the procedure.\n- You will be given a gown to wear.\n- You will be reminded to empty your bladder prior to the start of the procedure.\n- During the lumbar puncture you may lie on the exam table on your side with your chin tucked to your chest and knees tucked to your abdomen. Or, you may sit on the edge of an exam table with your arms draped over a table positioned in front of you. In either position the back is arched, which helps to widen the spaces between your vertebrae.\n- Therefore, your back will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution and draped with sterile towels. The doctor will wear sterile gloves during the procedure.\n- The doctor will numb the skin by injecting a local anesthetic. This injection may sting for a few seconds, but makes the lumbar puncture less painful.\n- The hollow needle will be inserted through the numbed skin and into the space where the CSF is located. You will feel some pressure while the needle is inserted. You must remain absolutely still during the insertion of the needle.\n- The CSF will begin to drip out of the needle and a small amount, about one tablespoon, will be collected into test tubes.\n- If the doctor needs to inject medication into the spinal canal, it will be given through the same needle after the CSF is collected.\n- When the procedure is done, the needle will be removed and a bandage will be placed over the injection site. The test tubes will be taken to the lab for testing.\n- Tell the doctor if you feel any numbness, tingling, headache, or lightheadedness during the procedure.\nYou may have discomfort during a lumbar puncture. Your healthcare providers will use all possible comfort measures and complete the procedure as quickly as possible to minimize any discomfort or pain.\nWhat happens after a lumbar puncture?\nYou usually will be asked to lie flat for about one hour after the lumbar puncture is completed. This helps reduce the incidence of a headache. You will be allowed to roll from side to side as long as your head is not elevated. If you need to urinate, you may need to do so in a bedpan or urinal during the time that you need to stay flat.\nYou will be asked to drink extra fluids to rehydrate after the procedure. This replaces the CSF that was withdrawn during the spinal tap and reduces the chance of developing a headache.\nAfter recovery, you may be taken to your hospital room or discharged to your home. If you go home, usually your doctor will advise you to only engage in very light activity the rest of the day.\nOnce you are at home, notify your doctor of any abnormalities, such as:\n- Numbness and tingling of the legs\n- Drainage of blood or pain at the injection site\n- Inability to urinate\nIf the headaches persist for more than a few hours after the procedure, or when you change positions, you should contact your doctor.\nYou may be instructed to limit your activity for 24 hours following the procedure. Generally, if no complications occur, you may return to your normal diet and activities.\nYour health care provider may give you other specific instructions about what you should do after a lumbar puncture.\nBefore you agree to the test or the procedure make sure you know:\n- The name of the test or procedure\n- The reason you are having the test or procedure\n- The risks and benefits of the test or procedure\n- When and where you are to have the test or procedure and who will do it\n- When and how will you get the results\n- How much will you have to pay for the test or procedure\nOnline Medical Reviewer:\nNelson, Gail A., MS, APRN, BC\nOnline Medical Reviewer:\nWeisbart, Ed, M.D.\nLast Review Date:\n© 2000-2015 The StayWell Company, LLC. 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067.

{"question":"Can elderly women participate in both religious activities and exercise programs, and what are the health benefits?","answer":"Elderly women can participate in both religious and physical activities. On the religious side, women can participate in group prayers (zimmun) with three or even ten women, and can engage in Torah study. Regarding exercise, older people, including women, can gain many benefits comparable to younger individuals. These benefits include improved strength, balance, coordination, and mobility. They show higher VO2max values, better cholesterol levels (higher HDL, lower LDL), enhanced glucose tolerance, greater strength, reduced fall risk, and increased bone density. Exercise programs should start with stretching and strengthening exercises, progressing to dynamic aerobic activities, with swimming and cycling recommended over jogging. Medical clearance is necessary before starting any exercise program.","context":["I have a “secret” life. I study Jewish religious texts and observe the holy days. ‘Twas not always thus. There was a time when I fled from a Judaism that had no place for women in terms of religious learning and ritual. I returned to religion as a feminist and helped create many feminist Jewish, life-cycle and inter-faith rituals.\nOn December 1st, 1988, in Jerusalem, I was privileged to be among the Jewish women who prayed for the first time in the women’s section at the Western Wall (or Kotel). While there are no exact parallels, this was analogous to Catholic women officiating at an all-female Mass in the Vatican. On that day, I was asked to open the Torah for the women to read from and it wedded me faithfully to the ensuing struggle for Jewish women’s religious rights which involved grassroots activism, consciousness raising, fundraising, and a lawsuit in the Israeli Supreme Court. You may read about some of this in a book I co-authored with Rivka Haut, Women of the Wall: Claiming Sacred Ground at Judaism’s Holy Site.\nHowever, I quickly understood that what I myself really wanted to do was to study Torah (The Old Testament and Commentaries) with learned, feminist women. Thus, I began to study with “Reb” Rivka eighteen years ago. We have studied the Torah, the Megillot (the stories of Ruth and Esther) a number of times; we always see new and unique things and ask questions that have not necessarily been asked before. Rivka brings both Talmudic and midrashic sources to bear on our studies. We are now “walking” through the Prophets. Three other women have joined us. We are currently reading Isaiah and trust me: His sentences about a peaceful and harmonious age are far fewer than are his truly terrible “fire and brimstone” passages which compromise the majority of his extraordinary Book.\nOf course, I study with male teachers as well. Many are utterly amazing and welcome women into their classes.\nSome questions: Do women see things differently than men do? Does living in a feminist era empower both men and women in new ways? Is there indeed, something new under the sun that the Sages did not contemplate? (The answer, of course, is yes). Does leading a learned and religious life lead to a different way of experiencing both time as well as one’s own life? (Again, the answer is yes).\nI really wrestle with questions about religion. Does religion lead to truth or to illusion, to hatred or to love? Is it the path of peace or the path of war? Is it reactionary or liberatory for women to wrestle with tradition? Will the tradition break–or will it hold?\nAnd, if I support a woman’s right to both practice a religion and to safely resist just such practices, where do I stand on Muslim (or Christian or Jewish or Buddhist or Hindu) women who choose to lead what seems to me to be terrifyingly subordinate lives in which their religious and spiritual expression is silenced or non-existent?\nFriends: This is my way of introducing you: my secular, non-Jewish, non-learned, non-observant, or perhaps profoundly atheistic readership to an interview that I have just published with Rivka Haut and Adena Berkowitz in the Jewish Press. Please understand: This newspaper is a conservative, Jewish paper where I frequently and proudly write–but not about religious matters. This interview is something of a “breakthrough” in that a new Prayer Book, written by these two wonderfully learned women, is being featured in a prominent way.\nHere is the Jewish Press interview: “A Bencher (Mini-Prayer Book) for Our Times.”\nMany Orthodox women have graced and inspired us with the most profound and amazing learning and leadership. It is my privilege to interview two such women for the Jewish Press about their important new bencher (mini-prayer book): “Shaarei Simcha” (Gates of Joy) published by K’tav.\nRivka Haut is a long-time agunah activist, a mother and grandmother, and the co-author of two books: Daughters of the King: Women and the Synagogue and Women of the Wall: Claiming Sacred Ground at Judaism’s Holy Site (Full disclosure: I am the other co-author and we have studied Torah together for eighteen years).\nDr. Adena Berkowitz holds graduate degrees in law and ethics. A popular teacher of Torah, Adena has lectured across the U.S. on Jewish ethics, Rabbinics, women and Judaism and Jewish values. She and her husband, Rabbi Zev Brenner are the parents of five children.\nRivka and Adena will be lecturing about the bencher on erev Shabbat, December 7th, 2007 at Congregation Orach Chayim after a shul dinner. Everyone is welcome.\nThe Jewish Press: What motivated you to create this bencher?\nRivka: Originally our intention was to prepare a small volume that would include Birkat HaMazon (blessings said after the meal) that would adhere to halacha (Jewish religious law) and be sensitive towards the religious needs of many groups: women, baalei teshuva (newly religious people) as well “frum (religious) from birth” Jews, marrieds and singles, people with children and those without, Ashkenazim and Sephardim. We were inspired by the approach of Rav Hisda in the Talmud (Berachos 49a) who tried to create a version of Birkat HaMazon that would be applicable to everyone saying it including women and slaves. Although his version was not accepted by the Chachamim, (Sages) his emphasis on sensitivity to all inspired us as we engaged in this endeavor.\nWhat challenges did you face in undertaking this project?\nAdena: We made a concerted effort to prepare a volume that would have as wide appeal as possible, all within a halakhic (religious) framework. We hope that what we have produced will be a good model for kiruv, ( closeness) allowing people at one table to share in a sense of chavershaft, (camaraderie) greater yiras Shamayim (faith) and an enhanced understanding of the tefilah (prayers) and berachot (blessings) they are saying. Hence we decided to completely transliterate all the prayers, as well as translate them in accordance with the admonition of Rambam. When translating we opted to go with a Sephardic pronunciation as that is the style taught in many yeshivot as well as a way of creating a bridge between Ahsknazim (Jews of European origin) and Sephardim (Jews from Arab and Muslim lands and who originally fled Spain and Portugal) . In addition we made an effort to include different Sephardic prayers which add greater beauty to the texts.\nWhat’s different about this bencher?\nRivka: As we began working on this project, it became evident that we needed to include more material beyond Birkat HaMazon. We were aware that there are many benchers available with beautiful graphics and illustrations. However, our focus was going to be on the text. We wanted to provide scholarly sources along with popular explanations and background discussions of various prayers and blessings connected with Shabbos (the Sabbath) and holidays. We felt it important to reintroduce techinas (women’s Yiddish prayers) and customs that many might be unfamiliar with such as techinas in Yiddish recited before taking challah, lighting candles or at the bris of one’s son or the custom of mayim acharonim.\nWhat prayers for modern occasions have you provided?\nAdena: We also included other prayers such as the Hebrew blessing such as a Hebrew blessing that a wife may recite for her husband as a parallel to “Eishes Chayil”. We tried to find a way to help parents have a role under the chuppah (marriage canopy) and included a prayer that either a mother or father could recite at that auspicious moment of their child’s wedding. We also provided ceremonies for naming a baby girl, for a boy at his bris, as well as a unique ceremony for adopted children. We have provided moving prayers for parents to say at their children’s bar and bat mitzvahs, (coming-of-age ceremonies) spiritual meditations to add at holiday times, such as Rosh Hashanah, and Sukkos, prayers to remember agunahs, as well as whimsical poems such as a Dr. Seuss style poem for Sukkos as well as a way of making Hannukah more meaningful.\nWe also felt it important to have this work reflect our love for Eretz Yisroel (Israel) and thus included a seder for Yom Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Day) that is based on the one prepared by the Rabbanut HaRashit and the Kibbutz Hadati movement.\nPRESS HERE TO CONTINUE THE ARTICLE IN THE JEWISH PRESS\nRivka: Our most difficult issue related to zimmun (group prayer after the meal) and women. We began our analysis as to the halakhic appropriateness of three women forming a zimmun, when they eat together. What we discovered was an interesting Rabbinic debate concerning whether women MAY do this or whether they MUST. For example, according to some authorities, (the Rosh and the Vilna Gaon), they are actually OBLIGATED to do so. Other rabbinic authorities agree that women are permitted to do zimmun. Yet, this fact has routinely been forgotten, and overlooked. When large numbers of women eat together, at women’s luncheons, for example, zimmun is not usually recited. At lunchrooms in girls’ yeshivahs it is often not done. Yet, women should recite zimmun as it offers an opportunity to form a group that thanks HaShem (God) together. Instead of thanking HaShem individually, and benching privately, each one to herself, zimmun elevates the meal to a meal eaten together, and adding additional praise to HaShem.\nWhat else did you discover about what might be halakhically permissible for women to do?\nAdena: After researching the issue of three women, we asked ourselves: What about ten women? Can they recite zimmun b’Shem, add HaShem’s name, as ten men do? To our surprise and joy, we discovered that there are rabbinic authorities who permitted this. In our introduction, we cite all the major sources on this issue. Yet, we were unsure whether to include them. Adena then remembered having read in a column in The Jewish Press by Rabbi Aharon Zeigler, an authority on the halakhic views of the Rav (Rabbi J.B. Soloveitcheik), (and reprinted in his book on the Rav). According to the Rav, zimmun of ten is not a function of minyan at all. It is a matter of glorifying HaShem’s name when eating in a group. According to Rabbi Zeigler, the Rav would have approved of ten women doing zimmun b’Shem.\nTherefore, we provide the sources, including a long quote by Rabbi Zeigler and we advise women to study the sources and make their own informed decision.","Inactivity, Not Aging Causes Most of our Health Problems & The Role Of Physical Activity And Exercies\nJust like the young, older people can gain many benefits from exercising. Life can be made a lot easier through improvements in strength, balance, coordination, and mobility. If the person has not exercised for a while, they must start slow. Even walking 10 minutes per day will give them great benefits.Weight training is also a great option. Start them on a 20 minute program (3-4 exercises), and increase them from there as they adapt. Keep sets at 2-3, reps at 10-15, and the rest interval between sets at 90 seconds.\n- Improvements in fitness and oxygen consumption with training are similar for younger or older men and women. Though, an older person will generally start at a lower level and peak at a lower level than a younger person.\n- Older subjects show greater gains in muscle oxidative enzyme activities.\n- Aging appears neither to impair the ability to improve muscle strength nor prevent muscle growth.\n- Exercise can help arthritic patients by increasing strength and mobility.Older people who exercise have:\n- Higher VO2max values and half the expected decrease in VO2max due to age\n- Higher HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol\n- Enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity\n- Greater strength, reaction time, and a lower risk of falling\n- Increased bone density (reduced chance of osteoporosis)\n- Always get a medical examination and clearance before starting an exercise program.\n- All equipment should be safe and inspected regularly for defects.\n- Training equipment should be located in an uncrowded area.\n- There must be adequate supervision by an experienced and registered trainer to ensure correct technique is used.\n- Programs should start with regular stretching and strengthening exercises, with a progression to more dynamic aerobic activities. Cycling and swimming are recommended over jogging.\n- Older people are generally less tolerant of environmental stress so restrict training in extreme temperatures.\n- Until they are experienced in weight training, only use exercises that require them to keep both feet on the ground (e.g. Squats instead of Lunges). This will reduce their risk of falling and injuring themselves.\n- Ensure all abdominal work is done on the floor and not on the Swiss Ball.Only light lifting should be done above the head.\n- No isometric exercises.\nPsychological Benefits of Exercise for the Elderly\nWhilst the physical benefits of exercise are quite obvious, the psychological benefits aren’t as commonly known. Many studies have shown that older exercisers get great benefits out of the interaction with others their age, and many people see a marked increase in self-esteem.\nBut it goes much further than that. Quite a lot of these people enjoy the different environment and discussion that goes along with it. Many older people have never been to a fitness centre or participated in a diet program because they led an active lifestyle and ate fresh, healthy foods (unlike us younger folk!), so this is all quite new to them!\nWhat is the role of physical activity and exercise in obesity?\nThe National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES I) showed that people who engage in limited recreational activity were more likely to gain weight than more active people. Other studies have shown that people who engage in regular strenuous activity gain less weight than sedentary people.\nPhysical activity and exercise help burn calories. The amount of calories burned depends on the type, duration, and intensity of the activity. It also depends on the weight of the person. A 200-pound person will burn more calories running 1 mile than a 120-pound person, because the work of carrying those extra 80 pounds must be factored in. But exercise as a treatment for obesity is most effective when combined with a diet and weight-loss program. Exercise alone without dietary changes will have a limited effect on weight because one has to exercise a lot to simply lose one pound.\nOther benefits of exercise include:\nImproved blood sugar control and increased insulin sensitivity (decreased insulin resistance)\nReduced triglyceride levels and increased “good” HDL cholesterol levels\nLowered blood pressure\nA reduction in abdominal fat\nReduced risk of heart disease.\nRemember, these health benefits can occur independently (with or without) achieving weight loss. Before starting an exercise program, you should talk to your doctor about the type and intensity of the exercise program.\nGeneral exercise recommendations:\n20-30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 to 7 days a week, preferably daily. Types of exercise include walking, stationary bicycling, walking or jogging on a treadmill, stair climbing machines, jogging, and swimming.\nExercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions.\nStart slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury, excessive soreness, or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day.\nPeople are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (ages 70-90 years) can improve their strength and balance.\nThe following people should consult a doctor before vigorous exercise:\nMen over age 40 or women over age 50.\nIndividuals with heart or lung disease, asthma, arthritis, or osteoporosis.\nIndividuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion, or who develop fatigue or shortness of breath easily.\nIndividuals with conditions or lifestyle factors that increase their risk of developing coronary heart disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol, or having family members with early onset heart attacks and coronary heart disease."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4c096da1-1ba2-4009-9537-40d52f696297>","<urn:uuid:e6077800-ac64-47d4-8cf4-868d047cf490>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you tell why St. Mark's was not Venice's cathedral until 1807? So confusing!","answer":"Throughout Venice's flourishing period, St. Mark's was officially only the domestic chapel of the Doge's Palace. The church of San Pietro di Castello served as Venice's cathedral until 1807, at which point St. Mark's finally replaced it as the cathedral.","context":["THE primitive patron of the town of Rivo Alto, and of the Republic of the Venetians, was the martyr St. Theodore, whose ancient figure still tops one of the columns in the Piazzetta. A church dedicated to this ancient saint is said to have occupied (nearly) the site of St. Mark’s before the 9th century. But in the year 819, (or 813,) when the seat of government of the Republic was fixed in Rivo Alto, the first Doge’s Palace was built on the spot where its successor now stands, and a Ducal Chapel was erected beside it. This chapel was still in all probability dedicated to St. Theodore. The body of St. Mark, however, was then preserved at Alexandria ; though, after the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs in 64o, the church of St. Mark’s in which it was kept was exposed to continual insults from the victorious infidel. In 829, the Khalif decided to destroy the church, for the sake of its marbles. Some Venetian merchants who happened to be then at Alexandria (a proof of the early maritime commerce of the town) succeeded in carrying off the body of the saint, and conveying it to Venice. On its arrival, it was received in state and housed in the Ducal Chapel ; while, in order to show due honour to the Evangelist, St. Theodore was deposed from his place as patron, and St. Mark was made the tutelary saint of the Republic. The old church of St. Theodore was also destroyed, and a new church of St. Mark’s, the predecessor of the present building, erected in its place.\nThis first church was burnt down in 976, and with it, humanly speaking, the body of St. Mark ; though its iraculous preservation and subsequent rediscovery are matters of history. Towards the close of the 10th century, the existing edifice was begun after the fire : it continued to be erected under Byzantine architects for nearly a hundred years. The body of the great church as we now see it be-longs essentially to this early period. But it has been largely remodelled and altered in its decorations, especially as regards the pinnacles of the exterior and the mosaics, during the Gothic reaction. The original portions, which will be pointed out in detail in the sequel, belong to the pure Byzantine style, and closely resemble parts of St. Sophia at Constantinople, on which edifice the church was mainly modelled. About the close of the 14th and first half of the 55th century, when the Gothic style had superseded the Romanesque and the Byzantine, several Gothic adornments were incongruously added, in the shape of pinnacles and pointed gables above the chief arches. In the 16th century and afterward, many of the beautiful old mosaics were ruthlessly destroyed, and replaced by jejune Renaissance compositions, which have no decorative value, and which jar with the architecture. But as a whole the church is still essentially Byzantine-Romanesque, with only just sufficient intrusion of the Gothic element to add a certain touch of bizarre extravagance.\nThe walls are of brick, but they are coated or incrusted throughout with thin slabs of many-coloured marble and alabaster ; the slender columns are of jasper, serpentine, verd-antique, porphyry, and other rare stones, mostly de-rived from earlier buildings ; and the whole is profusely adorned with gold and mosaic. To the mediaeval Venetian, St. Mark was not only the patron but the embodiment of Venice ; wherever the Venetian fleets went, they brought home in triumph columns and precious stones and reliefs and works of art for the further beautifying of the great shrine of their protector. St. Mark’s is thus a museum of collected fragments, as well as a gallery of Venetian mosaic-work. Its richness of colour is one of its greatest attractions.\nNevertheless, throughout the whole flourishing period of Venice, the shrine of the Evangelist was officially nothing more than the domestic chapel of the Doge’s Palace. The relatively unimportant church of San Pietro di Castello remained the cathedral till 1807, at which date St. Mark’s superseded it.\nIn examining St. Mark’s remember especially three things. First, it is the shrine of the body of St. Mark the Evangelist, the protector of the Republic, whom every Venetian regarded as the chief helper of Venice in times of trouble. Second, it is the private chapel of the Doge’s Palace. Third, it is essentially an oriental building, as befits what was really an outlying western fragment of the eastern empire.\nVery many visits should be paid to St. Mark’s. It would be impossible within the limits of these Guides adequately to describe all the architectural points, the mosaics, and the sculpture ; but in the succeeding account I have tried first to call attention to the main features, and then to treat in detail a few portions of the building as specimens, giving the reader some main clues by means of which he may work out the meaning of the rest of the building for himself on similar principles. St. Mark’s is of course by far the most important thing to see at Venice, and as much time as possible should be devoted to repeated visits. Do not run about after minor churches before you have thoroughly grasped the keynotes of this marvellous building.\nThe motto of Venice is “Pax tibi Marce, Evangelista meus “” Peace to thee, Mark, my Evangelist.” It will occur often on buildings or pictures.\nWhenever you visit St. Mark’s, take your opera glass."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:80360004-1214-48d5-bfb4-ef3090f3aab9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the storage methods for preserving genealogical research compare with emergency preservation techniques for water-damaged collectibles?","answer":"For genealogical research, multiple storage methods are recommended including computer databases, printed copies on acid-free paper, and distribution to multiple locations like libraries and family members. The focus is on long-term preservation and accessibility. For water-damaged collectibles, the preservation approach is more immediate and emergency-focused, requiring a controlled work area with adequate water supply and humidity control, gentle cleaning with clear water, and carefully managed drying processes. Both scenarios emphasize avoiding direct sunlight and controlling temperature/humidity, but water-damaged items require immediate intervention while genealogical preservation focuses on long-term storage strategies.","context":["History is very fickle in what it preserves, as a visit to a museum will\nreveal. Some museums do preserve wonderful statues and priceless jewelry\nbut, more often, the treasures are broken pieces of pottery, simple tools,\nweapons, objects of everyday life or, quite often, the items from a trash\nheap. That which is most treasured does not stand any better chance of\npreservation than the most common object.\nOne of my favorite poems is Ozymandias by Shelley. It tells of a pedestal\ninscribed with the words \"Look on my works, ye Mighty and despair!\" The\nirony is that all around is nothing but desert. The great Ozymandias built\nwonderful things for all to marvel at, but nothing remained but the mocking\nOf the seven wonders of the ancient worlds, only the Great Pyramid of\nKhufu remains intact. These were marvelous works in their time and probably\nthought to last forever. In view of the frailty of things, how is it possible\nfor genealogists to preserve their work? If the Hanging Gardens of Babylon\ndisappear, how can anyone insure that the history of the Barber family\nwill survive 50 years?\nPeople with all kinds of electronic gadgetry at their fingertips speak\nof how they can computerize, scan, digitize and otherwise preserve data\nelectronically. The truth is there is no sure way to store information\nto guarantee it will last for 100 years. Barring a direct hit, the Constitution\nof the United States in its sealed, guarded, bombproof case, will probably\nbe around, but most individuals do not have the resources to protect materials\nto that extent. So, what should you do with your research?\nKeep Everything in Perspective\nFirst of all, and this may sound cold-hearted, but keep everything in\nperspective. Most records are not as rare as they once were, so if something\ndoes happen to your research, chances are that much of the information\nwill be intact somewhere. Millions of public records, once subject to\nfloods, rats and fires, have now been microfilmed with several copies\nin different locations.\nThe original copy of my great grandparents' marriage in 1846 is a case\nin point. It could easily have met with many mishaps over 150 years. Now,\nI have photocopied it, sent copies to my siblings, scanned it, and there\nis also an organization in their county of marriage collecting copies\nof all marriages. A copy of the record is in many places, so the record,\nif not the original, stands a much better chance of surviving.\nThat said, if you have spent countless hours finding records and connecting\nfamilies and want that research preserved, what is the best way to do\nPreserving Your Work\nTo preserve your work you need to use many techniques. Fortunately, there\nare many methods available for publishing, storing and archiving information.\nTry to use more than one to improve your odds. Here are the key points:\nInterest your children, grandchildren or a relative in genealogy\nso they will want to preserve the records.\nUse as many different methods as possible to store the material.\nKeep up with the technology and move your material when newer methods\nShare information, but use discretion. Share with people who will\nrespect it and not misuse it.\nHere are some options for preservation, as well as the pitfalls of each\none. Take a few moments to consider the possibilities. Are you doing what\nyou need to do to keep your research safe?\nUse Genealogy Programs for Organizing and Printing Data\nComputer databases are a wonderful way of organizing material but a poor\nway to preserve it for posterity. First of all, does anyone else in your\nfamily know how to run your program or is this hobby yours alone? If you\ncan pass your data on to someone else who knows how to operate the program,\nthen you have at least shifted the problem to other shoulders. However,\nif there is no one to pass it on to, it could go into limbo.\nHow many times in the last 5 years has your program had an update? If\nyou leave the information in a computer program, chances are very good\nthat by the time your grandchild or cousin takes an interest, the program\nwill be obsolete. One lady I know of left her data to a public library\nalong with a copy of the computer program. The problem was that the next\nperson who wanted to see what she had done had no idea how to operate\nAs I said before, computer databases are a wonderful way of organizing\ninformation, so use that strength to help preserve your data. If you use\na program, it should be able to print hard copy reports. Get your information\ninto a condition that lets you create a logical, consistent report summarizing\nyour research. All your research notes and documents are wonderful (to\nyou) but if your heirs are not into genealogy, most of your papers will\nprobably be tossed or stored in less-than-ideal circumstances. You need\nto have your information organized such that a non-genealogist can step\ninto it, see what is there, and take it home in a manageable form.\nBe Aware of the Same Pitfalls with Scanning Software\nBy the same token, many genealogists put a lot of faith into scanning\npictures. Pictures do fade, but even a faded picture can show us something\nand can often be restored. A CD with lots of perfect pictures is useless\nwithout the equipment to open the files. Technology is changing so rapidly\nthat the process you use today to digitize photographs may not be readily\navailable in ten years. If you are saving pictures electronically, you\nhave to be aware of changes and keep up with the latest advances. Usually\nprograms will be backward compatible for a few versions, but if you don't\nkeep moving the material to each new version, you will find that what\nyou end up with is not compatible with the available equipment.\nOne person I know said he intended to keep up with the latest methods\nand move his material. However, once he is gone, if his heirs are not\ninterested in computers and/or genealogy, it could soon become out of\ndate. I read recently (and I don't know if it is true) that the 1960 U.S.\ncensus is stored on tapes that can no longer be read because the machines\nno longer exist. If the U.S. Government, which has relied on census information\nsince 1790, cannot keep up with migrating information to useable technology,\nI don't know how one individual can cope. When was the last time you moved\nyour data to a new program that required editing or updating and how long\ndid it take you to complete the task?\nWhile paper is one of the most fragile things we use, it can be amazingly\nhardy, and the written word has the advantage of being understood by almost\neveryone. I have an announcement from a local newspaper of my great-great\ngrandparents' marriage in 1800. Over the years, every family member that\ncame across this piece of newspaper could immediately recognize that it\nwas something unique and kept it. Even though it is 200 years old, I still\nhave it and anyone can read it.\nThe problem with paper is that many things were printed on poor-quality\npaper. For it to stand the best chance of survival, acid free paper is\na must. It also should be stored in a room where the temperature or humidity\ndoesn't vary too much. A library, either private or public, often has\nHave Multiple Copies in Multiple Places\nNo matter how hard we try to create the best environment, disaster can\nalways strike and paper can be destroyed. The best guardian against this\nis to create multiple copies which are stored in multiple places. Once\nyou have organized your material and printed it out, make sure that several\nfamily members receive a copy. Even non-genealogists usually keep genealogy\ninformation if it is in a form they can easily understand. Libraries are\nthe best keepers of books, so also donate copies to genealogical libraries.\nIn this way the information may also be microfilmed or otherwise electronically\nor digitally reproduced.\nStore Original Documents Separately\nSeparate the truly wonderful things from the mundane. Nowadays we can\nmake copies so easily and inexpensively that we tend to accumulate too\nmany of them. A long description of an area may be interesting, but is\nnot as important as original documents and pictures. Keep your very unique\nand irreplaceable pieces in a special place a carefully labeled\nbook or box that anyone could open and see that this is not to be thrown\nout. Photocopies of books and documents, even official certificates, are\nimportant but can be replaced if the source has been noted in your research.\nAcid free sheet protectors, papers and boxes along with old-fashioned\nfireproof and waterproof strong boxes might be your best answer for storing\nWhen it comes to electronic formats for storing your data, you should\nbe concerned not only with protecting the existence of your data, but\nalso the integrity of your data. There are a few things that you can do\nto safeguard it.\nA GEDCOM is a very easy way to exchange information, but also one that\nshould be used with caution. It is very useful if several people are combining\ndifferent branches of a family to combine into one database to be shared\nor from which to print a family history. It can also be handy if someone\nwants to compare information. However, it is too easy for the recipients\nto just incorporate into their own databases and use as their own without\nacknowledging or evaluating. You may put in links that you consider doubtful\nand you carefully document and otherwise indicate your unsureness. However,\nthe receiving program may not import these notes or surety indicators\nso things you don't want publicized as definite suddenly become written\nI put a lot of notes and documentation into my databases and I do not\nlike to send GEDCOM files to people. I will send them text files that\nthey can look over, read and evaluate and, if the material looks valid\nto them, they can enter into their own programs in their own way. I have\nworked on some lines for years and I am surprised when people ask me to\nsend a GEDCOM which represents 25 years of hard research so they can add\nto their research in 10 minutes.\nWorld Wide Web\nThe Web is another way to distribute material and store it outside your\nhome. It is very easy to create a Web page from many programs and you\ncan post your research for anyone to see. However, as with other storage\nmethods, you shouldn't rely on it alone, because there are downsides.\nIf you have a Web page, you will probably have it posted through an Internet\nprovider so it will not be on your computer. The Internet provider's computer\nis subject to crashes, hacking or the owner just shutting it down and\nAnother problem with the Web is that you not only have to worry about\nprotecting the data from loss, but also from corruption. When you post\nmaterial on the Web, you lose all control over it. A person can take whatever\nyou publish, copy it, mix it with other material and re-circulate it with\nlittle effort. It is more difficult to do this with printed material.\nMost researchers are willing to share information, but the biggest complaint\nis people who take information and publish it as their own without giving\nany credit to the person who did all the work. Many researchers have concluded\nthat you should not put everything on the Web. Give enough information\nso the reader will want to get in touch with you to find out more. In\nthat way you can also request information from them instead of always\ngiving it away.\nSimilarly, I have very mixed feelings about huge databases compiled from\nindividuals' research. They are good because in many ways they can serve\nthe way printed queries used to. If you find someone researching the same\nfamily, you can get in touch with them and compare information. The downside\nis that if the compiler shuts down his Web site or goes out of business,\nyour information will no longer be available to new researchers. You also\nhave no control over the distribution and use of the databases. It is\ntoo easy for people with a casual interest to just download the information\nand dump it into their own programs.\nProcrastinating: One of the Biggest Dangers\nAs you can see, there are many ways to preserve your hard work, and that\nchoosing more than one method is important. However, one of the biggest\nstumbling blocks when it comes to safeguarding your research is inherent\nto genealogy itself: it is never finished. You think you will get it all\norganized once you have had a chance to study all those land records you\ncopied last summer. Or, you need to go through that box of letters and\ndocuments your cousin found in his attic. Or, you need to write up some\nof those wonderful stories your mother told you. Most genealogists prefer\nthe chase to organizing. If you will just take the time to (semi)-finalize\nat least some of your work now, not only will your heirs benefit, but\nyou too will find it much easier to evaluate new research when the older\nmaterial is so easy to use.","COLLECTIBLES — Column #674 Copyright © Rinker Enterprises, Inc. 1999\nWater Damage with Special Emphasis on Flood Damage – Part III\nThis column is the third of a four-part series on dealing with water damage with special emphasis on flood damage. Part I presented information about Heritage Preservation (www.heritagepreservation.org), “The Emergency Response and Salvage Wheel,” planning ahead, and weathering the immediate emergency. Part II focused on the actions required to clean up a site and the initial steps in recovering water-damaged property. This column deals specifically with water damage recovery techniques relating to paper, everything from books to family photographs.\nBasic Steps That Apply To All Materials\nWhen objects have been heavily water-damaged, there are a few basic steps that apply to all objects whether books, ceramics, glass, furniture, paper, etc.\nEstablish a work area. Ideally, it will be on site. If not, you will have to move objects to it. The site needs plenty of workspace, an adequate water supply, and an indoor drying area that can be humidity controlled. You may have to build the latter.\nWhile an object is still wet, rinse it with clear water. A very fine, low-volume hose spray is ideal. Use soft brushes or damp cloths to clean off silt and debris. Be gentle. Avoid grinding the dirt and silt into the object. Dirt and silt is an abrasive. Over energetic cleaning will scratch an object. Dry the object with a clean, soft cloth or paper towel.\nDo not, repeat, not dry objects in sunlight or other high temperature environments. Drying an object too quickly can cause it to buckle, split, or warp. Air dry objects indoors where you have some control over the temperature and humidity.\nIf you transported the objects from the site to the work area in plastic bags, remove them from the bags as quickly as possible. In fact, do not seal them at all. Keep the bags open to allow air to circulate. These steps are designed to prevent mold from forming.\nThe development of mold and mildew are major concerns. Use these steps to delay or hopefully to prevent their occurrence: (1) after determining which tact is needed, increase airflow using fans, open windows, air conditioners, or dehumidifiers and (2) provide moderate exposure to light (which kills some mildew) by opening window shades or leaving lights on.\nWet paper tears easily. If possible use a plastic or other form of rust proof screen to support paper during the removal and recovery process. Carefully rinse the paper item to remove as much dirt and silt as possible. Be extremely careful with folded paper. It may make more sense to dry the object first before trying to unfold it.\nIf space permits, dry each sheet individually. If space is limited, dry documents in one-quarter inch or less piles, placing absorbent material between the sheets. Remove and replace when the sheets become wet.\nIf the number of documents is large, place a piece of wax or freezer paper between each document, create stacks (ranging between one and three inches), and wrap in freezer paper. Place these stacks supported in an upright position in a plastic or wire container in preparation for freezing. Never pack a container more than ninety percent full. Allow room for expansion due to freezing.\nFreezing stabilizes paper objects for months. It stops dye transfer, ink running, mold growth, and swelling. A sub-zero commercial freezer is the best choice. A home freezer is an adequate second choice. For extremely large paper collections, consider a refrigerated truck.\nFocus your efforts on your most important books. Assign the lowest priority to books that can be easily replaced or have little meaning to you.\nWater-damaged books can be very heavy and fragile. Use both hands when picking up one. Transport books to the recovery site in a plastic crate (milk crates are great) or wire basket. Do not use a paper container, e.g., cardboard box.\nKeep books closed until you are ready to work on them. The goal is to create a slow drying process that allows recovery. Temperature and relative humidity are critical. Work on books only in areas that are dry, cool and comfortable (warm or hot is very bad), and have plenty of air circulation. Never attempt to dry books in an oven or microwave or with a hair dryer or iron.\nDry large volumes flat, smaller volumes upright. Begin by placing sheets of absorbent material (blotters, plain newsprint, paper towels, etc.) between the pages. If the page count is high, you have to do this part of the drying process in several steps. Beware of adding too many sheets and destroying a book’s binding. Change the absorbent material as it becomes wet.\nWhen wet has been reduced to damp, stand the book upright on its driest edge and fan the pages. If you have fans, make certain the book’s spine or binding, not the open pages, is facing the breeze. When the book is dry but still cool to the touch, lay it flat and put a small weight on it. Check it twice a day for mold growth. Remove any mold you find immediately.\nBooks printed on coated paper, e.g., most coffee table and illustrated volumes, need to be treated differently. The coated, smooth, shiny paper will stick together when wet. In order to avoid this, insert a piece of wax paper instead of absorbent paper between each page in the drying process.\nFreeze any books that you cannot air dry within the first two days of your recovery operation. Wrap the books in wax paper and pack them spine down in a sturdy plastic or wire container. Defrost and work on the books as time permits.\nChances are you will not have the time or energy to save every photograph. You have tough decisions to make. Once you make them, do not look back. Remember, saving some photographs is far better than losing them all.\nDamaged photographs for which there are no negatives have the highest priority. If photographs stick together or become moldy, they are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to save. Immediately remove those photographs you wish to save from albums and frames.\nAs with water-damaged books, photographs become fragile when wet. Handle them carefully. Immediately rinse with clean water. Cut wax paper and place it between the photographs. Place the photographs in small stacks, eight to ten per stack, into a Zip-Lock type plastic bag and put them in a freezer to be worked on later. This step allows you to deal with other immediate preservation concerns. When the initial crisis is over, the photographs can be defrosted, separated, and air-dried. Never freeze glass plate negatives.\nIf you have the space and time, you can avoid the freezing process. Dry the photographs face up on a large table, non-rust window screen, or large piece of plastic laid on the ground and covered with absorbent paper if available. Do not dry them in direct sunlight. The photographs will curl as they dry. You can contact a photograph expert later about flattening them.\nFollow the same steps for negatives.\nPart IV, the final installment in this series, completes the steps necessary to recover water-damaged objects by concentrating on ceramics, furniture, glass, metal, and textiles."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4cc90f58-f0f2-4677-8be2-2b44118275e5>","<urn:uuid:1b21e7ae-e572-4bba-b81d-5f9def877810>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a business analyst, I'm evaluating automation technologies: Could you compare how RPA and blockchain technology contribute to improving business efficiency?","answer":"RPA and blockchain technology improve business efficiency in distinct ways. RPA enhances efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, executing them faster than humans, reducing processing times, minimizing costs, and providing error-free results. It can work 24/7 and integrates easily with existing IT infrastructure. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, improves efficiency by creating a digital ledger that reduces transaction times, eliminates the need for trusted third-parties, and provides increased transparency in transactions. It also enables automation through smart contracts, which can support conditional agreements and automate transactions based on coded conditions.","context":["Business enterprises continuously strive to generate more profit by increasing productivity and minimizing costs. Such growth is possible through enhancing business processes through technological innovation that significantly improves efficiency.\nRobotic process automation (RPA) is one such innovation that drastically impacts business processes by employing a digital workforce. RPA allows automating tasks with the help of bots to perform most labor-intensive and repetitive tasks such as clerical and back-office work including data entry and data validation.\nRPA imitates human actions and can be integrated with an organization's IT system to perform various operations using their in-house application.\nSince RPA allows enterprises to use a virtual workforce that can replace manual labor-intensive tasks, which minimizes cost considerably, it is more time-efficient, reliable, and can be easily implemented within the existing infrastructure. RPA does not require administrator-level access to codes or enterprise database and hence is much safer to use.\nRPA’s ability to simulate human actions allows it to be used on applications, business processes, software at normal employee level access. This ensures easy implementation of RPA into existing systems to perform any business activity saving a significant amount of time to generate error-free results.\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that involves the use of software robots or \"bots\" to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks in business processes. These tasks are typically time-consuming, manual, and prone to human errors. RPA aims to streamline and optimize these processes by automating them, allowing human workers to focus on more strategic and value-added tasks.\nRPA bots are designed to mimic human interactions with digital systems and applications, such as logging into the software, navigating through menus, entering data, copying and pasting information, and making decisions based on predefined rules. They can work across different Software Applications and systems, just like a human operator would, and they can be programmed to perform tasks around the clock without the need for breaks.\nRPA technology offers several benefits, including:\nEfficiency: RPA can execute tasks much faster and more consistently than human workers, leading to increased efficiency and reduced processing times.\nAccuracy: Since RPA bots follow predefined rules and instructions, they are less prone to errors that can result from manual data entry and repetitive tasks.\nCost Savings: By automating tasks, organizations can reduce labor costs and allocate human resources to more strategic roles.\nScalability: RPA can handle a large volume of tasks simultaneously, making it easy to scale up or down based on business needs.\nCompliance: RPA can ensure that tasks are performed in accordance with regulatory and compliance requirements, reducing the risk of non-compliance errors.\nAuditability: RPA logs all actions taken by bots, providing a detailed audit trail that can be useful for tracking and analysis.\nIntegration: RPA can work with existing IT infrastructure and applications, without requiring major changes to systems or processes.\nRPA is often used in various industries, including finance, insurance, healthcare, customer service, human resources, and supply chain management. It's important to note that while RPA is effective for automating rule-based tasks, it's not suitable for tasks that involve complex decision-making or tasks that require creativity and human judgment.","What is Blockchain?\nBlockchain. It’s a term that’s been on the tip of everyone’s tongue following recent, exciting advances in the technology, and growing media attention on the cryptocurrency market. Rightfully so, there is also a healthy mix of skepticism and cautious optimism depending on who you speak with. This year’s Health Datapalooza program aims to address the hype with multiple sessions including a main stage panel titled “AI, Blockchain, Machine Learning, IOT...from Buzzwords to Reality in Healthcare.” We hope this two-part blog will help you understand how blockchain works, considerations for health-related applications, and what the future holds.\nAt its core, blockchain technology represents a data structure that makes it possible to create a digital ledger of transactions and share it among a distributed network of computers with the potential for increased security, reductions in cost, decreased transaction times, and greater transparency - all while eliminating the need for a trusted third-party or intermediary. Blockchain technology uses cryptography to allow each participant in the network to make additions to the ledger in a secure manner without the need for a central authority, as long as any additions and changes are validated and agreed upon by network participants as adhering to the rules of the specific blockchain protocol.\nBlockchain technology, conceptualized by early pioneers such as the pseudonymous programmer(s) Satoshi Nakamoto with the widely known Bitcoin blockchain platform, was crafted in response to problems related to trust and the need for disintermediation in transaction processing. Blockchain’s elimination of central authorities, third-parties, or intermediaries for common transactions result in ‘trustless’ transactions where two parties conduct a transaction (i.e., peer-to-peer) by trusting the rules and cryptography in the underlying blockchain protocol. These features alleviate the common double spend problem (i.e., using the same digital money files such as Bitcoins more than once) with blockchain transactions structured to be irreversible and final within their timestamped universal ledger.\nBlockchain technology can also be classified into three categories based upon the entities who control and participate in the specific blockchain platform ecosystem: Private, permissioned, and public.\nPrivate blockchains are controlled by single entities managing all of the nodes and validators (i.e., key members of the organization’s blockchain network which independently check the data being conveyed through the network). Their distributed ledgers provide auditability of transactions within an organization, and the self-contained nature promotes privacy versus public blockchains. However, private blockchains lack true decentralization, leaving them potentially susceptible to the dictates of centralized governance and decision making. Attackers targeting an organization’s validator nodes, can also lead to the risk of blockchain rule changes or ledger modifications which compromises the integrity of the blockchain.\nPermissioned, or consortium, blockchains are those in which a group of participants (typically in a formal business agreement) each run a validator node. This promotes greater decentralization than private blockchains depending on the number of participants and validator nodes in the system. However, potential collusion between a majority participants or compromising the majority of validator nodes can result in a compromised blockchain. Permissioned blockchains have shown promise for multiple parties focused on eliminating issues of trust within their network using a transparent ledger supporting inter-party transactions. Permissioned and private blockchains afford greater privacy and transaction throughput with fewer validator and participating nodes, at the cost of security and potentially immutability.\nPublic blockchains, like the Bitcoin and Ethereum® platforms, allow anyone with a computer and internet connection to participate by downloading the necessary client software to run a node, regardless of whether they choose to actively conduct transactions or act as a validator. Public blockchains offer the greatest degree of decentralization, security, and likelihood of a ledger remaining immutable, at the cost of lower throughput, greater overhead in the form of transaction fees (typically paid to nodes that secure the network and confirm transactions), and lack of substantial privacy controls. These limitations make public blockchains a more difficult proposition for organizations from a data security/anonymity standpoint, though some interesting breakthroughs on are on the horizon in this regard.\nAs with the internet, which evolved from smaller networks or intranets, it is likely that many participants will initially gravitate towards private or permissioned blockchain technology. As the technology matures and new applications beyond cryptocurrency gain traction, the advantages of public blockchains will help advance their use.\nOkay, but HOW does it work?\nThe general concept of blockchain technology is that it represents a distributed, decentralized ledger that is secured cryptographically and, except under rare circumstances, immutable. The following figure outlines the processes occurring on a public blockchain from transaction origination to confirmation.\nBlockchain can be perceived as a key for a specific lock on a specific door, rather than a master key for doorway. There are additional nuances with various blockchain protocols and applications in addition to distinctions between public, permissioned, and private blockchains. These differences result in potential trade-offs and should be assessed by any organization considering the application of blockchain to their business.\nWhen should I consider blockchain?\nUltimately, blockchain technology brings a new and potentially game-changing solution to help address traditionally challenging issues of trust and the secure exchange of information in many multi-party transactional processes. In the context of health care, whether it’s health records and registries, claims processing, aid disbursement, or provenance in supply chain or chain of custody, blockchain can help close the trust gap through trustless, mathematically verifiable transactions, the elimination of intermediaries in a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and automation of conditional agreements.\nThe advent of more advanced blockchain platforms such as Ethereum® and Hyperledger™ (which comprises multiple blockchain technologies) offer the capability to incorporate logic-based, conditional agreements commonly referred to as “smart contracts” which can support the automation of transactions based on coded conditions and logic. This capability greatly expands the potential use cases for blockchain beyond peer-to-peer payments and simple value transactions to more ambitious applications built on an “Internet of Agreement” such as:\n- Blockchain enabled crowdfunding;\n- Supply chain management and other provenance-based use cases;\n- Identity verification, management, and eventually, self-sovereign identity;\n- Registries (Birth, Death, Land, Voting, etc.);\n- Asset management (tokenizing physical assets on the blockchain);\n- Decentralized data storage and dissemination;\n- Unique incentive programs for cross-market use; and,\n- Many more… it’s likely the best use cases have not even been thought of yet!\nThese use cases show exciting potential as blockchain technology matures at a rapid pace. Bitcoin, the oldest blockchain, has been around for eight years but has only gained widespread use in the past year. Other blockchain platforms such as Ethereum® and Hyperledger’s suite of solutions face a number of challenges - from scalability and access (most of the public blockchains have not achieved widespread use and scalability), to security and privacy protection, the technology and processes underlying blockchain are rapidly evolving and will take time to mature which makes a strong case for small scale projects and piloting proof of concepts.Whatever its ultimate use, blockchain technology can no longer be ignored by the federal, commercial, and non-profit health care sectors which rely upon the secure exchange of highly sensitive information. Stakeholders in the health care ecosystem are starting to get their feet wet with blockchain. Collaborations abound and an increasing interest in small projects and pilot initiatives to allow organizations test the technology – and their risk tolerance. While prudence is necessary, the significant potential advantages of blockchain technology present an incredible opportunity for early adopters in health care.\nPlease stay tuned for our second blog post which will further explore specific applications of blockchain and expand on the future potential for this exciting technology in research, clinical, and public health."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:137a5f7e-471c-4a68-b958-1da5a4c9774e>","<urn:uuid:57dae13f-bc5c-40f8-b65e-8f1899092c1b>"],"error":null}

Dwarf catmint with blue flowers and small gray leaves. A lovely ornamental 18 to 24 inches high. Minimally attractive to cats. A pleasant tea can be made from the flower heads and leaves.\nCatmint.Nepeta x faassenii 'Six Hills Giant'. Perennial, hardy to -20°F. Large plant with dark, blue-violet flowers. Very vigorous ornamental reaching 3 feet tall. Minimally attractive to cats. Can be cut back hard during the growing season to invigorate plant growth and encourage a second bloom.\nCatnip.Nepeta cataria. Perennial, hardy to -40°F. With its three-foot height, this catnip is formidable. It shows its mint heritage in a spreading, non-invasive habit. It has large green leaves and white flowers. Kitty's helpless attraction to catnip is comical and harmless. Less well known is the pleasant tea made from the flower heads and leaves. Use to flavor meat, vegetables, and for cat toys.\nCatnip, Lemon.Nepeta cataria 'Citriodora'. Perennial, hardy to at least -40°F. Similar to Tall White catnip but with a lemon scent. Kitty's helpless attraction to catnip is comical and harmless. Good for tea\nUse the flower heads in tea and in a decoction as a hair rinse. Both chamomiles grow best when planted on fertile, well-drained soils in a site with at least 4 hours of direct sun. People allergic to ragweed should be wary of ingesting any part of Roman chamomile.\nChamomile, German.Matricaria recutita. Annual about 18 to 30 inches high. Hardy to 29°F. Pinch young plants to promote branching and more flowers. Cut flowers frequently to keep plant vegetative. Use the flower heads in tea and in a decoction as a hair rinse. This is the best chamomile for tea. Best when planted on fertile, well-drained soils in a site with at least 4 hours of direct sun.\nChamomile, Roman.Chamaemelum nobile. Low growing perennial ground cover hardy to -40°F. Height 10 to 12 inches in flower. Sometimes called English chamomile because of its association with the gardens and lawns of that country. Keep plants amply watered during dry summers. Mowing or frequent trimming retards flowering and encourages spreading.\nChervil, Brusells Type.Anthriscus cerefolium. Annual, hardy below 20°F. Height to 2 feet (in flower). Its penchant for cool weather makes chervil a spring and winter herb in our climate. It is at its best grown in a cold frame over winter. Summer shade will help moderate temperatures. Foliage should be cut often for use, even when plants are small. Chervil is sometimes called \"gourmet parsley\" because of its resemblance to curly parsley and the fondness in which French cooks hold it. One of the fines herbes of the Gallic kitchen.\nChives.Allium schoenoprasum 'Purly'. Hardy to -40°F. The traditional chive with thin, tubular leaves. Plants develop into clumps which should be divided every three to four years. Cut snippets from the plants often. Remove rosy flower heads in late spring before seeds develop to eliminate seed scattering problems. Flowers can be used in chive-blossom vinegar. Foliage is used in soups, stews, vegetables, meat, fish, and eggs.\nChives, Garlic.Allium tuberosum. Sometimes called Chinese chives. This mild, garlic flavored chive develops flat, broad leaves as it matures. Although the roots are hardy to - 40°F, the tops will die down to the ground at the onset of cold weather. Plants develop into clumps which should be divided every three to four years. Cut snippets from the plants often. Remove flower heads before seeds develop to eliminate seed scattering problems. White flowers produce seed pods which can be pickled and used like capers. Foliage is used in a wide array of dishes including soups, stews, vegetables, meat, fish, and eggs.\nCilantro (Coriander).Coriandrum sativum 'Caribe'. Short-lived annual, hardy to 25-30°F. Height to 36 inches. Whether you call it cilantro or coriander may depend on how you use it. Cilantro, also dubbed \"Chinese parsley\", is cultivated for is aromatic foliage and used in Asian and Latin American dishes. Cilantro seeds (coriander) are used in baking and in a variety of vegetable and meat recipes. One of the most frequently asked questions here at the greenhouse is, \"why is cilantro so difficult to grow?\". Cilantro is no more difficult to grow than any other herb. Cilantro is a short-lived annual with two growth stages: the first is vegetative and the second is devoted to flower and seed production. The vegetative stage lasts up to 60 days, and is enhanced by regular cutting of foliage every 7- 10 days during periods of rapid growth. The appearance of fine, lacy foliage indicates the beginning of the flowering stage and the production of coriander seed. At this point the foliage becomes very bitter. Hot summer weather causes the plant to grow faster and go to seed sooner than during cooler periods. In order to have fresh cilantro all summer, successive crops 2-3 weeks apart, must be grown.\nCoriander, Mexican/ Culantro.Eryngium foetidum. Biennial. Sometimes called culantro. Unusual, thorny leaves with strong cilantro flavor. Use leaves like cilantro. Two year-old roots can be harvested in autumn and used fresh.

The flower is grown in many parts of the world, such as Europe and Asia.\nGerman Chamomile Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for this plant is “Matricaria recutita”.\nOther Names for German Chamomile\nThe flower is also known by several other names such as\nPicture 1 – German chamomile\n- Matricaria suaveolens\n- Matricaria chamomilla\n- Chamomilla recutita\n- Chamomilla chamomilla\n- Blue Chamomile\n- Camomille Allemande\n- Echte Kamille\n- Fleur de Camomile\n- Hungarian Chamomile\n- Kleine Kamille\n- Manzanilla Alemana\n- Matricariae Flos\n- Pin Heads\n- Sweet False Chamomile\n- True Chamomile\n- Wild Chamomile\nGerman Chamomile Description\nThe German Chamomile plant has small and dainty flowers that look much like daisies. These flowers are arranged in paniculate capitula. The white ray-like petals are all spread around a raised disc-shaped yellow center. The florets are equipped with a ligule. The width of a petal is less than one inch. The flower receptacle is swollen, hollow and lacking in scales. The stems on which the flowers grow are long, smooth and thin and light green in color. The stem has several branches. The narrow and long leaves are tripinnate or bipinnate. Sometimes these plants can grow near the ground and at other times they can be found in herb gardens. The plant can reach up to a height of 3 feet. The flowers of this plant have a sweet fragrance. German chamomile plant has a fibrous root system.\nGerman Chamomile Cultivation\nGerman Chamomile seeds require light for germination. Hence it is a delicate process to grow these plants from seed. Generally direct seeding is used to cultivate these plants. For proper growth and survival, the seeds need to be grown on open soil. It is important that seeds of superior quality are sown for vegetative propagation. The growing season lasts for two months. The seeds take one or two weeks to germinate. Seeds can be planted outdoors around the month of August. Alternatively, these plants can be grown initially in propagation trays around March. The number of seeds per gram of soil should range between 10,000 and 18,000. After the plants reach a certain level of maturity, they can be shifted to outdoors. Spraying chamomile tea on the plants aids in calcium absorption from the compost piles where they are planted. When they are grown outdoors, the seeds can be spread gently around some good soil. Individual plants should have a space of six inches between them. The plants are sturdy and strong after being firmly established. The plant can be grown in outdoors for gardening, landscaping and mass planting and can also be grown out of containers. It is however, advisable not to grow these plants in containers.\nThe plant can be grown on a wide variety of soils. However, a well-drained and sandy soil is preferred for growing German chamomile. The pH content of the soil should be between 7.0 and 7.5. The plant should have access to plenty of sunlight for healthy development. The plant needs to be watered regularly. However, care should be taken not to overdo the watering process.\nThe soil used for this plant should be tested before plantation. Depending on the results of the tests, certain minerals like phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium may need to be added. The major nutrients required by this plant for proper growth and development are as follows:\n- Carbon (C)\n- Oxygen (O)\n- Hydrogen (H)\n- Phosphorus (P)\n- Potassium (K)\n- Nitrogen (N)\n- Sulfur (S)\n- Calcium (Ca)\n- Magnesium (Mg)\nThe best time to grow these plants is in autumn or during earlier months after winter. The rate of germination depends on when the seeds are sown. Plants which are sown late will have a lower germination rate. As a result, these plants will develop less number of flower stalks and growth of flowers will be less.\nMatricaria recutita Range of Distribution\nThe German chamomile plant is native to a wide variety of regions all across the globe. Commercially, these plants are grown in\n- All over Europe, especially in countries like Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain\n- Parts of former USSR, such as Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova\n- North African countries like Egypt, Morocco and Ethiopia\n- South Africa (Free State, Lesotho, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces)\n- Temperate regions of Asia, comprising of countries such as North India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Japan and Turkey\n- East Coast of North America\n- South American countries like Brazil and Argentina\n- Australia and New Zealand\nThe Matricaria recutita flower plant is also grown in the icy regions ranging between North Caucasus and South Siberia.\nMatricaria recutita Uses\nThe German chamomile is extensively used for its positive health effects.

{"question":"As someone studying cultural stories: why do shapeshifter tales often feature local animals, and how does this compare to actual animal transformations in nature?","answer":"In folklore, shapeshifter stories typically feature animals native to the region - European tales focus on wolves, African stories feature hyenas and leopards, and Mesoamerican legends center on jaguars. This contrasts sharply with real biological transformations, where animals can only undergo specific predetermined changes through metamorphosis. While folklore allows immediate magical transformations between any human and animal forms, nature only permits certain species like insects and amphibians to transform through structured life cycles with specific stages. For example, butterflies and moths must progress through egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages, while some insects undergo incomplete metamorphosis with just three stages - egg, nymph, and adult.","context":["Happy Halloween! Let’s learn about some shapeshifters of folklore, including the werewolf and kitsune (thanks to Joel, Pranav, and Emma!), and a real-life shapeshifter.\nDon’t forget the Kickstarter, as if I’d let you forget it: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kateshaw/beyond-bigfoot-and-nessie\nMonsterTalk (note: sometimes there’s adult language or really scary themes)\nA death’s head hawkmoth, looking spooky:\nA death’s head hawkmoth caterpillar, not looking spooky at all:\nWelcome to Strange Animals Podcast. I’m your host, Kate Shaw.\nIt’s Halloween week and that means we need to talk about a truly spooky monster! Both Joel and Pranav suggested the werewolf a while back and Emily suggested the kitsune [kee-tsoo-neh], so let’s learn about shapeshifters and were-animals of all kinds. “Wer” is an Old English word that just means “man,” and just to get confusing, the word “man” used to refer to any person. The word “wif” referred to a woman, with wifman actually meaning woman. From those words we get the modern uses of wife, woman, and man, while “wer” is obsolete except in werewolf.\nLet me derail myself from talking about language by reminding you about our Kickstarter! It ends pretty soon, on November 5, 2021, so if you’ve been thinking about backing the project this would be a great time. It’s to help me publish a book all about mystery animals, called Beyond Bigfoot and Nessie: Lesser-Known Mystery Animals from Around the World. The book has a foreword by Blake Smith of MonsterTalk, the science show about monsters, and if you don’t already listen to that podcast, it’s a whole lot of fun and informative too. Thanks to everyone who has already backed the project!\nNow, Happy Halloween and on to the spookiness!\nThe important first question we need to answer is if werewolves really exist.\nNo. They do not exist outside of folklore and fiction, and I’ll explain why later so you don’t ever have to worry about werewolves or any other shapeshifters. But first, let’s learn what werewolves and kitsunes are.\nWerewolves are supposed to be people who can turn into wolves. Depending on the story, this can happen when the person wants to turn into a wolf or it can happen during the full moon whether the person wants to be a wolf or not. Sometimes the person has a magical wolfskin or some other item that they put on in order to transform. Sometimes they have to cast a magic spell, but sometimes it’s a curse that someone else has inflicted on them. Some stories say that the only way to kill a werewolf is by shooting it through the heart with a silver bullet, especially one that’s been blessed by a priest.\nThe werewolf is mainly from European folklore, where for many centuries all werewolves were also supposed to be witches. Until about the 18th century in some areas, if someone accused you of being a werewolf, you could be put on trial as a witch. Lots of people were convicted of witchcraft and killed during waves of witch-hunts in various parts of Europe. Most of the people accused were women, especially elderly women, especially women who were widowed or single, especially women who owned land that someone else wanted. Hmm.\nThe kitsune is a creature of Asian folklore, especially from Japan, that’s basically a fox that can work magic. It’s sometimes said that all foxes can turn into humans if they want, especially older foxes. The older and more powerful a kitsune is, the more tails it’s supposed to have, up to nine. Kitsunes sometimes play tricks on people but they can also act as guardians and friends.\nAbout the same time that old ladies were being accused of being werewolves in Europe, though, around the 15th to the 18th centuries, something similar happened in Japan. People were much more superstitious during this time and thought the kitsune was a dangerous goblin-like creature that could possess people and make them act like animals. These days the kitsune is back to being considered mostly a friendly trickster.\nWerewolves weren’t the only shapeshifters in the folklore of Europe, although they were the most common. A German story collected in 1879 is about someone who could transform into a fox using an item called a strap.\n“In the village of Dodow near Wittenburg there lived an old woman who possessed a fox strap. With its help she could transform herself into a fox, and thus her table never lacked for geese, ducks, and all kinds of poultry.\n“Her grandchild knew about it, and one day when the schoolmaster was talking about magic in the school, the child told about the fox strap, and the next day brought it to school.\n“The schoolmaster took it into his hand and unintentionally approached his head with it. Suddenly he was standing before the children, transformed into a fox. They broke out with a deafening noise. This so frightened the little schoolmaster that he jumped out the window with a single leap.\n“He ran to the hill that lay near the village and there built himself a den.\n“One day a great hunt was organized, and our fox was among those pursued by the huntsmen. A bullet hit him, and suddenly a schoolmaster was lying there before the bewildered huntsman. The bullet had struck the fox strap and ripped it apart.”\nWitches were also supposed to be able to transform themselves into hares, cats, dogs, even geese in European folklore. In other parts of the world, though, folklore is full of people who can turn into different animals, and the animals are always ones local to the area. In various parts of Africa there are stories of people who transform into hyenas, leopards, and lions, while in various coastal areas of the world there are stories of seals, orcas, dolphins, and other water animals that can transform into people or which are humans in disguise.\nThe nagual is a story from many places in Mesoamerica, dating back to the ancient Aztecs and Olmecs and other people who lived in what is now Mexico and parts of Central and South America. The nagual was supposed to be someone who could shapeshift into a jaguar. Some people today still believe in the nagual the same way some people still believe in werewolves, and like many other shapeshifters it’s often connected with witches. Modern nagual stories are about witches who can transform into various animals at night, including owls, bats, turkeys, pumas, and even wolves. In some stories they’re thieves and murderers, while in other stories they help people.\nOf course, not all folktales about shapeshifters are spooky. Sometimes they’re just meant to be funny, like this story from India.\nOnce there was a boy who herded buffaloes, and he noticed that at noon every day a dog would visit some nearby pools of water in a little valley. One day he hid to watch the dog. To his surprise, when the dog reached the water, it took its skin off and out stepped a beautiful young woman! She bathed in the pool, then put her dog-skin back on and left. The boy followed her to see what house she went to, then went back to watching his buffaloes.\nLater that year the boy’s parents decided it was time for him to marry and began to look for a wife for him. But he told them he wanted a dog as his wife and even had a particular dog picked out. Everyone laughed at him, but he was determined to marry the dog and so his parents agreed.\nThe wedding took place and that night the new bridegroom pretended to fall asleep, and when the dog got up he watched to see what she would do. She took her dog-skin off and started to leave the house, but the groom jumped up and threw the dog-skin on the fire, where it burned up. His wife remained in her human form and they lived happily ever after.\nHere’s another story, this one from Korea and published in 1911. Once a very poor old couple lived on the edge of a town, where they grew just enough rice to keep from starving. The old man caught fish to sell for extra money, but one day when he went to the lake, it was almost dried up and all the fish were gone. In the middle of the lake was a giant frog.\nThe old man shouted at the frog, “How dare you drink up the lake and eat up all the fish!” But the frog said, “You’ll thank me for it one day. Take me home and let me live in your house, and you’ll see how lucky you’ll be.”\nThe old man didn’t know what to do. Without the water from the lake, his rice would die, and without the fish from the lake, he had nothing to sell. He took the giant frog home.\nThe old man and his wife gave the frog the best room in their small house and the best food they had. In return, the frog turned out to be a very pleasant lodger and would talk and laugh with the couple long into the night, telling stories and singing songs.\nAfter a week, the frog said he needed to take a wife, but she had to be beautiful and of noble birth. The old man went to the town’s magistrate, whose youngest daughter was the most beautiful woman in the land, and explained that a giant frog would like to marry the magistrate’s daughter.\nThe magistrate laughed at first, but when he realized the old man was serious, he ordered him to be beaten. But immediately, hail began to fall from the sky—first tiny hailstones, then bigger and bigger ones. The magistrate hastily changed his mind and said his daughter could marry the frog, and the hail stopped.\nIn this time and place, a bride went to her wedding with her eyes closed and painted over with wax so she couldn’t see her husband until after the ceremony. Imagine the bride’s horror, after the wax was removed and she took her first look at her new husband, when she discovered he was a giant frog! The bride was furious, but the frog said, “You’ll be glad you married me. Will you take these scissors and loosen the skin of my back? It’s too tight and hurts me.”\nThe bride was so angry that she took the scissors and cut the frog’s skin open all the way down his back. Then, to her astonishment, he wriggled right out of his skin and out stepped a handsome prince wearing fine silk clothes. He had been enchanted and the spell could only be broken when he married a human woman. He and his wife lived happily ever after, and the poor old couple who had helped him were given all the riches they desired and lived in a palace to the end of their days.\nI could keep going forever, because there are a whole lot of stories about shapeshifters from around the world. If you want more folktales, I recommend the podcast “Sandman Stories Presents.” Each episode is another folktale. It’s really interesting and the host’s voice is soothing if you need a podcast to help you fall asleep.\nOutside of folklore and mythology, shapeshifters aren’t real. To understand why, we have to look at a very different animal, the butterfly—or, since this is a Halloween episode and most moths are nocturnal, the moth. Let’s learn about an especially Halloween-y moth, the African death’s-head hawkmoth. It gets its name from a pattern on its back that looks sort of like a human skull. Its upper wings are black and its lower wings are usually yellowy-orange. Its wingspan is as much as 5 inches across, or 13 cm. It lives in parts of Africa and migrates to Europe for the summer.\nThe deaths-head hawkmoth caterpillar can grow up to 6 inches long, or 15 cm, and has a curved horn-like structure basically on its butt. After it hatches, it spends the next month or two eating leaves, especially the leaves of potato and tomato plants. During this time it will go through five stages of development, called instars, where it sheds its skin and grows larger. Finally, the caterpillar burrows into the ground and forms a little nesting chamber in the dirt. For the next few weeks it just sits in the chamber while moisture evaporates from its body and it forms a hard shell-like structure called a pupa.\nInside the pupa, the caterpillar transforms into a moth by breaking down its own body with digestive juices. The resulting goo of undifferentiated cells reforms into a moth body, a process that takes weeks. Finally the newly formed moth emerges from the shell of its pupa and from the ground, climbs onto a leaf or twig, and hangs there for a little while as its wings uncrumple and extend to their full size.\nThe transformation of a moth or butterfly, or other insects that go through the same process, is astounding and not fully understood. What we do know is that it takes massive amounts of energy. A caterpillar eats all the time in order to store up energy to metamorphose into a moth or butterfly. If there was an easier way, for instance if a caterpillar just had to cast a magic spell or put on a mothskin coat to transform, they would do it the easy way. But they don’t, because this is the most efficient way to transform from one body to another that nature has developed. It takes weeks, it’s messy and dangerous because the animal is helpless the whole time, and it only happens once in an insect’s lifetime.\nSo that’s that. Werewolf movies are a lot of fun to watch, especially this time of year, but you don’t have to lie awake at night afterwards worried that a werewolf is going to bite you.\nYou can find Strange Animals Podcast at strangeanimalspodcast.blubrry.net.

When they are small and when they are grown up, they almost look the same. Their bodies just went through different stages and they got bigger.\nThe same with a plant - it started of as a small plant and then grows into an adult plant but still almost looks the same as what is did when it was small.\nAll living things (plants and animals) grow and go through different stages in their lives. This is called a life cycle, but not all animal look the same from when they were born to when they become adults.\nSome animals like insects and frogs looks totally different from when they were born and some just undergo a few changes. These changes that take place from one stage to another (and make them look different) is called metamorphosis.\nIf you look at the life cycle of a frog it all start with a female frog lying eggs. From the egg a tadpole hatches that almost looks like a little fish (it looks nothing like an adult frog). Changes will start taking place and the tadpole will first start growing hind legs and then front legs and lungs will also develop.\nEventually the tadpole will turn into a frog which then will grow to become an adult frog and if it is a female, it will lie eggs and the whole process or life cycle will start again.\nThere is a huge difference between the tadpole and the frog and this is called complete metamorphosis (the baby and the adult looks different from one another and the life cycle consist of 4 stages - the egg, tadpole, small frog/froglet and adult frog.)\nFor more information on the life cycle of a frog you can read here.\nAnother animal that goes through complete metamorphosis is a butterfly or a moth. There are also 4 stages and it is called the egg, the larva, the pupa and the adult.\nThe butterfly or moth does not hatch from the egg but it is a larva coming out of the egg - this looks like a worm. This larva will eat and grow.\nInsects have an exoskeleton which means it has a hard covering on the outside of the body which cannot stretch, so the larva will have to shed its skin. We say it molts.\nIf the larva has eaten and grown enough it will enter the next stage where it will rest and become a pupa. Inside of the pupa the butterfly or moth is forming with wings and antennae and after a certain time the adult butterfly or moth will emerge.\nHave a look at the video on the life cycle of a butterfly.\nSome insects looks almost the same as the adults when they hatch but will only undergo a small change. An example of this is the locust. The baby looks like the adult with one small difference - it does not have wings.\nAs the baby grows it will molt a few times and start growing wings until it is an adult. The stages in between each time it molts is called an instar.\nThis is called imcomplete metamorphosis and has 3 stages - the egg, the baby (which is called a nymph) and the adult.\nWatch the video on the differences of a complete and incomplete metamorphosis.\nFor more information on metamorphosis you can read here.\nCan you explain the following words in your own words (if you are not sure, read the piece again and find the meaning)\n- life cycle\n- complete metamorphosis\n- incomplete metamorhosis\nTeam South Africa banner designed by @bearone"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:452c0f8c-367f-4bf0-af7b-e4d154218fc4>","<urn:uuid:f175ccfb-1871-4c79-b30d-9118b6f6c21c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between Professional Indemnity Insurance and general Business Liability Insurance, and what specific risks does each one NOT cover? 🤔","answer":"Professional Indemnity Insurance covers negligent acts, errors, or omissions that occur during professional activities (like those performed by engineers, architects, doctors, or attorneys), while general Business Liability Insurance covers basic business risks like injuries sustained in your place of business or damages caused by products. As for exclusions, Professional Indemnity specifically deals with professional services, while general Business Liability Insurance does not cover professional errors such as negligence, malpractice, or misrepresentation. Additionally, general Business Liability Insurance doesn't cover worker injuries (which require Workers Compensation), car accidents, intentional acts, or product failures typically covered by warranties.","context":["Professional Indemnity Insurance in South Africa – Are They the Answers to Your Liability Cover?\nOne of the areas of greatest confusion is the difference between Professional Indemnity, General Liability and Product Liability Insurance. Professional Indemnity Insurance provides coverage for professionals (corporate or individual) for any negligent act, error or omission alleged to have occurred while in the performance of their professional activities and duties. It differs from General Liability and Product Liability Coverage in that the acts covered are those acts performed by an engineer, architect, doctor or attorney in rendering professional services to their clients. To better understand this coverage we will have a brief discussion below of Product Liability, Professional Indemnity and the application of the latter and how it functions.\nA. Product Liability\nProduct Liability is the legal responsibility of a manufacturer to a consumer of its’ product. Liability arises out of the negligent manufacture of a product including defective or faulty workmanship, materials or components. It is a liability that arises from the failure of a manufacturer to properly manufacture, test or warn about its product and occurs when the product departs in a negligent manner from its intended function.\nProfessional Indemnity (PI) Insurance Market\nProfessional Indemnity Insurance is designed to protect your business against any claims arising from negligence advice or services. It covers for people working for a business that involves risk.\nProfessional Indemnity Insurance policies are purchased by business owners to protect their companies from financial liability in case of claims of negligence. The individual under this is at the same time provided with assistance by Professional Indemnity Insurance when fighting lawsuits. Professionals like accountants, engineers and architects can choose several types of this insurance plan and make their business well protected.\nHowever a professional can be granted or denied by an insurer upon applying for a Professional Indemnity Insurance for several reasons. These factors may include business locations, claims history, industry and coverage amount. The degree of risk reflected by the premium amount is determined by these factors. The insurance company will raise the premiums if a professional is granted a policy but poses a higher risk than standard applicants.\nProfessional Liability Insurance\nBusiness liability insurance is tailored to protect your business against the cost of litigation and claims resulted from third party damages or bodily injuries caused due to negligence of your business. With respect to liabilities that a business can face, there are three main types of business liability insurances - public liability insurance, product liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance.\nThe above mentioned business insurance types differ from one another, but have their own importance in protecting the business from liabilities. Hence, it is very important for businesses to safeguard their investment and consider the three policies based on the type and need of their business. Before deciding on what to take, understand the differences between them.\nPublic liability insurance\nPublic liability insurance protects the insured against the third party claims that are likely to be raised due to damage to property, bodily injury or death occurred because of operation of the business.\nDeciding the right package of business insurance is quite hard. You should, however, see to it that you purchase insurance to cover every aspect of the risk involved in your business. The most common insurance cover includes product liability, public liability and professional indemnity insurance. All three policies are different from each other, but they are intended to protect your business from different risks of claims and liabilities. Hence, ensure that you have proper cover for your business against possible liabilities.\nProfessional Indemnity Insurance - Does it Help?\nWhen professionals are hired, they are done so with the belief that they have the necessary expertise and knowledge to carry out the task to the best of their abilities. Added to that, there is a certain code of conduct they are expected to abide by while doing their jobs. When professionals fail to meet the standards desired of them and their skill levels fall much below expectations, they are liable to be taken to court for the loss they inflict upon the business of another person. Thus, they need professional liability insurance. Professional liability insurance is termed \"errors and omissions\" liability, when liability is confined to acts of negligence.\nThere are different types of personal liability insurance coverage. Personal injury covers the client against claims of slander, libel and invasion of privacy. Intellectual property infringement coverage covers the client against claims of copyright infringement. Software processes and systems are commonly termed \"intellectual properties.\" Also, worldwide coverage is provided if the suit is bought in America.","What Is (And Isn’t) Protected Under Business Liability Insurance?\nBusiness Liability Insurance covers the basic risks associated with conducting business. Liability coverage refers to general items and not specific to unique business activities. Every business needs coverage but it is equally necessary to understand what coverage each plan offers and whether it is enough for your specific industry. Your Lyndhurst NJ insurance agent will be invaluable in determining the individual needs of your business. Not having the right kind of coverage, or lack of coverage may leave your business vulnerable to lawsuits and potential bankruptcy.\nWhat Is Covered By A General Business Insurance Policy?\nA general business insurance policy covers your business, your employees and yourself from lawsuits involving the business. Whether your business is being sued for an injury sustained in your place of business, caused by an employee or as a result of your product or service, Business Liability Insurance will cover it. Business Liability Insurance can also cover things like copyright infringement.\nBusiness liability insurance helps to mitigate the risk of losing money, or your business, due to legal action, whether that be from personal injury, property damage or intellectual damages. However, as with all other policy types, Business Liability Insurance has caps that may not cover the entire amount due. This is why it is important to have a risk assessment performed prior to choosing an insurance policy.\nWhat Is Not Covered By Your Business Liability Insurance Policy?\nA common misconception is that General Business Liability Insurance covers employees injured on the job… it doesn’t. New Jersey law requires business owners to have Workers Compensation coverage. Additionally, professional errors such as negligence, malpractice or misrepresentation will not be covered by a general Business Liability Insurance policy. Lastly, events such as car accidents, intentional acts and product failures that would be typically covered by a warranty are not covered by general business liability insurance. As a result, you may want additional coverage for any of the items not covered by your policy.\nIn addition to circumstance-specific policies like Workers Compensation and Car Insurance, it is important to evaluate the potential costs of damages following an accident. Business Umbrella Insurance is a policy that helps to pay any leftover amount in a lawsuit that is not covered by Business Liability, Workers Comp or Commercial Auto Insurance. This extra coverage helps to prevent major loses and even bankruptcy in the event of a large, substantial insurance claim.\nAdditional Insurance Coverage For Your Business May Include:\n- Automobile Insurance\n- Equipment Breakdown Coverage\n- Business Interruption Insurance\n- Electronic Data Loss Insurance\n- Data Breach Coverage\n- Professional Liability Coverage\nBusiness owners should have a solid understanding of what is included and not included with insurance policies. An experienced NJ insurance agent is instrumental in ensuring that you have the information and the coverage your business needs to be protected. Furthermore, take the time to evaluate your insurance annually. Your business changes over time, ensure your coverage is keeping up with these changes.\nSchedule A Meeting With Your NJ Insurance Agent Today\nContact our team at Bogle Agency Insurance today and make an appointment to evaluate your New Jersey business insurance needs.

{"question":"How were chickpeas used during World War I in Germany?","answer":"During the First World War, chickpeas were grown in some areas of Germany as a coffee substitute called chickamuddle.","context":["To use all functions of this page, please activate cookies in your browser.\nWith an accout for my.bionity.com you can always see everything at a glance – and you can configure your own website and individual newsletter.\n- My watch list\n- My saved searches\n- My saved topics\n- My newsletter\nThe chickpea, chick pea, garbanzo bean, Indian pea, ceci bean, bengal gram, hummus, kadale kaalu (Kannada), sanaga pappu (Telugu), chana or channa (Cicer arietinum) is an edible legume (English \"pulse\") of the family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae.\nThe plant grows to between 20 and 50 cm high and has small feathery leaves on either side of the stem. One seedpod contains two or three peas. The flowers are white or sometimes reddish-blue. Chickpeas need a subtropical or tropical climate with more than 400 mm of annual rain. They can be grown in a temperate climate but yields will be much lower. The garbanzo is often used as a source of protein by vegetarians and vegans since it has one of the highest protein levels of all plants.\nThere are two main kinds of chickpea (garbanzo), each with several varieties:\nThe Desi (meaning 'country' or 'local' in Hindi) form is also known as Bengal gram or kala chana. Kabuli (meaning 'from Kabul' in Hindi, as they were perceived to come from Afghanistan when first encountered in India) is the kind widely grown throughout the Mediterranean. Desi is likely the earliest form since it closely resembles seeds found both on archaeological sites and the wild plant ancestor of domesticated chickpeas (cicer reticulatum) which only grows in southeast Turkey, where it is believed to have originated. Desi chickpeas have a markedly higher fiber content than Kabulis and hence a very low glycemic index which may make them suitable for people with blood sugar problems.\nCultivation and uses\nChickpeas (garbanzo) are grown in the Mediterranean, western Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Domestically they can be sprouted within a few days all year round with a sprouter on a windowsill.\nMature chickpeas can be cooked and eaten cold in salads, cooked in stews, ground into a flour called gram flour (also known as besan and used in primarily in Indian cuisine), ground and shaped in balls and fried as falafel, fermented to make an alcoholic drink similar to sake, stirred into a batter and baked to make farinata, cooked and ground into a paste called hummus or roasted, spiced and eaten as a snack (such as leblebi). Chick peas and bengal grams make excellent curries and are one of the most popular vegetarian foods in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the UK. On the Indian subcontinent chickpeas are called chana (Hindi, Bengali and other Indic languages), konda kadalai or kothu kadalai (Tamil), where they are a major source of protein in a mostly vegetarian culture. Many popular Indian dishes are made with chickpea flour, such as mirchi bajji and mirapakaya bajji telugu. In India unripe chickpeas are often picked out of the pod and eaten as a raw snack and the leaves are eaten as a green vegetable in salads. Chickpea flour is also used to make \"Burmese tofu\" which was first known among the Shan people of Burma. The flour is also used as a batter to coat various vegetables and meats before frying, such as with panelle, a chickpea fritter from Sicily.\nHistory of chickpeas\nDomesticated chickpeas have been found in the aceramic levels of Jericho (PPNB) and Cayönü in Turkey and in Neolithic pottery at Hacilar, Turkey. They are found in the late Neolithic (about 3500 BCE) at Thessaly, Kastanas, Lerna and Dimini. In the southern France, Mesolithic layers in a cave at L'Abeurador, Aude has yielded wild chickpeas which have been carbon dated to 6790±90 BCE.\nBy the Bronze Age chickpeas were known in Italy and Greece. In classical Greece they were called erébinthos and eaten as a staple, a dessert and consumed raw when young. The Romans knew several varieties, such as venus, ram and punic chickpeas. They were both cooked down into a broth and roasted as a snack. The Roman gourmet Apicius gives several recipes for chickpeas. Carbonized chickpeas have been found at the Roman legion fort at Neuss (Novaesium), Germany in layers from the 1st century CE along with rice.\nChickpeas are mentioned in Charlemagne's Capitulare de villis (about 800 CE) as cicer italicum, to be grown in each imperial demesne. Albertus Magnus mentions red, white and black varieties. According to Culpeper \"chick-pease or cicers\" are less \"windy\" than peas and more nourishing. Ancient people also associated chickpeas with Venus because they were said to offer medical uses such as increasing sperm and milk, provoking menstruation and urine and helping to treat kidney stones. Wild cicers were thought to be especially strong and helpful.\nChickpeas were grown in some areas of Germany as a coffee substitute called chickamuddle during the First World War.\nThe name chickpea traces back through the French chiche to the Latin name cicer, from which the Roman surname Cicero was taken. The word garbanzo comes from Old Spanish (perhaps influenced by Old Spanish garroba or algarroba) through arvanço which may be linked to the Greek erebinthos.\nChickpeas are a helpful source of zinc, folate and protein. They are also very high in dietary fiber and hence a healthy food, especially as a source of carbohydrates for persons with insulin sensitivity or diabetes. Chickpeas are low in fat and most of it is polyunsaturated.\nOne hundred grams of mature boiled chickpeas contains 164 calories, 2.6 grams of fat (of which only 0.27 grams is saturated), 7.6 grams of dietary fiber and 8.9 grams of protein.\nChickpeas are also a good source of calcium (49-53 mg/100 g). Some sources cite the garbonzo as equal to yogurt and close to milk. According to the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, on average chickpea seeds contain:\nThere is also a high reported mineral content:\n|This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

{"question":"What testing methods are used in failure analysis, and what common product defects trigger recalls?","answer":"Failure analysis employs various testing methods including x-ray radiography for internal structure analysis, electrical characterization, thermal cycling tests, humidity testing, surface analysis using XPS and AFM, chemical analysis through ICP-MS and FTIR, and mechanical testing including pull and fatigue tests. As for common product defects that trigger recalls, these include fire hazards, electrical malfunctions, chemical hazards, mechanical issues, choking risks, and toxic exposure dangers. The most serious recalls typically involve children's products (toys, cribs, strollers), food items, automotive parts, and pharmaceutical products.","context":["Failure analysis is a comprehensive, forensic investigation into the reasons why a product or component has failed. Working with failed products or components, forensic engineers use a variety of examination techniques and testing methods to identify and evaluate specific root causes behind a failure. Once a cause has been determined, steps can be taken to modify or redesign the product to prevent future failures. Certain types of failure analysis techniques can also be applied during the product prototyping stage to identify potential areas of failure and to address deficiencies before a product is placed on the market.\nProduct failures result in a number of consequences for manufacturers of electrical and electronic products and components. At the very least, products which fail to function as promised lead to disappointed users and can tarnish a company’s reputation for quality products. Product failures can also lead to costly and time-consuming product recalls, along with the resulting adverse publicity. In the most extreme cases, product failures can place people and property at risk, sometimes resulting in death or injuries. Failure analysis can help manufacturers improve the quality and safety of their products, but can also reduce the risk of future failures in similar devices.\nTÜV SÜD operates Failure Analysis Centres in Singapore and in other major production centres around the world to provide manufacturers of electrical and electronic products and components with failure analysis testing, material and product evaluation services, and reliability testing.

The majority of the serious product recalls in the U.S. each year involve children’s toys, cribs, sleepers, heaters, strollers, food, auto and pharmaceutical industry products.\nOnce a product is released and is in widespread use, unforeseen safety issues can lead to a recall. Sometimes companies discover a problem and recall products on their own. Other times, a company is forced to recall a product after consumers, safety agencies and lawyers raise concerns.\nBecause so many products are put to market every day, several large U.S government safety agencies work to regulate safe commerce. These include:\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also work alongside these agencies, and alert the public when they discover a potential consumer and public health hazard.\nA product recall is a warning to consumers after the discovery of safety issues or product defects that could endanger consumers or patients, or place manufacturers and distributors at risk of legal action.\nUnfortunately, some products on the American market pose dangers for months or even years before a recall is issued, often only when a company is forced to recall a product or when legal pressure mounts from a Product Recall Lawyer. Common consumer product recalls often include the following:\nJoe Lyon is a highly-rated Cincinnati Product Liability Attorney representing plaintiffs nationwide in a wide variety of catastrophic injury and civil litigation claims.\nA product recall issued by a company or safety agency is a recommendation to return a product to the manufacturer due to a faulty product or a consumer safety issue. The U.S. Consumer Protection Agency works to protect the public from defective products that have the potential to cause injury by burns and fires, electrocution, toxic exposure, and inherent design defects.\nMany products produced abroad and imported into the U.S. must meet safety guidelines regardless of where they are manufactured. Manufacturers or retailers may be held responsible for any injuries sustained by consumers, and can be accountable by product liability laws.\nIt is important to note that not all product recalls are handled by the U.S. Consumer Protection Agency. The FAA oversees aerospace safety, the FDA handled drugs and medical devices, and the NHTSA handles automotive products. A few other government agencies handle the remainder, including contaminated foods.\nSerious injury caused by consumer products can prompt safety agencies to either issue a warning to recall a consumer product. It is crucial for individuals, manufacturers, and retail distributors to report serious injuries that occur from use of a defective product. Be sure to always report a product-related injury to the proper safety agency.\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) aims to protect the public from risks of injury or death associated with the use of the thousands of types of consumer products. They work to ensure the safety of products like commonly pose dangers, such as home gym equipment, children’s toys, clothing, cribs, power tools, and household chemicals.\nConsumers and families face potential injury from products that pose fire, electrical, chemical, and mechanical hazards. The most common hazards that prompt product recalls include the following:\nFood safety is a huge issue through the nation each year. According to the CDC, one in six Americans get sick from contaminated food each year. More than 3,000 annual deaths are attributed to food-related illnesses, most of which are preventable.\nThe CDC works with the Food and Drug Administration to identify health risks in consumables, but the outbreaks are sometimes overwhelming and spread too quickly to prevent public health risks.\nWhen an FDA-regulated product like a drug or medical device is either defective or potentially harmful, the FDA is responsible for issuing product recalls, which is the most effective means for protecting the public.\nThe FDA is usually alerted of an issue when a company discovers a problem, the agency inspects a manufacturing facility and determines the potential for a recall, or the FDA receives reports of health problems through various reporting systems.\nIn many cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contacts the FDA, often after the drugs and devices have already injured or possibly caused the death of unknowing consumers. FDA guidelines categorize all recalls into one of three classes, according to the varying seriousness of the hazard:\n• Drugs for human use\n• Drugs for animal use\n• Medical devices\n• Radiation-emitting products\n• Blood and blood-related products\n• Transplantable human tissue\n• Animal feed\n• Contaminated foods\nDefective drugs and unregulated nutritional supplements fill the U.S. market each year, endangering consumers and American patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiates weekly recalls for defective drugs, often after injuries have occurred and lawsuits are filed against negligent drug makers and pharmaceutical companies.\nThe FDA recalls defective drugs for a myriad of safety issues, including a lack of pre-market testing, drug contamination, and drug injuries reported by patients. Sometimes only after hundreds or thousands of adverse event reports are filed by doctors and patients are drugs taken off the market, discontinued or voluntarily recalled by manufacturers.\nWarning labels and “black box” warnings may be applied, and consumers are left wondering if the drug they have been taking for years may be dangerous or the root cause of an existing injury or illness.\nPharmaceutical companies tend to understate the risks of a drug and hype the benefits of a drug, in order to sell more and build profits. Even as the FDA works to regulate the giant drug market, their efforts often lag and injury cases must be filed by plaintiffs and an Ohio defective drug lawyer and product liability attorney.\nIn the auto industry, the number of product recalls has increased recently. Low priced production often leads to a hit in quality throughout the supply chain. As a result, technical failures are more likely to occur now than in the past.\nIn a recent, massive consumer product crisis, nearly 70 million Takata air bag inflators are under recall in the U.S. The defective Takata air bag inflators show a high risk of ruptures during air bag deployment.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says the risk posed by the airbag inflators in recalled vehicles is grave, and it is critical they be repaired now to avoid more deaths and serious injuries. Eight confirmed U.S. fatalities have been found due to Takata ruptures.\nThe oversight of the CPSC, FDA and NHTSA has contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years, however, each year many new dangerous products still hit the market and face recalls.\nBecause of the risks posed, and the negligence of manufacturers, there are thousands of pending lawsuits against makers of unsafe consumer products. Victims of hazardous products, such as contaminated food, faulty drugs and medical devices, and defective auto parts may have claims against a company and receive compensation. Contact an experienced attorney to find out what legal options may be available.\nProduct liability law holds manufacturers responsible for a large portion of liability regarding injuries directly related to defective or faulty consumer products.\nAmerica’s manufacturers have a moral and legal duty to ensure the safety of all products they market and distribute. More importantly, they have a responsibility to properly warn consumers of any defect their product may contain and issue prompt safety recalls.\nIn the event of an injury or death, compensation can be sought to cover medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, as well as punitive damages against a manufacturer for negligence and a disregard for the safety of consumers.\nFor a complete investigation and to build the strongest case possible, contact an attorney with considerable experience in product liability law and product recalls.\nMany product recall lawsuits have had a positive impact on consumer health and safety, and we have witnessed improved lives and prevented future injuries as companies are forced to recall products and change designs and warnings as a result of litigation.\nFollowing an injury caused by a recalled consumer product, a claim may be filed. Product liability lawsuits typically contain a cause of action for strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty.\nSafety agencies and companies themselves are responsible for recalling products when they pose safety and health risks. Common recalled consumer products include food, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, ATVs, automobiles, toys, home appliances and power tools.\nA product may be considered by law “defective” if it is unreasonably dangerous for its intended use. If a consumer is injured in part because of a product defect, legal action can be taken. Plaintiffs may sue a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer if they were aware of risk and failed to warn the public.\nThe manufacturer is likely liable for a product that fails or has an improper warning attached to it. Distributors and others in the supply chain may be liable as well.\nNot always, but if a product is recalled and a consumer suffers an injury due to the product defect, a lawsuit can be filed to recover compensation for the injury.\nDefective products that are sold to consumers present safety hazards for adults and children. Cheap and defective products may pose fire and burn risks; electrocution, strangulation and choking risks; and severe health risks. The manufacturers of inferior consumer products have a duty to foresee potential injury and properly design and test products before they are released to the public.\nCompanies must properly warn consumers of any risks associated with their products. Any failure to protect consumers or recall a product that results in an accident or injury can lead to lawsuits filed by plaintiffs and a product recall lawyer."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71c6eecd-dc7a-4bfe-86c6-a6fd426838fc>","<urn:uuid:fc7fa737-c09f-4e35-a21a-e02871e473ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying English literature and need to understand - what's the key difference between how satire works in classical parody versus Swift's Gulliver's Travels?","answer":"In classical parody, satire primarily operated through direct imitation and mockery of specific literary styles and conventions, as demonstrated by works like Aristophanes parodying dramatic styles of Aeschylus. In contrast, Swift's Gulliver's Travels employs a more complex satirical approach using contrast and symbolism to criticize society - for example, using the size differences between Gulliver and the Lilliputians to highlight political corruption, and employing the contrast between the rational Houyhnhnms and brutish Yahoos to critique human nature. While traditional parody often aimed simply to ridicule literary conventions, Swift's work uses satirical techniques to expose deeper societal flaws and aim for social reform.","context":["parody, in literature, an imitation of the style and manner of a particular writer or school of writers. Parody is typically negative in intent: it calls attention to a writer’s perceived weaknesses or a school’s overused conventions and seeks to ridicule them. Parody can, however, serve a constructive purpose, or it can be an expression of admiration. It may also simply be a comic exercise. The word parody is derived from the Greek parōidía, “a song sung alongside another.”\nOne of the earliest examples of parody comes from ancient Greece: Batrachomyomachia (The Battle of the Frogs and Mice), in which an anonymous poet imitated the epic style of Homer. Aristophanes parodied the dramatic styles of Aeschylus and Euripides in his play Frogs (produced 405 bce). In medieval England, Geoffrey Chaucer parodied the chivalric romance with “The Tale of Sir Thopas” in The Canterbury Tales (c. 1387–1400). European writers produced numerous examples of parodies during the Renaissance era: Miguel de Cervantes also took the romance as his target in Don Quixote (1605, 1615), while François Rabelais parodied the Scholastics in Gargantua and Pantagruel (1532–64). William Shakespeare mimicked Christopher Marlowe’s high dramatic style in the players’ scene in Hamlet (c. 1599–1601) and was himself parodied by John Marston, who skewered Shakespeare’s poem Venus and Adonis with his The Metamorphosis of Pigmalions Image (1598).\nGeorge Villiers, 2nd duke of Buckingham, in The Rehearsal (1671) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan in The Critic (1779) both parodied the heroic drama, especially John Dryden’s Conquest of Granada (1670, 1671). John Phillips in The Splendid Shilling (1705) caught all the superficial epic mannerisms of John Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667), while Jean Racine used Les Plaideurs (1668; The Litigants) to parody Pierre Corneille’s lofty dramatic style. During the 18th century the novel began to flourish as a means of delivering parody, particularly in Britain. Henry Fielding was notably effective as a parodist: he used both Shamela (1741) and Joseph Andrews (1742) to pillory what was, arguably, England’s first novel, Samuel Richardson’s Pamela (1740).\nRejected Addresses (1812) by Horace and James Smith was the first collection of parodies in verse to become a popular success in England. It consisted of a series of dedicatory odes on the reopening of the Drury Lane Theatre in the manner of such contemporary poets as Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Unique among the Victorians is Lewis Carroll, whose parodies preserve verses that might otherwise not have survived—e.g., Southey’s “Old Man’s Comforts” (the basis for “You Are Old, Father William”) and the verses of Isaac Watts that gave rise to “How Doth the Little Crocodile” and “The Voice of the Lobster.” In the United States the 19th-century poems of Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Bret Harte were mimicked by their contemporaries, particularly by the poet and translator Bayard Taylor. Because of the variety of accents of 19th-century immigrants, American parody often played on dialect, though sometimes to such an extent that the parody became merely an expression of anti-immigration sentiment.\nThe art of parody was encouraged in the 20th century by such periodicals as Punch and The New Yorker. One of the most successful examples of parody in prose from the early 20th century is Sir Max Beerbohm’s Christmas Garland (1912), a series of Christmas stories in the style and spirit of various contemporary writers, most notably Henry James. Sir John Squire has been credited with creating “double parody” in the period between World Wars I and II. This type of parody renders the sense of one poet in the style of another—e.g., Squire’s version of Thomas Gray’s “An Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” written in the style of Edgar Lee Masters’s Spoon River Anthology resulted in “If Gray Had Had to Write His Elegy in the Cemetery of Spoon River Instead of in That of Stoke Poges.” Other parodists working in English during the first half of the 20th century were Sir Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch and Stephen Leacock; E.B. White’s career extended well beyond the middle of the century. Vladimir Nabokov, Flann O’Brien, and Donald Barthelme also deployed parody in their writings. By the turn of the 21st century, literary parody had become, arguably, more difficult to identify, as the broad skepticism that underlies the most effective parody (and is a defining feature of what has been called postmodernism) had become a sort of default mode for Western writers who produced “literature,” such that much of what they published might be considered parodic.\nStill, the boundaries between the literary senses of parody, burlesque, travesty, and pastiche are debatable. So too the relationship between these terms and satire and comedy can be murky. It could be claimed, for instance, that parody seeking to satirize differs from burlesque by the depth of the parody’s technical penetration. Likewise, where travesty treats dignified subjects as trivial, parody may be distinguished by its more merciless exposure of its victim’s shortcomings of manner and thought. As a form of literature, parody can also be understood as a form of literary criticism, in that it represents a considered response to a literary text or texts. Successful parody cannot be written without a thorough appreciation of the work that it mimics, regardless of the parodist’s intent.","“Gulliver’s Travels” is an extraordinary work of social parody. Quick’s age was a time of egotistical lack of concern. Defilement was wild and the general population were as yet quite content with their lives. Accordingly, Jonathan Swift tears the cover of conceited lack of concern off which had blinded the general population to real issues of the society. In “Gulliver’s Travels”, there is satire on legislative issues, human physiognomy, keenness, conduct and ethical quality (Downie, 1977).\nIn the main voyage to Lilliput, Swift ridicules on governmental issues and political strategies observed in England through Lilliputians, the dwarfs of six inches. He mocks the way in which political workplaces were granted by English King in his time. Flimnap, the Treasurer, imitates Sir Robert Walpole who was the Prime Minister of England. Moving on tight ropes symbolizes Walpole’s aptitude in parliamentary strategies and political interests. The old sanctuary, in which Gulliver is housed in Lilliput, alludes to Westminster Hall in which Charles I was sentenced to death. The three fine silk strings granted as prizes to the champs allude to the different refinements given by English King to his top picks (Marchall, 2014).\nGulliver’s record of the inconvenience of the Empress of Lilliput on smothering flame in her room is Swift’s ironical method for depicting Queen Anne’s anger at him on writing “A Tale of a Tub”. Swift’s satire gets to be distinctly entertaining when Gulliver talks about the tussle between the Big Endians and the Little Endians. In this record Swift is disparaging the feud between the Roman Catholics and the Protestants. High Heel and Low Heel speak to Whig and Tory – two political gatherings in England.\nGulliver’s Travels reflects clashes in British society in the mid eighteenth century. By portraying Gulliver’s enterprises in Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and Houyhnhnm, the novel uncovers and scrutinizes sins and defilement of British elite class and their barbarous abuse towards individuals of Britain and neighboring nations in the capital-amassing time of British history. Gulliver is dealt with differently in various nations (Marshall). The writer portrays each circumstance at awesome length, which makes readers have a craving for encountering them actually. The significance of the work lies in the creator’s capable utilization of bitting and significant satire. Swift makes sarcastic impacts by utilizing incongruity, differentiation, and imagery. The story depends on the then British social reality. He not just mocks on the then British governmental issues and religion, but, in a more profound aspect, on human instinct itself. Quick’s great rendering of satires leads Gulliver’s Travels to turning into a point of reference gazed up to by the people who aspire to write satire (Downie).\nThere are no less than three sorts of sarcastic methods displayed in Gulliver’s Travels, that is, verbal, situational and emotional ironies. To start with, verbal irony implies utilizing words in an inverse way. The genuine suggested importance is contrary to the exacting significance of the lines in verbal irony. At the end of the day, it utilizes positive, commendatory words to depict clearly appalling and unpleasant matters so as to express the writer’s hatred and repugnance. The book conveys verbal irony from the earliest starting point to the finish of the story. Second, situational irony happens when there are clashes amongst characters and circumstance, or disagreement between readers’ desire and real results of an occasion, or deviation between individual attempts and target actualities. In Gulliver’s Travels, the plot advancement is regularly the opposite perusers anticipate. Third, sensational irony is when words and activities have an essentialness that the audience or group of onlookers sees, however the speaker or character does not (Kelly et al, 1976).\nSwift, likewise, utilizes contrast as a logical gadget to develop mocking impacts. With a specific end goal to achieve the reason for humor, he assembles conflicting subjects to portray and think about. There are no less than three obvious sets of contrasting subjects. To start with is Gulliver and Lilliputians. They contrast immensely in figures and in characters. The tallness of Gulliver’s body surpasses Lilliputians’ in the extent of twelve to one. As to character contrasts, Gulliver is thoughtful-hearted and appreciative with a feeling of equity, while Lilliputians are all the craftier. They need to make full utilization of Gulliver in the war battled with its clashing nation: Blefuscu.\nHe helps them against intrusion from it however declines to serve for them in their expansionist designs. Second, in Part II, figures of the subjects and Gulliver’s again shape an unmistakable difference. In Brobdingnag, he is placed in a carriage and conveyed to the commercial center to play out his tricks. He tries to satisfy those goliaths by demonstrating to them his little coins and perform tricks with his sword. He collides with the Queen’s most loved diminutive person and they conspire against each other. Then again, the scholarly King of Brobdingnag represents his nation with reason, sound judgment, equity and leniency (Kelling, 1952). The political framework in Brobdingnag is exceptionally perfect and systematic, in which law ensures opportunity and welfare of the nationals. Gulliver acquaints with the King his country’s (England) general public and political framework and adorns reality. He depicts how awesome England is. Nonetheless, he could scarcely shield himself confronting the King’s inquiry. Also, the examination between the King’s liberal administration and control under England’s common class uncovers defilement of its legislative issues. Third, the elite class of the nation of the Houyhnhnms are steed like creatures of reason, equity and trustworthiness, though the ruled class (Yahoos) are grievous, covetous and aggressive animals. The complexity between the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos is extraordinary.\nThe steeds are spotless and sweet-noticing; their eating regimen is mild and vegan (Kelling, 1952). Their propensities constitute the restraint that the eighteenth century thought described sensible man. The Yahoos, then again, are human in frame and highlight. They are dingy and they stink. They are omnivorous however appear to favor meat and waste.\nSatire alludes to a classification of writing which is regularly utilized by artistic people as a witty weapon to hold up indecencies, indiscretions and inadequacies in a general public to scorn, normally with the plan of deriding people or society into change. Samuel Johnson (1709-84) characterized satire as ‘a ballad in which insidiousness or imprudence is rebuffed’. Other than the way that few, assuming any, would these days limit satire to verse, whatever is left of the definition functions admirably enough. Parody denounces, either clearly or clandestinely, what it accepts to not be right, by and large with a view to accomplishing change. It works best when there is general understanding among its perusers about what is correct or typical. It might be coordinated against an individual, a gathering or humankind when all is said in done (Bullard).\nIrony, criticism, spoof, mockery, embellishment are basic humorous procedures, among which the first one is the most widely recognized one. As a noteworthy method of parody, irony includes a distinction or difference amongst appearance and reality – that is an error between what has all the earmarks of being valid and what truly is valid. Three sorts of incongruity have been perceived since relic. To start with, sensational irony gets from established Greek writing and from theater. It alludes to a circumstance in which the group of onlookers has information denied to at least one of the characters in front of an audience. As it were, sensational irony happens when a character states something that they accept to be valid yet that the reader knows is not valid.\nThe way to sensational irony is the reader’s premonition of coming occasions. Second or all the more reading of stories frequently increments emotional irony on account of learning that was absent in the primary reading. For instance, in Twelfth Night by Shakespeare, Malvolio’s expectations of a splendid future get from a letter which the group of onlookers knows to be faked. Second, verbal irony, here and there known as phonetic irony, happens when individuals say the opposite they truly mean. In this manner, it regularly conveys two implications: the express significance and a frequently deriding importance running counter to the first. This is likely the most well-known sort of irony.\nThird, Socratic irony takes its name from the old Greek essayist Socrates, who frequently in his thoughtful discoursed asks obviously silly inquiries which really move the civil argument toward the path he needs. These days, two further originations have been included: basic incongruity and sentimental incongruity. The first is incorporated with writings in a manner that both the surface importance and more profound ramifications are available pretty much all through. A standout amongst the most widely recognized methods for accomplishing basic irony is using a storyteller, whose basic and direct remarks are at difference with the peruser’s understanding. Swift applies this procedure in Gulliver’s Travels by setting Gulliver as the storyteller of the stories. In Romantic irony, scholars contrive with readers to share the twofold vision of what is occurring in the plot of a novel, film, and so forth. In this type of composing, the author sets up the universe of his content, and after that intentionally undermines it by reminding the peruser that it is just a type of hallucination (Downie).\nGulliver’s Travels is profound in substance, as well as significance. His satires about humankind in the four books are at their finest. Satire is both certainly and unequivocally developed all through the four books. Appall for human gradually increments as the story continues. The enormity of this novel does not clearly lie in Swifitian parody. The entire novel resembles a mirror by which human defects are reflected. It most likely would long have been overlooked if the book did not convey basic contemplation about human beings.\nDownie, J.

This independence allows robotic cleaners to operate at peak efficiency, even when the pump or filter is dirty or off.\nRobotic pool cleaners include brand names like Aquabot, Aquatron, Aquavac, Dirt Devil or Dolphin. All of these devices share the characteristic of a belt driven rover, with two internal motors - a pump motor and a drive motor. The pump motor does the vacuuming and keeps the suction close to the floor and the wall, while the drive motor is connected to pullies and belts that propel the cleaner forward and in reverse.\nRobot pool cleaners operate on low voltage, plug a transformer into any 115v outlet, and plug your cleaner cord into the power box to send 24 volts to the pool cleaner to power the motors. A distinct advantage to the robotic pool cleaner is that while it vacuums, it also filters. The internal debris bag, made of a fine mesh, traps particles as fine as 2 microns, reducing the work load of your filter and chemicals.\nUsually reliable, robot pool cleaners will from time to time refuse to move, or turn on, or clean the entire pool upon demand. Here's some tips on what to check when your robotic pool cleaner takes a day off.\n- Robotic Cleaner is not moving:\n- Is there water being pushed out of the top of the unit?\ni. YES: Power is reaching the unit. The water flow should be strong and steady.\n1. Turn over unit and look on the side where the drive motor makes contact with the drive pulley.\n2. Check the tension on the drive belts that run over the pulley.\n3. Check that the pulley fits snugly in the side plate and is making contact with the drive motor pin on the other side of the pulley.\nii. NO: Power may not be reaching the unit. Check for:\n1. Indicator Light on the power supply.\n2. Reset button on the power supply.\n3. Fuse on the power supply.\n4. Outlet plugged into has power, not tripped.\n5. Cord from cleaner is snugly plugged in.\n6. Wiggle cord near unit, esp. where it connects to cleaner. Broken internal cord wiring can be a cause.\n- Robotic Cleaner is moving slowly or not climbing walls.\n- Check for loose or worn drive belts, pulleys, rollers.\n- Check for loose wheel tubes or missing bushings.\n- Check for worn drive tracks or wheel tube brushes.\n- Check that cleaner bag is not needing to be cleaned.\n- Check internal floatation pieces.\n- Robotic Cleaner Cord is tangling\n- Check your hose floats are well spaced and floating.\n- Lay in sun straight an uncoiled for a day\n- Coil up from the cleaner toward the cable plug end.\n- Position cord floats over crimped sections.\nIf you would like to Guest Post on our Pool Blog ~ or for permission to repost our Pool Blog on\nyour website, please contact the author by the email link at the top of the page.

{"question":"What are the different reasons for getting dental crowns, and how do missing teeth affect overall dental health if left untreated?","answer":"Dental crowns are placed for multiple reasons: to support large fillings when there isn't enough tooth remaining, to attach bridges, to protect weak teeth from fracturing, to restore fractured teeth, to cover badly shaped or discolored teeth, and to cover dental implants. As for untreated missing teeth, they can cause several serious issues. The remaining teeth will slowly shift to fill the gaps, which can lead to chewing problems and changes in bite alignment. This shifting can cause jaw soreness and make teeth harder to clean, potentially leading to tooth decay and gum disease. Additionally, missing teeth can result in other serious dental issues including bruxism, temporomandibular joint disorder, gum and bone loss, increased tooth decay, and periodontal disease.","context":["Crown & Bridge Restorations\nRebuilding The Perfect Smile\nWhy Do I Need a Crown ?\nIf you want your smile to be your crowning glory, you need healthy, attractive teeth. When they are cracked, stained or damaged, however, your teeth detract from your dental health and your appearance, too. To restore them, we may recommend crowns. The following will help answer some of the common questions you may have about crowns.\nWhat are crowns and why are they used ?\nA crown is a restoration that covers or caps a tooth to restore it to its normal shape and size. Its purpose is to strengthen or improve the appearance of a tooth. A crown is placed for a number of reasons:\nTo support a large filling when there isn’t enough tooth remaining\nTo attach a bridge\nTo protect weak teeth from fracturing\nTo restore fractured teeth\nTo cover badly shaped or discolored teeth\nTo cover a dental implant\nWhich material is best ?\nBoth the “look” and function of your crowns are considered when choosing the materials most suitable for you. Your dentist will consider the tooth location, the position of the gum tissue, the amount of tooth that shows when you smile, the color or shade of the tooth and the function of the tooth.\nCrowns are made from a number of materials, Gold alloys or non-precious alloys, porcelain or ceramic, acrylic or composite resin or combinations of these materials may be used. Porcelain attached to a durable metal shell is commonly used because of its strength. Crowns made entirely of porcelain may look better; however, they usually aren’t as strong. In the process of making the crown, the porcelain is colored to blend in with your natural teeth.\nHow is a crown placed ?\nSeveral steps are involved in placing a crown. Usually at least two visits are necessary. We will prepare the tooth by removing the outer portion of your tooth to accommodate the thickness of the crown. If the tooth has a filling, part of the material may be left in place to serve as a foundation for the crown. An impression is made to provide an exact model of the prepared tooth. Our dental laboratory, following the instructions from us, will then make the crown from the model.\n” Temporary ” crowns (often made of acrylic resins) are placed while the permanent crown is made. If the shape or length of your teeth are changed for cosmetic purpose, for example, temporary crowns will allow you to become accustomed to this change. They can also help you decide if you like what you see or if there are any changes that you would like made before the permanent crowns are placed.\nWhen the permanent crown is ready, we will put it in place and make the necessary adjustment. To see how your crown will look, you can use a large mirror held at arms length in various types of lighting. When you are satisfied with your appearance, the crown will be cemented in place.\nWhat will the finished crown look like ?\nOne of your dentist’s main goals is to create crowns that look like natural teeth. To achieve this, a number of factors are considered such as the color, occlusion or ” bite, ” shape and length of both your natural teeth and of the artificial crown. Any one of these factors alone can significantly affect your appearance.\nIf you have a certain look in mind for your crown, discuss it with us on your initital visit. When the procedure is complete, your teeth may not only be stronger but they may be the attractive feature of your face – your crowning glory.\nBridging The Gap\nA bridge is a way to replace one or more missing teeth. Replacing missing teeth makes it easier to chew. It can improve your appearance. It also helps keep your teeth, gums, and jaws healthy.\nA conventional bridge has replacement teeth that are attached to crowns. The crowns are placed over the natural teeth on either side of the space to be filled.\nA Maryland bridge has replacement teeth that are attached to the back of nearby natural teeth using a wing. This type of bridge may be an option if the teeth next to the bridge are in good condition.\nWhy a Bridge ?\nSpaces left by missing teeth affect the rest of your teeth. These gaps can cause chewing problems. If even one tooth is missing, other teeth may slowly shift out of place. This changes the way your teeth fit together (your bite). A poor bite may make your jaw sore. Your teeth may become harder to clean, leading to tooth decay and gum disease. Shifting teeth may change your smile.\nThis information is provided to assist you in making choices about restorations for your posterior teeth (bicuspids and molars.)\nhave been used for many decades for the highly successful restoration of posterior teeth. They are nontoxic, wear similarly to tooth enamel when opposed by natural teeth, and are soft enough that years of use allow them to “wear in” much like natural teeth. Well-placed cast gold restorations usually have longevity of several decades in-patients without peculiar tooth grinding habits (bruxism, clenching). In mouths with severe wear patterns, gold is the material of choice, because gold is strong yet soft.\nHowever, gold is not tooth colored, and in many situations, it cannot be used because it creates unsightly display of metal. You will be advised if gold could be used in your mouth without significant display. Since gold alloys are expensive, a considerable portion of the cost of the restoration is to cover the cost of the metal. When esthetically possible, cast gold is the longest lasting, strongest type of posterior tooth restoration.\nPorcelain-fused-to metal restoration has been in service for about 30 years. They are a metal coping (thimble), with tooth-colored porcelain baked onto it. Such restorations can be as beautiful as natural teeth when placed in the mouth. These restorations are strong and very lifelike, but they have some negative characteristics.\nThey usually are not acceptable for patients with tooth grinding habits (bruxism or clenching), because they may crack or break under enormous stress. They wear opposing natural teeth in patients with grinding habits. Extreme stress (ice chewing, bones, cherry pits, etc.) can break the porcelain from the metal.\nHowever, in most patients, porcelain-fused-to metal restorations provide excellent, beautiful, long lasting posterior tooth restorations. Unless gold alloy copings are required, porcelain-fused-to metal restorations are slightly less in cost than cast gold restorations.\nAll Ceramic restorations are now available. They do not have any cast metal in them. These are fired or cast porcelain, or other ceramics. These restorations called aluminous porcelain, IPS Empress, Procera, Dicor, Optec, Hi-Ceram, Willie crowns, and others are highly esthetic and are most indicated for persons with metal allergies. They are suggested only for single crowns and not for multiple units connected together. Their strength is not as high as porcelain-fused-to metal restorations. Cost is similar to porcelain-fused-to metal crowns, or may be somewhat higher.","Missing teeth are more than a cosmetic issue. When you have missing teeth, it can become difficult to chew or speak properly. In time, if the teeth are not replaced, your remaining teeth will move to fill the gaps, pulling out of their pockets. This can be quite painful and may lead to other serious dental issues such as bruxism, temporomandibular joint disorder, gum and bone loss, increased tooth decay and periodontal disease. When you are missing multiple teeth, a dental bridge can be used to fill the gap to prevent these issues from occurring.\nA dental bridge works similarly to a dental implant or removable partial denture. There are several different types of fixed dental bridges for you and your dentist to choose from based on your unique situation. For cantilever and conventional dental bridges, the teeth on either side of the gap will need to be properly shaped and prepared for a dental crown that will be used to anchor the fixed dental bridge into place. In cases where the missing teeth are the visible front teeth, a resin-bonded bridge may be used. This requires less tooth enamel to be removed, but it can only be used in areas where the gums and anchoring teeth are healthy.\nDeciding Which Dental Bridge Is Right for You\nOnce our dentist has determined that a fixed dental bridge is the correct restoration to replace your missing teeth, he will discuss which type of dental bridge is best suited to your situation. You will also be allowed to choose the materials your dental bridge will be made from, as well as select the proper shade for these materials to allow the restoration to blend with your natural teeth. The materials you can choose from will depend on the area of your mouth where the dental bridge will be placed, the dental laboratory that will be making your restoration, and whether or not you suffer from bruxism. In most cases, your dental bridge will be created from a combination of porcelain and metal. If you are allergic to metals, your bridge can be created from materials such as zirconia or alumina.\nCreating and Placing the Dental Bridge\nIn order for the dental laboratory to create your dental bridge, our dentist will take impressions and x-rays of your teeth. In some cases, photos may be taken as well. All of these will be used to help the laboratory plan and create a unique restoration. In most cases, your bridge will consist of anchor crowns on either side of the gap joined by a piece of metal that will hold the replacement teeth.\nBefore the impressions for your restoration can be taken, your anchoring teeth will need to be properly prepared for the crowns. A local anesthetic will be used to numb the area around the teeth to be prepared. Then, a small amount of your tooth enamel will be removed in order to roughen the surface of the teeth, allowing the dental crowns to be properly bonded. If your teeth are not healthy enough, they will need to be treated and restored before your dental bridge can be placed.\nA model of your teeth will then be made using a special material with a putty-like consistency. This provides the dental laboratory a model of the area where the dental bridge will be placed, allowing them to create a restoration that will fit snugly but comfortably into the gap. This will take up to eight weeks to create so you will be given a temporary bridge to wear. Once our office has received your permanent dental bridge, you will return to our office and it will be cemented into place.\nCaring for Your Dental Bridge Properly\nOnce your dental bridge has been cemented into place, you will be given a list of care instructions. This will ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy and that your restoration lasts as long as possible. Our office will provide you with a special flossing instrument to use around the dental bridge daily. In addition, you may be advised to use a special brushing technique and toothpaste to prevent plaque and tartar buildup.\nYour dental bridge will also need to be checked regularly to ensure that it still fits properly and remains free from damage. This will be simple as long as you continue to maintain a bi-annual schedule of visits to our office for checkups and cleanings. If you find any damage or discoloration on your bridge, you will need to contact our office right away for repair.\nIf you have any questions about dental bridges, or if you would like to see if you might be a good candidate for a dental bridge restoration, contact our office today for a consultation. Our goal is to help all of our patients achieve their healthiest, brightest smile, and we look forward to answering any questions you might have."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38afd002-0d8b-4a3b-b1f5-9e8089b3a63b>","<urn:uuid:e3a0c26b-a6a3-4653-87d9-14b5ad984ff5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How big is case of Lady Diver watch? どのくらいの大きさですか?","answer":"The Lady Diver has a 39mm case size, crafted in 18K rose gold with 40 individually set diamonds on its bezel.","context":["Ulysse Nardin Lady Diver 39mm\nUlysse Nardin’s connection to sea exploration began in the 19th century, when the brand crafted precision marine chronometers to aid sailors’ navigation on the open seas. Today, of course, modern seafaring navigation doesn’t require onboard mechanical marine chronometers, so there is no longer any demand for them (except for collectors).\nWe’re at about the century mark for water-resistant wristwatches, and for decades top brands have consistently improved upon their water-resistant and diver watches.\nOne of those brands is Ulysse Nardin Lady Diver 39mm. Counting the three new diving watches detailed below, the brand offers 38 different timepieces in the Diver collection. The breadth of this collection and its myriad style options offers a timepiece to suit almost any taste and level of marine activity.\nThe largest of the new pieces, the Diver Chronometer 44mm (ref. 1185-170-3/BLUE), offers complications not usually associated with diver “tool” watches. In addition to the essential unidirectional rotating bezel for timing dives, the 44mm watch has a power reserve indicator and a combination small seconds-date indicator at 6 o’clock.\nThe case is titanium with a blue PVD (physical vapor deposition) coating. The bezel is also blue, with 18K rose gold numerals, indices, and outer ring. The watch’s hands and hour indices are also rose gold, with a rich coating of glow-in-the-dark Super-LumiNova. A blue rubber strap with a blued titanium buckle completes the elegant yet rugged look of the timepiece.\nSecond in size is the Diver 42mm watch (ref. 8163-175/GREY-5N) in a rich grey that Ulysse Nardin calls “shark grey.” Powered by the calibre UN-816 automatic movement, the watch has 18K rose gold accents on its bezel, and its hour indices and hands are coated with Super-LumiNova. Also, its sandblasted grey dial features a relatively undersized date at 6 o’clock so that it doesn’t distract from the hands or bezel.\nOverall, the watch, priced at $10,400, has a stealthy look to it, with its grey matte satin-finished case, grey rubber bezel, and grey alligator strap. Stealthiness is essential for sharks on the hunt, making “shark grey” quite an apt name for the watch’s color.\nDazzling diamonds are the focal point of the third new model, the Lady Diver 39mm (ref. 8162-182B1-0A/3A). The watch’s case is crafted of rich 18K rose gold, with 40 individually set diamonds on its bezel. Moreover, the new model has an opalescent mother-of-pearl dial, a nod to the ocean’s riches. Diamonds also serve as hour markers for the watch, and it has a small date at 6 o’clock.\nFor all its sparkle, the new Ulysse Nardin Lady Diver 39mm – available for $25,800 on either a white rubber or alligator strap – packs plenty of watchmaking power with its calibre UN-816 automatic movement.\nLast but not least, the 15-piece Ulysse Nardin Diver Chronometer 44mm Beau Lake Limited Edition is the result of a design partnership between the two brands, both of which are dedicated to ultimate hand craftsmanship.\nThis limited edition is almost identical to the new Diver Chronometer we already discussed, but the Ulysse Nardin x Beau Lake model bears both brand names on the dial. Plus, the $16,300 limited edition watch comes with a rosewood-wrapped, custom 11’6” Malibu paddle board featuring Ulysse Nardin’s anchor logo. All of Beau Lake’s products “blend vintage aesthetics with high performance,” according to the brand. And the Malibu’s design inspiration comes from “Gibson guitars and ‘50s surf culture.” Also included are a matching Ulysse Nardin Lady Diver 39mm-embossed paddle and a travel bag.\nUlysse Nardin and Beau Lake share “a love of life on the water, a sense of adventure, and appreciation for history,” the brands said in a statement, and it shows!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5c760101-a9ba-4c1a-8cd9-5220e250b1bb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did ancient civilizations use clay for writing, and what recent experimental approaches are helping scholars understand these writing techniques?","answer":"Ancient civilizations around the eastern Mediterranean used clay as a reusable natural resource for writing, with different regions developing distinct traditions and methods. In Mesopotamia, they used cuneiform, while the Aegean used Linear A and B. Modern scholars are using practical experiments and hands-on studies to better understand these ancient writing techniques. For example, researchers have experimented with different implements and methods for writing on clay tablets, and conducted hands-on studies of artifacts like the Amarna Letters at the British Museum to understand the physical characteristics and practical techniques used in their creation.","context":["Cuneiform Texts of the 4th and 3rd Millennium in the Hermitage Collection\nThe Hermitage Collection contains about 2000 cuneiform texts of the 4th and 3rd millennium B.C. These are mainly administrative and legal documents from various archives, but including some royal inscriptions. The latter will be outside the scope of this presentation, so we are left with 194 administrative texts; the majority of these (1576) are, as usual, Ur III documents, the rest include 2 proto-cuneiform tablets, 343 pre-Sargonic Lagash/ED IIIb texts, 21 Old Akkadian documents from different sites and 3 Lagash II tablets.\nAll the texts found their way into the museum through the antiquities market, or were assumed from private collections. The first cuneiform tablets were purchased by the Royal Hermitage Museum at the end of the 19th century from a well known French antiquities dealer, M. Sivadzhan. The next acquisitions were made by the State Hermitage Museum after the October revolution of 1917. Some tablets were purchased, others simply confiscated from private collectors.\nThe Likhachev collection\nWe do not know exactly what happened to Likhachev’s cuneiform collection after the revolution. In 1918 the main part of his collection was transferred to the State Museum of Paleography, and after this museum was closed in 1938 the objects were moved to the Hermitage Museum. But before the move of the private collection into the state museum, Likhachev sold some cuneiform tablets to the Soviet government. As a result, more than 1300 tablets were moved to Moscow at the end of 1917 and later became part of the collection of the Pushkin Fine Arts Museum. Interestingly enough, most of the texts edited by M. Nikolski in 1915 (Old Akkadian and Ur III documents) were among those moved to Moscow. The reason was probably the better state of preservation of these texts in comparison to those left in Petrograd. You will now find only one Ur III tablet, one Old Akkadian document (only obverse is published by Nikolski) and two Ur III clay tags from the Nikolski edition (DV 5 = Nik 2) in the Hermitage collection.\nThe Hermitage collection of early cuneiform\nIn 1908 M. Nikolski edited 322 administrative documents from pre-Sargonic Lagash/ED IIIb (Nik 1; ca. 2400-2350 B.C.); most of these tablets are now in the Hermitage collection and were republished in 1989 by G. Selz (FAOS 15/1), with the addition of three texts edited first by A. Riftin in 1929. G. Selz also republished two “Nikolski tablets” in ASJ 16, 207ff. The collection contains 30 unpublished ED IIIb documents. Of the four legal documents of this period in the Hermitage collection (all published by D. Edzard in SRU), the most interesting are two “House sale contracts” (SRU 33 and 34) written on hollow clay nails. Unfortunately, both texts are damaged. The Hermitage possesses two of six known ED IIIb letters (s. B. Kienast - K. Volk, SAB asGir2 and asGir3). Worth mentioning are a wide variety of tags and labels in our collection, including so called “pisan-dub-ba”-labels (7) and “Tonoliven” of Urukagina (4).\nAll but one Old Akkadian tablets in the Hermitage collection remain unpublished. We have 21 documents of this period: seven probably from Umma, four probably from Girsu, the rest of unknown provenience. One tablet of unknown provenience—a letter written in Sumerian—is edited by N. Koslova in Fs Kienast (2003), 239ff. One more letter of the same period in our collection—probably from Girsu but written in Akkadian—remains unpublished. A very interesting text dated to the Old Akkadian period deserves mention here, although strictly speaking it does not belong to the sphere of the CDLI project; it is a hexahedral prism with the name of Lugalušumgal, ruler of Lagash, on one face, the other five being inscribed with the first 38 lines of the Standard Profession List (Lú A). This object was published by V. Shilejko in 1915 in his book Votive Inscriptions of Sumerian Rulers because he believed it to be an inscription of Lugalušumgal. In the full edition of “Lú = ša” (MSL 12), our prism is mentioned as source S from Lagash/Girsu: the first side contains lines 1-19 of the list, the sides 2, 3, 4 and 5 are completely identical with lines 20-38, side 6 contains the colophon: “Nisaba! Lugalušumgal, scribe, ruler (ensi2) of Lagash.”\nThe Ur III part of the Hermitage collection contains 1008 texts from Umma, 406 from Drehem, 84 from Girsu, just six from Nippur and none from Ur. I have been unable to identify the provenience of 72 tablets. The modest number of Girsu texts may be due to the way the Likhachev collection was divided after 1917: the Pushkin Museum possesses several hundred Ur III documents from Girsu; why they were selectively moved to Moscow is unknown. As for different Drehem archives, we have about 25 texts from the archive of Šulgi-simtī and two from the Treasury archive, the rest coming from the main royal archive.\nPublications of the Ur III texts\n2) Since 1991, the project of publishing the entire Ur III collection in 4 volumes:\n3) There are, finally, four Ur III letters in the Hermitage collection, edited elsewhere (N. Koslova, Fs Kienast  239ff.) together with one Old Akkadian letter mentioned above.\nState of digitization\nThe full catalogue of the collection, the transliterations of documents as well as the glossaries are being prepared now. The collection, its digital library website, and its integration into the general datasets of the CDLI, was presented on 30 October 2003 by Natalya Koslova and Peter Damerow at the Proceedings of the 5th Russian Conference on Digital Libraries in St. Petersburg (a copy of the contribution is available for download here).","Happy International Lego Classicism Day to all our friends and colleagues! In celebration this year, I have been working on something special: a re-imagining of the cover art from John Chadwick’s The Mycenaean World book, in a 3D Lego model. Far from a just-for-fun exercise, this actually has some helpful practical applications in making us question what Mycenaean scribes did at work, and how Linear B archives functioned.\nMy research has taken a fun turn towards practical experiments lately, as some of our Twitter followers may have noticed. It isn’t just because I wanted to get away from the computer (though I did…); it’s because I have been working on a problem where direct evidence is scarce and/or difficult to interpret, and where experimentation is surprisingly elucidating.\nWe know that during the Bronze Age a number of civilisations around the eastern Mediterranean were using clay to write on. From Mesopotamian cuneiform to Linear A and B in the Aegean, people found that this reusable natural resource provided a vital tool for making records. But they didn’t all use it in the same way, and they didn’t all use the same implements or methods to write on it – instead traditions of writing display considerable regional differences, whether or not there might have been any influences from one place to another. Continue reading “What to write with? Styli for clay tablets in the ancient Aegean and eastern Mediterranean”\nWe’ve talked a lot on this blog about how important it is to think about ancient writing in its physical capacity – as part of an object – not just as text. This is why we’re so keen on trying out ancient writing techniques for ourselves. But it’s not just making new things; it’s looking at real ancient tablets with an eye for their material characteristics and the practical techniques used to make them.\nLast week I was lucky enough to visit the British Museum for a hands-on study session with some of the most famous tablets of the Near Eastern Bronze Age – the Amarna Letters.\nOur series of blog posts on objects in our special writing-themed display at the Fitzwilliam Museum is drawing to an end, with just three objects left. This week the spotlight is on a replica clay tablet inscribed in Linear A, which I made as part of a practical writing experiment.\nThis week in our look through the objects in the CREWS exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, we’re shining the spotlight on one of our replicas, this Ugaritic tablet I made last summer. There are lots of reasons why we’ve included replica items in the exhibition. Partly it lets us show off writing systems for which genuine ancient examples are hard to come by and which we wouldn’t otherwise be able to include. But they also have an important research role. Continue reading “CREWS Display: Replica Ugaritic Tablet”\nFor this week’s inscription post based on our CREWS display at the Fitzwilliam Museum, we’re going to be revisiting ancient Cyprus – this time in a much earlier period than we discussed for the Idalion Bilingual. This little item might look unassuming (it’s only a couple of centimetres in diameter, don’t be fooled by the photo!), but it is very important for trying to understand the earlier development of writing on Cyprus.\nImage courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum.\nThe item in question is a small ball made of clay, with writing in what we call the “Cypro-Minoan” script around the outside, which is on loan to us from the British Museum. It was found at the Cypriot site of Hala Sultan Tekke, in the island’s south-east. Continue reading “CREWS Display: A Cypro-Minoan Clay Ball”\nPhilip has just given an interview for Atlas Obscura, all about his adventures in making Ugaritic cookies. As regular readers will know, this is more than just baking – this is a lovely opportunity to work on replica Ugaritic cuneiform tablets, think about how they were inscribed, and then eat the results afterwards!\nYou can read the article here:\nWe recently had the pleasure of being involved in a number of outreach events organised through the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. That meant talking to the public about our work and showing people (especially groups of children) how to write in ancient writing systems. These are more than ‘just’ outreach events for us – they are a valuable opportunity to put our theoretical work into practice and share it with others!\nYou don’t have to be present at these events to join in! If trying your hand at ancient writing appeals to you, have a look at our ‘write your name’ sheets HERE. Currently available are the ‘standard’ Greek alphabet, the Cretan alphabet, Phoenician, Ugaritic cuneiform, Linear B and Egyptian hieroglyphics. They can be downloaded and used for free so please do have a look and try writing your name or a message.\nFirst up was the Prehistory and Archaeology Day organised by the McDonald Institute in Cambridge. This was a big event with all sorts of different activities, where the opportunity to learn an ancient writing system was just one of the possibilities on offer. Philip helped to run a drop-in stall (alongside colleagues from Archaeology and Classics) showing people how to write in Ugaritic and Akkadian cuneiform as well as other scripts. The practical element to this was not only learning to write in these scripts but also using a stylus to write something on a clay tablet.\nPhilip’s post about the Prehistory and Archaeology Day last Saturday – and the problem of finding the right stylus for writing Ugaritic cuneiform in clay.\nAbout a year ago I posted a series following my attempts to write Ugaritic cuneiform, first in plasticine and then in clay. I ended up using the square end of a chopstick for a stylus, and this is what I’ve been doing ever since, including in my cuneiform baking. It works, but it’s fiddly – the stick has to be held just right to make the wedge-shaped prints, and it takes practice to stop them being large and clumsy.\nLast weekend I took part in a Prehistory and Archaeology Day as part of Cambridge University’s Festival of Ideas. Hosted by Cambridge Archaeological Unit, this offered hundreds of members of the public – mostly children – the chance to try their hands at a wide range of archaeology-related activities, from spear-throwing and archery to excavation and osteology. The ancient writing systems stall was particularly eclectic, with academics from the Faculty of…\nView original post 346 more words\nTerm-time has recently finished here, and the CREWS project team has been taking part in some rather jolly end-of-term activities.\nThe first was the final session of the ‘Linear A self-help group’, a series of seminars we have been running where a number of colleagues working on Linear A or related scripts have been presenting their work and discussing their ideas. For the final meeting, we decided to have a practical session, and to try making our own inscriptions using modelling clay. You also can read about it on our colleague Anna Judson’s blog HERE.\nWhat are Linear A and Linear B?\nLinear A was used around the 19th-15th centuries BC, in Crete and some of the islands, to write an unknown language that we label ‘Minoan’ (we know the values of many signs, but still do not understand the language).\nLinear B was used around the 15th-13th centuries BC, in Crete and on the Greek mainland, to write an early form of Greek.\nWhy bother trying to make our own inscriptions? Well, actually there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the production of clay tablets in the ancient Aegean. How did the scribes achieve such detail in the more complex signs? What did they use to write with? How did they create the flat surface for writing on? Why are Linear B ‘palmleaf’ tablets (i.e. small elongated ones that can be held in the palm of the hand) curved on the back but flat on the top? We started off the session with an illuminating presentation by PhD student Ester Salgarella on some of these problems, and then we set about trying to answer some of them through a practical attempt at making our own tablets."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ffc80adc-7dde-4027-b278-3de4274f2381>","<urn:uuid:02fade76-9e80-4c83-bfca-f95e7452520f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál de estos edificios tiene un diseño más enfocado en la luz natural: the Walker Library in Minneapolis o the Kansas City Southern headquarters? 🤔 I'm curious about their architectural approaches!","answer":"Both buildings prioritize natural light but in different ways. The Walker Library features floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides and special 'sky cubes' with yellow glass that brings in changing light throughout the day and seasons. The Kansas City Southern headquarters uses an open office plan that allows plenty of natural light to flood the workspaces, particularly through its arched Palladian windows. The Walker Library's design specifically addressed previous issues with lack of natural light in its underground predecessor, while raising the floor five feet inside to allow readers to better enjoy the daylight.","context":["The Walker Library has a storied history. A Hennepin Country Library branch located in the bustling Minneapolis neighborhood of Uptown near H.W.S Cleveland’s famous Chain of Lakes park system, the original 1911 building was a stately Beaux Arts design. In 1981, one of the country’s few underground public libraries, and the city’s first earth-sheltered building, was constructed across the street.\nA lack of natural light, water seepage, and accessibility issues plagued the subterranean structure. After years of discussion among stakeholders, the Hennepin County Library commissioned the Minneapolis firm VJAA to design a new, above ground 30,000-square-foot building, using the existing pit left after demolition for a 15,000-square-foot parking lot beneath the library.\nAmong the stakeholders was an active Community Advisory Committee, which crafted a vision statement that guided VJAA. Key among the committee’s concerns was “getting the library out of the ground and up into the light,” said Lois Lenroot-Ernt, of Hennepin County Library’s Capital Projects Office. The building also needed to have “a strong civic presence.”\nOn April 26, an airy new library, with a simple modern form and floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, opened to community acclaim. “We met those objectives,” said Lenroot-Ernt of the vision statement. “The building makes a statement of its own, but fits beautifully into the community.”\nThe one-story library (storage is on a lower level) sits at the corner of Hennepin and Lagoon avenues—a major thoroughfare for vehicles, transit, pedestrians, and bicyclists. So the architects moved the entry to the park side to relate better to the original library and the adjacent VJAA-designed park, and “let the flow of traffic wrap around the building,” said Vincent James, a VJAA principal.\nAt the same time, the architects ensured that the library would respond to and re-establish the corner by widening the sidewalk, canting a lower pane of glass in response to the flow, and putting a bend in the upper part of the building. In doing so, “the library also makes a strong tie with rhythms and animation of people in the area and the street itself,” said Jennifer Yoos, another VJAA principal.\nThe steel-frame building is clad in precast and stainless steel shingles with a bronze patina “that picks up ambient colors of light and changes all the time,” said James. “Sky cubes” clad in patina-less stainless steel are fitted with yellow glass, “to bring in light that changes throughout the day and through the seasons, and makes things pop in the interior,” added Yoos.\nWhile many of the interior materials are matte and muted, including the FSC-certified walnut, the white trusses, and magenta, bright blue, and grass green walls “play with the austere walnut surfaces,” said Yoos. “Because it’s a simple building, and Uptown is an eclectic and vibrant neighborhood with lots of cultural diversity, we didn’t want to bring a highly restrained aesthetic to the library’s interior.”\nVJAA did, however, raise the floor five feet inside so readers can enjoy the daylight and the quiet of a library, “but experience a flow of energy and traffic and people around them that’s hypnotizing,” said Yoos. The raised floor also houses ventilation displacement cooling attached to a high-performance heating and cooling system with energy recovery.\nOverhangs protect the front of the building from heat gain, while electric shades inside regulate heat and light. In addition to reading areas, the new library includes additional computers and an iPad dispensary, study areas, collaborative workspaces, conference rooms, a lecture/presentation room, and children and teen areas.\nUptown has an abundance of public spaces, including the Chain of Lakes parkways and the Midtown Greenway bike path. “But they’re all exterior,” said James. “Most of the interior spaces are private or business. We describe the new library as the living room of Uptown.”","A church steeple presiding over a flower-filled park, a town square bustling with shoppers, and, in the background, the lonesome whistle of a train: These images evoke a bygone era. Kansas City Southern, a transportation company founded in 1887 and based in Kansas City, MO, has recently returned to its railroad roots. Its newly constructed headquarters reinforces the company’s history and relates to Kansas City’s rich past.\nAs the country grew, so did Kansas City Southern. In the 1990s, the company’s operations greatly expanded and departments were scattered in several facilities. Present-day, the new headquarters facility needed to consolidate people and services, as well as reflect the company’s move from a financial institution back to its primary transportation mission. “By 1999, it became evident that our company, Kansas City Industries, was going through a change. We decided when that split took place we should have our own headquarters,” says Mike Haverty, chairman, president, CEO, Kansas City Southern.\nThe company worked with Kansas City, MO-based developer and building owner Broadway Square Partners to select a site in Cathedral Square that suited its corporate needs and demonstrated the company’s loyalty to downtown Kansas City’s revitalization. Combined architectural team BNIM/CDFM2, Kansas City, MO, was brought in for shell design, tenant interior design, and contract administration; MC Lioness Realty Group LLC, Kansas City, MO, provided project management; and J.E. Dunn Construction, Kansas City, MO, provided general contracting services. Many members of the building team had worked together in the past and were able to draw on these experiences to ensure good communication and teamwork.\nAs a tenant, Kansas City Southern had very strong views on the style and presence of the new facility. “Our instructions to the architects were that we wanted a very modern headquarters, but one that when you looked at it you could tell that it was the home of a railroad,” says Haverty. The company insisted on the latest amenities in a nostalgic building that harkened back to the company’s long history in the region. “It was a spec office building, but it was really a build-to-suit,” says Peter Sloan, RA, RCID, project architect, CDFM2, Kansas City, MO.\nMarrying images of turn-of-the century technology with responsive, flexible workspaces presented many challenges. Moreover, the new facility was built over a four-level underground parking structure, which provides parking for the employees as well as the public. Situated near the historic residential district of Quality Hill, the new headquarters is bracketed by two stately cathedrals.\nMirroring the grand and gracefully traditional architecture of train stations, the headquarters features arched Palladian windows, cherry wood finishes, prepatinaed exterior copper accents, and granite and terra cotta tile flooring. Limestone accents and Quality Hill bricks complement the neighboring churches and residential buildings.\nAlong with the traditional trappings, the facility’s interior exceeds all of the tenants’ needs. The architectural teams researched Kansas City Southern’s work habits so the building’s layout could take advantage of greater efficiencies by consolidating departments. “There was a lot of work done to find out … the right [layout] and where each person should go,” says Sloan. Careful collaboration and scheduling allowed the project to be completed on time and on budget.\n“From a developer’s perspective this is a very marketable building,” says John Yacos, vice president, development, MC Lioness Realty Group LLC, Kansas City, MO. The facility operation team collaborated with the building team to make sure the structure could be easily and cost-effectively maintained. An open office plan allows plenty of natural light to flood the workspaces.\nOne of the challenges of the project was that five fountains with extensive landscaping were constructed above the underground garage. “That’s 40,000 square feet of landscape space, rainfall, and water from fountains that we have to make sure gets drained out,” says Chris Paris, project manager, J.E. Dunn Construction Co., Kansas City, MO. The landscaping visually connects the nearby cathedrals.\nWhile a prominent six-story clock tower on the company headquarters is reminiscent of grand old train stations, generous landscaping, replete with indigenous plants, encircles the train shed plaza deck and gives the lush site a mall appearance. A newly refurbished 1928 Pullman sleeper car resides on-site to serve as an intimate gathering place – and an elegant reminder of the company’s past. “There were several challenges here, and bringing in a train was a good one. We were able to design a lot of the constructionability and scheduling issues into the design of the building by working with the engineers,” says Tom Turner, J.E. Dunn general superintendent.\nInside, the connection to history continues, with museum cases that display Kansas City Southern artifacts. Old photographs, a pocket watch, fine bone china, and even a conductor’s hat once hidden in storage are now proudly shown in the facility’s Grand Hall. “The Grand Hall gives us the opportunity to display our rich history of all the years Kansas City Southern has been in Kansas City,” says Doug Banks, director, joint facilities and contracts, Kansas City Southern.\nAt the same time, the surrounding community has embraced the facility. The Grand Hall – complete with catering kitchen and accompanying lofty train shed – has welcomed many events. “It has become the No. 1 meeting venue in Kansas City,” says Haverty.\nIn a rapidly changing world, trains still hold a mystery and charm that no other transportation technology can touch. By relying on this mystique, the Kansas City Southern headquarters is a tribute to an innovative past and a classic interpretation of a forward-thinking facility.Regina Raiford Babcock (email@example.com) is senior editor at Buildings magazine."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:533f244a-f16b-42bd-bb1e-6fe72a9fbdcf>","<urn:uuid:94ecc785-f184-4fb1-9208-3441c53de8f7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a researcher studying diagnostic methods - what key differences exist between the shortened 7-question ADI-R assessment and the initial symptoms that typically lead parents to seek an autism diagnosis?","answer":"The shortened 7-question ADI-R focuses primarily on social-communicative behaviors, including comprehension of simple language, reciprocal conversation, imaginative play, social play with peers, direct gaze, group play, and age of first symptoms. In contrast, initial symptoms that typically prompt parents to seek diagnosis include a broader range of indicators like absence of babbling by 1 year, lack of single words by 16 months, no two-word combinations by 2 years, not responding to name, loss of language skills, inappropriate toy play, excessive lining up of objects, lack of pointing/showing, and absence of imitation. The shortened ADI-R notably focuses less on restricted and repetitive behaviors, while these are prominent early warning signs for parents.","context":["\"Deploying a variety of machine learning algorithms, we found one, the Alternating Decision Tree (ADTree), to have high sensitivity and specificity in the classification of individuals with autism from controls. The ADTree classifier consisted of only 7 questions, 93% fewer than the full ADI-R, and performed with greater than 99% accuracy when applied to independent populations of individuals with autism, misclassifying only one out of the 1962 cases used for validation\".\nInterested? The quote comes from this recent paper by Dennis Wall and colleagues* (full-text) following up some related research from this group based on another gold standard autism assessment schedule, the ADOS (see here).\nI'm not going to dwell too much on the study details aside from saying:\n- The ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised) is probably one of the more time and resource-intensive interview questionnaires used for the assessment of autism, coming in at 93 questions long and asking about current behaviour and 'most abnormal' (aged 4-5 years) if appropriate.\n- An abbreviated ADI-R would therefore be quite a useful measure in these austere times; particularly one which could maintain the same level of accuracy as completion of the full schedule.\n- Similar to their previous study, Wall and colleagues applied various machine learning algorithms (n=15) to ascertain whether any might be able to determine which ADI-R items are most relevant to diagnosis based on the AGRE dataset.\n- Once again, the Alternating Decision Tree (ADTree) model performed best: perfect sensitivity (1.0), a low false-positive rate (0.013) and \"overall accuracy of 99.9%\".\n- Seven items of the ADI-R comprised the ADTree model: (i) comprehension of simple language at most abnormal (4-5 years), (ii) reciprocal conversation (regarding the ability to facilitate the flow of conversation), (iii) use of imaginative / pretend play at most abnormal (I have post about pretend play coming up fairly soon), (iv) social imaginative play with peers at most abnormal, (v) direct gaze at most abnormal, (vi) group play with peers at most abnormal (spontaneous games or activities) and (vii) age when abnormality was first evident.\n- Testing accuracy was again carried out on participant data from the Boston Autism Consortium (AC) and the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) from where the quite compelling data for the success of the ADTree model was derived.\nSo the ADI-R has been boiled down to 7 pertinent items. The ADOS boiled down to 8 distinguishing module 1 items. I think most people would stand up and take note of these findings even if further replication is still required (based on different geographical groups for example). Don't get me wrong, there is still a large degree of skill required to deliver the ADI-R and ADOS and maintain your reproducibility and diagnostic prowess so I don't think this combined data will be putting people out of work just yet; certainly not with the number of people estimated to be coming through the diagnostic process. That and the fact that these are assessment instruments and so are subservient to a final clinical opinion for an autism diagnosis or not.\nAside from the grand findings I am interested in the types of behaviours which are noted to be important for diagnosis. All very 'social-communicative' (sounds familiar) and not at all heavy on the 'restricted and repetitive behaviour' side of things. Indeed, looking back at the ADOS ADTree paper, I might be wrong but only one element, 'functional play with objects' seems to have any strong relation to issues with repetitive behaviours. This could be that we aren't asking the right questions about this area of behaviour, but I would hedge my bets that more likely is the stress on the social-communicative side of presentation as being key to diagnosis. I think I might have to look at this further in future posts.\nFinally, I have previously talked about the lack of instruments to appropriately and accurately assess 'change' in autism (as a function of maturation or intervention or anything else).

Use of artificial intelligence to shorten the behavioral diagnosis of autism PLoS ONE : 10.1371/journal.pone.0043855","6 Facts About Autism Spectrum DisorderJuly 5, 2016\n1. Autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are terms for a group of complex neurological disorders. In 2013 all autism disorders were merged into one overall diagnosis of ASD. ASD is characterized by difficulty interacting and communicating with others. Children with ASD also tend to engage in repetitive behaviors, which may be physical (flapping hands, jumping repetitively) or vocal (repeating videos, making repetitive sounds). Play skills are also often immature and repetitive.\n2. ASD symptoms and their severity vary widely. Each child on the spectrum presents with a unique array of symptoms. While all children with ASD present with some challenges in the areas of language and socialization, some may have a complete lack of spoken language and have more challenging behaviors that disrupt their daily lives and the lives of their families. The basic symptoms of autism are often accompanied by other medical conditions and challenges, which can also vary widely in severity.\n3. Autism is often diagnosed between the ages of 18 months and 3 years. Studies indicate that autism is four times more common in boys than girls, and there is a higher risk if a sibling is diagnosed with autism.\n4. Some indicators of ASD may include:\n-doesn’t babble by 1 year\n-does not speak one word by 16 months\n-does not combine two words by 2 years\n-does not respond to name\n-loses language or social skills\n-doesn’t play with toys appropriately\n-excessively lines up toys or objects\n-no pointing or showing\n-does not imitate\n-no back-and-forth conversation\n-abnormal eye contact and body language; lack of understanding and use of gestures; lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication\n-difficulty in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships; absence of interest in peers\n-repetitive motor movement, use of objects or speech (i.e. lining up toys, flipping objects, echolalia)\n-insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines (i.e. difficulties with transitions, need to take same route or eat same food every day)\n5. An evaluation should be considered if your child demonstrates some of the following “red flags”:\n-rarely looks you in the eye or avoids eye contact\n-does not respond when you call his/her name\n-does not point at something he wants\n-is not beginning to imitate what you do (clapping, blowing kisses, etc.)\n-has repetitive motor movements (rocking, hand flapping, jumping), repetitive actions with toys (lining up), or repetitive vocalizations\n-repeatedly vocalizes parts of TV shows, books, or previously heard conversations, often days after he heard them\n-has difficulty with changes in daily routines and get inordinately upset when routines may change\n-show no interest in his peers and does not observe what other children are doing\n6. Research shows the most effective treatment for children with ASD is ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis). Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) focuses on the principles that explain how learning takes place. Positive reinforcement is one such principle. When a behavior is followed by some sort of reward, the behavior is more likely to be repeated. Through decades of research, the field of behavior analysis has developed many techniques for increasing useful behaviors and reducing those that may cause harm or interfere with learning. ABA is the use of these techniques and principles to bring about meaningful and positive changes in behavior. ABA therapy sessions often involve one-on-one interaction between the ABA provider and the child. These techniques can be used in structured situations such as the classroom as well as in everyday situations.\nAs with any concerns, speak with your pediatrician first.

{"question":"What are the key differences between using compost versus traditional fertilizer for providing nutrients to plants?","answer":"Compost and traditional fertilizers differ significantly in how they provide nutrients to plants. Compost acts as a slow-release nutrient source, where nutrients become available gradually over many years, making it typically characterized as a soil amendment rather than a fertilizer. It contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and supports microorganisms essential for plant growth, with nutrients less likely to be lost through leaching. Additionally, compost improves soil structure and water retention, holding up to 1.5 quarts of water per cubic foot of soil for each percent of organic matter. In contrast, when using uncomposted materials like straw or leaves, supplemental nitrogen fertilizer must be added (1 pound per 100 square feet) to compensate for nitrogen loss during decomposition, as microbes utilize soil nitrogen while breaking down carbon materials.","context":["Early composting helps soil and plants later\nNew gardeners often ask, “What is compost and do I need to buy it?”\nWhen starting a new garden, it is hard to imagine we should initially spend more time, money and energy on compost than on plants, said a University of Illinois Extension horticulture educator.\n“It is plants we want,” said Nancy Pollard. “Yet without adequate compost (decomposed organic matter) in the soil, the plants won’t thrive. It is the soil that provides nutrients, and the compost that holds adequate water and provides good drainage to make the difference between just surviving plants and the thriving plants we covet.”\nGood soil, that is soil with a good amount of organic matter, will hold lots of water available to plants, yet drain well so roots stay healthy. Soil can hold roughly 1.5 quarts of water per cubic foot of soil for each percent of organic matter. So increasing the organic matter content from 1 to 2 percent would increase the volume of water to 3 quarts per cubic foot of soil, or at 3 percent to 4.5 quarts of water.\n“What a difference that extra water makes in times of drought stress,” she said. “It is the difference between needing multiple applications of water per week compared to only needing additional water every week or two. So adding compost in the beginning saves you time and money and gets you much better plants in the long run.”\nIn a very small garden, work the organic matter in with a spading fork ($50-$100) or, for a larger garden, invest in a broad fork (about $200), Pollard recommends. Many gardeners prefer the broad fork to a rototiller, as the broad fork aerates more deeply, preserves soil structure, brings up fewer weed seeds, cuts up far fewer earthworms, requires little maintenance and is less costly and less jarring.\nHow much compost should be added?\nPollard recommends that for 100 square feet of soil, add one (or a proportional combination of) the following:\n8 cubic feet of peat moss; OR\n15 cubic feet of compost; OR\n4 bushels (about six 5-gallon buckets) of grass clippings. (Do not use lawn clippings from grass that has been treated with sprays containing fungicides, insecticides or herbicides.)\nWhen most un-decomposed organic matter is added to the soil, microbes begin decomposing the carbon materials, utilizing soil nitrogen in the process. In order to compensate for this nitrogen loss when using un-composted straw or leaves, you will need to apply supplemental fertilizer containing nitrogen. For 100 square feet of soil, add either one bale of straw or four bushels of leaves, as well as, in either case, 1 pound of nitrogen fertilizer (to help microorganisms break down organic matter).\nAdding organic matter in the fall is best and the spring is second best. Any time of year is better than not doing this, Pollard cautioned.\n“I did not say add garden soil or potting soil to your garden unless you are making raised beds,” she noted. “If using raised beds, create a soil and compost mix with up to a maximum of 50 percent compost by volume. So you likely don’t need more soil in your garden, you likely need more compost.\n“Why are those extra quarts of water made available by organic matter important? Water is critical because plants use water to maintain plant turgor (hold them up). Water aids in cell division and growth; water provides pressure to push roots through soil; water is required in photosynthesis to make carbohydrates; water moves food and minerals around the plant; and water is critical for stabilizing plant temperatures,” Pollard said.\nLots of compost initially and top dressing with compost annually means the plants will likely have adequate water available and won’t be stressed so easily. The plants will flourish, and the gardener will be proud and proclaim they have a green thumb. Interesting that brown matter (compost) is what makes for a green thumb.\nContact Nancy Pollard at 708-679-6889 or email@example.com.","Lawn and Garden Shop\nWHAT IS COMPOST?\nCompost is a natural organic material produced when microorganisms break down organic residue. This process occurs continually in nature, resulting in a sweet, earthy smelling brown material called compost. Compost adds food for many organisms and an enormous diversity of organisms to your garden soil when you use it as a soil amendment. It is a rich source of organic matter. Although compost contains plant nutrients, it is typically characterized as a soil amendment rather than as a fertilizer because most of the nutrients are not readily available and only become available slowly, over many years.\nThere are several ways to acquire and use compost to benefit the soil and plants in your own yard and garden:\nThe best way to improve the soil is to mix in plenty of compost or other organic matter before planting. Thoroughly mixing these materials deep into the soil helps retain water and air, and provides nutrients to the plant roots.\nWhen: Mix in organic matter with existing soil before planting perennials, lawns, trees and shrubs, each time annual beds are replanted, and when dividing perennials or repotting container plants.\nHow: Use a shovel or digging fork to mix amendments into the top 6 to 12 inches of soil. Amend large planting areas not just small holes for each plant.\nHow Much: Amount of compost recommended to be tilled into each 100 square\nfeet of planting area. Use these following guidelines.\nIn clay soils: 8 cu. feet (0.3 cu. Yd.) = 1\" layer of compost.\nIn sandy soils: 13 cu. feet (0.5 cu. Yd.) = 1 ½\" layer of compost.\nIn sandy soils: 24 cu. feet (0.9 cu. Yd.) = 4\" layer of compost.\nSoil Testing: For a list of local laboratories who can test the amount of sand, silt and clay in your soil call your County Extension Service.\nWhat: Different types of organic amendments may provide special benefits for certain plants or soil types, as the chart below shows. Any clean organic amendment will improve the soil. The best advice is to use what is reasonably priced, plentiful and easy to get. Use as Mulch for Vegetable and Perennial Gardens - Mulch means placing compost (or another material) on the soil’s surface around a plant. Mulching with compost is especially beneficial because earthworms and other soil life move through the mulch and help carry these materials down into the soil. Placing mulch around plants also helps to limit weed growth, reduce evaporation, moderate fluctuations in soil temperature, and reduce soil erosion.\nUse to Top-dress and Renovate your Lawn - Spreading a thin layer of compost on your lawn can do wonders for the soil underneath. This technique works best if you first aerate the lawn.\nIn the spring or fall when the soil is moist, use an aerator tool (you can rent one) to remove plugs of soil and thatch from your lawn.\nNext, using a spreader tool or a rake, spread a thin layer (about ½ \") of compost over the lawn. The grass should be standing up through the compost after application, not bent over or buried.\nYou can also mix grass seed in with the compost to encourage new growth and fill in bare spots where weeds might take hold.\nConsider a Retrofit If the soil under your lawn is unhealthy, one of the best actions you can take is to retrofit your lawn. Grass thrives in 8-12\" of healthy soil. In addition, seed-grown lawns are more sustainable in healthy soil than sod-grown lawns because roots grow directly into the soil rather than through layers of potentially different soil types. Retrofitting a lawn with healthy soil and reseeding may be worth it-in fact, several local studies have indicated that a lawn grown on a deep layer of healthy soil pays for itself in 5-7 years based on water savings alone!\nWhat Does Compost Do? Improved soil structure creates passageways in the soil for air and water. In heavy clay soils, the addition of compost enhances the physical make-up of soil which improves soil structure, porosity and bulk density to create a better environment for plant growth.\nSupplies Slow-Release Nutrients to Plants without using fertilizers Compost is a good source of nutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and microorganisms essential for plant growth. Since compost is made of relatively stable organic matter, nutrients are slowly made available for root uptake and. In this way, nutrients are less likely to be lost through leaching.\nHolds Moisture and Reduces Erosion Compost has a large capacity to hold water-many times its own weight. This reduces water loss and leaching in soil. The soil-binding properties of compost result from its humus content which acts like a glue, holding soil particles together, making soil resistant to erosion and improving moisture retention.\nImmobilizes and Degrades Pollutants Compost has the ability to bind heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and other contaminants, reducing both their leachability and absorption by plants. The soil microorganisms that compost supports also help break down pesticides, fertilizers and hydrocarbons. This same binding effect allows compost to be used as a filter for storm water and other runoff.\nProvides Organic Matter Compost supplies organic matter to the soil which increases the presence of microorganisms. The activity of microorganisms promotes root development and assists in the extraction of nutrients from the soil. It also encourages the growth of earthworms and other macro-organisms, whose tunneling increases water infiltration and aeration.\nSuppresses Soil-Borne Diseases and Plant Pathogens Plant disease is influenced by both the level and type of organic matter as well as the microorganisms present in soil. Detrimental organisms like oot-eating nematodes, a number of specific plant diseases and several lawn diseases are suppressed by microorganisms found in compost.\nHow good is the compost? The quality of the compost used for soil enhancement is important. Commercial compost should have a sweet, earthy smell. Compost should meet your Department of Ecology’s guidelines for Grade A compost.\nSuggested Reading: Soil Biology Primer, Soil and Water Conservation Society, Revised 2000.

In Chinese celebrations, they serve bao, chicken, glutinous rice dishes, pig's trotters, and pickled ginger. In Japan, during the okuizome (first eating ceremony), babies are fed rice, soup, fish, and boiled vegetables. In Korea, they prepare different types of tteok (rice cakes) including white steamed rice cake (baekseolgi), rice cake balls with red bean paste (susugyeongdan), and 5-color half-moon rice cakes (osaek songpyeon). In Singapore, they serve ang ku kueh, an Indonesian red tortoise cake made with glutinous rice flour and filled with sweet mung bean paste.","context":["Throughout the world, the number 100 is associated with perfection and wholeness. It seems natural that the number has long been associated with important milestones. People in Hong Kong, China, Korea, Japan, and Singapore hold a baby’s 100th day as an especially important occasion, and some even consider the 100-day mark as the baby’s first birthday.\nWhy and how is this milestone celebrated? The precise origins of the celebration are unknown, but many people believe it originated in Korea or China. Historically, it’s been a day to thank the gods for helping a baby to survive its vulnerable first period of life. Pragmatically, it’s also a day for people close to the family to meet the baby and to celebrate its entrance into the community. The day celebrates a “baby’s first of many firsts”.\nWhy do people celebrate a baby’s 100th day?\nInfant survival rate used to be low in Korea and China, as hygienic conditions were poor back in the days, and early childhood disease was widespread. Babies were given time to strengthen their immune system by staying indoors for their first month. The 30th day was called the “full moon” day, or man yue (满月) and marked the end of the delicate newborn stage. In ancient times, the chance of a baby surviving its early infancy was so low that parents were reluctant to announce the birth before the child had survived a month. Some even believed that premature announcement could jinx the baby’s survival.\nThe mother was also believed to be vulnerable to illness after the strenuous process of giving birth, staying home with the baby and eating nutritious foods to heal, dispel air from her womb, and regulate her body’s temperature. This isolation was also an opportunity for the baby and parents to have intensive bonding time.\nToday, it is more common to celebrate a child’s passing of the full moon on the 100th day. So the celebration can have different names: man yue party, 100th day party, or red egg and ginger party. The main theme of the celebration is of a new life entering society having overcome a period of physical vulnerability, and people close to the family participating in ensuring a successful, healthy, happy life for the baby. People with Chinese and Korean values believe that this is more likely to happen when the appropriate words are spoken, the correct behavior is exemplified, and proper ritual symbols are used throughout the celebration.\nIn modern Asian culture, the ways of celebrating a baby’s first phase of life has evolved to suit personal preferences and values. However, there are key customs that have traditionally been observed for the 100th day celebration.\nHow do people celebrate the 100th day?\nAt the beginning of the day, the mother historically took her first bath after giving birth in water steeped in pomelo leaves. Having an immersive bath in the first month after childbirth was considered unhygienic. In modern practice, this bath is more symbolic than literal.\nThe baby receives their first haircut on this day. Traditionally, the baby’s head was fully shaved and the hair carefully made into an ink brush called tai mao bi (胎毛笔) as a keepsake. Today, many parents prefer to simply cut a small piece of the baby’s hair in a nod to the tradition. After the haircut, the baby is also given their symbolic first bath. They are bathed in water along with pomelo leaves, hard-boiled eggs, coins, and flowers to wash away bad luck.\nThe baby and mother are dressed in new, red clothing. The baby is also gifted with gold jewelry to wear to their party, commonly a longevity lock. Similarly, party guests know to wear red which represents happiness and prosperity, rather than black and white which are mourning colors.\nIn Buddhist and Taoist families, incense is burned and food offerings are made. This is done to inform the home’s deities of the new addition to the family, to show gratitude for taking care of the mom and baby, and to pray for protection over the baby.\nAt the party, the baby’s name is formally announced. If their name hasn’t been decided yet, it is done so at the celebration by the paternal grandfather. This decision is important because a person’s name is believed to determine their characteristics.\nBao, chicken, glutinous rice dishes, and pig’s trotters are served as part of the meal. Pickled ginger is a significant dish because the Cantonese word for “sour” sounds like the word for grandchildren, symbolizing another wish for a future large, happy family.\nGuests receive red hard-boiled eggs as presents, which represent fertility and renewal of life. The round shape itself represents harmony and unity (hence the alternative name “red egg and ginger party”). In return, guests give the family hong bao, more gold jewelry, jade in the shape of the child’s astrology sign, peachwood ornaments, or other practical newborn supplies like clothes and diapers. Objects like scissors, clocks, and pears have negative connotations in Chinese culture and are mindfully avoided when giving gifts.\nWhich cultures celebrate the 100th day?\nJapanese and Singaporeans also celebrate this milestone in an infant’s life.\nIn Japan, a “first eating ceremony” called okuizome is held where the baby is fed rice, soup, fish, and boiled vegetables by the oldest member of the family.\nIn Singapore, a traditional food eaten at parties or given as gifts is ang ku kueh, an Indonesian red tortoise cake. The cake is made with sticky glutinous rice flour, filled with a sweet filling like mung bean paste, and presented on a banana leaf square.\nOn baek-il (100-day celebration) in Korea, the family offers rice and sea mustard soup to Samshin, the shaman spirit of childbirth, for helping mom and child survive the hard first 100 days. Different types of tteok (rice cakes), are prepared: white steamed rice cake (baekseolgi), rice cake balls filled with red bean paste (susugyeongdan), and 5-color half-moon rice cakes (osaek songpyeon). Baekseolgi symbolize holiness and the 5-color cakes symbolize harmony. These tteok are shared with neighbors and also placed in the four cardinal directions in the house to promote protection for the baby. Adversely, if the baby were to be sick on its 100th day, celebrations are avoided as that would be considered bad luck.\nHow is man yue celebrated differently today?\nWith modern medicinal advancements, the practices associated with this celebration are not as highly motivated by traditional belief in the divine help of the childbirth/prosperity gods as they used to be.\n“Roots-seeking millennials” are creating modern-traditional hybrids of the 100th day celebration, hosting parties in cafes and hotel ballrooms, hiring magicians, serving food like canapés and Disney-themed desserts, and giving out gift bags with non-traditional items like family portraits. Yet the 100th day celebration remains a significant day for the unveiling of a child to the world, and for the support network surrounding a family to celebrate its new life together."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:15372ee2-59dd-4ed1-97b4-77dc5706d8b4>"],"error":null}

By its very nature, a porous pavement system with subsurface aggregate bed may have better snow and ice melting characteristics than standard pavement.\nPorous pavement also cuts back on watering costs for plants, reduces traffic, and in some cases, avoids the need for taking out permits since it is considered a form of landscaping, not hardscaping. Pro: Cooler Surfaces. Traditional asphalt and concrete surfaces heat up quickly. Since porous pavement is permeable, it tends to trap less heat.\nPorous asphalt has much to offer those in need of a new driveway, parking lot, or roadway. However, you should educate yourself about the specific maintenance needs of porous asphalt. This article will help you protect your investment in a porous asphalt pavement by discussing three key maintenance tips. 1.

{"question":"How does the approach to injury prevention and response compare between outdoor recreational activities and tactical law enforcement operations?","answer":"In outdoor recreational activities, the emphasis is on individual preparedness and self-help techniques, with focus on making do with available materials to handle injuries until proper medical care can be reached. In contrast, tactical law enforcement operations take a more systematic approach, involving pre-planning, coordination with medical resources, and implementation of specific medical contingency plans. Law enforcement agencies have shifted their doctrine to include training officers in self-care and buddy care basics, particularly focusing on bleeding control, while also maintaining dedicated tactical medics and establishing relationships with local EMS and hospitals before high-risk operations. Both contexts emphasize immediate response to injuries, but tactical operations have more structured protocols and resources in place.","context":["There’s nothing like spending time outdoors when the weather permits. Hiking, mountain biking, fishing, camping, hunting–the options are endless. Everybody enjoys nature in a different way, but you should always be mindful of your surroundings. When you’re having too much fun, disaster can strike suddenly. If you happen to get injured out in the field, follow these steps to make a splint or sling to minimize the damage until you’re able to receive medical attention.\nExamine the Injury\nBefore you attempt to build a makeshift splint or sling, you must first determine the type of injury you have and its severity. Splints are most appropriate for serious fractures that either protrude from the flesh or don’t. Their purpose is to keep the bones from shifting so as to prevent further injury. Slings, on the other hand, are more commonly used for lesser injuries such as dislocations, sprains, and minor fractures. They suspend a damaged limb in a safer and less painful position. Sometimes both are required to fully stabilize an injury.\nTend to Immediate Concerns First\nIf your injury involves an open wound, your priority is to control the bleeding. Use clothing, towels, blankets, or other cloth materials to tightly wrap the wound. Once the bleeding has stopped, try to clean the area around the wound to prevent infection. You can flush the wound out with a bottle of water if you don’t have a first aid kit on hand.\nLocate the Proper Materials\nTo make a splint, you’ll need to find something rigid to hold the broken bone in place. Out in the wild, tree branches and bark are the most obvious materials to use for support. Anything that is rigid enough not to bend under the weight of the broken limb should work. For the padding, safety companies in Calgary recommend packing grass or leaves together to form a cushion layer. Finally, the same grass and leaves can be used to wrap everything together. If you have paracord or some form of rope on you, that would be ideal. A sling is much easier to make if you have the resources—the easiest way to go about it is to cut a shirt or tent open. An emergency medical specialist from 911 Industrial Response Inc reports that any piece of large cloth will usually do, so long as it is reasonably clean and sturdy enough to support the injured limb.\nBuild the Splint or Sling\nFirst, wrap the cushion materials around the fracture. Then, place the support materials around the padding. Finally, secure the support materials to the padding with any string-like materials. The splint can be put into a sling for even greater support. To form the sling, cut open a large piece of cloth, and tie the two corners farthest away from each other together. Throw the knotted part around your neck, and place the broken arm into the loop.\nWhen building the splint around the injury, remember to leave the body part as is. Do not attempt to shift or straighten out any broken bones as that can make things much worse. The splint should also cover the joints above and below the injured area for optimal support.\nWhen you’re out in the wild, anything can happen. Don’t let an unexpected injury threaten your life. By creating a splint or sling, you can preserve the damaged limb and increase your mobility on your way to safety.\nEmma is a freelance writer currently living in Boston, MA.

Jim is also the Terrorism Preparedness Coordinator for the Alameda County EMS Agency. Jim has a master’s degree in Homeland Security from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA. He can be reached at firstname.lastname@example.org\nWhat is a \"SWAT medic\" and what does it take to become one? Tactical medicine is a specialized and highly discriminating endeavor that requires intensive training, discipline and a unique relationship with law enforcement. Tactical medics have the primary responsibility of providing medical care to the SWAT team, but their duties extend far beyond that task.\nThis article examines the evolution, and current tactical medical principles and procedures employed by military and law enforcement agencies (LEA), specifically SWAT teams.\nTactical medicine concepts have been around since the dawn of medicine….and warfare. Even in early battles the “King’s Doctor” was to be close at hand to deal with injuries, but only to the royal few. Outcomes were not very good as the initial insult might have killed the victim; if that didn’t, then infection usually did.\nHistorical accounts and personal diaries of military medics through the centuries are fascinating and show a steady progression of tools and techniques and an ever improving understanding of injury management. The Vietnam War showed that rapid transport to a higher echelon of care had a significant impact on survival.\nThe last 10 years of conflict overseas has shown that controlling extremity hemorrhage and aggressive airway management accounted for a significant reduction in the casualty fatality rate (CFR). The CFR is the percentage of those who are wounded in battle die.1\nCasualty Fatality Rate\nWWII 19.1 %\nVietnam War 15.8\nIraq/ Afghanistan conflicts 9.4\nPrior to 2004, there were a significant proportion of deaths in American soldiers during the Global War of Terror (GWOT) associated with each of the following injuries:\n- Hemorrhage from extremity wounds\n- Junctional hemorrhage (where an arm or leg joins the torso, such as in the groin area after a high traumatic amputation)\n- Non-compressible hemorrhage (such as a gunshot wound to the abdomen)\n- Tension pneumothorax\n- Airway problems\nIt was noted that extremity hemorrhage was the most frequent cause of preventable battlefield deaths. The U.S. military re-introduced and emphasized tourniquet use and hemostatic agents with measurable success.\nTourniquets were proven to save lives on the battlefield including 31 lives saved in 6 months by tourniquets after the retraining. Kragh et al. estimated that 2000 lives were saved with tourniquets during the Iraq conflict. As importantly, there were no arms or legs lost because of tourniquet use.2\nCauses of preventable battlefield death are not that different from the potential injuries of law enforcement/ SWAT operators during high-risk law enforcement operations.\nToday's tactical EMS\nTactical medicine has become a discipline and specialty within law enforcement circles. High profile events such as the Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora Movie Theater and countless other “active shooter” incidents have shifted the way law enforcement operates.\nThere have been two major shifts in doctrine related to SWAT and law enforcement operations over the last 10 years. One change was focused on aggressively going after active shooters with whatever assets happen to be on hand, instead of waiting for a SWAT team.\nThe second has been to recognize the need for emergency medical contingency planning. This includes training officers/agents in the basics of “self-care” and “buddy care” with the focus on bleeding control.\nAnother aspect of this doctrine shift is the inclusion of organic assets (the tactical medic), and involving, or at least notifying local EMS, hospitals about law enforcement operations that have a high risk for injuries. SWAT teams have increasingly a dedicated tactical medical component as part of their setup.\nSome law enforcement agencies (LEA) have decided to send officers to EMT school, or specific tactical medical classes. That may be a workable solution; however, it is unlikely those individuals have the experience and patient assessment skill needed to be the best medical practitioner they can be.\nIt may make more sense to train an experienced medic to work in a warm zone environment and keep the scope of that person's job as the medic.\nTactical EMS models\nThere are countless workable models for the incorporation of a medical contingency plan for law enforcement operations. Some of the more common models are listed below:\n- Officer-Agent/medic- sworn LEO having either dual roles as an \"operator\" and medic, or strictly as a medic; but has law enforcement powers and can certainly protect themselves from potential threats.\n- Agency contract- LEA has a contract or memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a local EMS provider to provide \"up-close\" medical care. Some agencies put the medics through a Reserve Officer school, so that they can be armed as LEOs.\n- Individual contract- an individual or a team made up of individuals who have either a contract or MOU between them and the LEA providing coverage for SWAT missions and training.\n- ALS Stand by- No Tactical Medics, but ALS unit will stage close by and respond if scene is secured by law enforcement.\nLearning about Tactical EMS\nThere are many in the EMS field that would like to explore the option of getting into the field of tactical medicine. In addition to the medical training one already has such as a physician, nurse, paramedic or EMT, it is highly recommended to procure specific tactical medical education.\nPrograms such as NAEMT Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) and other like it are one to two days in length and have been well received by the EMS community. The International School of Tactical Medicine (ISTM) offers a 2 week intensive program aimed at medical practitioners who need basic training on law enforcement operations, and how to work within a law enforcement team as the medic.\nThe emphasis in this program is to insure that the tactical situation is resolved and EMS providers are not put in harm’s way. There are many skills sessions and tactical/ medical scenarios to test the knowledge learned under stressful conditions.\nThe tactical medic\nThe Tactical Medic is the logical liaison to the on-scene EMS assets that support law enforcement operations. Typically the Tactical Medic will have a face-to-face meeting with EMS supporting units if they are available.\nIt is imperative that EMS providers are not put in harm’s way and are not allowed to enter a scene where there is a shooter, or other threats are still possible. In an active shooter type situation, once the threat is eliminated, the scene is no longer a hot zone. A quick sweep from a SWAT team can confirm this assumption.\nIf there are significant casualties, the next priority should be to escort the EMS providers into the scene quickly and safely into the newly created “warm zone”. They would work closely with the Tactical Medic throughout the event.\nScenario of a tactical mission\nOn a typical hypothetical SWAT operation there are several phases and steps that take place well before the “hit”. Most often, the mission is a planned high risk search or arrest warrant. After getting a \"warning order\", the SWAT team operators and all of the support elements (medical, communications, negotiators, etc.) typically convene at a Forward Staging Area (FSA).\nA briefing will occur, where mission goals, subjects, and target location layouts are reviewed. The tactical medic then calls the local EMS transport provider to have an ALS ambulance stage close to the location.\nMost times if EMS is notified beforehand, they are welcome into the briefing. The local EMS crews are given instructions and a communications plan. In most cases they follow the vehicle convoy in and are in close proximity to the target location.\nLocal hospitals and trauma centers are notified that the mission is taking place and to be on alert in the event of casualties.\nPersonally, I’ve been on close to 200 SWAT missions and thankfully there have been no gun-fights with injuries.\nOn most of SWAT missions, we have a day or two to plan. Most large city police departments have a higher percentage of spontaneous SWAT missions such as a bank robbery “gone bad” or a barricaded subject.\nTactical medicine is an exciting and evolving field of emergency medicine. Consider taking a tactical medicine class and see if you are up to the task.\n1 NAEMT Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Curriculum, http://www.naemt.org/education/TCCC/tccc.aspx\n2 Kragh J et al.

{"question":"My hospital stocks two types of sodium chloride injections - why does one need dilution before use while other doesn't?","answer":"The 23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection is hypertonic and must be diluted prior to administration because direct injection can cause serious complications like sudden hypernatremia, cardiovascular shock, and severe tissue necrosis. In contrast, the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection can be used directly as a diluent or solvent for other drugs and for flushing intravenous catheters, as it contains a much lower concentration that is safer for direct administration.","context":["Label: SODIUM CHLORIDE injection, solution, concentrate\n- NDC Code(s): 0409-1141-02, 0409-1141-12\n- Packager: Hospira, Inc.\n- Category: HUMAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABEL\n- DEA Schedule: None\n- Marketing Status: New Drug Application\nUpdated July 21, 2021\nIf you are a consumer or patient please visit this version.\n- SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION\n23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Additive Solution is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution for intravenous administration ONLY AFTER DILUTION to replenish electrolytes. The preparations contain 23.4 g of sodium chloride (400 mEq each of Na+ and Cl-) in Water for Injection, USP.\nThe solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer. The additive may contain sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. The pH is 5.0 (4.5 to 7.0). The specific gravity is 1.15, and the osmolarity is 8.01 mOsmol/L (calc).\nSodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline compound freely soluble in water. The molecular weight is 58.44 g/mol.\nThe Pharmacy Bulk Package is a sterile dosage form which contains multiple single doses for preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\nSodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.\nSodium is the principal cation of extracellular fluid. It comprises more than 90% of the total cations at its normal plasma concentration of approximately 142 mEq/L. While the sodium ion can diffuse across cell membranes, the intracellular sodium is maintained at a much lower concentration than extracellular sodium through the expenditure of energy by the cell (so called \"sodium cation pump\"). Loss of intracellular potassium ion is usually accompanied by an increase in intracellular sodium ion. Sodium is the principal ion that determines osmotic pressure of interstitial fluids and the degree of tissue hydration.\nWhen serum sodium concentration is low, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary is inhibited, thereby preventing water reabsorption by the distal renal tubules. On the other hand, adrenal secretion of aldosterone increases renal tubular reabsorption of sodium in an effort to re-establish normal serum sodium concentration.\nChloride (Cl¯) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells.\nThe distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl¯) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.\n- INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is hypertonic and must be diluted prior to administration. Inadvertent direct injection or absorption of concentrated sodium chloride solution may give rise to sudden hypernatremia and such complications as cardiovascular shock, central nervous system disorders, specifically osmotic demyelination syndrome, extensive hemolysis, cortical necrosis of the kidneys and severe local tissue necrosis (if administered extravascularly).\nSolutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.\nIn patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium may result in sodium retention. The intravenous administration of this solution (after appropriate dilution) can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of other serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema.\nExcessive administration of potassium-free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia.\nWARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.\nResearch indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.\nExcessive amounts of sodium chloride by any route may cause hypokalemia and acidosis. Excessive amounts by the parenteral route may precipitate congestive heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease and in patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin or drugs that may give rise to sodium retention. Special caution should be used in administering sodium-containing solutions to patients with severe renal impairment, cirrhosis of the liver or other edematous or sodium-retaining states.\nClinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Do not use unless the solution is clear and seal is intact.\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. It is also not known whether sodium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\nIt is not known whether 23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sodium chloride is administered to a nursing woman.\nSafety and effectiveness of 23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP have not been established in pediatric patients. Its limited use in pediatric patients has been inadequate to fully define proper dosage and limitations for use.\nAn evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\nThis drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n- ADVERSE REACTIONS\nExcessive administration of 23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may result in electrolyte imbalance with water retention, edema, loss of potassium and aggravation of an existing acidosis. See WARNINGS.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n23.4% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Additive Solution is administered intravenously only after addition to a larger volume of fluid.\nThe dose, dilution and rate of injection are dependent upon the individual needs of each patient.

Product labeling documents include information like generic names, active ingredients, ingredient strength dosage, routes of administration, appearance, usage, warnings, inactive ingredients, etc.\nSodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution. The osmolarity is 300 mOsmol per liter (calculated).Each mL contains: Sodium chloride 9mg; Water for Injection q.s. It contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is supplied only in single dose containers. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment (pH 4.5-7.0).Sodium chloride occurs as colorless cubic crystals or white crystalline powder and has a saline taste. Sodium chloride is freely soluble in water. It is soluble in glycerin and slightly soluble in alcohol.The empirical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl and the molecular weight is 58.44.\nSodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (CI-) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.The small volume of fluid and amount of sodium chloride provided by Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9%, when used only as a vehicle for parenteral injection of drugs, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid and electrolyte balance except possibly in very small infants.Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.\nIndications And Usage\nSodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% preparations are indicated for diluting or dissolving drugs for intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous injection according to instructions of the manufacturer of the drug to be administered.Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% is also indicated for use in flushing of intravenous catheters.\nFor use in newborns, when a sodium chloride solution is required for preparation or diluting medications or in flushing intravenous catheters, only preservative free Sodiumn Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% should be used.\nGeneralConsult the manufacturer's instructions for choice of vehicle, appropriate dilution or volume for dissolving the drugs to be injected, including the route and rate of injection. Inspect reconstituted (diluted or dissolved) drugs for clarity (if soluble) and freedom from unexpected precipitation or discoloration prior to administration.PregnancyPregnancy Category C--Animal Reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9%. It is also not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction of capacity. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\nReactions which may occur because of this solution, added drugs or the technique of reconstitution or administration include febrile response, local tenderness, abscess, tissue necrosis or infectoin at the site of injection and extravasation.If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate countermeasures and, if possible, retrieve and save the remainder of the unused vehicle for examination.\nWhen used as a diluent, solvent or intravascular flushing solution, this parenteral preparation is unlikely to pose a threat of sodium chloride or fluid overload except possibly in very small infants. In the event these should occur, reevaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures. (See PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).\nDosage And Administration\nBefore Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% is used as a vehicle for the administration of a drug, specific references should be checked for any possible incompatibility with sodium chloride.The volume of the preparation to be used for diluting or dissolving any drug for injection is dependent on the vehicle concentration, dose and route of administration as recommended by the manufacturer.Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% is also indicated for use in flushing intravenous catheters.

{"question":"I'm studying fictional characters who suffered tragic ends. How did Fake Godzilla and Amroth meet their ultimate fates?","answer":"Fake Godzilla and Amroth both met tragic ends, but in different ways. Fake Godzilla was ultimately destroyed by the real Godzilla, who blasted off its rubber skin to reveal the metal underneath and then easily defeated the imposter. Amroth, on the other hand, met his end by drowning in the Bay of Belfalas. After being separated from his beloved Nimrodel and waiting for her at the haven, a fierce storm drove their Elven-ship far from port. Upon awakening and seeing how far they had drifted, Amroth, in despair, screamed Nimrodel's name and threw himself into the water.","context":["Fake Godzilla's name comes, simply enough, from \"Fake\" and \"Godzilla.\"\nIn Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, Fake Godzilla looks almost identical to the MegaroGoji suit. At first, Fake Godzilla was portrayed using the actual MegaroGoji suit, but after Anguirus exposes metal on its arm, it is portrayed using a second suit that has some differences from the MegaroGoji. This suit features a more pronounced nose, sharper pointed teeth, and sinister-looking eyes. This suit also features stiff elongated fingers designed to resemble Mechagodzilla's finger missiles.\nIn Godzilla Island, Fake Godzilla is portrayed with another of the same figure used to portray Godzilla in the show. After it is exposed as a fake, the suit has a metallic torso identical to that of the Showa Mechagodzilla visible underneath its skin.\nFake Godzilla shares Mechagodzilla's roar.\nFake Godzilla was a disguise for the first Mechagodzilla created by the Black Hole Planet 3 Aliens.\nMuch like his organic counterpart, Fake Godzilla was an adept fighter, mostly utilizing his claws in combat, as shown during his skirmish with Anguirus. He also has shown a great deal of intelligence, as shown when exploits Anguirus' weaknesses by splitting his jaw open. Fake Godzilla had a flamethrower equipped inside his mouth. this is meant to mimic Godzilla's Atomic ray. Curiously enough, Mechagodzilla, the true identity of the imposter does not use his flamethrower after he sheds his disguise, although he does use it in Godzilla Unleashed.\nHe battled Fake Godzilla, and tore off a piece of his skin, revealing metal underneath. Fake Godzilla broke Anguirus' jaw, sending him running. He was attacked by real Godzilla later that night at a oil refinery, and they fought until Fake Godzilla's identity was revealed to be an impostor. Fake Godzilla was a robot Godzilla in disguise.Zaguresu and went on a rampage across Japan. Believed to be the real Godzilla, he was put in a cave in handcuffs. The cave was blocked by metal bars, almost like he was in jail.\nMegalon and Battra flew to Godzilla Island and attacked. They were eventually driven off by Rodan, Mothra, Mechagodzilla and Moguera after a quick fight, but this distraction allowed Fake Godzilla to escape. He rampaged through Japan again. Still thinking he was the real Godzilla, the G-Guard Commander warned that if Fake Godzilla didn't stop, he would have to be destroyed. Torema flew to Japan and pleaded for Fake Godzilla to stop, but was shot down.\nHowever, the ship was grabbed. The real Godzilla had come. He blasted Fake Godzilla, burning off some of the rubber skin and revealing metal inside, proving he was a fake. Godzilla fought and easily destroyed the copy-cat. Zaguresu then revealed she had tried to frame Godzilla. It is likely this Cybot was not the Showa Mechagodzilla given how easy Godzilla destroyed him.\nFake Godzilla appears in the U.S. version of Super Godzilla as its weakest enemy, it only needs one hit to be defeated. However, once hit, it becomes Mechagodzilla, the true boss of the stage.\nAfter Doctor Oniyama finished rebuilding Mechagodzilla for the third time, he crafted a false skin over it which acted as a disguise, recreating Fake Godzilla. Fake Godzilla attacked Godzilla on Oniyama's orders, but was revealed after Godzilla blew off some of the skin on his arm with his Atomic Breath.\nFake Godzilla makes an appearance in issue 13 of Godzilla: Rulers of Earth as a Godzilla disguise used by a Mechagodzilla built by the Cryog aliens. The Fake Godzilla lures Anguirus to the arctic, where it sheds its disguise and reveals itself as Mechagodzilla and attacks Anguirus.\nIn other languages\n- Russian: Лже-Годзилла\n- The Fake Godzilla suit was later used to portray Godzilla wading out to sea at the end of Terror of Mechagodzilla.\n- During Fake Godzilla's appearance through stock footage at the beginning of Terror of Mechagodzilla, it is given Godzilla's normal roar rather than Mechagodzilla's.\n- The Fake Godzilla in Godzilla: Rulers of Earth is modeled after a Godzilla figure produced by Bullmark in 1970.\n- Though Fake Godzilla itself does not appear in the game, Fake Godzilla is referenced in The 2014 Godzilla video game in Mechagodzilla's battle intro, which features Mechagodzilla appearing on fire before it extinguishes to reveal Mechagodzilla, which is a reference to its Fake Godzilla exo-skin being burned off in Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.\nList of appearances\n- Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (First appearance)\n- Terror of Mechagodzilla (Stock footage)\n- Godzilla: Final Wars (Stock footage)","Amroth and NimrodelEdit\nAmroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that Elves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being admitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought wars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once enjoyed. When Dwarves were driven out of Moria by Orcs and also settled in Lothlórien, Nimrodel fled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to the forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became. Nimrodel was too afraid to enter the forest, as she believed that the trees were menacing and some of them moved to bar her entrance.\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel had a long discussion. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that she would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time came when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at peace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again. He suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering Seas to the Undying Lands.\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a haven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those elves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was aware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to any of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made the necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked for Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south towards the Sundering Seas.\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few remaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to leave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they welcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They hoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the White Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was expected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that Amroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from their houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for many weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not arrive.\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor came from the Northern Wastes, swept through Eriador and caused an enormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men of Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind broke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far from the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when Amroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full of despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the water below and drowned.\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely that the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol Eressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the Great Journey.\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were many legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\nThe Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which indirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend, Amroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice often resonated from the stream that shared her name.\nAmroth name means \"upclimber\" or \"high climber\", from am (\"high, going up\"). It might have been derived from the fact that he lived in a flet built high in the trees on Cerin Amroth. The name was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Thranduil.\nAmroth in SongEdit\nAn Elven-maid there was of old,\nA shining star by day:\nHer mantle white was hemmed with gold,\nHer shoes of silver-grey.\nA star was bound upon her brows,\nA light was on her hair\nAs sun upon the golden boughs\nIn Lórien the fair.\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white,\nAnd fair she was and free;\nAnd in the wind she went as light\nAs leaf of linden-tree.\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel,\nBy water clear and cool,\nHer voice as falling silver fell\nInto the shining pool.\nWhere now she wanders none can tell,\nIn sunlight or in shade;\nFor lost of yore was Nimrodel\nAnd in the mountains strayed.\nThe elven-ship in haven grey\nBeneath the mountain-lee\nAwaited her for many a day\nBeside the roaring sea.\nA wind by night in Northern lands\nArose, and loud it cried,\nAnd drove the ship from elven-strands\nAcross the streaming tide.\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost,\nThe mountains sinking grey\nBeyond the heaving waves that tossed\nTheir plumes of blinding spray.\nAmroth beheld the fading shore\nNow low beyond the swell,\nAnd cursed the faithless ship that bore\nHim far from Nimrodel.\nOf old he was an Elven-king,\nA lord of tree and glen,\nWhen golden were the boughs in spring\nIn fair Lothlórien.\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap,\nAs arrow from the string,\nAnd dive into the water deep,\nAs mew upon the wing.\nThe wind was in his flowing hair,\nThe foam about him shone;\nAfar they saw him strong and fair\nGo riding like a swan.\nBut from the West has come no word,\nAnd on the Hither Shore\nNo tidings Elven-folk have heard\nOf Amroth evermore.\nOther versions of the legendariumEdit\nHe was called as Ammalas in earlier writings, and was the lover of Inglorel (Nimrodel).\nTranslations around the WorldEdit\n|Foreign Language||Translated name|\n|Chinese (Hong Kong)||安羅斯|\n|Serbian||Амротх (Cyrillic) Amroth (Latinised)|\n|Uzbek||Амротҳ (Cyrillic) Amroth (Latinised)|\n|King of Lórien|\n| Preceded by|\n|Amroth|| Succeeded by|\nCeleborn and Galadriel (as Lord and Lady of Lothlórien)\n|SA 3434 - TA 1981|\n- ↑ The History of Middle-earth, Vol. 12: The Peoples of Middle-earth, VII: \"The Heirs of Elendil\"\n- ↑ The Lord of the Rings, Appendix B: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), \"The Third Age\"\n- ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 Unfinished Tales, Part Two: The Second Age, IV: \"The History of Galadriel and Celeborn, and of Amroth King of Lórien\"\n- ↑ 4.0 4.1 The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, Book Two, Chapter VI: \"Lothlorien\"\n- ↑ The History of Middle-earth, Vol. 5: The Lost Road and Other Writings, Part Three: \"The Etymologies\"\n- ↑ The History of Middle-earth, Vol. 12: The Peoples of Middle-earth, II: \"The Appendix on Languages\", Languages at the end of the Third Age\n- ↑ The History of Middle-earth, Vol. 7: The Treason of Isengard, XII: \"Lothlórien\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:535026ce-0f02-4cc9-afe0-4c33939224e0>","<urn:uuid:e4eb9a0d-8c71-4c83-b4ee-eda1af2518d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do pathology tests in clinical trials compare to pharmacovigilance monitoring in terms of ensuring patient safety?","answer":"Both pathology tests and pharmacovigilance serve crucial but distinct roles in ensuring patient safety during clinical trials. Pathology testing monitors patient safety by checking drug metabolism, critical blood and organ function, and potential drug interactions with substances inside the body. Meanwhile, pharmacovigilance involves continuous monitoring of all adverse events experienced by trial patients, with serious adverse events (SAEs) being reported within 24 hours to trial sponsors. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are reported within 7 or 15 days and entered into a European database for review by authorities.","context":["The term ‘clinical trial’ is laden with the hope of wonder treatments and medical breakthroughs but beyond the medical community, few people know what is truly involved in clinical trials and how pathology is a key component.\nThe purpose of a clinical trial is to establish evidence to inform clinical practice. Much emphasis is placed on trials that bring new drugs or devices to the clinic, but a large body of research also assesses which existing practices work best; these are known as comparative effectiveness trials.\nAll trials can be broken down into a series of steps:\n1. Hypothesis generation and design\nA clinical question is identified based on addressing an identified problem. For instance, there may be a suspected greater risk of infection in people with an increased BMI (Body Mass Index) who are undergoing large abdominal surgery. Researchers would first check their theory by cross checking medical records and pathology notes. As a possible solution, investigators might suggest using an antibiotic pre-emptively to prevent infection. To test this intervention, researchers would measure the number and types of any infections after surgery, as well as the overall health of patients. Pathology would be used in analysis of infections and ensuring patient safety in the trial.\nPathology is used to make sure a person meets the inclusion criteria to take part in a trial, for example that they have a cancer with specific characteristics such as HER2 positive breast cancer. There are also exclusion criteria that may prevent someone from participating, for example levels of immune system, liver and kidney function. These are confirmed by pathology testing.\n3. Ongoing analysis of drug response:\nIn clinical trials involving drugs, pathology testing is used to check that patients are receiving the dose of drugs as administered because drugs can metabolise differently in different people. Tests also ensure patient safety by monitoring critical blood and organ function that may be affected by drugs. Drug interactions must also be monitored, including interactions with substances inside the body such as foods and other medications, as well as external factors such as sun exposure.\n4. Analysis of data\nPathology results can be used to help prove an intervention has worked. In the example above of using pre-emptive antibiotics, pathology results could show significantly fewer infections in patients receiving the intervention. Other biomarkers could be measured and recorded as secondary outcomes, for example if patients receiving the intervention also had lower rates of inflammation post-surgery.\n5. Correlative studies and future work\nIn drug trials, pharmacogenomic analysis can be used – this testing looks at a person’s genetic make-up for markers that might affect how their body responds to the drug. This could enable researchers to discover or confirm genetic markers that influence the drug action. Discoveries could also point to new areas to research.\n6. Introduction to clinical practice\nFollowing a successful trial of a new drug, pathology results will be used in an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to have the drug approved for medical use in Australia. Not only can pathology prove effectiveness, test results may also inform clinical guidelines, for example when a drug could be toxic to patients with liver conditions or will only work for those who have a specific genetic mutation.\n7. Ongoing surveillance\nOnce a drug is approved it must be monitored for ongoing safety. Pathology tests can be used to look at the risk of long term side effects.\nPAA Ambassador, Prof Nik Zeps said:\n“Pathology really is integral to clinical trials. It is often involved throughout the process from deciding upon a theory and how to test it, to guiding future research and getting the right drug to the right patient. With the explosion in genomics and our growing knowledge of how genetics influence disease risk and response to treatment, pathology testing in clinical trials will become even more important to guide research.”","Before you take part in a cancer trial, you must give your written consent to do so. This is done by signing a consent form.\nYou will be given a Patient Information Leaflet, which explains the details of the trial such as the drugs you’ll be given, how long you’ll be on the trial and how many times you’ll need to visit the hospital so that your progress can be monitored. It will also outline the potential risks, so you are fully informed of all aspects of the trial.\nYou’ll be able to discuss all details and any concerns you may have with the trial’s Doctor and Research Nurse/Radiation Therapist before you sign the consent form, to make sure all your questions have been answered and you are happy to participate.\nEvery reasonable precaution will be taken to ensure your safety during the trial.\nNothing you are told when you consent to take part in a trial alters your legal rights to recover damages should you suffer an injury as a result of participating in a trial.\nParticipation in studies is covered by an approved insurance policy in the name of the company leading the study. This could be an international research organisation or a pharmaceutical company. For studies led by Cancer Trials Ireland, this is covered by the State Claims Agency.\nThe study sponsor will comply with applicable guidelines and with Irish law if you become ill or injured as a result of participation in a study. The amount of any compensation paid may, however, be reduced if you have not complied with the instructions issued for this study. In addition, the medical practitioners involved in this study have medical malpractice insurance coverage in public hospitals under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme managed by the State Claims Agency, and in private hospitals by liability insurance covering research.\nKey points in relation to consent\n- A clinical trial involving a study drug or drug combination has to be approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). The HPRA is Ireland’s state body responsible for regulating medicines, medical devices and other health products. The HPRA decides if a trial can take place in Ireland. It ensures that the trial will be carried out in line with current Irish, EU and international standards for clinical research.\n- A clinical trial must be approved by a national Ethics Committee and/or the Ethics Committee of the hospital in which it is taking place. These independent committees are usually made up of doctors, nurses, medical staff, lawyers and members of the public.\n- Specialist cancer doctors from Cancer Trials Ireland also review trials before they are approved.\n- Numerous precautions are taken to ensure your well-being during a trial. Patient safety on clinical trials is continuously monitored and subject to legally binding reporting requirements. Pharmacovigilance or drug safety in trials involves monitoring events that may be experience by trial patients.\n- The information collected on the effects of the treatment will be shared with other doctors and researchers, but you will not be identified personally.\n- You may withdraw from a study at any time if you wish to do so.\nPatient safety on clinical trials is continuously monitored and subject to legally binding reporting requirements.\nAll adverse events experienced by a trial patient are recorded on the clinical trial report forms. All events are documented whether they are considered related or not to the study drug/treatment. Some of these events are considered serious adverse events (SAEs) if they meet certain criteria, most typically hospitalisation. All serious adverse events are reported by the hospital staff within 24 hours to the sponsor of the trial such as Cancer Trials Ireland.\nOur pharmacovigilance team assess all events and report them (if required) to competent authorities (e.g. the Health Products Regulatory Authority), the concerned national ethics committee (the ethics committee that approved the trial) and all doctors participating in the trial. The serious adverse events that are considered possibly related to the study drug and unexpected for the study drug (suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)) are reported by Cancer Trials Ireland within defined time limits (7 or 15 days). These SUSARs are entered in a European database (Eudravigilance) and subject to consideration and review by the national competent authorities and European Medicines Agency.\nPharmacovigilance is conducted in adherence to national and EU regulations. Pharmacovigilance staff ensure the most up to date regulations are adhered to by attending Irish and European pharmacovigilance information days and by receiving alerts from the HRPA and other organisations. Cancer Trials Ireland’s pharmacovigilance staff ensure compliance with these regulations by following Standard Operating Procedures. Pharmacovigilance compliance is monitored continuously by HPRA.\nIf you require further information, please contact the pharmacovigilance department at firstname.lastname@example.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:176becf1-55a9-4801-be6f-a9d6692eaeaf>","<urn:uuid:4f163788-e93c-43a2-ac3a-aabdea87692c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Being new to studying plasma physics, could you explain the key differences in magnetic field effects between solar photosphere and fusion reactors?","answer":"In the solar photosphere, magnetic fields naturally occur and are responsible for creating visible features like sunspots, while also influencing the granulation pattern of rising and sinking plasma. In fusion reactors, magnetic fields are artificially created and serve a crucial containment function - they're used to keep the hot plasma from touching the vessel walls and to compress it for fusion. Additionally, in fusion reactors, the magnetic fields interact with plasma pressure to generate the 'bootstrap current', a self-generated current that could help make fusion more economically viable by reducing the need for external current drivers.","context":["Supercomputers at NERSC are helping plasma physicists “bootstrap” a potentially more affordable and sustainable fusion reaction. If successful, fusion reactors could provide almost limitless clean energy.\nIn a fusion reaction, energy is released when two hydrogen isotopes are fused together to form a heavier nucleus, helium. To achieve high enough reaction rates to make fusion a useful energy source, hydrogen contained inside the reactor core must be heated to extremely high temperatures—more than 100 million degrees Celsius—which transforms it into hot plasma. Another key requirement of this process is magnetic confinement, the use of strong magnetic fields to keep the plasma from touching the vessel walls (and cooling) and compressing the plasma to fuse the isotopes.\nSo there’s a lot going on inside the plasma as it heats up, not all of it good. Driven by electric and magnetic forces, charged particles swirl around and collide into one another, and the central temperature and density are constantly evolving. In addition, plasma instabilities disrupt the reactor’s ability to produce sustainable energy by increasing the rate of heat loss.\nFortunately, research has shown that other, more beneficial forces are also at play within the plasma. For example, if the pressure of the plasma varies across the radius of the vessel, a self-generated current will spontaneously arise within the plasma—a phenomenon known as the “bootstrap” current.\nNow an international team of researchers has used NERSC supercomputers to further study the bootstrap current, which could help reduce or eliminate the need for an external current driver and pave the way to a more cost-effective fusion reactor. Matt Landreman, research associate at the University of Maryland’s Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics, collaborated with two research groups to develop and run new codes at NERSC that more accurately calculate this self-generated current. Their findings appear in Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion and Physics of Plasmas.\n“The codes in these two papers are looking at the average plasma flow and average rate at which particles escape from the confinement, and it turns out that plasma in a curved magnetic field will generate some average electric current on its own,” Landreman said. “Even if you aren’t trying to drive a current, if you take the hydrogen and heat it up and confine it in a curved magnetic field, it creates this current that turns out to be very important. If we ever want to make a tokamak fusion plant down the road, for economic reasons the plasma will have to supply a lot of its own current.”\nOne of the unique things about plasmas is that there is often a complicated interaction between where particles are in space and their velocity, Landreman added.\n“To understand some of their interesting and complex behaviors, we have to solve an equation that takes into account both the position and the velocity of the particle,” he said. “That is the core of what these computations are designed to do.”\nEvolving Plasma BehaviorThe Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion paper focuses on plasma behavior in tokamak reactors using PERFECT, a code Landreman wrote. Tokamak reactors, first introduced in the 1950s, are today considered by many to be the best candidate for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion power. A tokamak features a torus (doughnut-shaped) vessel and a combination of external magnets and a current driven in the plasma required to create a stable confinement system.\nIn particular, PERFECT was designed to examine the plasma edge, a region of the tokamak where “lots of interesting things happen,” Landreman said. Before PERFECT, other codes were used to predict the flows and bootstrap current in the central plasma and solve equations that assume the gradients of density and temperature are gradual.\n“The problem with the plasma edge is that the gradients are very strong, so these previous codes are not necessarily valid in the edge, where we must solve a more complicated equation,” he said. “PERFECT was built to solve such an equation.”\nFor example, in most of the inner part of the tokamak there is a fairly gradual gradient of the density and temperature. “But at the edge there is a fairly big jump in density and temperature—what people call the edge pedestal. What is different about PERFECT is that we are trying to account for some of this very strong radial variation,” Landreman explained.\nThese findings are important because researchers are concerned that the bootstrap current may affect edge stability. PERFECT is also used to calculate plasma flow, which also may affect edge stability.\n“My co-authors had previously done some analytic calculations to predict how the plasma flow and heat flux would change in the pedestal region compared to places where radial gradients aren’t as strong,” Landreman said. “We used PERFECT to test these calculations with a brute force numerical calculation at NERSC and found that they agreed really well. The analytic calculations provide insight into how the plasma flow and heat flux will be affected by these strong radial gradients.”\nFrom Tokamak to Stellarator\nIn the Physics of Plasmas study, the researchers used a second code, SFINCS, to focus on related calculations in a different kind of confinement concept: a stellarator. In a stellarator the magnetic field is not axisymmetric, meaning that it looks different as you circle around the donut hole. As Landreman put it, “A tokamak is to a stellarator as a standard donut is to a cruller.”\nFirst introduced in the 1950s, stellarators have played a central role in the German and Japanese fusion programs and were popular in the U.S. until the 1970s when many fusion scientists began favoring the tokamak design. In recent years several new stellarators have appeared, including the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) in Germany, the Helically Symmetric Experiment in the U.S. and the Large Helical Device in Japan. Two of Landreman’s coauthors on the Physics of Plasmas paper are physicists from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, where W7-X is being constructed.\n“In the W7-X design, the amount of plasma current has a strong effect on where the heat is exhausted to the wall,” Landreman explained. “So at Max Planck they are very concerned about exactly how much self-generated current there will be when they turn on their machine. Based on a prediction for this current, a set of components called the ‘divertor’ was located inside the vacuum vessel to accept the large heat exhaust. But if the plasma makes more current than expected, the heat will come out in a different location, and you don’t want to be surprised.”\nTheir concerns stemmed from the fact that the previous code was developed when computers were too slow to solve the “real” 4D equation, he added.\n“The previous code made an approximation that you could basically ignore all the dynamics in one of the dimensions (particle speed), thereby reducing 4D to 3D,” Landreman said. “Now that computers are faster, we can test how good this approximation was. And what we found was that basically the old code was pretty darn accurate and that the predictions made for this bootstrap current are about right.”\nThe calculations for both studies were run on Hopper and Edison using some additional NERSC resources, Landreman noted.\n“I really like running on NERSC systems because if you have a problem, you ask a consultant and they get back to you quickly,” Landreman said. “Also knowing that all the software is up to date and it works. I’ve been using NX lately to speed up the graphics. It’s great because you can plot results quickly without having to download any data files to your local computer.”\nTop Photo: A section of the W7-X plasma vessel.

{"question":"How to build a 3D printed house in less time and with lower costs? 🏠","answer":"3D printed houses can be built quickly and cost-effectively using a layer-by-layer mortar printing process. For example, a 250 square meter office complex in Dubai was completed in just 17 days for $140,000. The process involves using a large 3D printer to lay down the mortar, followed by manual installation of windows, panes, electricity, and utilities. This method can reduce construction costs by up to 90%, cut labor demand by 70%, and reduce building time by 80%. Some companies, like ICON in Texas, can print homes of 55-75 square meters in under 24 hours for as little as $4,000.","context":["For the last week, Michael Torpak, a sculptor from Prague, has been overseeing his latest project.\nIt’s a new home that he hopes will be ready to launch on the Vltava River in early August.\nThe home itself took a few weeks to design. It’s shaped like a protozoa – a primitive sea living and free moving parasite – with one bedroom, a kitchen and a planted roof.\nWhat’s remarkable about the structure is that it was built in less than 48 hours, for a cost for a few thousands euros.\nTorpak worked with a 3D printing company to do the job. The mortar was printed layer by layer, and then the windows, panes, electricity and utilities were installed by a hand.\nIt’s a nice little project. And houses and huts like this are springing up cities across the world.\nIn Dubai, for example, a Chinese company called WinSun has printed a 250 square meter office complex using a printer the size of a five aside football field.\nThe building was finished in just 17 days and cost $140,000. It stands 31 feet tall with a traditional foundation made of precast concrete, and a structure that is reinforced with concrete and rebar.\nDubai plans to ‘print’ 25% of all ‘new build’ property by 2030. And there are serious benefits to this method of construction.\nFor one thing, it’s a cheap way to build. The Dubai government estimates that reaching the 25 percent 3D printed building goal will reduce labor demand in construction by 70 percent, cut costs by 90 percent, and reduce the time it takes to build by 80 percent.\nSecondly, this method of construction is quite friendly to the environment.\nBuilding and construction are responsible for 39% of all carbon emissions in the world, with operational emissions (from energy used to heat, cool and light buildings) accounting for 28%.\nBut by using materials and printing houses in a matter of days, there is serious scope for reducing the emissions.\nA group of architects in America have used mud to create prototype 3D-printed earth structures for example.\nItalian 3D-printing company WASP is even working on a 3D printing machine that can build houses from soil and agricultural waste.\nWill we build structures like these in the UK?\nI think we will. I can see how you might decide to build a structure of your own in your back garden, or a modest 3D cabin by a river or lake in the countryside.\nThe house below, for example, was 3D printed by a company called ICON in Texas.\nThe prototype for the 3D printed house cost around $10,000 in about 24 hours. But homes of about 55 to 75 square metres will soon be “printed” in under 24 hours for $4,000.\nYou can take a look around the inside of the house in this video.\nA Planet of Slums\nI think the biggest use of 3D printing, however, could be in supplying affordable housing in cities.\nIn the last few decades, we’ve seen a vast exodus in developing countries from the countryside in the city. Many of these people have ended up living in vast slums outside major cities with very poor housing and facilities.\nThe scale of this industrialisation utterly dwarfs that of the Victorian age, says Mike Davis in his book Planet of Slums.\nLondon in 1910 was seven times larger than it had been in 1800.\nBut today, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kinshasa in the Congo, and Lagos in Nigeria, are each approximately 40 times larger than they were in 1950.\nIn many cities, 3D printing could provide a means to produce good quality housing for slum dwellers.\nIt would be relatively cheap for the government to undertake these projects, and it might help reduce poverty and the environmental impact of slum life.\nAs Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has pointed out, these slums are often a thriving hotbed of small entrepreneurs’ selling vegetables, doing laundry, and even opening small bars and restaurants.\nIf these people were afforded decent housing and property rights, they might be able to borrow against their property to scale up their businesses.\nICON, who built the house in Texas, are currently 3D printing affordable housing in El Salvador and have plans to expand from there.\n3D Printing Farms\nIn fact, I see a big future for 3D printing.\nIn the next ten years, I can see printer farms springing up in most major cities.\nThese factories will have printers of all sizes and they will could supply most of the goods needed where they are needed—whether semiconductors, medical equipment, drugs, body parts, food, vehicles, robots or houses.\nClearly, the present way of manufacturing things is unsustainable.\nThe global supply chains involved in sourcing components from different parts of the world, cobbling them together into products and then shipping them to end markets is increasingly risky and costly.\nThis is where a cluster of fast evolving technologies comes in, comprising generative software design, 3D printing, robotics and new synthetic materials.\nIn fact, you can read more about the 3D Printing boom in our free Life After Covid report."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f3395a34-dfed-4684-9133-2ec835e10b92>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm planning to renovate my home's cooling system. How do heat pumps compare to evaporative cooling in terms of environmental impact and energy efficiency?","answer":"Heat pumps and evaporative cooling systems differ in their environmental impact and efficiency. Heat pumps are highly efficient since they don't produce heat but merely move it from one place to another, using less electricity than traditional systems. They emit no greenhouse gases directly, making them environmentally friendly. Evaporative cooling systems are also eco-friendly and energy-efficient, using only a fan and pump system that consumes less energy than refrigerant-based systems. They emit no gases and minimize carbon footprint. However, evaporative cooling effectiveness is limited in humid conditions and only provides cooling, while heat pumps can both heat and cool your home year-round.","context":["Because the conditions alter, you should ensure your property remains to be cozy all season-spherical, and here is where temperature pumps come in. Temperature pumps are an efficient substitute for conventional HVAC techniques which use fuel or electrical energy. heat pump (värmepump) They supply both air conditioning to your home, leading them to be an all-in-one remedy for your house heating and cooling needs. So, whether or not it’s the recent summer time or perhaps the chilly cold months of winter, temperature pumps have got you taken care of.\nPrecisely What Are Temperature Pumping systems?\nHeat pumps are appliances that actually work by moving heating from a spot to one more. They serve as a form of two-way air-con device that can either amazing or temperature your home. Heat pumps work using the theory that hot air passes from hotter to chillier spaces. Throughout the warm summertime, heating pumping systems transfer warmth from the property, chilling the atmosphere inside the house. When it’s frosty, heat pumping systems reverse the approach, shifting temperature from the outside into the house to cozy it up. This technique functions efficiently mainly because it needs significantly less electrical power to move warmth from a place to an additional than it can do to build heat.\nVarieties of Heat Pumps\nThe two main types of heating pumps: atmosphere-source and terrain-provider. Oxygen-supply heating pumping systems function by transferring heat between your home and the outdoors air flow. They utilize backyard and indoors units to attract in and expel air flow as well as heat. On the other hand, terrain-provider warmth pumping systems, also called geothermal heating pumping systems, make use of the normal heat of the the planet to temperature and cool your property. They function by working drinking water through below ground pipes that bring temperature through the the planet to deliver warmth in the wintertime or release warmth in summer time.\nBenefits associated with Temperature Pumping systems\nThe key benefits of heat pumps are that they are efficient, adaptable, and cost-efficient. Temperature pumps have great productivity because they don’t produce warmth but move it. Therefore, they prefer significantly less electrical power, which decreases electricity charges. Also, they are adaptable simply because they supply both air conditioning to your property, which means you only have to install 1 model as opposed to two individual air conditioning methods. In addition, heat pumping systems are eco friendly since they produce no emissions. In addition, they may be risk-free and easy to work.\nWarmth Pumps or. Classic Heating and air conditioning Techniques\nHeat pumps are an alternative to standard Heating and air conditioning solutions such as furnaces and air conditioners. Heating pumping systems provide all-in-one particular heating and cooling and therefore are far more power-productive than traditional systems. Heating and air conditioning systems make heating by eliminating standard fuels for example natural gas and propane, giving off garden greenhouse gas that give rise to climate change. On the flip side, heating pumping systems emit no garden greenhouse gas, leading them to be an environmentally friendly solution.\nIn a nutshell:\nTemperature pumping systems are a competent, cost-effective, and eco-helpful way to warmth and cool your own home all through the year. While temperature pumps might be a little bit pricier than conventional Heating and air conditioning methods to put in, they could help you save money in the end because of their energy performance. With heating pumps, you are also doing your component in aiding to conserve the planet. So, no matter if you’re replacing an older HVAC program or constructing a home, consider utilizing a temperature water pump for your home air conditioning requirements.","Air conditioning and evaporative cooling are prevalent. Technically, evaporative cooling is a form of air conditioning, but we’re comparing the two based on their cooling methods.\nEvaporative cooling refers to water-based roof-mounted systems. Wall-mounted split systems and ducted solutions may heat and chill. Dual-function reverse cycle.\nBoth systems are effective, but neither is universal. Evaporative cooling vs air conditioning: a no-holds-barred duel. We’ll walk you through the main event to help you decide which is best.\nWhat’s The Difference Between Evaporative Cooling And AC?\nAn evaporative cooling system uses water to chill air and moves it around your home, while air conditioning (split systems and ducted) relies on refrigerant gases and a chemical process. There’s more to consider when backing a winner.\nWhat Is Evaporative Cooling?\nEvaporative cooling is eco-friendly and efficient. The roof-mounted unit filters hot, dry air via water-filled cooling pads. The water evaporates to generate a cooling vapor. Through unobtrusive vents, the system’s fan disperses air to a central area or preferred rooms.\nEvaporative cooling devices are often called swamp coolers, however, they’re useless under excessive humidity.\nHow Does Reverse Cycle Ac Work?\nSplit systems, multi-head units, and ducted air conditioners all use refrigerant gases. Most units produce reverse-cycle air, so they can heat and chill all year.\nOne unit indoors and a compressor outside make up an air conditioner. The two work together to remove hot air from the home while refrigerant gas cools incoming airflow. Air conditioners are efficient, but their high running costs make them expensive for some.\n1. The Price\nA new system’s pricing depends on size, performance, and installation complexity. The split system air conditioner is the most economical equipment.\nThe ducting, ventilation, compressor, and installation needs vary per job. The best approach to finding the upfront cost is to compare estimates.\n2. Running Costs\nEvaporative cooling is an affordable option. These fan-and-pump systems are more energy-efficient than refrigerant air conditioning.\nHeating and cooling account for 20% to 50% of a building’s energy use, so using an evaporative unit or refrigerated air conditioner with a high energy rating can reduce your electricity expenditures.\n3. Healthy Choice\nSplit and ducted AC recirculate indoor air, lowering its quality and exposing occupants to dust and allergens.\nEvaporative coolers use fresh air, which is healthier for breathing. Good evaporative coolers evaporate water when it’s not needed, so there’s no standing water to promote bacteria. Dusty ventilation systems or external pollutants can damage evaporative cooling’s fresh air quality.\nEvaporative coolers utilize less energy than air conditioners and emit no gas, minimizing your carbon impact.\nEach generation of air conditioners is more environmentally benign than the last, although they contribute to greenhouse gas emissions through energy use.\nBoth provide great climate control, but evaporative cooling is less effective in humid conditions. Since the cooling effect relies on evaporating moisture, these systems perform best in hot, dry circumstances and can’t achieve intended results when the outside air is damp.\n6. Temperature Control\nEvaporative cooling isn’t heating. It’s cool. An evaporative system may have fan speed or strength options, but it will always be cooling. So a winter heating solution may be needed. Modern air conditioners are reverse cycle, so you may be comfortable year-round.\nDoors and windows should be left open while using an evaporative cooler so hot air may escape. On a 40-degree day, you may not want the doors or windows open. A reverse cycle system removes warm air as it cools."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:54a31518-c1da-4a11-96fb-f8b02805aced>","<urn:uuid:b3fade29-a916-4078-a67b-76ae1baa320e>"],"error":null}

According to a report attached to an affidavit which was handed to the Gauteng High Court, an internal inquiry found that the soldiers cannot be held responsible for Collins Khoza's death. The report stated that Khoza was \"pushed” and “klapped” and “conscious and healthy when the security forces left.” According to the South African National Defence Force's report, an internal board of inquiry has concluded its investigation into the incident on April 10 and found that neither the SANDF nor the Joburg Metro Police were at fault. This, in spite of a post mortem report stating that Khosa had died of blunt force trauma to the head. According to the SANDF report, there is no link between the injuries he sustained and the actions of the soldiers.\nAll domestic workers can return to work on Monday – subject to 'protocols28 May 2020 | 9 Minute Listen\nGuest : Pinky Mashiane | President at United Domestic Workers of South Africa | All domestic workers will be allowed to go back to work during Alert Level 3, cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma confirmed on Thursday.\nWill Coronavirus Kill Astrology?27 May 2020 | 27 Minute Listen\nGuest : Dawn Carter - From Soul Direction | Dawn Carter, an astrologer from Soul Direction and who can be reached through her website (www.souldirection.co.za) and also on Facebook and Instagram. www.souldirection.co.za email@example.com\nLavender in Lavender Hill sows hope27 May 2020 | 13 Minute Listen\nGuest : Marcelle Du Plessis | Fund Raising and Communications Manager at Mdzananda Animal Clinic Khayelitsha | The voice of my next guest is one you're no doubt familiar with.

{"question":"Can you explain what defines bullying behavior and what tips are recommended to prevent it? 请详细说明～","answer":"Bullying is defined as the use of force or coercion to abuse or intimidate others, requiring two key elements: an intentional act to hurt someone and an imbalance of power. It's behavior designed to threaten, frighten, or exert control over someone often perceived as 'different' or 'weak.' To prevent bullying, several key tips are recommended: 1) Do not physically fight back as it can be dangerous, instead walk away and avoid the bully, 2) Tell a trusted adult about the situation, even if it's embarrassing, 3) Parents should talk to their children daily about their school experiences, 4) Families should educate themselves on school bullying policies, and 5) Parents should work with their children to problem-solve together rather than taking matters into their own hands.","context":["October is National Bullying Prevention Month and awareness of this harmful behavior is on the rise; parents are beginning to realize that it’s not just child’s play, but a serious problem with serious effects. Not to say that the numbers are down, but campaigns against bullying are up, raising awareness for the 1 in 4 students who report being victims of bullying behavior. At GET SAFE, we empower students (victims and bullies,) parents and faculty by providing education and tools, such as the following basic prevention and response tips, to help create a safer, more inclusive school culture.\nBullies often target those who are perceived as “different.” By its very definition, bullying is a form of intimidation, behavior designed to threaten, frighten, or to exert power and control over another person, who is often perceived as “weak,” “different,” or “other.” Bullying may be physical (hitting, kicking, pushing), verbal (taunting, name-calling, threatening), emotional (spreading rumors, manipulating social relationships, extortion), and/or sexual.\nWhile bullying will always be an issue in schools, there are some basic steps you and your little scholar can take to prevent and appropriately react to bullying-behavior.\nHere are GET SAFE’s top tips to tackle bullying:\n- Do NOT physically fight back. This can be dangerous, and may only make things worse if it leads to retaliation or escalation to weapons. Instead, ask the bully to leave you alone (eh…), walk or run away (better…), and try to avoid them (best!) Also, find a group of positive peers—maybe from after-school activities such as art class, sports, or music—to hang out with.\n- Tell a trusted adult. Bullying can sometimes be embarrassing, or you may be afraid of getting in trouble or losing a “friend,” but it’s always best to ask for help. If you don’t feel comfortable telling a parent, tell another adult you trust, such as a close relative, coach or teacher.\nClick to download: GET SAFE Bullying Tip Sheet – For Students\n- Talk to your kids daily. Ask them what they did before, during, and after-school that day. If you suspect your child is being bullied, ask the deeper level questions: “Who did you play with today?” “What was the best part of your day? The worst?” Have this talk in a relaxed environment; while the subject is serious, the discussion doesn’t have to be.\n- Educate yourself on school policy. Does it reward good behavior and embrace diversity? Is there an anonymous reporting system? Do they have a proper rehabilitation program for bullies? Sit down and go over your school’s (after-school program, place of worship, etc.) bullying policy—including consequences—with your child so they know too.\n- Problem-Solve, Together. As parents, our first reaction to hearing our child is being bullied might be to go teach that bully (or her parents) a lesson ourselves. But retaliation sends the wrong message to your child. Bullying behavior already leaves its victim feeling powerless, and if you “fix” the problem for your child, it will only dis-empower him or her further. Instead, have your kid brainstorm some solutions, and only offer suggestions if they get stuck. Remember, we always want to try to create independence and confidence in our children.\nClick to download: GET SAFE Bullying Tip Sheet – For Parents\nBullying is significantly under-reported and unfortunately not all victims show warning signs. However, the main indicator to watch out for is a change in personality or behavior. If your child is angrier or withdrawn, is asking you to replace “lost” lunch money, or is lashing out at you more than the usual, “Why can’t I eat ice cream for breakfast!?” start in on those deeper-level questions.\nIs There a Solution?\nNo matter what tools you equip your child with or how well-versed you are on school policy—kids are going to be cruel. The best solution is to educate schools, students and parents about our differences; people are scared of the unknown, people are scared of different—so they lash out. Students, parents and faculty/administration all need to work together to create a compassionate, more inclusive school culture. After every GET SAFE Bullying Prevention & Personal Safety training, we ask our students to take the BACKOFF! Buddy Pledge™ to help raise bullying prevention awareness, as well as give the students control and accountability. The pledge states:\n“I pledge to use my voice as a BACKOFF! Buddy to take a stand against bullying behavior. If I see someone being bullied, I will go tell an adult I trust. If I am being a bully, or see my friends being bullies, I will stop and remember that everyone has a right to feel safe.”\nWhen we build understanding, we promote acceptance and unity. Remember, people, it takes a village.","What is bullying?\nMost experts on bullying define it as the use of force or coercion to abuse or intimidate others. In order to be considered bullying, the behavior must be aggressive and include:\n- An intentional act to hurt or harm someone\n- An imbalance of power\nWhat are the types of bullying?\nBullying can be done in various forms. Here are the ways in which people are bullied:\n- Verbal: this includes inappropriate sexual comments, name calling, teasing and taunting.\n- Social, emotional or psychological: this can involve spreading rumors, public embarrassment or humiliation or excluding someone from a group or activity.\n- Physical: this may include beatings, tripping, hitting, kicking or destroying property.\n- Electronically: also known as cyberbullying, this is when threats, hate messages and other forms of digital abuse are delivered via electronic media such as email, websites, social media or text messages.\nWhat are the warning signs of bullying?\nThe best way to help your child handle bullying is to know when it's occurring and respond to it. Remember that every kid can have an \"off\" day and not all children being bullied show these warning signs. But look for an atypical pattern of behavior in your child. The following are some bullying red flags to look for:\n- avoids school situations (such as after-school activities, walking to school or riding the bus)\n- sudden loss of friends\n- significant and sudden drop in academic performance (homework, grades and attendance) or not wanting to go to school\n- lost or destroyed personal belongings such as electronics, books, jewelry, money, school supplies or clothing\n- physical complaints such as stomach aches, headaches, nausea or faking illness (goes to nurse to avoid class)\n- difficulty sleeping, frequent nightmares, bed wetting or cries self to sleep\n- changes in appetite like binge eating, skipping meals or hungrier than normal after school (which could be due to a stolen lunch or lunch money or avoiding the cafeteria)\n- waits to use the bathroom at home (to avoid being bullied in the school's restrooms)\n- sudden weight loss\n- low self-esteem or feelings of helplessness\n- fear of being left alone or clingy\n- distress after being on the phone or online\n- unexplainable injuries such as bruises, cuts, scratches or scrapes\n- runs away from home, talks of suicide, harms him or herself or other self-destructive behaviors\nWhat should I do if my child is bullied?\nIf your child is being bullied, he or she may not tell you about it. Bullied children may feel helpless, weak, embarrassed or ashamed. They may fear that you or others will punish or judge them or be upset or angry at them. They may worry that you'll confront the bully or tell them to do so. Or they may think that you won't understand, care or believe it's happening.\nThat's why you need to take the situation seriously. Talk with your child about the bullying. Ask direct questions. Find out when it happens, who is involved and what is said or done. Ask what your child has done to stop it (if anything) and what's been successful and unsuccessful. Record the details and facts objectively. The more specifics you get, the better.\nListen to your child tell you what's going on lovingly and calmly, expressing your concern, support and understanding. Remind him or her that it's not his or her fault. Praise your child for talking to you about it, saying you're there to help and he or she is no longer alone.\nIf your child won't open up, look for opportunities to discuss bullying such as talking about a relevant situation on a television show or something that happened with another family member or friend. If your child won't confide in you, set up a conference with a trusted adult such as a family friend, teacher or coach.\nThen, reach out to school authorities such as a teacher, principal or guidance counselor. Find out what the school teaches students about bullying and the school's anti-bullying policies. Ask them what they can do to help address the bullying. And don't be afraid to reach out again if the bullying resumes.\nAfter you talk with school officials, you may consider contacting the police or a lawyer if you believe your child has been threatened or attacked physically or in any harmful way.\nIf you know a bullying incident has occurred, tell your child's teacher and school principal immediately. Ask about the school's bullying policy and for a specific action plan."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3301882a-27c8-4605-95d8-539fc99b71d7>","<urn:uuid:4405b2f7-3b74-4a4c-8e5b-62247a6d2d0c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the specific applications of RFID tool tracking in construction sites, and what mounting options are available for metal surfaces?","answer":"In construction sites, RFID tool tracking systems help increase tool availability by reducing losses and simplifying delivery movements between sites, while enabling easy check-in/check-out of tools and equipment with a simple scan. The system extends to materials and yard management, including tracking of rebars. For mounting on metal surfaces, there are several options available: special adhesives designed specifically for metal surfaces, welding for high-temperature applications, and bolting methods. The technology is particularly well-suited for construction sites because it outperforms traditional methods like barcodes in field operations.","context":["RFID Tool Tracking in\nAviation, Manufacturing, Rail, Construction\nTool Tracking RFID systems are designed to actively prevent FOD and FME incidents and drive safety in mission-critical operations such as Aviation, Rail, Defense, Manufacturing, Nuclear, Construction.\nThey automate tool management procedures by tracking and controlling tools throughout their workflow and lifecycle using tags, tool storage hardware, and software.\nTHE CHALLENGES OF TOOL MANAGEMENT\nTool Tracking RFID systems are deployed in mission-critical environments that cannot afford the FOD and FME risks that come with relying on employees to manually track and record the hand tools, power tools, and equipment they use throughout the day. But successfully deploying tool tracking systems involves overcoming many challenges regarding the tool inventory, existing processes, change management, and technology.\nAviation and industrial operations have first-hand experiences of the limitations of manual Tool Management processes relying on tool foam organizers, sign-in/sign-out procedures, visual identifiers, or barcodes:\nLoss of tools due to misplacement or outright theft, and therefore the direct cost of replacement.\nLost productivity due to personnel check-out/check-in of tools, searching for lost tools or waiting for replacements to arrive.\nPoor customer satisfaction from missed commitments, maintenance, and added costs.\nSmall Tool Tracking is another sizeable challenge: With sockets and ratchets accounting for up to 30% of a typical tool inventory in MRO operations, delivering a near 100% tool tracking coverage is critical in environments prone to FOD and FME incidents.\nUSING THE RIGHT RFID SYSTEM\nStarting a Tool Tracking RFID System involves a tagging strategy to RFID-enable a tool inventory made of various hand tools, smaller tools, power tools, and equipment to track.\nXerafy has developed a unique range of RFID tagging options, built on overcoming several challenges of traditional RFID technology relating to Tool Management when it comes to metal interference, harsh environments, and long-range read distance requirements:\nRFID for environments with a high density of metal surfaces\nRFID tagging options adapted to various form factors and materials (metal, plastics, wood)\nRFID optimized for tool tracking applications: Size-to-performance ratio, long read-range, accuracy, and reliability\nReliable tagging techniques that are proven in the field for shocks, abrasion, fluids, chemicals\nScalable tagging methods adapted to larger tool inventories\nXerafy provides tool tagging options that can be either mounted or embedded into tools and equipment at point-of-use. Many industries favor a combination of Epoxy and Heat-Shrink Tubing to retrofit their tool inventories. In addition, some use a carrier to add an extra level of protection against shocks and fluids.\nWorking with leading manufacturers such as Stanley Black & Decker (for its Cribmaster, Proto, and Facom brands), Kyoto Tool, SnapOn, Xerafy has pioneered a new approach that sees them offering ranges of 'smart tools' with native RFID features embedded at point-of-manufacture to enable tracking, identification, location, usage data capture. In doing so, tool manufacturers respond to strong demand for evolutions in tool management towards Connected Tools.\nIndustrial operations rely on specialized tools and equipment: Securing them from theft and locating them quickly when they are needed is critically important in their daily operations.\nBy improving both the accuracy and the effectiveness of tool tracking, RFID tool tracking reduces the substantial costs of tool availability and life cycle.\nThe drawbacks of manual tool tracking in industrial environments are well documented:\nLoss of tools, due to misplacement or outright theft, and therefore the direct cost of replacement\nLost productivity due to personnel check-out/check-in of tools, searching for lost tools, or waiting for replacements to arrive\nPoor customer satisfaction from missed commitments, maintenance, and added cost\nIn mission-critical operations such as Aircraft MRO, unaccounted tools and other maintenance incidents can have catastrophic consequences.\nTool Control procedures traditionally rely on visual tool identifications such as tool foam organizers for toolboxes and drawers. Tool cribs and sign-in/sign-out procedures provided another level of control but with limited efficacy and accuracy.\nMRO operations have been early adopters of technology solutions for Tool Control, setting the standard for how other industries can address their own safety, compliance, and productivity challenges.\nAutomated Tool Control (ATC) solutions from market leaders such as Cribmaster Storeroom and Tool Crib Management, SnapOn Level5 Automation Solutions, Nexess Smart Cabinet, bring tool control RFID systems to drive safety, efficiency, and digitization.\nThe ATC solutions are built around multiple smart RFID-enabled mobile and fixed tool storage options, including tool crib, tool trolley, tool cart, tool cabinet, CICO kiosk, tool room, toolbox.\nRailway operations leverage RFID for the management of their tools and rolling stock.\nOperators of passengers, freight, and metro services rely on RFID systems for smart tool management of train maintenance operations.\nXerafy RFID also powers self-reporting communications systems to drive rolling stock availability and safety as used by manufacturers of locomotives and unpowered rail vehicles.\nConstruction sites rely on a complex and fluid organization. RFID Systems for Tool Tracking brings them the situational awareness required to run smoothly and safely, helping with the location and availability of tools and equipment in the field.\nTools, equipment, teams, materials, sites: Maintaining a safe and efficient on-site environment is a daily challenge for the Construction industry.\nConstruction Tool Tracking RFID Systems are helping to increase the availability of tools on site by reducing losses and delivery movements to different sites. Employees can easily check-in and check-out tools and equipment with a simple scan. RFID Systems extend to materials and yard management, for instance, keeping track of rebars.\nMarket adoption is supported by a very diversified offering with RFID solutions and software adapted to team sizes, contractors, tool and equipment types, IT configurations (onsite / cloud, mobile / ERP).\nRFID is particularly well suited to construction sites: The technology's traditional advantage over Barcodes and other optical identification methods are at their maximum when it comes to operations in the field.","When it comes to using RFID technology, one of the biggest challenges is getting a tag to work on or around metal surfaces. Metal can interfere with the radio waves used to transmit information from an RFID anti-metal tag, making it difficult to read the tag’s data.\nHowever, you can improve the performance of RFID tags on metal surfaces. This article evaluates the effects of metal on RFID and best practices for using RFID tags on or around metal surfaces.\nRFID on Metal – Why is It Tricky?\nRFID tags contain a chip that stores information about the item to which it is attached. This information is transmitted to an RFID reader via radio waves. The reader then uses this information to track the item or perform other functions.\nThe problem is that metal surfaces can interfere with the radio waves used to transmit information from an RFID tag to the reader. This interference can make it difficult, or even impossible, for the reader to receive and interpret the information from the tag.\nThere are a few reasons why metal causes this interference:\n- Metal surfaces can reflect radio waves, making it difficult for the waves to reach the tag.\n- Metal surfaces can absorb radio waves, preventing the waves from reaching the tag.\n- Metal surfaces can conduct electricity, creating electrical noise that interferes with the signal from the tag.\nBecause of these reasons, it can be difficult to get RFID tags to work on metal surfaces. However, you can circumvent the problem using a few hacks.\nSome Ways to Improve RFID Performance on Metal Surfaces\nWhile there is no guaranteed way to make RFID work perfectly on metal surfaces, there are a few things you can do to help improve performance. They include:\n- Use Metal Mount RFID Tags\nSome RFID tags are specifically designed to be used on metal surfaces. These tags have a special mounting system that helps reduce the effects of metal interference.\nFor example, some manufacturers offer RFID Anti-Metal tags with a gap between the tag and the metal surface. This gap helps to reduce interference by allowing radio waves to pass through without being reflected or absorbed by the metal.\n- Use a Low-Frequency RFID System\nOne way to reduce the effects of metal interference is to use a low-frequency RFID system. These systems operate at frequencies less likely to be affected by metal surfaces.\nFor example, most low-frequency RFID systems operate at 125 kHz or 134.2 kHz. These frequencies have a longer wavelength than higher frequencies, which makes them less likely to be affected by metal surfaces.\nHowever, they have a lower data transfer rate, which may not be suitable for all applications. If you want the benefits of high data transmission, you should use HF or UHF metal-mount RFID tags. This way, you can still take advantage of the long wavelength while maintaining a high data transfer rate.\nWhat is RFID Anti-Metal Tag?\nAn RFID anti-metal tag works optimally on or around metal surfaces. They are used in harsh or difficult environments where other tags would fail. As such, these tags are designed to be hardy. Some of their features include:\n- High-Temperature Tolerance. These tags can withstand high temperatures of up to 200 ℃. This property is useful in applications where the tags will be exposed to extreme heat, such as in a foundry.\n- Corrosion Resistance. RFID anti-metal tags are also designed to resist corrosion. This resistance is critical in applications where the tags will be exposed to corrosive materials, such as chemicals or salt water.\n- Flexibility. These tags are also flexible, making them ideal for applications where they need to conform to a curved surface.\n- High Stability. RFID anti-metal tags have high stability, meaning they retain their properties even after exposure to extreme conditions.\n- Good Read Performance. Anti-metal RFID tags have good read performance. This is critical since most of these tags are used outdoors or in other difficult environments.\n- Superior Protection. RFID anti-metal tags offer superior protection against physical and environmental damage. This protection is crucial in applications where the tags will be exposed to harsh conditions, such as on a construction site. The protection ranges from IP63 to IP68.\nHow to Use RFID Anti-Metal Tags?\nRFID anti-metal tags can be used in a variety of applications. Some of the most common include:\n- Asset Tracking. These tags track assets, such as equipment or tools. This is especially useful in construction or manufacturing where there is a need to track the location of equipment.\n- Inventory Management. RFID anti-metal tags can be used in warehouses or retail stores to track metallic inventory. This way, you can know what is in stock and where it is located.\n- Vehicle Tracking. These tags can be used to track vehicles. This is useful for fleet management or security purposes.\nHow to Attach RFID Tags on Metal Surfaces?\nThe attachment method you use will depend on the type of RFID tag you are using. For example, some RFID tags come with a special adhesive designed for use on metal surfaces.\nIt is also necessary to consider the environment where the tag will be used. For example: If the tag will be exposed to high temperatures, you will need to use a method that can withstand those temperatures.\nSome attachment methods include:\n- Adhesives. Adhesives are a common method for attaching RFID tags to metal surfaces. However, not all adhesives are suitable for use on metal. You must use an RFID tag with a special adhesive designed for use on metal.\n- Welding. Welding is another effective method for attaching RFID tags to metal surfaces. This method is often used in applications where the tag will be exposed to high temperatures.\n- Bolting. Bolting is another common method for attaching RFID tags to metal surfaces. This method is often used in applications where the tag will be exposed to high temperatures.\nWhichever attachment method you choose; it is critical to test the tag before using it in your application. This will eliminate any potential problems that could affect its functionality.\n- What are RFID Standards?

{"question":"What are the typical linguistic differences between male and female speakers in English?","answer":"Women tend to use more prestigious and polite language forms than men of the same social background. Women frequently use words like 'lovely', 'sweet', 'divine', 'nice', 'darling', 'cute', 'adorable', and 'charming', which have become female speech markers. They also tend to use intensifying adverbs such as 'horridly', 'abominably', 'immensely', 'excessively', and 'amazingly'. Men, in contrast, use more straightforward and less polite language, and are more likely to use double negation structures like 'I didn't do nothing'.","context":["Presentation on theme: \"Chapter 8 Language and Society 8.1 The Scope of Sciolinguistics 8.1.1 The relatedness between language and Society.\"— Presentation transcript:\nChapter 8 Language and Society\n8.1 The Scope of Sciolinguistics The relatedness between language and Society\n1) While language is principally used to communicate meaning, it is also used to establish and maintain social relationships.\n2) Users of the same language in a sense all speak differently. The kind of language each of them chooses to use is in part determined by his social background. Language, in its turn, reveals information about its speaker.\n3)To some extent, language, especially the structure of its lexicon, reflects the physical environments of a society.\nWhereas English, for example, has only one word for snow ( or two if we include sleet), Eskimo has several. The reasons for this are obvious. It is essential for Eskimos to be able to distinguish efficientlybetween different types of snow.\nEnglish, of course, is quite able to make the same distinctions: fine snow, dry snow, soft snow, and so on, but in Eskimos this sort of distinction is lexicalized---made by means of individual words.\n4. To some extent, language, especially the structure of its lexicon reflects social environments of a society.\nFor example, a society's kinship system is generally reflected in its kinship vocabulary.\nWe can assume, for example, that the important kin relationships in English- speaking societies are those that are signaled by single vocabulary items.\nAs society is reflected in language in this way, social change can produce a corresponding linguistic change.\nThis has happened in the case of Russian. During the period from 1860 to the present day the structure of the Russian kinship system has undergone a very radical change as a result of several important events:\nFor example:the emancipation of serfs in 1861, the First World War, the revolution, the collectivization of agriculture and the Second world War. There has been a marked social as well as political revolution, and this has been accompanied by a corresponding change in the language.\nIn the middle of the last century, wife's brother was shurin, whereas now now it is simply brat zheny, brother of wife. Similarly, brother's wife, formerly nevestka, is now zhena brata, wife of brother. In other words, distinctions that were formerly lexicalized, because they were important, are now made by means of phrases. The loss of importance of these particular relationships are due to the fact that social changes in Russia have led to the rise of the small, nuclear family.\nIn the last century most Russians lived in large patrilocal extended-family households. brother's wives, at that time part of the family now normally live, in different households. Similarly, the term yatrov, signifying husband's brother's wife has now disappeared entirely.\nAs a social phenomenon, the evaluation of a linguistic form is entirely social.\n8.1.2 Speech community\nA speech community is defined as a group of people who form a community and share the same language or a particular variety of language.\nThe important characteristic of a speech community: A. They speak the same language or dialect.\nB. the members of the group must interact linguistically with other members of the community.\nC. They may share similar attitudes toward linguistic norms.\nSpeech variety Speech variety, also known as language variety, refers to any distinguishable form of speech used by a speaker or group of speakers.\nThe distinctive characteristics of a speech variety are mainly reflected in its pronunciation, syntax and vocabulary.\nSpeech variety is a neutral term, which is often used to replace the such terms as standard language, dialect, pidgin and creole.\nIt can also be used to refer to regional dialects and ethnic dialects such as Australian English and Black English as well as the functional dialects such as legal language.\n8.2 Varieties of language People who claim to be users of the same language do not speak the language in the same manner. For example all the English–speaking people do not speak the same type of English. And the language used by the same individual varies as circumstances vary.\n8.2.1Dialectal varieties Regional dialect Regional dialects are linguistic varieties used by people living in different regions.\nNorth: You need your hair cutting. South: You need your hair cut\nEnglish: Scottish: It needs washing It needs washed\nHe's a man who likes his beer. He's a man that likes his beer. He's a man at likes his beer. He's a man as likes his beer. He's a man what likes his beer. He's a man he likes his beer. He's a man likes his beer.\nRegional dialect boundaries often coincide with geographical barriers such as mountains, rivers, or swamps. This differentiation is accounted for by the lack of communication in the old days when travel was difficult.\nSociolect Just as regional dialect is associated with separation caused by physical conditions, social dialect has to do with separation brought about by different social conditions.\nSocial-class dialect, or sociolect, refers to the linguistic variety characteristic of a particular social class.\nTwo people who speak the same regional dialect may possess some linguistic features which arise because of social factors instead of regional factors.\nIn other words, people who have different social and economic backgrounds, academic experiences, occupations, ages and sexes speak differently. Although living in the same region, people may consciously or unconsciously select linguistic features for communication that are appropriate to their social identities.\nWhen we look at the language used by two speakers A and B, we can estimate roughly their relative social status: Speaker A speaker B I did it yesterday. I done it yesterday. He hasn’t got it. He ain’t got it. It was she that said it It was her what said it.\nIn Britain, one of the most important markers of status is accent. “Received Pronunciation”, a non-localized form of pronunciation, refers to the particular way of pronouncing standard English, which is an indicator of a public school education and thus a high social status on the part of the speaker.\nIn the past the possession of an RP accent was extremely important because it served a s a high-status marker, and also as a qualification for high-prestige employment no matter what other abilities the work might require.\nInvestigations have been carried out by linguists to obtain evidence for the correlation between certain phonetic features and social variables. Percentage of speakers Using [n] for [ ŋ ] Middle middle class 3% Lower middle class 42% Upper working class 87% ]Middle working class 95% Lower working class 100% ŋ\nIt should be clear that social-class dialects are not distinct entities; they merge into each other to form a continuum. It is only the proportions which are different.\nlanguage and sex\nDifferences between women and men have always been a topic of interest to the human species and supposed linguistic differences are often enshrined in proverbs:\nThe North Sea will sooner be found wanting in water than a woman at a loss for a word. ( Jutland ) A woman's tongue wags like a lamb's tail. (England) Foxes are all tail and women are all tongue. ( England-Cheshire)\nWomen in many countries are more status-conscious than men, and therefore more aware of the social significance of linguistic variables.\nIn normal situations, female speakers tend to use more prestigious forms than their male counterparts with the same general social background.\nPeter Trudgill studied the double negation structures. He found that the use of “ I didn ’ t do nothing ” to mean “ I did nothing ” is more common in a male ’ s speech than in a female ’ s speech ， given that their social background is the same.\nIn addition, a woman tends to use polite forms, therefore a woman ’ s use of language is more indirect, while men's use of language is more straightforward and less polite.\nBesides, the gender differences are also reflected in the use of the same lexical items. For example, women tend to use such words as: “ lovely ”, “ sweet ”, “ divine ”, “ nice ”, “ darling ”, “ cute ”, “ adorable ”, “ charming ” which have almost become the markers of a female.\na. Oh dear, you've put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again. b. Shit, you've put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again.\nImagine a man and a woman both looking at the same wall, painted a pinkish shade of purple. The woman may say: Women prefer to use the following colour words while most men do not: mauve, beige, aquamarine, lavender, magenta The wall is mauve.\nIf the man should say the above sentence, one might well conclude he was imitating a woman sarcastically, or was a homosexual, or an interior decorator. The wall is mauve.\nfemales: so good, such fun, exquisite, lovely, divine, precious, adorable, darling, fantastic. neutral: great, terrific, cool, neat Women have their own vocabulary for emphasizing certain effects:\nCompared with men, women tend to use such adverbs. ： horridly, abominably, immensely, excessively, amazingly ， so, most,etc.\nIn Chapter III in Jane Austen’s novel,“Pride and Prejudice”,Mrs Bennet, excited after participating in a party, talked to her husband about Mr.Bingley as follows:\nOh! My dear Mr. Bennet, we have had a most excellent ball. …Jane was so admired. Every body said how well she looked. Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, …I was so vexed to see him stand up with her. … I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! …[Mr. Darcy] is a most disagreeable, horrid man. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with.\nLanguage and age Certain linguistic features occur more frequently in the speech of one generation than that of the other.\nThe most striking difference is found at the lexical level. Lexical variation is more noticeable across three-generation time span than two-generation time span.\nAn elderly man who still talks about the “icebox” or the “wireless” may be confused by the speech of his teenage granddaughter who like to “pig out” whatever she sees in the “fridge” while listening to her “boombox”."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5be0bf4c-3a2a-48c3-b3fb-7bb384d7e92d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main differences between BIM's collaboration features and PLM's collaboration capabilities for team projects?","answer":"BIM's collaboration features focus specifically on construction project coordination, enabling stakeholders to share a multi-discipline 3D model in real-time and supporting design through various phases. It helps improve communication between design engineers, general contractors, subcontractors, and owners. PLM's collaboration capabilities, in contrast, are more structured and process-oriented, offering two main sets of features: the exchange of correspondence with or without artifacts as context, and the ability to subscribe to activity streams related to 3D models, requirements, or projects. PLM also includes workflow support for routing tasks and approvals, plus project management capabilities for defining and tracking task-based plans, while BIM primarily focuses on the collaborative use of the virtual building model.","context":["There is an ongoing discussion in the building industry of what constitutes Building Information Modeling (BIM). The National Building Information Model Standard (NBIMS-US) Project Committee sees Building Information Models as shared knowledge resource for information about a facility, while collaboration of stakeholders is another basic feature.\nThe Handbook of BIM (Eastman, Teicholz, Sacks & Liston 2011) says this:\nWith BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology, one or more accurate virtual models of a building are constructed digitally. They support design through its phases, allowing better analysis and control than manual processes. When completed, these computer-generated models contain precise geometry and data needed to support the construction, fabrication, and procurement activities through which the building is realized.\nIn its most simplistic form, BIM is a 3D model with information associated with the objects contained therein. In its most complex form, it is a multi-discipline 3D model shared in real-time with all project participants.\nIt's important to understand that all models representing a building are not BIM. For example, those models that contain only visual 3D data but no object attributes, or those that allow changes to dimensions in one view but do not automatically reflect those changes in other views, are not BIM. These examples exclude the building data that support construction, fabrication, and procurement.\nDesign BIM/constructable BIM: two sides of the same coin\nArchitects were the first to see the value in creating 3D models to win business. Design engineers use models to flesh out the building in more detail to better communicate with the general contractor and subcontractors. In many cases, the model never progresses beyond its use as a visualization tool, or what is often called \"design\" BIM.\nWhile design BIM serves an important purpose, \"constructable\" BIM has proven highly effective in improving communication and collaboration, and reducing errors, cost, and risk because it allows the building to be constructed virtually and contains all of the project details necessary to build the structure -- right down to the position of each anchor bolt, the length and placement of each piece of rebar, and much more. When used to its fullest potential, every member of the project team will rely on the model throughout the construction process.\nCollaboration and information management\nWorking with others is a pain point in any building project. According to the NBIMS-US Project Committee, \"Buildings cost more than they should to design, build, and sustain, and they take too long to deliver. We must do a better job of collaborating between the many stakeholders involved in the building process.\"\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that the lack of interoperability costs owners an additional $15.8 billion every year (of speculative cash, keep in mind). Owners can definitely benefit from better communication and information management between design engineers, general constructors, sub-contractors, and owners.\nBIM means automating the use of information. From software, BIM asks for accuracy and capability to handle lots of information. The adoption of Open BIM and using BIM to create constructable models make good BIM workflows achievable.\nBIM is mainly about the headless chicken approach to construction. Companies that use constructible BIM have reported benefits for scheduling, estimating, safety, and risk reduction, as well as more collaborative processes during the design and construction of a building and better facility management for owners. Constructable BIM also provides the opportunity to experiment with alternatives since the structure is prototyped virtually and easily modified. Project parties can understand and review the design more easily, which helps ensure its accuracy and completeness.","Definition of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)\nPLM software is used to facilitate and automate the development of products, particularly focusing on hardware aspects, throughout design and manufacturing.\nApplication of PLM Software\nDistributed teams use this type of software to manage and execute complex processes. This includes interdependent tasks, compliance requirements and collaboration needs.\nCapabilities Provided by PLM Software\nThis software provides capabilities that are often closely related to those of PDM software. Beyond those capabilities, other capabilities of this software include:\n- Managing the extended definition of products and processes in development, going above and beyond information extracted and captured by PDM software. This includes:\n- Product traits and characteristics like requirements and their allocations, component suppliers and effectiveness, as well as much more.\n- Process traits and characteristics, such as whether a change process is fast-track or full-track, the decisions made during a design review meeting and the completion of a regulatory submittal process.\n- Execution support for tasks and processes. PLM software enables collaborative development processes through two main sets of task-oriented capabilities:\n- Workflow provides the routing of tasks and approvals and reminders of tasks, as well as notifications during the development process. This includes the ability to embed logic within the workflow to route items through different branches of a process.\n- Project and Program Management capabilities allow users to define task-based plans and track them through to completion. These capabilities also provide oversight into the progress of such plans.\n- Collaboration support during the development process, which is split into two main sets of capabilities:\n- One set of capabilities involves the exchange of correspondence with or without artifacts or information as a context. In the latter scenario, the artifact or information acts as a common single reference point against which the correspondence is exchanged.\n- Another capability allows individuals to subscribe or follow a stream of activity occurring against that context, whether that is a 3D model, a requirement or a project.\n- Report generation for products and processes in development. This is broken into two main categories:\n- Product-based reports reveal the state of the product. Examples include reports that show the amount of constrained materials needed for regulatory compliance, reports displaying systems and components that have been released and reports revealing the fulfillment of requirements.\n- Process-based reports show the progress of development processes. Examples include dispositions of change requests over time, the current condition of a verification and validation process and opportunity vs. cost charts needed for portfolio management processes.\n- Automated creation of documentation for processes. Examples include deliverables required for the completion of regulatory submittals, FDA approvals and ISO compliant processes.\nTechnology Enablers Related to PLM Software\nProduct Data Management (PDM) software is closely related, if not considered a subset, of this software solution. This is often a critical connection, as the fundamental definition of many products is extracted from the MCAD and ECAD artifacts managed in PDM software. Furthermore, Software Configuration Management (SCM) software is also closely related. This is because it often sends a representation of the final compiled code to PLM software to be managed as part of the product’s Bill of Material (BOM).\nApplication Lifecycle Management (ALM) software is considered a peer of PLM software, as it manages the lifecycle of the software artifacts that go into products.\nThis software solution is closely connected with Enterprise Resource and Planning (ERP) software, as it often hands the BOM over to ERP software for production execution after design release.\nProviders that offer this type of solution include:\n- Aras offers Aras Innovator\n- Autodesk offers PLM360\n- Dassault Systèmes offers ENOVIA\n- DEXMA PLM offers a product of the same name\n- Omnify Software offers Empower PLM\n- Oracle offers Agile PLM\n- PTC offers Windchill\n- SAP offers SAP PLM\n- Siemens PLM offers Teamcenter PLM\nProviders that offer solutions focusing on the collaboration and process execution capabilities of PLM include:\n- 3D Systems offers Teamplatform\n- OneDesk offers a service by the same name"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a2cb7a98-ae0a-4fcc-ac79-cb2fb94260fe>","<urn:uuid:9ffcf19f-3a09-4728-b668-766f997ec751>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How are modern aircraft addressing the storage and comfort needs of long-haul passengers?","answer":"Modern aircraft are implementing various solutions to enhance passenger comfort and storage during long flights. In economy class, new designs like the A/B Seat feature elevated storage pockets that create additional legroom and provide multi-pocket solutions for phones, tablets, and personal items. The Airbus A350 XWB offers extra-wide 220-inch cabins with 18-inch seats in economy, roomier overhead storage for two carry-on bags per passenger, and entertainment systems hidden under the floorboard to maximize under-seat space. Additionally, the aircraft incorporates features like wider windows and near-vertical walls to create a sense of spaciousness.","context":["When settling in for a flight, passengers often want to make the space their own and have a place for their personal items. Airlines have accommodated this practice of “micro-nesting” in the design of their premium cabin interiors by ensuring that business class and first class seats have a number of cubbies for storing productivity tools, eyeglasses and bottles of water. But passengers in the economy class cabin have largely been left to their own devices, making use of the magazine pocket which can prove expensive for airlines since overstuffed pockets can become damaged and need replacing.\nA new “A/B Seat” design collaboration between Sekisui SPI, TrendWorks, appLab and Rollon was born out of a discussion at a Red Cabin aircraft interiors conference. During a panel session, Alaska Airlines onboard experience manager Matthew Coder shared details of his dream economy class seat which would address passenger needs during various activities on board. The collaborators put their heads together to imagine a seat that met Coder’s wishlist and added other useful features.\n“The A/B concept seat explores a number of different technologies with both traditional aviation materials and innovations. One of the key enhancements for the economy class passenger is to create a ‘micro-nesting’ solution to organize personal storage in a confined space, much as we would organize the console or drawers in a premium cabin. By moving the storage pocket higher on the seatback, we create additional legroom at the knees and provide a multi-pocket solution for phones, tablets, books, reading glasses, etc closer to the ‘Media Easel’, a convenient shelf and docking solution for the passenger’s electronic devices. This ‘soft storage’ is intuitive and flexible enough for a number of different tools, and creates visual interest when it is used,” TrendWorks trend & CMF specialist Elina Kopola tells RGN.\nShe notes that micro-nesting is also currently a phenomenon in the fashion industry, with TrendWorks seeing “parallels with urban-nomads using bags/carriers with multiple pockets/storage for phone, notebooks, eyewear and water bottle”.\nWhile utility pockets that allow passengers to organize their personal space are an attractive idea, the team had to consider common issues with real-life applications. Producing a seatback assembly with pockets adds considerable costs and creates fresh vulnerabilities for tears which would require replacing the part. They found an elegant solution by designing a single ‘3D knitted’ assembly that has pockets for eyeglasses, pens, and a notepad or smartphone.\n“With our joint background and experience at TrendWorks in textile and ID design we wanted to bring some of the benefits of textiles into the aviation cabin. 3D knitting is a cost-effective way to create a pocket structure in once piece, in other words the complete pocket comes off the knitting machine as one ready piece. This eliminates any need for secondary processes such as sewing and stitching and makes manufacturing faster and more efficient,” explains Kopola. “Knitting also allows for blending of colors to create a soft melange impression which was important for the homey furniture feel we wanted to create.”\nThe team worked with Austrian knitwear company Kobleder to create the aurora borealis-inspired pocket used in the A/B Seat. “Kobleder is a great partner because their innovation mindset…with years of experience in the fashion and furniture industry,” says Kopola.\nThere is definitely demand for economy cabin storage facilities. An entrepreneurial streak in some has led to creative micro-nesting economy cabin solutions finding their way to sites like Etsy, but having passengers “add-on” to the seat structure can sometimes result in trouble with parts becoming damaged or not functioning as intended.\nConsideration was given to passenger personal storage on the new JAL A350 economy class cabin. The main seat pocket assembly features a series of utility pockets made of webbing, giving passengers somewhere to store a water bottle, pen and notepad or personal electronic device. Other innovative solutions include straps on the Safran Z400 seat, which allow passengers to store personal items including eyeglasses.\n- Super Eco Seat brings minimalism to new heights\n- Astronics reveals dock style wireless charging in tray table\n- Flitetec adjustable holder aims to accommodate 90% of tablets on board\n- United’s invisible cocktail table underlines importance of design testing\n- Seatmakers offer new PED holders, but room remains for innovation\n- PED Pouch makers still see big need despite flat tablet growth\n- The personal electronic device holder comes of age in aircraft seats\n- PED stowage solution created for high pocket seats\n- New tray table shelf for gadgets revealed","With only a handful of airline carriers offering direct flights to some of the further destinations across the globe, travelers’ itineraries are filled with long layovers and multiple connecting flights. Trips that should require only 13 hours of travel actually take a whole day because of stops made along the way, either to refuel or switch aircrafts. Frequent flyers might soon see more options for direct flights to faraway destinations like Shanghai or Dubai with the introduction of the Airbus A350 XWB to the aviation industry. The revolutionary design of this new jetliner makes traveling long distances possible without stopping, saving valuable time that could be devoted to exploring and experiencing new cultures in exotic countries.\nOriginally conceived in 2004, the A350 model is currently in production with the leading aircraft manufacturer constructing more than 700 planes ordered by 40 customers around the globe. The engineers behind this incredible aircraft recognize the rising cost of fuel, address existing concerns about the environment, and live up to the high standards of the modern day traveler.\nWhile the economy has witnessed decreases in gas prices, the cost of fuel for an aircraft continues to rise. The Airbus A350 XWB is constructed with carbon fiber material instead of aluminum, making the aircraft much lighter and capable of flying farther distances without the need of more fuel. The signature wing tips cut through the air more efficiently and the mechanical apparatuses that are normally in aircrafts have been replaced with a fully electrical three-axis control system, which enhances flight safety and reduces the pilot’s workload.\nWhen crafting the design of the Airbus A350 XWB, the engineers developed ways to meet environmental standards. The Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, which have the lowest carbon emissions of any wide body power plants, and the Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic fuselage increase the eco-friendliness of this aircraft model. The Automatic Noise Abatement Departure Procedure helps make the aircraft much quieter by optimizing the thrust and flight path to reduce noise in crowded areas. Also, the LED lighting reduces the overall weight and energy consumption of the A350. The incorporation of innovative aerodynamic technology in the A350 model provides for 25-percent lower fuel consumption than its competitors.\nOther features incorporated into the design of the latest Airbus model are intended to deliver a more relaxing and peaceful flight to the modern day traveler. Passengers on-board the A350 will notice the extra wide 220-inch cabins and the roomier overhead storage trunks that account for two pieces of carryon luggage per passenger. The A350 offers two types of cabins, business and economy. Those traveling businesses will feel more at ease in the cozier seats that recline into a fully flat 73.5-inch bed. While the 3-3-3-seat configuration in the economy cabin might seem clustered, the extra wide 18-inch seats give passengers more room to relax.\nAlso, taller customers will not have to cross their fingers or pay extra for the aisle seats to avoid being crushed by entertainment boxes. These systems are now hidden under the floorboard, clearing up the room under the seats. Each seat is equipped with a fourth generation entertainment system, with individual seat monitors, offering in-flight television, movies, and games. The wider windows, near vertical walls, and leveled flooring create a sense of spaciousness in the aircraft. With enough seats for 300 passengers, the Airbus A350 XWB is reshaping the future of travel by offering more options for long distance flights."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac6797c3-d35a-4ea0-bd9a-4025882dc438>","<urn:uuid:8c428f74-7462-4d5f-8ba5-02d3d783f69e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my community organization's next meeting, could you explain how infrastructure failures impact vulnerable communities, and what measures are being taken to address these challenges?","answer":"Infrastructure failures disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, with disruptions costing households and firms in low- and middle-income countries at least $390 billion annually. For example, in Kampala, one in three residents cannot reach hospitals during moderate floods due to road disruptions, and in DR Congo, water disruptions led to a 155% increase in suspected cholera cases. To address these challenges, cities are implementing inclusive civic engagement processes specifically designed to reach historically underrepresented communities, including people of color and low-income residents. This includes providing transportation and childcare for meetings, offering translation services, and conducting community dialogues in accessible locations. These efforts aim to ensure that infrastructure planning reflects diverse community needs and promotes equitable access to resilient services while minimizing disruption impacts on vulnerable populations.","context":["Historically, people of color and indigenous communities (POCI), renters, and people from low-income backgrounds have been underrepresented in civic processes. This can be attributed to many factors including lack of free time and commitments to work, education, and family. One of the main causes for lower representation of POCI in these processes is the structure in which traditional civic engagement has been conducted, and the disenfranchisement of communities that continue to create obstacles and barriers for people to engage. Throughout the Minneapolis 2040 process civic engagement has been designed and conducted in a way to create equitable and innovative ways to engage populations that have been historically underrepresented in civic life. Such efforts includes dedicating time to building new relationships in order to create a more inclusive and equitable planning process to join communities that have already been at the table.\nMinneapolis 2040 is the city’s twenty-year Comprehensive Plan update. The Comprehensive Plan is an important citywide policy document that provides direction for Minneapolis’ built, economic, and natural environment into the future. The City of Minneapolis is required by state law to update the Comprehensive Plan every ten years according to regional planning requirements administered by the Metropolitan Council.\nOn April 1, 2016, the City Council directed the Department of Community Planning and Economic Development (CPED) to update the policies of the City’s Comprehensive Plan in service to the values of growth and vitality, equity and racial justice, health and resilience, livability and connectedness, economic competitiveness, and good government with a focus on guiding public and private investment in the built, natural, and economic environment.\nWhat was the timeline of the process?\nThe comprehensive plan process was organized into five phases that are tied to the Topical Research Teams goals and methods of civic engagement, including gathering public and community feedback on various ideas and proposals that come to the surface as the project unfolded. The process started from early 2016 and lasts through 2018. The five phases are:\n- Phase 1 - Launch\n- Phase 2 - Big Questions\n- Phase 3 - Policy Framework (Phase 3A and Phase 3B)\n- Phase 4 - Policy Document\n- Phase 5 - Review\nThe civic engagement process was a dynamic process which required participants, City of Minneapolis staff, and elected officials to learn, interact and engage through various mediums. Beyond the extensive effort, which engaged with the plan’s identified key audiences in meaningful dialogue on the direction of the city, City staff also gathered input from the Steering Committee, the City Planning Commission, relevant Boards and Commissions, the City Council, and the Mayor.\nWhat is civic engagement and why is it important?\nCivic engagement is a means for all people to bring their voices into the process and to share their own ideas, backgrounds, and experiences to plan for a future that benefits everyone. The people of Minneapolis assisted in the creation of Minneapolis 2040, and the final plan reflects that participation. As part of this process, the Civic Engagement Plan was created to recognize the complexity of engaging the Minneapolis community in a transparent and effective way to develop Minneapolis 2040. It contains goals that guided engagement, identified creative methods for engaging key audiences, established a timeline and phases for activation, and presented an outline of how the City has incorporated feedback from the public and key audiences into the City’s formal decision-making structure for when the Mayor and City Council are asked to approve the plan.\nWhat are the engagement goals?\nCivic engagement for Minneapolis 2040 featured opportunities for participants to learn and be informed, interact in the process, and provide meaningful feedback through large convenings, in-person interactions, technology, and creative tools. Each engagement method was evaluated based on engagement goals that were formulated from the Core Principles of Community Engagement, which were adopted by City Council in 2007. The City aimed to achieve these outcomes and objectives through the civic engagement process through:\nMeaningful and Relevant Dialogue: The community feels that the dialogue has been meaningful and relevant to their interests and daily lives.\n- Focus all materials, activities, and tools on specific topics.\n- Use key audiences’ time efficiently and effectively.\n- Connect topics to the work of the internal Topical Research Teams process of developing and updating City policies.\n- Clearly define the expectations, goals and outcomes of every activity, especially in terms of how they relate to key audiences.\n- Tell the story of how creating a vision of Minneapolis for the year 2040 connects to various key audiences.\n- Follow-up by connecting people to resources.\nInclusive Representation: The perspectives and participation of a broad range of community members are equitably represented in the plan.\n- Create a variety of options for key audiences to engage in the process.\n- Share information through ethnic and community media venues.\n- Market events, materials, and tools to different age groups.\n- Meet people where they already gather and attend existing meetings.\n- Facilitate discussions and develop materials with cultural sensitivity and eliminating biases in mind.\n- Provide clear and comprehensive summaries of public input and share them through engagement activities, materials, and other tools.\n- Create opportunities for different key audiences to understand each other’s various perspectives.\n- Share case studies of different demographic groups in the city.\nAccess to Information and Opportunities: The public has the information they need to participate in ways that are appropriate to their experiences and lifestyles.\n- Provide translation of activities and materials in appropriate languages and for people who are visually and hearing impaired.\n- Provide childcare and transportation when feasible.\n- Ensure meetings, events, and tools are ADA and transit accessible.\n- Test methods and tools to confirm they are understandable and accessible to people from a range of cultural backgrounds and with a range of abilities.\n- Be concise and use plain language at events and in materials and tools.\n- Make engagement more accessible through visual examples (diagrams, charts, photographs) and develop tools that are accessible to people with a variety of learning styles and on a variety of levels.\n- Incorporate the City’s standard language block into all public documents and information.\nContributions Have Impact: The public feels their input has been thoughtfully considered and sees their contributions reflected in the plan.\n- Have face-to-face interactions.\n- Report back on what we heard.\n- Report back on how public input has influenced decisions that shape policies.\nEmpowering Experience: Community leadership and capacity has been built through the process.\n- Build relationships with and between various communities through follow-up interactions.\n- Engage diverse key audiences in speaking at and facilitating meetings and activities.\n- Encourage key audiences to tell the visioning process and Comprehensive Plan story.\n- Engage key audiences in reporting back to their communities.\nEffectively-Used Resources: Government resources are used wisely and effectively.\n- Use objectives, methods, and tools that make the most effective use of government resources.\n- Develop methods than can be used in future planning processes beyond Minneapolis 2040.\nWho has been engaged?\nThe civic engagement process was structured to be as inclusive as possible as City staff worked together with community members to shape the future. City staff identified key audiences that best meet the engagement goals and objectives of the Civic Engagement Plan. These were intended to be broad audience groups that would help focus engagement efforts, but would be as far-reaching as possible. However, the list is not exhaustive, and may not represent all interested people. These key audiences include, but are not limited to:\nThe general public\nYouth and families\nDevelopers and brokers\nSocial media users\nSmall business owners\nTourists and visitors\nEvaluating Approaches to Engagement - Informing, Interacting, and Feedback\nOne of the objectives throughout the engagement process was to have a variety of opportunities for engagement for all types of participants. This included opportunities to learn, interact with City staff and other participants, and provide input on key questions. Engagement methods were utilized based upon their ability to achieve at least one of these types of engagement:\n- Informing: Staff updates the community on the planning process and creates access to resources. Key audiences are informed on various topics early in the process to empower participants for more meaningful discussion and feedback for further engagement as policy topics are prioritized.\n- Interacting: Engagement that facilitates an exchange of ideas between the City and the community. Engagement methods that are designed as a forum for participants to interact with each other and allows for learning from different experiences and perspectives. These types of interactions are prioritized as it allows the opportunity for dialogue and relationship building.\n- Feedback: Community members share their thoughts and ideas with the City. Comments are collected through various engagement opportunities through written or drawn feedback at open houses, street festivals, and online interactions. All collected feedback are used as comments and are transcribed or documented.\nHow did engagement occur?\nDuring each comprehensive planning phase the community had the opportunity to be involved in engaging with City staff, and each other, during a period of focused activities and other related opportunities. Each round of engagement included:\n- Community Workshops – Community meetings and workshops were held during each phase of engagement, and were designed to be as inclusive as possible. This was done by hosting them in accessible locations next to public transit, offering food and refreshments, and having fun and family friendly activities with artist-designed engagement. This included activities and information that was accessible to different types of participants who wanted to engage for a couple minutes or dive deeper into a discussion. Interpreters were on hand at every meeting for limited-English speakers.\n- Community Dialogues - Community Dialogues are facilitated conversations, supported by the Department of Neighborhood and Community Relations, between City departments and cultural communities as well as other under-represented groups. The dialogues take City staff outside of City buildings to meet various community leaders in places where communities are already meeting to talk about issues relevant to their daily lives. Staff returned to the communities in subsequent phases to report back on how their feedback were used in decisions-making, and brought City leaders to discuss relevant topical issues.\n- Street Festivals – During the summer and fall months, vibrant festivals draw cultural communities, residents, business owners, visitors, and youth to destinations around the city. City staff engaged with community members at various events such as Open Streets Minneapolis, Juneteenth, Somali Independence Day Festival, and May Day where attendees visited various exhibits, and watched performances and small presentations in parks and on streets. Creative tools were activated such as Imagining Equity, the Minneapolis 2040 mobile engagement tool. Other activities include visually interactive boards which engaged participants, and responses were recorded on cards and documented through photos.\n- Artist-designed Engagement – A collaborative process in which City staff worked together with artists to design creative engagement methods. Artists focused on designing tools that helped reached out to diverse populations, and helped build capacity through art in order to make planning fun and accessible. Examples of artist-designed engagement activities included: artist-designed open houses, Imagining Equity - mobile engagement tool, performances, and infographics.\n- Online Engagement – During each engagement phase a collection of online engagement opportunities were made available which coincide with each major community workshop. Materials at in-person workshops were made available online such as exercises, maps, and surveys. This included online engagement activities such as the Planning for Equity, Housing for All, \"What can we Do?\", and the Make a Map tool.\n- Meeting-in-a-Box – Meeting-in-a-Box is a civic engagement tool designed for use by community groups, neighborhood associations, or friends to gather at a convenient time and location to share their ideas. It contains a packet of materials, which were made accessible online, with directions to host the meeting and how to submit input to City staff. During subsequent phases of the process Meeting-in-a-Box was updated to reflect new questions and content that was engaged on during that period.\n- Tweet with a Planner – A planner was made available during the lunch hour to interact with the public on certain topics during each phase of engagement. During each of the events, a series of engagement questions were posed by planning staff that led to a live conversation on Twitter through a series of Tweets. Participants were able to provide feedback on certain topics, and have a dialogue with community members.\nCity staff collected demographic information in-large convening events, on the website, and in Meeting-in-a-Box from willing-respondents who wished to provide that information to help staff provide feedback on the process to make sure the process was as inclusive as possible. Other activity tailored to each phase of the process includes graphics and interactive mapping exercises used to support the engagement process.\nThe comprehensive planning process was guided by three formal bodies: the Steering Committee, Topical Research Teams, and CPED Long Range Planning.\nThe Steering Committee is comprised of eight individuals who are either elected officials or department leadership whose committees, boards/commissions, and departments are strongly correlated with long range comprehensive planning and visioning. The committee guided the planning process, reviewed draft material, and provided input into the engagement process. Steering Committee members included:\n- CPED Executive Director (co-chair)\n- City Coordinator (co-chair)\n- Chair of the Zoning & Planning Committee of the City Council\n- Chair of the Transportation & Public Works Committee of the City Council\n- Director of Equity and Inclusion\n- Director of Public Works\n- Commissioner of Health\nThe Topical Research Teams included over 150 staff from around the Enterprise as well as interjurisdictional partners. These staff teams are organized around 15 different topics related to the built, natural, and economic environment of the city. They were responsible for providing technical expertise and experiences on applicable subject matter and policy development.\nCPED Long Range Planning served as the Project Management Team for the update to the comprehensive plan. Their responsibilities included coordination with the Steering Committee, and providing technical assistance and guidance to the Topical Research Teams. In addition, the Project Management Team is responsible for the plan production, preparation of draft content for review, the facilitation of civic engagement, and incorporation of public comment.\nHow has engagement feedback been used and documented?\nDocumentation of each step of the engagement process was critical in defining the direction and priorities for Minneapolis 2040 as well as better understanding which stakeholder groups are being reached. For each event and activity, staff documented the following information:\n- What was the purpose of the engagement?\n- What questions or issues were identified?\n- What methods were used?\n- Who participated?\n- What feedback was received?\n- How was the feedback collected and analyzed?\n- What decisions did this input influence?\nThe documentation of engagement shaped the content process for each successive phase of engagement. City staff collected demographic information in large convening events and on the website, from willing-respondents who wished to provide that information, in order to help staff make sure the process was as inclusive as possible. Other in-person methods were used to reach key audiences who may not be able to attend a large event, or be inclined to interact with technology. At the end of each phase, an Engagement Summary was published to provide an overview of engagement activities that were made available on the project website.\nWhat did we hear?\nAt the end of each phase a summary of engagement activities and transcriptions of all written feedback was packaged together and published online at the project website. Below are the documents that were made available.\nPhase Engagement Summary\nPhase 2 Civic Engagement Raw Data\nOverview of Phase 2 Engagement Feedback\nPhase 3A Civic Engagement Raw Data\nPhase 3B Civic Engagement Raw Data","A new report finds that the extra cost of building resilience into infrastructure systems is only 3% of overall investment needs, and yet would provide an enormous $4.2 trillion in net benefits over the lifetime of new infrastructure.\nThe World Bank’s Lifelines: The Resilient Infrastructure Opportunity report provides a framework for understanding infrastructure resilience by examining four essential infrastructure systems: power, water and sanitation, transport, and telecommunications.\nIf countries continue to build infrastructure that is not resilient to climate change, the additional cost will be $1 billion over the next decade, the report says. Climate change makes action on resilience even more important as, on average, climate change doubles the net benefits from taking resilience measures. In Bangladesh, for example, $1.6 billion has been avoided in damages to power systems thanks to $560 million in flood protection spending.\nReliable infrastructure such as water and sanitation, energy, transport, and telecommunications are essential for raising people's quality of life. It is therefore critical that infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change. When powerlines fail, water pipes are damaged, and transport links are wiped out, people’s lives can be put in danger.\nAnalysis in the report shows that one in three Kampalans would not reach a hospital in time because of road disruptions during just moderate floods. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, after one day of water disruption, incidence rates of suspected cholera increased by 155%, compared to the incident rate when there was optimal water provision.\nDisruption to infrastructure costs households and firms in low- and middle-income countries at least $390 billion a year, and indirect costs increase the burden too.\nIn Tanzania, for example, the cost to firms from outages and disruptions in power, water, and transport due to rainfall and flood is $250 million per year. Therefore, ensuring that essential infrastructure systems are resilient to the physical risks climate change presents not only avoids costly repairs, but also minimizes the effect and extent of the consequences of natural disasters on people’s livelihoods and well-being.\nThe trick is to spend better—not necessarily to spend more. By investing in regulations and planning in the early stages of project design, and in maintenance, the costs of repairs or reconstruction after a disaster strikes can be significantly reduced.\nUnwarranted expenses can be minimized by planning based on providing services rather than assets and helping these service users to manage disruptions. Good infrastructure management is key—a one-off resilience intervention will not suffice. Instead, a range of coordinated actions will be required, collaborating across sectors and governance. As such, the report outlines five recommendations on how to unlock the $4.2 trillion opportunity.\nThe trick is to spend better—not necessarily to spend more. By investing in regulations and planning in the early stages of project design, and in maintenance, the costs of repairs or reconstruction after a disaster strikes can be significantly reduced .\nGet the basics right: Poor management and governance largely explain why infrastructure systems underperform. While more money may be spent on infrastructure systems, improvement will be hampered by (i) a lack of enforcement of regulations, construction codes, and procurement rules; (ii) not having a system for appropriate infrastructure operation, maintenance, and post incident response; and (iii) not providing appropriate funding and financing for infrastructure planning, construction, and maintenance.\nBuild institutions for resilience: Governments need to play a coordination role and provide a certain way forward in order to overcome political economy challenges. They should prioritize actions that will (i) implement a whole-of-government approach, facilitating information exchange, and build on existing regulatory systems; (ii) identify critical infrastructure and define intolerable and acceptable risk levels; and (iii) ensure equitable access to resilient infrastructure, by using approaches that also assess well-being loss and socioeconomic resilience for both poor and rich households.\nInclude resilience in regulations and incentives: Too often, decision-makers only consider lower repair costs when deciding on investments in resilience, and rarely take into account other impact costs. Governments can help by including resilience in regulations and financial incentives to align parties’ interests. This includes (i) considering resilience objectives in master plans, standards, and regulations, and adjusting them regularly to account for climate change; (ii) creating financial incentives for service providers to promote resilience infrastructure services; and (iii) ensuring that infrastructure regulations are consistent with risk-informed land use plans and guide development toward safe areas.\nImprove decision-making: Even with financial incentives and regulations, infrastructure providers will not be able to do much without access to data and tools, and the skills to put them to use. Governments therefore need to help stakeholders by (i) investing in freely accessible natural hazard and climate change data; (ii) making robust decisions via stress-testing that will work across a range of uncertain futures, minimizing potential for regret and catastrophic failures; and (iii) developing the skills needed to use data and models to mobilize the practical know-how of the private sector.\nProvide appropriate financing: Affordability and financing constraint will also inhibit action on making infrastructure more resilient. Making resilient changes may well result in decreased repair costs, but may also incur greater design, construction, and maintenance costs. Therefore, there needs to be (i) provision of adequate funding to include risk assessments in master plans and early project design; (ii) a government-wide financial protection strategy and contingency plan in order to raise funds in the aftermath of a disaster; and (iii) a promotion of transparency to better inform investors and decision-makers of the physical risks associated with investments and assets.\nCentral to all five of these recommendations is the emphasis on implementing resilience thinking in the early design and planning stages of infrastructure services. These early stages are where a little investment in resilience thinking can go a long way and significantly improve the overall resilience of infrastructure systems, securing people’s well-being and livelihoods.\nDownload a copy of the Lifelines report here.\n Jeandron, A., J.

{"question":"How do water clocks and hourglasses compare in terms of their reliability at sea?","answer":"Water clocks (clepsydras) were less reliable at sea compared to hourglasses. Water clocks were difficult to maintain a constant flow and were prone to condensation due to temperature changes. In contrast, hourglasses became popular on ships because they were the most reliable measurement of time during sailing, as the motion of the ship did not affect their operation. The granular materials inside hourglasses also ensured more precise measurements than the water in clepsydras.","context":["We live in a universe of clocks. What is a pocket watch but a mechanism that goes through change at a steady, predictable rate? Other aspects of the universe change as well. Some change at a steady, fixed pace (such as the movement of the planets), while others follow less predictable patterns (such as weather conditions). Even your body is a sort of clock, constantly changing and progressing in a cellular countdown to zero.\nWelcome to the world of horology, the science of measuring time. From the outset, a horologist's goal is to find something that changes at a steady, predicable rate and use it as the measuring stick for all other changes. Ignoring your various clocks and electronic gadgets, what do you have in your life that is this predictable? Obviously, you could turn to the solar and lunar cycles, which have aided horologists since prehistoric times. But what good is a sundial without a sunny day?\nThink about the plumbing in your home. Has a dripping faucet ever kept you awake at night? Do you know exactly when the toilet tank will finish refilling or how long it takes to fill up the bathtub? There you have it: another very predictable rate of change in the world around you. But could you divide your day into narrow increments based on the drip rate of water?\nThe technology may not sound as dependable as your cell phone alarm clock, but humans have turned to water-powered clocks for more than three and a half millennia. In this article, we'll discuss how some of these clocks functioned, as well as how water powers a few modern timekeeping gadgets.\nWater-powered Clocks Through the Ages\nHumans noticed the predictability of moving water long before recorded history. The oldest water clock we know of dates back to 1500 B.C., when it was interred in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I. The Greeks began using them around 325 B.C. and dubbed them clepsydras or \"water thieves.\"\nThese early water clocks fell into two categories: outflow and inflow. In an outflow water clock, the inside of a container is marked with lines of measurement. Water leaks out of the container at a steady pace and observers tell time by measuring how much the water level has changed. For instance, if it takes one hour for the water level in the container to drop down one inch, then a three-inch drop in water level means that three hours have passed.\nAn inflow water clock follows the same basic principle, only the measurements are inside a second container, into which the first one drips. Either way, the measurement vessel is often bowel-shaped to ensure that it fills up gradually.\nIn some parts of the world, this technology survived unchanged up into the 20th century. In other areas, however, inquisitive minds elevated water clock technology to near Rube Goldberg proportions. You see, although a simple water clock operates with a certain degree of predictability, it's very difficult to maintain a constant, persistent flow.\nTherefore, Greek and Roman engineers began regulating pressure in their water clocks between 100 B.C. and A.D. 500. While they were at it, they threw in bells, pointers and even mechanical displays involving moving doors and animated statues.\nMeanwhile, Chinese engineers furthered their own water clock designs. By A.D. 1088, they were erecting elaborate water clock towers, some as tall as 30 feet (9 meters). Similar clocks were soon counting the hours in the Middle East.\nWater clocks provided a reasonably reliable alternative to the sundial for ages. Yet the more engineers strove to perfect them, the more complicated water clocks became. The situation was hardly sustainable. For instance, when the century-old water clock in the Moroccan city of Fez stopped working in the mid 1400s, there was no one around to fix it. It remains inoperative to this day.\nThe Modern Water-powered Clock\nYou can still find quite a number of operating water clocks in the 21st century world. However, sine we've happened upon a number of reliable timekeeping technologies that don't require trips to the well and 30-foot (9-meter) towers, most of these water clocks exist as either museum pieces or works of kinetic art.\nFor instance, the whimsical Hornsby Water Clock gushes with the linear progression of time in New South Wales, Australia. The fountain is actually the third largest clock in the world and combines three different ancient water clock designs. Meanwhile, the work of modern horologicartist Bernard Gitton is on display in the Indianapolis Children's Museum. Gitton's 26.5-foot (8-meter) \"Time Flow Clock\" uses 70 gallons (265 liters) of water, methyl alcohol and food coloring to provide visitors with the time of day.\nWe live in an age of widespread electricity. Ironically, hydroelectric power accounts for 19 percent of the world's energy production [source: U.S. Geographical Survey]. Due to this, you could argue that many modern clocks are essentially water-powered. If you went so far as to count the use of steam in conventional and nuclear power plants, then that percentage reaches much higher.\nAnother from of water-powered clock bears mentioning, despite the fact that it doesn't depend on the movement of water at all. All you need in order to power the Eco-Friendly Water-Powered Clock (pictured above) is a little water -- and a splash of natural lemon juice.\nThis clock runs off a simple galvanic cell battery, which entails the emersion of a cathode or positive metal (such as copper) and an anode or negative metal (such as zinc) in an electrolyte solution. The lemon-laced water serves as the electrolyte solution, which allows the transfer of electrons between the two metals, resulting in an electric cell. If you've ever used a potato to power a digital clock as a school project, then you've witnessed the same process at work. These water-powered clocks tend to sell for less than $20, not counting any lemon juice runs you'll have to make.\nReady to make the switch to liquid-based timekeeping?

Hourglass consists of two glass bulbs which are connected vertically by their narrow endings, forming a special neck. Neck is the part which ensures regulated trickle of sand from the upper bulb to the lower one. Factors which are affecting the time interval are the amount of sand, the coarseness of sand, the size of bulbs and the width of neck. When the upper bulb is empty, hourglass may be inverted, and the countdown resumes from the beginning.\nThe origins of hourglass is unclear. It is believed that hourglass is a successor of clepsydra or, in other words, water clock, which may have been invented in ancient Egypt, therefore, hourglass may have been invented there as well. The American Institute of New York considers, that hourglass was invented in Alexandria about 150 BC. The Journal of British Archaeological Association believes, that hourglass was used before the time of St. Jerome about 335 AD. The first representation of hourglass was found in a sarcophagus which is dated c. 350 AD and which represents the wedding of Peleus and Thelis. This sarcophagus was discovered in Rome in the 18th century and was studied in the 19th century.\nInteresting, but there is no records about hourglass in Europe before the Early Middle Ages. It was not mentioned anywhere until the 14th century, but then Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted a fresco “Allegory of Good and Bad Government” in the year of 1338, which is believed to be the earliest evidence of hourglass in Europe.\nAfter 14th century there were a lot of records about usage of marine sandglass. The majority of these records were from logbooks of European ships, but it appears in other records and lists of ships stores as well. Marine sandglasses were popular on board ships, because they were the most reliable measurement of time during sailing in the sea. Unlike the clepsydra, the motion of ship during sailing did not affected the hourglass. Also granular materials inside of hourglass ensured more precise measurements, unlike clepsydra which was prone to get condensation inside of it because of temperature changes.\nHourglasses were popular on land as well, because they were inexpensive and thus available to majority of people. Hourglasses were commonly used in such places as church, home and work place to measure sermons, cooking time and time of breaks. As they were commonly used for more practical tasks, the size of hourglass began to shrink. Smaller hourglasses were more practical and more discreet.\nAfter 1500, when the mechanical clock was developed, hourglasses became less popular, because mechanical clocks were more precise, practical and cheaper. Of course, hourglasses did not disappear entirely because of their unique design. The glass bulbs of hourglass have changed in design and style over time. The bulbs were not always connected – the first hourglass had two separate bulbs which connection was wrapped with a cord to hold them together. Only in the year of 1760 both bulbs were blown together. The majority of hourglasses contains sand, but a lot of them contains granular mixtures of other materials. Earlier hourglasses contained powdered marble, tin oxides or even pulverized eggshells, but nowadays hourglasses contain synthetic materials."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:58017424-64e5-4343-9a03-af1f9419718d>","<urn:uuid:57aafed2-b0ce-4fe5-9118-599a20a33a88>"],"error":null}

Both are calculated from simple 2x2 tables. The question of which statistic to use is subtle but very important. Probability is the likelihood of an event in relation to all possible events. Relative risk is a ratio of probabilities. It compares the incidence or risk of an event among those with a specific exposure with those who were not exposed eg, myocardial infarctions in those who smoke cigarettes compared with those who do not Figure.\nThis paper argues that the use of the odds ratio parameter in epidemiology needs to be considered with a view to the specific study design and the types of exposure and disease data at hand. Frequently, the odds ratio measure is being used instead of the risk ratio or the incidence-proportion ratio in cohort studies or as an estimate for the incidence-density ratio in case-referent studies. Therefore, the analyses of epidemiologic data have produced biased estimates and the presentation of results has been misleading. However, the odds ratio can be relinquished as an effect measure for these study designs; and, the application of the case-base sampling approach permits the incidence ratio and difference measures to be estimated without any untenable assumptions. For the Poisson regression, the odds ratio is not a parameter of interest; only the risk or rate ratio and difference are relevant. For the conditional logistic regression in matched case-referent studies, the odds ratio remains useful, but only when it is interpreted as an estimate of the incidence-density ratio.\nShow more about author. The odds ratio OR is one of several statistics that have become increasingly important in clinical research and decision-making. It is particularly useful because as an effect-size statistic, it gives clear and direct information to clinicians about which treatment approach has the best odds of benefiting the patient. Typically the data consist of counts for each of a set of conditions and outcomes and are set in table format. In addition to assisting health care providers to make treatment decisions, the information provided by the odds ratio is simple enough that patients can also understand the results and can participate in treatment decisions based on their odds of treatment success. DOI:\nWhat are relative risk, number needed to treat and odds ratio? Risk difference RD is the difference in risk of the outcome event between control and experimental group. Control group is not exposed to the intervention, whereas experimental group is the one that is exposed to intervention. The risk of outcome event in the control group is also called baseline risk. The NNT is the inverse of the risk difference and indicates the number of patients required to be treated to avoid one additional outcome event. Risk difference and NNT are absolute measures of effect.\nWell, both measure association between a binary outcome variable and a continuous or binary predictor variable. And unfortunately, the names are sometimes used interchangeably. The relative risk is also called the risk ratio. Suppose you have a school that wants to test out a new tutoring program.

As projects are completed, knowledge is accumulated and re-usability increases. In turn, the value of knowledge and its transfer also increasingly becomes the main focus of companies.\nThis paper, analyzes the challenges of managing and transferring knowledge and introduces some relevant key concepts such as data, information, and knowledge. The knowledge transfer life cycle, which is already mentioned in PMI's Pulse of the Profession®: Capturing the Value of Project Management Through Knowledge Transfer will be visited, and based on this cycle the method used in PPMO (project portfolio management office) at SDT (Space and Defense Tech.) will be explained in the Knowledge Transfer Framework in SDT topic with the following three headings: Developing a knowledge-sharing platform, creating knowledge sharing culture, and evaluating knowledge transfer success.\nPPMO of SDT has been assigned a new role: knowledge broker. The function and responsibility of this new role, as well as the results and impacts of applying it to projects will be presented.\nKeywords: knowledge, PMO, broker, culture, people\nKnowledge is becoming an even more powerful element to create unique products and services than ever. Meanwhile, transferring this knowledge within the organization from one project to another, from retiring staff to younger staff, and from outside of the organization to inside of the organization also gets more challenging.\nThe journey starting with data, then becoming information, and ending with knowledge is costly for any organization. The culture and the people are the two main factors affecting the effectiveness of this journey. The first part of the paper will be explaining these concepts and factors.\nThe main challenges to manage the knowledge will be explained in the second part of the paper from the perspective of complexity, uncertainty, and culture.\nThe knowledge transfer life cycle will be visited and Space and Defense Tech.'s (SDT's) approach for each step will be presented. As this approach reveals a framework, the role of “knowledge broker” is to be introduced. The conclusion of the paper analyses the gain and impact of this approach.\nDEFINING CONCEPTS AND FACTORS\nData is the structural value of the organization. As data is collected and analyzed, information is created so that decisions can be made. Organizations may have systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) to collect data and may have tools to analyze this data. On the other hand, the challenging part begins with communicating this information at the right time, to the right people, in the right way, and with the right content. That's why project managers spend most of their time by communicating. Effective communication positively affects the success of the project however it's not as effective for the new-starting projects. This is because the information is generally specific to the project itself unless very similar parts are planned to be used again in the coming project. What affects the success of the new-coming project is the experience, wisdom, and insight gained from the previous projects. This is simply called knowledge.\nKnowledge can be explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge is easier to get transferred whereas tacit knowledge is encoded knowledge which needs to be interpreted and is difficult to transfer. Many researchers admitted that tacit knowledge is crucial for building sustainable development (Cavusgil, Calanlone, & Zhao, 2003). Hence this paper especially will focus on the transfer of tacit knowledge, which is learned through collaborative and/or individual experience, and interpretations of events.\nOrganizational culture and environment, and people are two key factors affecting the success of knowledge transfer. Informal communication level, lack of trust, and turnover rate may shape the culture, resulting in effective or ineffective knowledge transfer. Expectations, happiness, and feeling valuable may determine the people's perspective to knowledge transfer.\nProjects increasingly become global in terms of using resources, having customers and suppliers. A greater variety of disciplines is getting involved in the projects and uncertainty level is not decreasing. Hence, increasing complexity and uncertainty are the first two challenges for the knowledge to capture and transfer.\nIdentifying and capturing knowledge for an employee during operational work or executing a project is not at first priority for this employee most of the time. Achieving his task is more important. Hence organizational culture is another challenge to motivate these employees to get involved in knowledge transfer cycles.\nKNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FRAMEWORK IN SDT\nPMI's Pulse of the Profession®: Capturing the Value of Project Management Through Knowledge Transfer defines the steps of the knowledge transfer life cycle as Identifying, Capturing, Sharing, Applying, and Assessing. PPMO is assigned for the knowledge transfer in SDT by the executive management, and PPMO has used these steps to develop its own knowledge transfer structure as summarized in Exhibit 1.\nExhibit 1: The Knowledge Transfer Structure of SDT.\nPPMO first established a categorization of knowledge before the Identifying step as follows: Knowledge created outside the company, knowledge accumulated in the reusability database, knowledge not known formally but informally within the company. This categorization helps determine the essential knowledge to transfer and an assessment phase specific to each project is defined before a project is initiated in order to elaborate this categorization.\nPPMO identifies knowledge brokers (KBs), who are responsible to specify critical knowledge to be transferred. The main characteristics of knowledge brokers can be stated as follows:\n- KB is not a role in the hierarchy of the organization\n- KBs can be project managers, systems engineers, or any other key team members.\n- PPMO is responsible to identify and lead KBs\n- KBs are expected to smooth out the barriers to access knowledge\n- KBs are expected to utilize the knowledge-sharing platform effectively\n- KBs are expected to help creating knowledge-sharing culture\nPPMO guides knowledge brokers on how to identify and capture the knowledge at different phases of the project. This guidance is also defined in the project governance management plan of each project.\nPPMO has established a knowledge-sharing platform called a knowledge bank and knowledge brokers are key members of this platform and all the employees have access to this platform. The structure of this platform is designed so that there is an active link between ongoing projects and this platform. For example, a lessons-learned knowledge of a project is designed such that lessons learned are accumulated throughout the project life cycle and each lessons learned is linked to an action item, which is also put in the knowledge bank. The aim of generating an action item is to analyze the effects of that lessons-learned to the organization and other projects and put this knowledge to the knowledge bank.\nKnowledge brokers are the key persons to make sharing a habit within the organization. People need a trustworthy environment as well as expect to have a benefit so that they share knowledge. PPMO is expected to suggest ways to create such a knowledge sharing culture.\nTo be able to measure knowledge transfer success is also crucial for a sustainable knowledge sharing culture. PPMO defines metrics and makes analysis according to the collected data and presents benefits. Examples for metrics are as follows: reusability level, project success rates, interaction rate between the knowledge bank and the people, number of knowledge brokers, and so forth.\nGaining knowledge, identifying specific knowledge, capturing it, sharing and assessing the value of this captured knowledge…each step is very challenging and each step is related with people and culture which makes this challenge even more difficult to achieve. On the other hand if an organization succeeds in transferring the right valuable knowledge then it will gain an incredible competitive advantage. SDT is aware of this benefit and the structure it has established already started to show the gains.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMustafa Hafizoglu, PMP, has 17 years of experience in hardware and software development projects, especially on aerospace and defense industry.

{"question":"How do vortex shedding dynamics compare to induced drag in terms of energy loss?","answer":"In Von Karman vortex street phenomenon, vortices shed from lines absorb about 80% of energy given up to drag, with shedding frequencies near 30 KHz at racing speed. In contrast, induced drag is specifically related to the production of lift in wings, representing a different type of energy loss. This drag occurs alongside parasitic drag, which is produced from air resistance moving across the wing surface. The latter can be reduced through features like winglets at the wing tips.","context":["Analysis and Prospects\nLine drag at the Reynolds numbers that models experience is primarily due to the alternating vorticies shed from the lines. This phenomenon is called the Von Karman vortex street and the vorticies absorb about 80% of the energy given up to drag. The frequency of vortex shedding for an F2C is near 30 KHz at the time at racing speed and lower as it gets closer to the handle. When the engine stops one can sometimes hear the lines `sing', the same phenomenon that gives rise to the tones emitted by an Æolean harp.\nIn systems in which one line trails the other - even out to 8 diameters - there is a very large reduction in drag. When in tandem both the leading wire and the trailing wire have reduced drag, but the drag of the trailing wire is something like 1/3 that of the leading wire. In these cases the drag of two wires is less that the drag of one wire alone.\nThis is the idea behind having the leadouts as close together as possible. However, the configuration of one line trailing the other is not stable. The lines between the handle and the entry to the aircraft wing have significant curvature. For F2C the maximum departure of the lines from a straight line is about 15cm (6 in.), and this figure is directly proportional to the ratio of line drag to line tension. If the rear line has half the drag of the front line it will not have as much curvature. Being more nearly straight it will be in front. The differences in curvature will produce line separations that are on the order of 100 diameters, far too much for any drag reduction.\nThe amount of drag reduction can result in a drag difference of 3:1 from leading to trailing wire. Hard to predict and eliminated with only a millimeter or two vertical movement of the lines.\nAsymmetrical wings are, however, a way to produce significant reduction, and the thicker the lines the easier it is. For two 0.35 mm diameter lines a 12% thick wing section that around 7 mm thick has no more drag than the wires. Removing 1 cm from the outer wing and putting it on the inner wing places it in an area of slightly lower dynamic pressure and covers lines `for free'. Making a thinner section and extending it as far inboard as possible is still better.\nFlutter is always a potential problem, the solution being to keep the center of mass well ahead of the structural center of torsion. This is why the Boeing jet transports pioneered the now standard jet engines slung on extended pylons. A mass balance at the tip - a wire attached to the wing and extending forward with a weight can be used as well as an additional tail or structural modifications to place the center of torsion further forward.\nRule lawyers may have an opinion on how extreme asymmetry might be treated, but at present it seems the only way forward to me.\nThe wing section need not have a sharp trailing edge, a small, squared off trailing edge - perhaps as much as 2% of the chord in thickness may give a little benefit at low Reynolds numbers and small tubulators aft of the 50% chord line may also make small improvements. The nose of the airfoil should be rather sharply curved. The NACA four digit series (e.g. NACA \"0012\") are VERY old designs, the thickness profiles dating to 1930 or so, and have too large a nose radius.","Bernoullian lift and Newtonian lift\nBernoullian lift: Air \"splits\" at the front of a wing, and recombines\nat the rear of it. Because the air recombines, if the top of a wing is longer\nthan the bottom, air travels faster over the top of a wing than over the bottom\n(this is referred to as the \"principle of equal transit\ntimes\"). According to the Bernoulli effect, the quicker the air is\nmoving, the lower the pressure. This means that there is lower pressure\non the top than the bottom. This causes air on the bottom to try to move\nupward, pushing the wing upward with it.\nTrue airflow over a wing given\ndiffering angles of attack\nImage courtesy of See How It Flys\nNewtonian lift: The angle of attack pushes the air\ndownward. This causes the air to leave the wing with more downward velocity than it started with. Since there needs to be an upward movement to counteract this downward\nmovement, the wing creates lift (Newton's 3rd law).\nIf we consolidate these two theories, the resulting idea would look something like\nthis: Air moves faster over the top of the wing than over the bottom. This\ncauses a near 'vacuum' over the top of the wing. Air from the bottom of the wing\ntries to go upward pushing the wing upward. This so far is standard Bernoullian\nlift. However, air on the top of the Bernoullian vacuum is also moving downward into\nthe vacuum. An effect known as the\nCoanda Effect assists\nthis. The Coanda Effect is a property of the viscosity of fluids in which a fluid\ntends to \"stick\" to an object.\nAt the rear of the wing, due to the\nCoanda Effect, the air attempts to follow the curvature of the wing downward, resulting in\na net downward momentum change in the air. Also, at the front of the wing, the air\nis forced to separate and the air below the wing transfers its upward momentum to the\nwing. The unbalanced momentum is transferred into the wing creating lift.\nTake a moment and investigate your instincts about good wing design with this wind tunnel animation from NASA.\nWing Span - the distance from one tip of the wing to the other tip on the other side.\nChord - the distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing\nCamber - the ratio of curvature to cord length\nMean Camber Line - an imaginary line that runs half way between the top and bottom surfaces of the airfoil\nAngle of attack - an imaginary line that runs through the fuselage and parallel to the chord\nRudder - controls the yaw\nYaw - the horizontal movement, \"the left and right direction\" of an airplane\nElevator - controls the pitch at the tail\nPitch - the vertical movement, \"the rise and fall\" of an airplane.\nAileron - controls the surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing\nRoll - to turn horizontally, to twist\nWinglets - a piece that can be flipped up at the end of each wing to help reduce drag\nInduced drag - the drag due to the production of Lift\nParasitic drag - the drag that is produced from the resistance of the air that moves across the wing\nCantilever - a wing design that is used on small aircraft, wing that is top mounted and is supported by struts\nSee How It Flys\nUniversity of Washington\nAll Star Helicopters\nEast Kentucky University"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:04d4a03d-6a7b-43c6-bfb6-5febc7a12d04>","<urn:uuid:ebbf4e76-a5fd-4a48-8196-ca80aa9d5fa3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the natural flood management approaches differ between the Eddleston Water project and Hudson River communities in terms of specific interventions and planning strategies?","answer":"The Eddleston Water project implements direct physical NFM measures including planting 330,000 native trees, installing 116 log structures in upland streams, building 29 flood storage ponds, and re-meandering 2.9km of river channels. In contrast, the Hudson River communities focus more on planning and assessment approaches, such as developing shoreline flooding plans, conducting green infrastructure feasibility studies, creating watershed management plans, and performing stream restoration planning. The Hudson River projects emphasize community collaboration and policy development, while the Eddleston Water project demonstrates more extensive physical implementation of nature-based solutions.","context":["Research findings just revealed by one of the EU North Sea Region Building with Nature partners in Scotland are revealing the true value of taking a sustainable approach to reducing flood risk - through the careful and targeted use of Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures, building with nature at a landscape scale across the whole Eddleston Water river catchment.\nThe Eddleston Water Project is Scottish Government’s long-term study on the effectiveness of utilising NFM to reduce the risk of flooding and to improve river habitats. It must be stressed that NFM measures are not used instead of existing means to protect properties and livelihoods, such as flood walls and Flood Warning systems, but work alongside these structural methods to provide a whole catchment approach to reducing flood risk to downstream communities and enhancing the local environment for wildlife.\nAs part of recent work in the Eddleston Water catchment, the project managers Tweed Forum commissioned consultants JBA and Mott MacDonald to explore the costs and benefits of using a range of NFM measures to reduce flood risk, and also to explore how this might be integrated in to standard methods used for assessing the value of different Options for reducing Flood risk at a scheme level. Of particular interest was how not only the value of flood damages avoided by the use of NFM measures might be costed, but also how the other added benefits delivered by some of the different NFM techniques (such as creating ponds, planting riparian woodlands, remeandering rivers, etc.) might also be valued.\nAs part of the project, a large number of methods for estimating the economic value of these benefits were critically reviewed and their advantages and challenges discussed with key stakeholders. The favoured method, B£ST was then tested on the Eddleston Water to trial its suitability. As a tool for comparing different flood risk options, It was found to be intuitive to use and the tool was able to reliably quantify all significant multiple benefits in the form of ‘ecosystem services’ delivered by the various NFM measures across the 69 km2 Eddleston Water catchment. To date, the project has planted over 330,000 native trees, installed 116 log structures in upland streams, built 29 flood storage ponds and re-meandered 2.9km of previously straightened and embanked river channels. Evaluation of their impact on flood flows showed that the value of flood damages avoided in downstream communities from these existing NFM measures is estimated as c.£950,000 (Net Present Value, using a 100-year appraisal period). In addition to flood risk reduction, this new work was able to show that these same NFM measures provide benefits across a wide range of other ‘ecosystem services’ including: Amenity, Biodiversity and ecology, Carbon sequestration, Education, Flows in watercourse, Water quality and pollution mitigation. These additional benefits provided by the NFM measures were estimated to be approximately £4.2m on top of the £950k already seen for flood risk reduction. Extending this to a hypothetical scenario with greater use of NFM measures across the catchment showed further gains could be possible; with flood damages avoided estimated at £2.85m and the benefit from other services estimated at £17.7m.\nSummarising the results so far, Project manager for this work Chris Spray said ‘I guess the take home messages are probably threefold:;\n- Building with Nature through the use of NFM measures across the landscape such as the ones we have already put in does make a difference in terms of their ability to reduce the risk of flooding downstream, and we can put a value on that – i.e. say how much this is worth in terms of net value for damages avoided;\n- At the same time though, these NFM measures provide us with many other benefits (biodiversity, carbon, recreation, water quality, etc) – and we can now put a value on these as well; and\n- We need to recognise these additional values provided by Building with Nature and somehow include them in the process of assessing which of a number of options we might wish to accept for flood risk reduction using (both NFM and Structural methods) – and that one way of integrating this in to standard procedures for flood risk appraisal would be to use the B£ST methodology.","The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) recently announced approximately $770,000 in grant funding which was awarded for communities in the Hudson River Estuary.\nThe funding will go towards the design and planning of 18 projects that will increase resiliency to flooding, protect water-quality and conserve natural resources.\nThe following municipalities and organizations received grants:\nHudson River Shoreline Flooding Plans:\nCity of Kingston, $49,684 to convene a Sea Level Rise Implementation Learning Group to collaborate on implementing key actions of the Flooding Task Forces in the village of Piermont, village of Catskill, city of Kingston and the town of Stony Point.\nVillage of Catskill, $25,500 for a Hudson River Shoreline Flooding Plan including an analysis of potential changes to the village’s local zoning code to address resiliency issues.\nThe Nature Conservancy, $50,000 to continue a project to assist local communities to participate in the Hudson River Comprehensive Restoration Plan (HRCRP) process in the Hudson River Restoration Study Area from the Troy dam to the Piermont Marsh.\nFlood Adaption Planning for Water and Waste Water Infrastructure:\nVillage of Catskill, $42,500 to complete a Risk and Engineering Review of the village of Catskill Wastewater System, and to implement recommendations from “Resilient Catskill Report of the Catskill Waterfront Resilience Task Force.”\nGreen Infrastructure Planning:\nAlbany Water Board (City of Albany Department of Water and Sewer), $50,000 for an Albany Pool Communities Feasibility Assessment for a Green Infrastructure Banking System.

{"question":"As a marine biologist comparing habitats - are both Irvineia voltae and Sargocentron found in tropical waters?","answer":"Irvineia voltae and Sargocentron have different habitat preferences. Irvineia voltae is found in tropical freshwater environments, specifically in the lower Volta River basin between 6°N – 5°N.

The posterior chamber is, as usual, divided into two by a membranous longitudinal septum which ends just in front of the narrow communication with the posterior caecum. Other internal ridges are confined to a few low folds of the ventral wall of the posterior chamber. The posterior caecum opens by a narrow neck out of the hind end of the main bladder and extends to the end of the abdomen, where it is more or less constricted, and then expands again to the caudal part, which extends to the end of the of the abdomen, where it is more or less constricted, and then expands again to the caudal part, which extends to the end of the anal fin, always on the right side of the basalia of the anal fin, between the bones and the thin muscle-layer. In the specimens at hand the bladder is in various states of distension, and there is probably free passage of air throughout its length. The caudal part is irregularly constricted, and the walls of the whole caecum are strengthened by internal ridges.\nThe caecal bladder is equally extensive in all the specimens. This is in contrast to Pangasius, in which the caecum does not extend into the caudal region until the fish is a little larger than the smallest Irvineia examined, and then reaches only a quarter of the way along the anal fin (Nair, 1937).","Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) > Beryciformes\n(Sawbellies) > Holocentridae\n(Squirrelfishes, soldierfishes) > Holocentrinae\nEtymology: Sargocentron: Greek, sargos = sargus + Greek, kentron = sting (Ref. 45335).\nEnvironment / Climate / Range\nMarine; reef-associated; depth range 1 - 84 m (Ref. 27370).

{"question":"What role does practical experience play in technical education programs, both in academic settings and professional certification courses?","answer":"In academic settings like MIT's Making Books course, practical experience involves hands-on work in the Hobby Shop building a printing press, combined with traditional academic elements like discussions and examining rare books. Students spend significant time (approximately 15 hours per week) divided between classroom learning and hands-on work. In professional certification courses, as shown in the confined space training program, practical experience includes hands-on demonstrations, equipment use training, and simulated exercises. Both programs emphasize the importance of direct experience - MIT students learn woodshop skills while building a press, while safety trainees practice using breathing apparatus and safety equipment in real-world scenarios.","context":["Instructor Insights pages are part of the OCW Educator initiative, which seeks to enhance the value of OCW for educators.\nThis page focuses on the course 21H.343J / CC.120J Making Books: The Renaissance and Today as it was taught by Professors Anne McCants and Jeffrey S. Ravel in Spring 2016.\nPart of the Concourse program at MIT, this course explored the impact of new technology on the recording and distribution of words and images at three different times: the invention of the printing press ca. 1450; the adaptation of electricity to communication technology in the 19th century (telegraph, telephone, photograph); and the emergence of digital media today.\nAssignments included essays and online projects.

{"question":"What are the characteristics of the mean in statistical analysis, and how does it relate to the prediction of individual scores?","answer":"The mean serves as both a measure of central tendency and a predictive tool in statistical analysis. As a measure of central tendency, it represents the point around which most scores are located in a symmetrical distribution. The mean is particularly valuable as it is the best predictor of an individual score in a sample of scores. When using the mean for prediction, deviation scores (X - X bar) indicate the difference between the predicted mean and the actual individual scores. Moreover, when working with populations, the mean of a random sample is considered the best estimate of the population mean. However, it's important to note that in skewed distributions, the mean becomes the mathematical center but may not accurately represent where most scores tend to be located.","context":["The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is commonly called the average of the numbers. Its method of calculation is well known. A synonym for 'average' is 'typical' which may be a helpful word to use given the computational baggage that is associated with average. Average also becomes a troublesome word when it brings to mind 'mediocre' as a synonym.\nThe median is another 'typical' value which may be used to represent a larger set of numbers. A simple definition of median is that it is the middle value in a set of numbers which have been ordered by magnitude. This definition causes a problem when there is no middle value because there are an even number of values, or when there are several numbers having the same value around the point where the middle should occur. A more general definition of median is that it is the 50th percentile of the frequency distribution formed by counting the number of times each value occurs.\nWhen the distribution of numbers is symmetrical, such as that of the so-called bell curve, the mean and median are equal. When the distribution is not symmetrical, debate arises concerning which is the more typical number. An example often used concerns average income where the arithmetic mean may be quite different than the income of the typical wage earner because of the skewed distribution of values. In this case, and often in the case of course/instructor rating scales, the median more closely approximates the income of the typical worker or the rating given by the typical student.\nCalculation of the median using the idea of a grouped frequency distribution allows one to recognize that, for example, a 5-point rating scale constrains responses to a small set of discrete values when the underlying attribute being measured is really a continuous scale. Evidence of this is observed in the collection of students' ratings of instruction when we observe that some students mark 2 consecutive values in an attempt to communicate that they're not sure if they want to award, for example, a 4 or a 5. We have also observed on a number of occasions that a respondent will make a mark, for example, between the 4 and the 5. Neither of these types of responses provide valid data but they do illustrate the presence of a continuous scale underlying the small set of discrete values. Calculation of the median in such situations proceeds as follows.\nIf the distribution of responses given by a class of 25 students is\n- 1 Strongly Disagree,\n- 1 Disagree,\n- 4 Neutral,\n- 8 Agree, and\n- 11 Strongly Agree\nand the values 1 through 5 are assigned as ratings corresponding to Strongly Disagree through Strongly Agree, the mean is 4.08. The median is computed as the value attributed to the 50th percentile point in the distribution of ratings given by the 25 respondents. Six responses are Neutral or lower while 14 indicate Agree or lower.

{"question":"How did Napoleon and Gustavus Adolphus differ in their approach to battlefield awareness and tactical innovation?","answer":"Napoleon and Gustavus Adolphus had different approaches to battlefield awareness and innovation. Napoleon possessed an extraordinary natural ability to assess enemy forces and movements, being able to quickly calculate the numerical strength of armies of 60,000-80,000 men and predict concentration times just by looking through his telescope. In contrast, Gustavus Adolphus innovated through systematic reforms, introducing concepts like combined arms tactics, cross-training of troops, and mobile artillery. He reorganized his army to maximize the use of gunpowder weapons, reduced the manual of arms movements from 160 to 95, and created more maneuverable formations that could quickly adapt to battlefield changes.","context":["“In a very different subject-matter, Napoleon supplies us with an instance of a parallel genius in reasoning, by which he was enabled to look at things in his own province, and to interpret them truly, apparently without any ratiocinative media. ‘By long experience’, says Alison, ‘joined to great natural quickness and precision of eye, he had acquired the power of judging, with extraordinary accuracy, both of the amount of the enemiy’s force opposed to him in the field, and of the probable result of the movements, even the most complicated, going forward in the opposite armies… He looked around him for a little while with his telescope, and immediately formed a clear conception of the position, forces and intention of the whole hostile array. In this way he could, with surprising accuracy, calculate in a few minutes, according to what he could see of their formation and the extent of the ground which they occupied, the numerical force of armies of 60,000 to 80,000 men; and if their troops were at all scattered, he knew at once how long it would require for them to concentrate, and how many hours must elapse before they could make their attack.’” (Newman, J.H., An Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent, (2013 ) Assumption Press, p 219).\nI have to confess, that that was a somewhat unexpected paragraph in Newman’s book for me, at least. In the passage in question and its surroundings, Newman is pondering the nature of genius. He observes before it that, for example, Newton had a tendency to simply write down answers to mathematical physical problems without working them out or proving them. It then took several generations for the rest of the academic community to catch up and prove that he was, in fact, right. I believe that someone once claimed (with what accuracy I am unsure) that for every time that the mathematician Carl Freidrich Gauss wrote ‘it is obvious that’ or ‘clearly it follows that’ or similar phrases, someone has obtained a PhD for showing it to be so.\nNewman continues after the passage just quoted: “It is difficult to avoid calling such clear presentiments by the name of instinct; and I think they may so be called, if by instinct be understood, not a natural sense, one and the same in all, and incapable of cultivation, but a perception of facts without assignable media of perceiving.”\nThe problem is this: as ordinary human beings, we have little idea of how geniuses proceed, and, in general, cannot cope when they do. If Napoleon was a genius at warfare, it is little surprise that his opponents, no matter how competent, struggled to cope with his manoeuvers. Even Wellington was humbugged by the Corsican, even though the latter was not at his best during the Hundred Days. The fact that the Allies won and Napoleon lost was due more, perhaps, to Wellington’s planning and positioning of his forces during Waterloo, and the Prussian ability to support him than any military genius on their side.\nAll through history we can see military geniuses, alongside those in other fields, turning received wisdom upside down and winning battles, or solving problems, in ways that were thought impossible. On the military side was can name, for example, Marlbrough, Alexander, perhaps Caesar, Hannibal, Scipio and so on. Some others might be in the running as well, such as Gustavus Adolphus or Maurice of Nassau, but in general I am sure you can see my point. The geniuses were not coped with by the normal military institutions of the day. Until those institutions adapted to cope, victory went to the genius.\nThis then is a problem for wargaming. Unfortunately, few of us are geniuses; perhaps fortunately, most of us will never need to get involved in major warfare for real. But the problem is how we, as wargamers and wargame rule writers, can cope with these geniuses who upturn the conventional wisdom of warfare. For a set of wargame rules, almost by definition, must represent the normal, conventional warfare of the time.\nThere is an additional problem, of course, in that we have a splendid dose of hindsight to add to the mix. When Napoleon is facing the Allied army at Waterloo, we might want to explain to him the fact that most of the enemy army is over the ridge and a grand battery, no matter how grand, just is not going to cut the mustard. We also might like to point out that the army closing in on his right is not reinforcements but an army he thought were thoroughly beaten. Thus there is here a question of epistemology (to give it an overpoweringly posh name). Napoleon may not have known these things; somehow he had lost control of the campaign.\nThe issue is, in terms of wargame rules, firstly, that of course Napoleon, if he had been aware of these facts, might have taken different action, although the politics might have made this difficult. These are issues beyond a simple set of rules to deal with. But the real problem is, if I may call it such, the ontological one of genius. The being of a military genius on the battlefield cannot, I think, be handled as it is mostly by a ‘+2’ on the command rolls, or some other sort of fudge factor to enable the wargame to come out in a vaguely historical manner. The genius who can just ‘see’ the solution, the Marlbrough who marches half an army across the battlefield to obtain tactical surprise, cannot be subsumed within a simple addition to a command rule or radius. These rules and their fudging simply do not reflect the process of the genius winning the battle.\nI do not think that there is in fact, any legislating for such genius. Firstly, even Napoleon had feet of clay, or at least had to odd off day on the battlefield. If we construct rules for military genius, then we would also have to construct rules for the genius not having had his morning coffee. And that way, I think, wargame rule writer’s madness lies. Secondly, genius is, well, genius. It tends to operate outside the box, which would mean, more or less, it might well operate outside the framework of the rules. And I cannot think of a rule set that can allow that.","|The genius of Sweden’s ‘Lion of the North’\nby Steve Wilson\nIn the skies over a modern battlefield a joint tactical air control team is often credited for carrying their platoon’s “big gun,” or radio, as devastating airstrikes are vectored in from aircraft loitering in the battle space where friendly forces are taking fire.\nLaser guided munitions, global positioning systems, joint direct attack munition technology and real-time communications make it possible for military units to shape the battlefield to their advantage.\nHowever, coordinated efforts on an ever changing fluid battle space aren’t new concepts. In fact, credit for this military innovation, and several others, belongs to Gustavus II Adolphus, King of Sweden, whose reign lasted from October 12, 1617 until his death in battle, Nov. 6, 1632.\nThe period of warfare before Adolphus’ time lacked what in today’s terms could be called strategic thinking. Granted, there were great generals and great battles, several of which changed the known world. But, until gunpowder began to see widespread use, armies were marched directly toward an opposing force, drawn in parallel lines and the order of battle tended to consist of: archers, followed by the heavy infantry that hurled javelins as the masses continued to creep toward each other until finally the armies were in sword, hammer or pike range.\nThe only real fluid part of a battle space prior to gunpowder was the cavalry, which were usually concentrated on the flanks and, when possible, charged the enemy’s extreme left or right and hoped to collapse the opposition around itself.\nAs gunpowder began to see common and widespread use on the battlefield, Gustavus Adolphus was the first to shed old tactics and status-quo thinking.\nIn Adolphus’ time, firearms were just beginning to make their way into the hands of both heavy infantry and cavalry.\nAnother relatively new invention, gunpowder propelled artillery, changed the scope of the battlefield by shifting the range at which armies could engage one another as well as a constant need for specialized war material – chiefly powder and shot.\nArmies could no longer move quickly and largely rely on foraging for raw materials to construct siege and artillery equipment.\nBut, until the new-age thinking of Gustavus Adolphus, the technology had changed but tactics and strategy had not.\nWarfare, around the time of the Thirty Years War, was on the cusp of becoming more specialized and calculated, rather than an affair where two huge forces collided and the winner was decided by large amounts of courage and the ability to deal harsher blows about the head and shoulders to the enemy.\nIt was during this period of time in military history that Gustavus Adolphus would shatter the old school system of waging war.\nPrior to Adolphus emerging on the scene as a battlefield innovator, European armies largely conscripted soldiers or employed large numbers of mercenaries just before marching to their objective. After the war, these conscripts and soldiers for hire were quickly mustered out of the army until politics demanded the nation fight another battle.\nGustavus Adolphus threw a wrench in 1600s European thinking by having a regular standing army that was well-trained, regularly drilled, armed with fine weaponry and were paid on time.\nHe also redesigned his army to take advantage of newly acquired mobility that was afforded to him by the emerging innovation of gunpowder and modern firearms. While the European army model largely consisted of forming squares or, even older, lines of phalanxes several soldiers deep of mixed musketeers and pikemen, Adolphus formed whole regiments solely of musketeers.\nHe also adopted a new, lighter musket, thus eliminating the need for the gunner or an assistant to carry a forked pole to rest the firearm on.\nHe made paper cartridges standard in his army.\nHe also drilled his men in the concept of rolling volley fire.\nThis innovation was a regiment of musketeers, usually six lines deep that closed to three before engaging the enemy.\nThe first rank would kneel the second would crouch and the third rank would stand all firing simultaneously.\nThe rate of fire Adolphus was able to maintain on a battlefield surpassed other armies of the time largely because the Swedish king reduced the traditional European manual of arms from 160 movements for firing and reloading to 95.\nAdolphus disregarded the big, cumbersome cannons favored by many leaders of his day and opted for lighter and maneuverable field-pieces that could be quickly moved to give fire where his infantry needed support at a particular time.\nThis is a stark contrast to other European army models of the day, who fought in dense, slow maneuvering masses and tended to try to win a battle by numbers and brute force alone.\nIn this way, he ensured his portion of the battle space was not rendered static and motionless by fixing big artillery pieces in one spot that could not be maneuvered to support the foot soldiers.\nAnother innovation was a concept that today is dubbed “combined arms,” although in the 1620s the term didn’t exist. Gustavus Adolphus disregarded traditional pike squares common in European formations of the time and instead incorporated a thin pike wall in with his musketeer formations.\nThis innovation featured one pike for every few muskets, which was enough to keep enemy cavalry from decimating the infantry but still leaving the Swedish formation plenty of firepower to engage the enemy. Adolphus used this tactic until 1631, when he formed entire regiments comprised of nothing but musketeers.\nThe Swedish king also developed what today we call “cross-training.”\nInfantry and cavalry units alike were trained to fire artillery. His pikemen could pick up a musketeer’s weapon, load and fire it if need be. Artillery and infantry soldiers were all trained to ride, should the battlefield occasion demand it.\nIn doing this, King Gustavus Adolphus ensured sub-unit integrity and unit cohesion throughout his army. The cavalry were not elevated above the infantry; rather, every soldier was cross-trained into other specialties to make for maximum efficiency on a fluid battlefield.\nWhile King Gustavus Adolphus can be given scores of credit for innovation and forward thinking, the real measure of any commander is results in battle. This begs the question, how well did this new mode of combined arms work on early 17th-century battlefields? We will examine his most important battle.\nThe Results of Adolphus’ Innovations: The Battle of Breitenfield\nGustavus Adolphus of Sweden entered the Thirty Years War allied with the Protestant cause. He established lines of communication and supply with his native Sweden and moved across the Baltic Sea and into the heart of Europe in 1630.\nAdolphus, trained in statesmanship all his life before assuming the throne, began to build alliances, recruit more soldiers to the Protestant cause and secure his lines as he moved toward Saxony. He met his chief rival, Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly and commander of the Catholic League’s armies, on September 17, 1631.\nKing Adolphus deployed his force in conjunction with his new and innovative strategy of stressing attack over defense and mobility over static lines.\nHe mixed his force of light and heavy infantry, dispersed with his pikemen throughout the formation to provide defense against enemy cavalry. He also deployed his light, nimble artillery consisting of three-pounder guns with his infantry instead of the old tactic of placing the infantry in front of heavy, difficult to move cannon.\nIn this, he assured the cannon could directly support the infantry and be quickly moved where supporting fire was needed most along an ever changing and fluid front.\nThe Count of Tilly’s forces were deployed in a typical European, and largely static, formations.\nThe troops were packed together in tight squares and were mostly heavy infantry armed with pikes. The Catholic League’s forces did have musketeers, but these were either placed in the corners of the formation squares or largely on one side. Thus, shifting fire from one direction to another involved a slow and cumbersome series of movements.\nThis formation did not, unlike the Swedes, incorporate supporting artillery directly with the infantry.\nBoth armies had cavalry units.\nThe Count of Tilly’s forces were trained to ride toward the enemy, fire cumbersome and short range pistols in a maneuver called the caracole, in which the rider closed to firing range and executed a half turn and fired one pistol, then executed another half turn in the opposite direction and fired his second pistol.\nAfter this volley the rider would canter tow the back of the formation to reload and fire again.\nHowever, this tactic would be hard pressed to work under constant repeating volley fire from Adolphus’ formations.\nThe Swedish cavalry still relied on the age-old tactic of riding at a full gallop and engaging the enemy with the saber; however, Gustavus Adolphus had trained his musketeers to provide fire support to the cavalry prior to a charge when at all possible.\nWhen the two forces met, the Catholic League’s army was deployed into 17 dense square formations with the heavy cannon placed in the front.\nKing Gustavus Adolphus’ forces were deployed in two lines, with the bulk of their cavalry on the right side.\nThe two armies began with an exchange of artillery fire and it was soon obvious the Swedish gunners could achieve a far superior rate of fire with their light, three-pound guns.\nThe Catholic League forces cavalry charged the Swedish lines a total of six times, but each time was stopped by the combination of musket and cannon fire from Adolphus’ forces. Finally, after the seventh and final charge by County Tilly’s cavalry was beaten back yet again by the Swedes, King Gustavus Adolphus released his own cavalry against the enemy.\nThe already weakened Catholic League cavalry units were driven from the field by Adolphus’ cavalry and retreated 15 miles from the battlefield.\nSeeing the Swedish cavalry leave the lines, Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, ordered his remaining cavalry and infantry forward. The Swedish lines on Adolphus’ left flank began to falter under this combined attack without cavalry support.\nSeeing this, King Gustavus Adolphus, thanks to his innovations of mobility, quickly shifted his lines and anchored along a new front to meet the Count of Tilly’s advance.\nThe European square tercio could not quickly shift to face this new front and were heavily fired upon by Adolphus’ light cannons and musketeers.\nThe shift in lines and new front made Adolphus’ far right flank unopposed and he personally reformed them and led them in a charge into the Count of Tilly’s forces and thus captured the enemy artillery.\nTaking advantage of his forces being cross-trained, King Gustavus Adolphus began to use the enemy’s own artillery against him and fired repeatedly into Tserclaes’ exposed flank and rear.\nThis quickly led to the Catholic League’s forces being engaged on multiple fronts in a harrowing crossfire. Not able to withstand overwhelming firepower with no possibility of a counterattack, the Count of Tilly’s forces retreated.\nAs day turned into nightfall, it became clear the Count of Tilly’s force was all but annihilated. Several of the survivors deserted and some 6,000 were captured, many of which joined Gustavus Adolphus’ army.\nThe Battle of Breitenfield was the first and most important of King Gustavus Adolphus’ short career. It annihilated the Catholic League’s main fighting force during the Thirty Years War and necessitated for it to be rebuilt.\nHis tendency to personally lead the charge, which was certainly a factor in his death at the Battle of Lutzen in 1632, is perhaps the only reason he did not emerge on the world’s stage as a significant figure in Europe’s course after the war’s conclusion in 1648.\nHowever, his contributions to modern warfare were such as attack emphasized over defense, sustained rate of fire, combined arms tactics and the value of cross training fighting units have been validated time and again on the globe’s battlefields after the 1600s.\nHis innovations and models have been admired by Napoleon, Carl von Clausewitz, and General George S, Patton.\nSweden has not forgotten her “Lion of the North,” as each Nov. 6 is celebrated as Gustavus Adolphus Day.\nCopyright © 2012 Steven Wilson\nWritten by MSgt Steven Wilson.

{"question":"What are the technical requirements for DNA amplification through PCR, and how does this method integrate with array comparative genomic hybridization techniques?","answer":"PCR amplification requires creating a master mix solution with Green Master Mix containing Taq polymerase, dNTP, MgCl2, and reaction buffers, plus forward and reverse primers. The process involves three main steps: denaturing DNA at high temperature, annealing at lower temperature for primer bonding, and extension at an intermediate temperature for strand completion. This process is repeated about 25 times. For array CGH integration, the amplified DNA must be labeled with Cyanine-3 and Cyanine-5 fluorescent dyes for sample and reference DNA respectively. The samples are then co-hybridized to an array containing bacterial artificial chromosome clones, requiring 25-100 ng of input DNA. The success of amplification must be verified through gel electrophoresis before proceeding with array CGH analysis.","context":["Continuing on with my undergraduate research project on the firefly genus Pyropyga, the next big step was to use of DNA barcode to identify the morphospecies we separated visually.\nThe process of extracting and amplifying DNA is both lengthy and complicated; full of many steps and countless hours. Before I worked on this project I only knew the basic theories and steps behind the process. Anything I might have learned through the many biology classes I have taken over the years. But there is a substantial difference between learning about DNA extraction and amplification and actually doing it. So when I sat down and thought about what I would write for my next blog post, I decided I wanted to explain each step I took in a way that you, the reader, could understand regardless of any background knowledge you may have regarding DNA work. Writing out the procedure also greatly helped me grasp the ins and outs of extracting and amplifying DNA that I had already accomplished.\nThroughout the process I followed the steps for DNA extraction and PCR protocol from a handout provided to me and, in truth, there are many steps I performed without fully grasping what they accomplished. But through the process of writing out and explaining each step I took, I now feel that I have a better knowledge of what I did and why I did it. So without further ado, here is the entire DNA extraction and PCR amplification process in my own words.\nStep 1: Acquiring a sample for DNA extraction\nThe first step in the process is to acquire the sample from which you will be extracting DNA. Our sample was a leg from each specimen. The process of removing a leg (we used the back left leg) from the specimen was a bit difficult on account of just how small members of the genus Pyropyga are. What I did in order to solve this was to use two pairs of very sharp forceps, one to hold the insect, and one to pull the leg off.\nStep 2: Isolating DNA\nThe second step is to isolate the DNA from the leg. To do this the leg is added into a solution of buffer ATL which breaks down and opens the membranes of the cells so that the DNA (in the form of nucleic acids) can be removed and suspended in solution. A small amount of proteinase K is also added to the solution in order to digest and remove proteins that could otherwise contaminate the DNA sample while leaving the DNA intact. This solution is incubated overnight at 56°C to aid in the process. After the specimens are done incubating they are removed from the heat source and placed in a freezer for at least two hours.\nStep 3: Purifying DNA\nThe third step of the process is to eliminate cellular debris and purify the DNA. The vials containing the legs in solution (called a supernatant) are removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw. The previous step should have successfully pulled DNA from the leg and left it suspended within the supernatant, so we can now remove the legs from there and put them back with their respective specimens. The goal now is to use a special vial called a DNAeasy column which contains a membrane that collects the DNA through the next steps. First a solution of Buffer AL (that’s a protein precipitation solution) is added. When the DNeasy column is sent through a centrifuge with the solution in it, the DNA will be attracted to and will stick to the membrane of the column and all other particulates and materials should pass through. This membrane is then washed to further clean and purify the DNA using buffer solutions AW1 and AW2.\n(Tired already?! That’s okay! We didn’t do all these steps in one day.)\nStep 4: Elution of DNA\nOnce the DNA within the membrane has been washed successfully the fourth step of the process begins, the elution of the DNA. “Elution is the process of extracting one material from another by washing with a solvent, in this case extracting the DNA from the membrane” as pulled from dictionary.com. In order to accomplish this, Buffer AE is added to the DNAeasy column before the column is centrifuged. This serves to pull both the elution buffer and the DNA through the matrix membrane allowing the membrane to be discarded and leaving behind a vial full of DNA in solution.\nStep 5: PCR\nFrom there the DNA solution is ready to undergo PCR, short for Polymerase Chain Reaction. This method is used to amplify and duplicate a strand of DNA making it easier to sequence. The first step of the PCR process is to create a master mix solution using a base of Green Master Mix which contains Taq polymerase, dNTP, MgCl2, and reaction buffers already mixed into the optimal proportions for DNA amplification (1). To that base, equal amounts of forward and reverse primers are added. These primers will serve to bind to the DNA strands later in the PCR process. Finally, water is added so that the primers and the water equal the same amount as the Green Master Mix solution and a small amount of DNA is added before the tubes are centrifuged.\nOnce that is finished the vials containing the DNA are put into the PCR machine and set to begin the cycles. PCR itself contains three major steps: 1) denaturing, where the DNA solution is heated up to a very high temperature in order to essentially ‘melt’ the bonds between the double stranded DNA to make it single stranded, 2) annealing, where the DNA solution is heated to a much lower temperature than the denaturing step which allows the forward and reverse primers in the solution to bond to the appropriate ends of the DNA strand, and 3) extension, where the DNA solution is heated to a temperature between the first and second steps to allow the taq polymerase in the solution to extend the DNA strands. These steps are repeated several times (upwards of 25) before the PCR is complete.\nStep 6: Checking the DNA\nBy now the DNA should be sufficiently amplified and ready to send off to be sequenced. But how do we know for sure? PCR can fail for a number of reasons resulting in unsuccessful amplification that cannot be sequenced properly. The determination of the success of the PCR process is done with a different process known as Gel Electrophoresis.\nGel electrophoresis allows us 1) to see if we successfully amplified the DNA through PCR and 2) to ensure that only one product was amplified. The first step of the process is to make the gel in an apparatus that will later allow for an electric current to be sent through the gel. After the gel is made a buffer is added to completely submerge the gel which allows for the electrical charge to flow. Then, each sample of DNA is carefully pipetted into the individual wells in the gel, and anodes and cathodes are attached to the apparatus and turned on before letting the system run. Once the system is done running the gel is removed from the apparatus and placed within a chamber and illuminated with a black light.\nIf the PCR process was a success a bar of light should be visible below the well. If there wasn’t an illuminated bar or if there are more than one bar per column, then the process was unsuccessful or the DNA was contaminated and the PCR must be redone. If everything looked good then the samples are ready to be sent off to have the DNA barcoded!\nThanks to Zach Lahey, PhD candidate in the Johnson Systematics Lab at Ohio State for his guidance in the molecular lab.\nAbout the Author: Martha Drake is fourth-year undergraduate majoring in Entomology and minoring in Environmental Science at Ohio State.

Y., Watson, S. K., Saprunoff, H., Heryet, C., Lam, W. L. Technical Demonstration of Whole Genome Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization. J. Vis. Exp. (18), e870, doi:10.3791/870 (2008).\nArray comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) is a method for detecting gains and losses of DNA segments or gene dosage in the genome 1. Recent advances in this technology have enabled high resolution comparison of whole genomes for the identification of genetic alterations in cancer and other genetic diseases 2. The Sub-Megabase Resolution Tiling-set array (or SMRT) array is comprised of a set of approximately thirty thousand overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that span the human genome in ~100 kilobase pair (kb) segments 2. These BAC targets are individually synthesized and spotted in duplicate on a single glass slide 2-4. Array CGH is based on the principle of competitive hybridization. Sample and reference DNA are differentially labeled with Cyanine-3 and Cyanine-5 fluorescent dyes, and co-hybridized to the array. After an incubation period the unbound samples are washed from the slide and the array is imaged. A freely available custom software package called SeeGH (www.flintbox.ca) is used to process the large volume of data collected - a single experiment generates 53,892 data points. SeeGH visualizes the log2 signal intensity ratio between the 2 samples at each BAC target which is vertically aligned with chromosomal position 5,6. The SMRT array can detect alterations as small as 50 kb in size 7. The SMRT array can detect a variety of DNA rearrangement events including DNA gains, losses, amplifications and homozygous deletions. A unique advantage of the SMRT array is that one can use DNA isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples. When combined with the low input requirements of unamplified DNA (25-100ng) this allows profiling of precious samples such as those produced by microdissection 7,8. This is attributed to the large size of each BAC hybridization target that allows the binding of sufficient labeled samples to produce signals for detection. Another advantage of this platform is the tolerance of tissue heterogeneity, decreasing the need for tedious tissue microdissection 8. This video protocol is a step-by-step tutorial from labeling the input DNA through to signal acquisition for the whole genome tiling path SMRT array.\nNote: limit exposure of Cye Dyes to light at all times (this can be achieved by working in a darkened area or by shielding the tubes with a cover such as aluminum foil)\n(Setup 1 reaction tube for reference and 1 reaction tube for sample)\n- DNA (25-400 ng)\n- 5 µL of 5X random primers buffer (Final concentration: 5X Promega Klenow buffer and 7 µg/ µL random octamers)\n- Dilute to 17.0 µL total volume with distilled H2O\n- Boil for 10 minutes at 100°C. Transfer immediately to ice for 1 minute.\n- Add 4 µL of 10X dNTP mix (2mM dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 1.2mM dCTP).\n- Add CyeDyes:\n- Add 2 µL (2 nmoles) of Cy-3 labeled dCTP to Sample DNA\n- Add 2 µL (2 nmoles) of Cy-5 labeled dCTP to Reference DNA (e.g., Novagen human genomic DNA)\n- Add 2.5 µL of Klenow (9 U/µL, Promega ) and mix.\n- Incubate at 37°C overnight* (~18 hours).\n*The overnight hybridization time can be adjusted between 14 to 24 hours without adversely affecting the labelling process to fit to a laboratory schedule.\nSAMPLE CLEAN UP\n(Combined probe clean-up and preparation for hybridization)\n- Using a Microcon YM-30 column:\n- Add 100 µL Cot-1 DNA (1µg/µL) to column. Do not touch membrane with pipette tip.\n- Pool the reactions (reference and sample) and add to column.\n- Place column in provided tube and spin at 13000 g for 10 minutes.\n- Add 200 µL distilled H20 to membrane and repeat spin to wash.\n- Discard tube and add 45 µL hybridization solution: (Roche DIG Easy)\n- Invert Microcon, place in a new labeled tube, and spin at 3000 g for 3 minutes.\nCALCULATION OF INCORPORATIONS\n- Remove 1.5 µL and measure Fluorophore incorporation using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer. Using your hybridization buffer as a blank (DIG Easy) follow the directions on the screen. (You can recover the sample from the pedestal, if necessary, after measurement.)\n(Note: Incorporations below 3.0 pmol/µL in either channel have shown variable results.)\n- Denature at 85°C for 10 minutes.\n- Place probe at 45°C for 30 minutes to 1 hour (allows Cot-1 DNA annealing.)\n- Place 44 µL probe solution onto the coverslip (22 mm x 60 mm) (Fisher Scientific). If available, place the coverslip on a slide warmer or heat block pre-warmed to 45°C to maintain temperature.\n- Align slide over coverslip and probe solution, lower one edge of the slide allowing contact with the hybridization solution. Continue to lower until the coverslip is attached to the slide with surface tension. Invert slide.\n- Place the slide into hybridization cassette (Telechem), pre-warmed to 45°C, and add 10 µL of water in the lower groove (to control humidity during hybridization).\n- Seal cassette and incubate for 36 - 40 hours at 45°C.\nRemoval of the slide from the hybridization cassette is critical. DIG Easy quickly crystallizes at room temperature. The slide should be immediately immersed and the cover slip removed in the wash solution.\n- Add approximately 60 mL of 0.1XSSC, 0.1%SDS (pH 7.0, 45°C) wash solution to a Coplin jar prior to opening the hybridization chamber.\n- Open chamber, add slide to wash solution and remove coverslip (it should slide off).\n- Wash the slide 3 times in 0.1XSSC + 0.1%SDS at 45°C for 1 minute each with agitation.\n- Rinse the slide 3 times in fresh 0.1XSSC*. There should be no residual bubbles from the SDS wash visible.\n*The slides can remain in the final wash solution until ready to centrifuge and scan (~15 minutes).\n- Centrifuge the slide in a 50 mL Falcon tubes at 700 g for 3 minutes.\n- Immediately scan the slides (signal intensities will diminish over time.)\nPoor quality DNA will not provide a good hybridization profile. It is essential to ensure that sample and reference DNA are free from contaminants such as phenol, RNA, salt, etc that may interfere with the random prime labeling step before starting a hybridization experiment. For example the resuspension of DNA in Tris - EDTA (TE) instead of water is not recommended as high salt concentration can inhibit the labeling reaction. We recommend assaying DNA quality using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer to measure both the DNA quantity as well as overall shape of absorbance curve and the 260/280, 260/230 ratio.\nWashing: Removing the slide from the hybridization cassette and transferring to the heated wash solution is a critical step in the hybridization process as the DIG Easy hybridization solution crystallizes very quickly. It is important that the wash solutions be at a neutral pH and the temperature of the wash solution is important for stringency while removing the unbound probe. After drying slides it is important to keep them in the dark if not scanning right away, or after scanning if you wish to rescan them at a later time.\nOzone: Ozone has been a worldwide concern when performing array CGH. Ozone levels above 5ppm have been shown to adversely affect the Cye dyes. Cye 5 is particularly sensitive to ozone degradation. Minimizing ozone exposure is key to preventing Cye dye degradation and loss of signal before and during scanning. Scanning at night for example, when environmental ozone is typically lower, is one possible option. Ozone free enclosures for automated slide washing and scanning and various chemical slide treatments are commercially available. Ozone resistant Cye dyes have also recently been developed.\nWe wish to thank members of the Wan Lam Lab BAC Array team especially Miwa Suzuki and Bryan Chi for the preparation of this article.

{"question":"How is the Bible portrayed in modern media productions, and what are the historical perspectives of different religious groups on biblical interpretation?","answer":"In modern media, the Bible is portrayed through dramatic adaptations with creative liberties, as seen in History Channel's $22 million miniseries 'The Bible,' which features elements like martial arts angels and dramatic effects for scenes like Moses parting the Red Sea. The series aims to make biblical stories accessible to a new generation while maintaining historical drama. Regarding historical interpretations, various religious groups have different approaches to biblical texts. For instance, many Black Hebrew Israelite groups affirm the King James Version (1611) as their only rule of faith, while some accept only the Torah or include additional texts like the Apocrypha and Book of Enoch. Some groups reject Paul's writings due to their historical use during American slavery, highlighting how different communities have distinct approaches to biblical interpretation based on their historical experiences.","context":["POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Mar 03, 2013\nFor as long as there has been filmed entertainment, there have been producers and directors retelling the dramatic stories from the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments. But the cable channel History's coming 10-hour miniseries, \"The Bible,\" might be the first to include an angel skilled in Chinese martial arts.\nThat angel, fighting an angry mob during the destruction of the city of Sodom — and an effort by the producers to make the program racially inclusive — pops up in the first episode of the five-week series, a $22 million project to bring the Bible to life for a new generation. It begins today and ends on Easter.\n\"The Bible\" premieres at 6 p.m. today on the History Channel.\nThe producers know their angels (there are five throughout the program, along with a black-hooded satanic specter who often hovers in the background). The miniseries, to be rerun Mondays on Lifetime, has as executive producers the husband-and-wife team of Roma Downey, a star of the 1994-2003 CBS series \"Touched by an Angel,\" and Mark Burnett, in his first foray outside of the reality genre he helped popularize with CBS' \"Survivor.\"\nThe program came about after Burnett's company was pitched a Bible documentary that he found sensationalized and Downey countered that they should make what she, in a joint interview in Manhattan, called \"the grand sweeping embrace, the love story that is the Bible.\" Referring to Burnett's expertise at marshaling massive productions in remote lands and her own experience with actors, she said, \"We could handle the scale and the intimacy.\"\nSeveral networks made offers, Burnett said. \"It was clearly a very big idea,\" said Nancy Dubuc, president for entertainment and media at A&E Networks, parent of History and Lifetime. Of Burnett — whose credits include \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Voice\" — Dubuc added, \"We take very seriously when a producer or a storyteller of his magnitude is incredibly passionate about something. They tend to give it their all.\"\nWhat the producers delivered was historical drama with an emotional focus and digital effects that dramatize stories of Moses' parting of the Red Sea, Daniel in the lion's den and Jesus walking on water. Shooting last year over six months in Morocco, the producers put a particular emphasis on details, down to the dust. \"Something we knew we did not want to do is make a donkey-and-sandal movie for your grandmother,\" Downey said. The international cast includes Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado as Jesus, Francis Magee (\"King of Thrones\") as Saul and Downey as Mary.\nThe program abounds with bloody swordfights, beheadings and lashings. \"It is a violent story,\" Dubuc said, referring to the Bible. \"When you have to illustrate it, that's pretty gnarly stuff.\" Ten ways to open the series were considered before the production team settled on a scene inside Noah's storm-tossed ark, as he tells the Genesis creation story to his scared children. The ark scene is not found in the Bible, but the writers contend it could have happened, given oral histories of the time. That dramatic license infuses the 10 hours. The 23rd Psalm is worked into the script when David recites it as he and his slingshot take down Goliath. (Many historians credit the psalm to him but debate when he wrote it.) Pontius Pilate's wife appears in several scenes even though the figure has just one sentence in the New Testament.\nMore dramatic poetic license has been a staple of Bible movies from the beginning, starting with Cecil B. DeMille's silent \"King of Kings,\" which rendered Mary Magdalene as a wealthy courtesan, J. Stephen Lang, author of the 2007 book \"The Bible on the Big Screen,\" said in a telephone interview. Conversely, Lang said, important Bible figures like Paul have been relatively overlooked because \"there is no romance there.\"\nThe producers' initial challenge was finding a narrative and choosing from dozens of Bible stories. They settled on fewer stories, Burnett said, to go \"longer and deeper\" into others; Joseph and his colorful coat — which Lang said is the fourth most popular subject of Bible movies, behind Jesus, David and John the Baptist — got left on the cutting room floor, to their regret. What unites the stories, Downey said, is a repetition of human failings and \"people striving to get back to a connection to God.\"\n<t$>The network and the producers disagree on the program's religious underpinnings. \"I don't see this as a Christian production,\" Dubuc said. \"We are a global brand, and we appeal to all walks of life and beliefs.\" Among the notes the <t-3>network gave during production, she said, was that \"this is not a piece of conversion.\"\nDubuc said, \"This is an epic drama that's endeavoring to tell the literal — as literal as we could be given our production constraints — translation of this book that has shaped the world and the people who live in it.\"\nDowney said she believes people of all faiths will enjoy the program. But, Burnett said, \"the meta-narrative of the Bible, the through-line, is the Messiah does come.\" To exclude the New Testament, he added, \"is cheating the Bible.\"\nAdvisers including Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Los Angeles; and Bishop T.D. Jakes of the Potter's House, a megachurch in Dallas, are helping publicize the broadcast. Curriculum tools for churches, many of which are organizing viewing parties, are part of an extensive website from Christian marketing firm Outreach. In a video on the site, Burnett cites the series' potential \"to reach not only those who already go to church, but to reach a whole new generation of people, people who have never been to church.\"\nA shortened theatrical movie, focused on Jesus' baptism through Revelation, will be released for arenas and theaters; there is a CD of the score by the Oscar-winning film composer Hans Zimmer (\"Gladiator\").\nIn addition to a book of 100 inspirations, there are Spanish- and English-language companion books for adults and young adults.\nDowney said the producers hope to drive viewers back to the original source, the Bible. The books, however, are not Bibles, but a novelization of the stories in the script.","By: D.A Horton (Article Originally Posted on dahorton.com on Sept. 26, 2015)\nHeads up: since there is no “one set of beliefs” that all Black Hebrews, Black Hebrew Israelites, and Hebrew Israelites fall under, this blog will highlight a few of the movements that are often identified as having similar beliefs. This section will be longer than others as I’ve attempted to consolidate several different movements under the term Black Hebrew Israelite while giving each respected entity recognition for it unique nuance and history.\nThe Founders: Most groups that identify themselves with being Black Hebrew Israelites residing in America trace their inception back to the Pre-Civil War era of American History. One of the first preachers known to harmonize the American slaves with the biblical account of the Israelites was Martin Prosser, a slave preacher in Richmond, VA. In 1800 he helped his brother Gabriel organize what is now known as Gabriel’s rebellion. The first known leader to organize a movement around the connection between American slavery and the Israelite narrative recorded in the Bible was William Saunders Crowdy.\nCrowdy, a Civial War veteran established the establishing of The Church of God and Saints in Christ (COGASC) in 1896. Crowdy began to preach new revelations that God gave Him known as the “Seven Keys” that make up the doctrine of the COGASC. Crowdy remained the leader of congregation until his death on August 4, 1908 after which Bishop James M. Grove was elected as the new leader.\nIn 1866 F.S. Cherry organized the Church of the Living God, Pillar of Truth for All Nations in Chattanooga, TN. Cherry’s doctrine focused on the blackness of Adam, Eve and Jesus while arguing the white/white Jews altering of the blackness of biblical figures to fit their purposes. Cherry claimed his call to ministry was given by God to make Blacks aware that their true religion was indeed Judaism. Cherry also taught Blacks were of the lineage of Jacob and God hated White Jews because they rejected Jesus while using Revelation 3:9 as his proof text. Cherry moved the church from Chattanooga to Philadelphia in 1915 and remained the leader of the church until his death in 1965 after which, his son Benjamin Cherry took over as the leader.\nIn 1919 in Harlem, New York the Commandment Keepers of the Living God (also known as the Royal Order of Ethiopian Hebrews) began assembling under the leadership of Rabbi Wentworth A. Matthew. The group gained momentum due to their response to the Great Depression, World War II, and the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Matthew, born is West Africa but raise in the Caribbean created a hybrid theology that had influences from March Garvey, Arnold Josiah Ford to the point he took over Ford’s congregation when he left for Ethiopia. Matthew’s congregation stayed in tact while other organizations around them were closing their doors, most notably Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association. Matthew’s views and practices were known to be the closest of all Black Jewish movements to Orthodox Judaism yet at the same time, he taught; original Jews were black and white Jews are products of generational intermarriage with Europeans and the sufferings of Blacks was caused by their violation of God’s commandments. Before his death in 1973 Matthew ordained his grandson, Rabbi David Dore to be his successor. At the time of his ordination, Dore was only seventeen years old. His ordination caused a great division between Dore and Rabbi Chaim White that lasted for over three decades that eventually led to self-destruction.\nIn the 1960’s Ebner ben Yomin (also known as Abba Bivens) left the Commandment Keepers and began the Israeli School of Universal Practical Knowledge. Three of Bivens’ followers teamed up with four “high priests” to take over the school and were collectively known as the “Seven Heads”. These leaders later changed the name of the school to the Israelite Church of Universal Practical Knowledge and then changing the name again to rebrand because of a failed prophecy of Christ’ return in 2000, the name became the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ, Inc. The current leader, Apostle and Chief High Priest Tazadaqyah, born Jermaine Grant, rose to power after Ahrayah’s, one of Bivens disciples, prophecy of Christ’s return in 2000 to “slay or enslave” all the Edomites (whites) failed to come to pass. Tazadagyah is known by his followers as the Comforter, a direct reference to Holy Spirit and is propagated as such at the website dedicated to him.\nYahweh ben Yahweh was born Hulon Mitchell, Jr on October 27, 1935 in Kingfisher, OK to a pentecostal minister. After graduating high school he served in the Air Force, earned a degree in Psychology from Phillips College in Oklahoma before earning a master’s degree in economics from Atlanta University. He was briefly involved with the Nation of Islam before moving to Miami, FL in 1979 when where he declared himself as Yahweh ben Yahweh and began the Nation of Yahweh.His ministry was to rebuild the Liberty City section of Miami and by October 7, 1990 Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez declared the day to be Yahweh ben Yahweh Day all the while a federal grand jury was preparing to indict he and over a dozen of his followers with charges ranging from extortion, racketeering and over a dozen murders.The trial ended with a conviction that landed him in prison for 18 years but only served 11 of those years and after his release was informed he could not have any contact with any of the members of his group. On May 7, 2007 he passed away from cancer.\nThe Followers: It is hard to identify how many followers in the United States align themselves with the various groups that identify with the Black Hebrew Israelites. Part of the challenge is due to the strong emphasis put on a Jewish bloodline as being a prerequisite. According to an article by Michael Gelbwasser published in 1998 there were he cites Robin Washington (who organized the Alliance of Black Jews) claim of 260,000 black Jews practicing Judaism in America.Although the entirety of this number does not state how many align with Black Hebrew Israelite teachings, those who do would argue there are more since Black Hebrew Israelites include Latino and Native American heritages as well.\nThe Focus: The overall focus of all groups regardless of Scriptural interpretation is to bring an awareness of Israelite identity to those living in America that are unaware of such heritage. In addition, they live to see all true Israelites obey the Commandments of the Only True and Living God and forsake all forms of paganism. Some groups such as African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem go as far as mandating a migration to Israel.\nThe Faith: Many Black Hebrew Israelites affirm the King James (1611) Version of the Bible as their only rule of faith and practice and the interpretation of it is reserved for their ordained leader. Some groups accept some books of the New Covenant (New Testament) yet, many reject Paul’s writings on the idea, they were used often by White masters during the American slavery years.\nThe Friction: In addition to a high regard for the KJV, other Black Hebrew Israelites look to the Torah alone or Talmud while others the Apocrypha, Book of Enoch, Book of Jasher, andPseudepigrapha texts as being with equal with the KJV. Many Black Hebrew Israelites reject God’s nature being triune and separates Jesus from God the Father by forcing a dichotomy between the Supreme Being in the Universe and Jesus the “mere human being, a noteworthy prophet”.Jesus is then also seen as one who practiced Judaism, did not change any laws in Torah, lived an exemplary life.\nAccording to the Hebrew Israelites sin is defined by 1 John 3:4 which says, “Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness”, but on their website they quote the KJV which says, “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law” (italics original). They go onto to explain the “laws of Yah can be found in the first five books Scripture which are known as the Torah or Instructions” which include the Ten Commandments and various dietary laws. In addition, many Black Hebrew Israelites teach the only days that are to be celebrated are the Feasts found in Scripture.\nSalvation to many Black Hebrew Israelites is defined by one of two schools of thought; it is obtained through total obedience to the Law of Moses and calling on the Hebrew name of God (or Jesus for those who see Him as the Messiah) or exclusive to those who have a bloodline that leads back to Israel. According to the ICOGIJC, different nations who believe in the Lord Jesus “will not be spared from God’s wrath” using Isaiah 14:1—3, 34:1—3, and 66:15—6; Jeremiah 3:23; Daniel 2:44; Micah 4:11—3; and Revelation 19:11—5 as proof texts. They also say only the 12 Tribes of Israel will be saved and spared from His wrath. Heaven and hell are seen as states of mind not literal locations.\n-  Slave Rebellions, http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/slavery-iv-slave-rebellions, accessed on June 6, 2014\n-  Israel Unite. “Brief Israelite History”, http://israelunite.org/archives/2710, accessed on November 28, 2012\n-  Church of God and Saints of Christ.“What are the Seven Keys”,http://www.cogasoc.net/faq.php, accessed on November 28, 2012.

{"question":"How do lean manufacturing cells compare to the batch process approach in terms of task organization and efficiency?","answer":"Lean manufacturing cells separate processes into distinct units where the same person performs the same tasks repeatedly, which increases efficiency and improves consistency. The batch process approach, while allowing for grouping of certain parts together, operates at lower volumes and lacks the connected workflow of cellular manufacturing. Although batch processing offers more flexibility, it doesn't achieve the same level of efficiency as the cellular approach where tasks are standardized and chunked into specific work units.","context":["Efficiency is important to every organization because it affects the bottom line. In manufacturing, efficiency tends to have a greater impact because the environment is process-driven, which means optimal productivity is critical to reduce labor costs and achieve desired profits. One way to improve efficiency in manufacturing is to maximize the use of available resources. This means making full use of human resources, materials and equipment. A lot of companies leverage Six Sigma principles to ensure processes are lean and that only required resources are procured. Design for manufacturability (DFM) principles often produce remarkable results when it comes to eliminating waste. In DFM, parts are created with minimal materials in order to reduce waste and optimize the return on investment. To further optimize efficiency, factory returns and scraps are recycled.\nProven Methods for Increasing Efficiency in Manufacturing\nOpportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs are often found in the shipping process. Some companies are able to assess the materials used in shipping and make adjustments in order to slash expenses. For example, limiting the amount of bubble wrap based on what’s truly needed as opposed to simply guessing. This requires a more strategic approach and process testing. Another way to increase efficiency is through the use of a direct drive rotary compressor.\nPerhaps one of the best ways to increase efficiency and yield the biggest results is through employee training. Specifically, on-the-job training where employees are able to see the process performed with optimal effectiveness. This also provides an opportunity to demonstrate problem solving methods. Having a chance to experience a process firsthand while being trained by a veteran improves the employee’s ability to comprehend best practices. Cross-training team members on the entire manufacturing process helps everyone understand what’s required, value their individual role in the process and contribute to success.\nOne method of identifying where improvements can be made is to place a monetary value on each phase of the manufacturing process. This allows you to assess the cost of labor, materials and equipment involved and determine where improvements can be made. While assessing the value of each phase, you can identify any items that are unnecessary. For example, if there are tools or products that are not being used, there is likely an opportunity to cease purchase of those items.\nA common way in which companies boost efficiency in manufacturing is through the standardization of every task, no matter how large or small. Although some workers prefer autonomy, when it comes to manufacturing and productivity, following a strict process should be a priority. Having an explicit process that’s followed by everyone can significantly increase efficiency. A step-by-step process accompanied by a checklist is often a useful tool.\nLean manufacturing principles dictate that every process is separated by cells and each cell has it’s own task. In some spaces this is referred to as chunking because it allows the same person to perform the same tasks, which increases the efficiency in which each task is performed. This method is also believed to improve consistency.","When deadlines approach and it seems like there’s no way you’re going to pull through, work flow can potentially become unorganized and chaotic without the proper guidance. Part of the Lean and continuous improvement process is being able to effectively organize processes in the most efficient manner. Specific tools and procedures have been developed through the years to help organizations organize their work flow and become more efficient. One in particular that I will discuss in this post is the Product-Process Matrix.\nProduct-Process Matrix Background\nThe matrix was introduced by Robert H. Hayes and Steven C. Wheelwright in the Harvard Business Review in 1979, entitled “Link Manufacturing Process and Product Life Cycles” and “The Dynamics of Process-Product Life Cycles.” In the articles the two authors examine market manufacturing process issues and use the matrix to create strategic options for the company.\nThe matrix is made up of two dimensions that help to illustrate the linkage between the type of product produced and the production process. The first being product structure/product life cycle and the second is process structure/process life cycle. Together, the two dimensions can help you and your organization identify they type of production approach necessary for a particular product.\n- Low volume , low standardization one-of-a-kind products\n- Multiple products, low volume\n- Few major products, higher volume\n- High volume, high standardization, commodity products\n5S Guide: Improve efficiency with effective organization\nWhen the workplace is a mess, processes slow down. 5S, a systematic method for workplace organization, keeps spaces clean and clear of clutter processes. This 5S Guide explains the steps of a 5S program, how to start a program, and what tools you'll need to make 5S a success.\nThe rows of the matrix contain the process choices as shown in the example matrix to the right. Hayes and Wheelwright found that the majority of organizations lie along the diagonal of the matrix, where product type and process choice are logically aligned with one another. These process types are as follows:\nIf you are an organization that falls into the job shop process, it is more than likely that you produce a variety of goods in relatively low production volumes. This allows a lot of flexibility in both your workers and your equipment because you are producing a low volume. However, the goods produced are generally unique products that require customization, direct interaction with customers, and requires a high level of skill to produce.\nAlthough, there is flexibility and creativity in the job shop process, there is little to no repetition in the process. This can lead to inefficiency and slow production times without the proper materials and skills necessary to produce the good.\nA batch process is one that is capable of producing more goods than a job shop, but the volume per good is still not enough to justify dedicated equipment. This allows for a little more efficiency because you are grouping certain parts together in one process as needed. However, it is still at a low volume.\nThe repetition is good for creating a smoother flow in the work process, but it is still not a connected process.\nAn assembly line process consists of highly similar goods produced in a repetitive manner. Workstations are set up so that products can pass through them in a sequential order that allows the goods to be produced in the most efficient manner. This standardization provides an excellent opportunity to manage and oversee the process, but offers little to no flexibility or variety in the process or the product. However, does allow for the company to produce its goods in a high volume quickly.\nContinuous flow processes require specialized equipment in order to work continuously. This can only be possible when your range of products is extremely limited and you’re required to produce them in an extremely high volume. The upside to this process is it is the most efficient and standardizes the process the most, making it the easiest to maintain standards. The downside, is that it offers no flexibility or ability to customize the products. It also can be very expensive to set up and fix machinery when they break, possibly causing long downtimes and gaps in your production.\nWhere Do You Fit In?\nThe first two processes fit into the upper left quadrant of the matrix. They both put a major emphasis on product variety and flexible resources (workers and equipment). While the last two processes offer little variety and use less flexible resources. They tend to align themselves in the lower right portion of the matrix.\nWhen used, the product-process matrix can provide at least an understanding of the strategic options available, especially when it comes to production efforts. If you fall into a particular part of the quadrant, but are using a process that doesn’t align with your placing in the matrix, then it might be time to rethink your process.\nThis is not the perfect solution for every organization out there trying to find their niche, but it does provide a quick and easy guide to see where you line up. Every product and every organization is different, thus no one way is the right way. However, finding the most efficient and value adding method to your process, should alway be the end all goal.\n- 6 Lean Manufacturing Principles to Improve Your Productivity\n- Top Tips For Process Improvement\n- Overproduction is a Waster\n- Product Quality – How can it be better Controlled?\n- Implementing The 5s Principles In Transactional And Service Process\n- 5S: More Than Meets The Eye\n- Process Cycle Efficiency– creativesafetysupply.com\n- Ways To Improve A Product– lean-news.com\n- New Product Development: Potential Pitfalls– blog.creativesafetysupply.com\n- Utilizing The Right Tools To Implement The Kaizen Process– kaizen-news.com\n- 5 Kaizen Tools to Start Using– hiplogic.com\n- Heijunka – Creating Flow– blog.5stoday.com"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b8661b0d-e567-4f94-823b-168b90aa8b3d>","<urn:uuid:6e06e516-3835-46a7-96f5-0c2d756762be>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the approach to telling difficult stories differ between the North Korean tuberculosis documentary and Christa Parravani's memoir 'Her'?","answer":"Both works demonstrate how personal stories can humanize difficult subjects, but take different approaches. The North Korean tuberculosis documentary 'Out of Breath' breaks down stereotypes by showing cooperation between US and North Korean medical teams fighting disease, revealing unexpected friendships and common humanity. Meanwhile, Parravani's memoir takes a more direct and unflinching approach, using a matter-of-fact tone to convey the raw reality of losing her twin sister to drug overdose. Both works succeed in making challenging topics accessible by focusing on human experiences rather than stereotypes or sensationalism.","context":["Peace Journalism for the Koreas Negotiations\n“Do not demonise North Korea. Demons do not negotiate. If there are no negotiations, there will be war.” The words of Chung-in Moon to journalists who gathered for the Korea Press Foundation journalism conference in Seoul, last October, as diplomatic efforts were being stepped up for a second summit meeting between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.\nMoon is a sage old hand of arms control talks. A current member of the South Korean government’s advisory committee on diplomatic strategy, he previously served as Ambassador for International Security, combining these posts with his career in universities. His advice was timely, given the findings of new research on Australian media and how they refer to the Democratic People’s Republic[i]. In coverage from two major newspapers and the public broadcaster, the ABC, North Korea was usually described as rogue, secretive, totalitarian or evil, with its leader “often referred to as a ruthless psychopath.” Dominant metaphors tended to be conflictual, framing the country as “a military threat [and] unpredictable, irrational and ruthless.” As the researchers comment, the pattern is typical, and not just in Australia.\nWhat would it take, to change the tenor of international coverage? Restraint, for one: CNN’s Seoul correspondent Paula Hancocks, who also spoke at the conference, recalled how she successfully argued against the network running a story on claims that Kim had removed one of his relatives, fallen from government favour, by feeding him to a pack of dogs. Editors in Atlanta had been keen on the story, which was being widely aired elsewhere, but Hancocks advised caution, given that no firm evidence was available to support it.\nWhat can the Peace Journalism playbook contribute? How can readers and audiences be prompted and equipped to consider and value nonviolent responses to the still-unresolved conflict on the Korean peninsula, with all its potential dangers? Look past slogans from both ‘sides’ to focus on the goals of the conflict parties, for one. The Korean war of 1950-53 has never been declared officially over. The Koreas are separated by a so-called Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which marks the ceasefire line. Given this, Moon said, it was vital to realise that the North saw no reason to consider itself “a defeated nation. [So, they would think] don’t treat us as if we have to surrender to the United States.” Reporters should therefore regard with scepticism calls by hawkish voices on the American side for “complete and verifiable disarmament” before concessions such as the lifting of sanctions (which, indeed, collapsed the second Trump summit, when made under the apparent influence of National Security Adviser John Bolton). Approaches that provide for such steps to proceed in parallel should be seen as more realistic.\nAnother distinction in the Peace Journalism model originally proposed by Johan Galtung is to focus on “people as peacemakers”, not just leaders. A couple of months before leaving for Seoul, I listened to a talk, at Sydney’s Exodus Foundation, by the veteran nuclear disarmament campaigner, Joseph Gerson, who was visiting Australia from the US. Because the North Korea talks were an initiative of the Trump White House, he explained, Democrats were instinctively sceptical, if not downright hostile. A typical line was: “this is all a sham, Trump gave up too much, we should still be exerting maximum pressure.” Instead, he called on the official agenda for the process to be “attacked from the Left: demand the formation of negotiating teams” to hammer out a sequence of real progress towards denuclearisation, and the “easing of the trade and medicine embargo.” This would also meet one of Galtung’s key recommendations for reporting peace plans, which I presented at the Seoul conference: ask “is the peace plan a process, or only an outcome?” Beyond the day’s headline, what happens next?\nIf non-elite voices deserve greater prominence on the American side, the same is true on the Korean peninsula. Korea Peace Now: Women Mobilizing to End War, was an intervention by the Nobel Women’s Initiative and Women Cross the DMZ. Taking the form of a letter to Presidents Trump and Kim, they called for normalization of relations by “establishing reciprocal liaison offices, lifting sanctions that harm vulnerable individuals, and facilitating people-to-people engagement.”\nOne of the chief gains from the first Trump-Kim summit in 2018 was a “freeze for a freeze”: no further nuclear weapons testing by Pyongyang, in exchange for a halt to joint military exercises between the US and South Korea. Peace campaigners are calling for the latter to be made permanent. Over recent years, the pristine environment of Jeju Island has been violated by the establishment of a new naval base, which hosted an “international fleet review” last October. The local Association of Gangjeong villagers, who opposed the development, called on third countries not to send warships to take part. If more media were prepared to listen seriously to such voices, then a more nuanced picture, exposing more of the realistic prospects for peacemaking, could emerge.\nAs Annabel McGoldrick and I argue in Peace Journalism, our book[ii] distilling many of the discussions we conducted with editors and reporters around the world, presenting inputs to news from unconventional sources requires journalism to construct a “framework of understanding” to establish their relevance to the story. Today’s journalists must do this anyway, it could be argued, to justify their existence as professional communicators. Another contributor to the Seoul conference was Thomas Rosenstiel, Executive Director of the American Press Institute. Publics now require “news fluency”, he said, to enable them to differentiate journalism they can rely on. Editors and reporters can help by explaining “how and why this was a story.” If the message from journalism to readers and audiences in the 20th Century was “trust me”, its equivalent for the 21st, in a world of unprecedented media plenitude, was inverted. Now, the message was coming from readers and audiences, demanding greater transparency as a corollary of that trust: “show me.”\nPart of the remedy, for the demonising coverage exposed by the findings on Australian media, would, the researchers say, be to feature “more stories illustrating individual and community life. This would give North Koreans a human face.” Getting the requisite access for such stories is difficult, they concede. However, a notable example screened this year on Australian television, which points the way. The Foreign Correspondent strand on ABC Television took us into the heart of a unique US-North Korean cooperative venture, between clinics in the country for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis – a deadly disease that strikes half a million people a year worldwide – and volunteers from the Eugene Bell Foundation, who work with them.\nTitled ‘Out of Breath’, it’s a moving and memorable film, deserving to be more widely viewed – which it can be, on the program’s website[iii]. “I will never forget the first tuberculosis centre I visited,” the film-maker, Hein S Seok, has written[iv]. “As soon as we stopped, the North Korean medical team rushed over with huge smiles. I realised I was witnessing a reunion of old friends who had been working towards the same goal for decades… I discarded any assumptions I might have had about the North Korean people.”\nAs long-form journalism (the film runs at 28 minutes) it’s in a genre that lends itself most readily to the PJ approach. But there are clear opportunities now for editors and reporters engaged in all forms of journalism to peer beyond the clichés, engage with the goals and agendas of the parties to an unresolved and potentially dangerous conflict, and make room for peace to enter the debate.

This month’s memoirs contain tales of young lives formed and spent in places like the Hudson Valley, Chicago, Oakland, Louisiana, and Utah (with stints in Africa, Venice, and Antarctica). Was geography destiny for our memoirists? Does where you come from matter as much as what you did while you were there? How does setting inform narrative? If you imagine each of these stories set somewhere else do they retain the same power? I don’t think so.\nAldrich, Alexandra. The Astor Orphan. Ecco: HarperCollins. Apr. 2013. 272p. photos. ISBN 9780062207937. $24.99; ebook ISBN 9780062207968. MEMOIR\nRokeby, the sprawling, dilapidated Hudson Valley home of Aldrich’s aristocratic forebears, the Astors, played as much of a role in her bohemian childhood as any of the eccentric adults who raised her there. Tensions between efforts at historic preservation and a desire for normalcy and comfort created warring factions among the numerous family members (and their partisans) residing at the 43 room estate on 450 acres. Aldrich’s portrait of a family with more history and house than money, vividly illustrates the concept of shabby chic. What is made even clearer is the extent to which Aldrich’s family draws its identity from Rokeby. VERDICT Inevitably, comparisons to Albert and David Maysles documentary film Grey Gardens spring to mind. Aldrich provides a fascinating, if voyeuristic peek behind the rotting silk curtains in one of America’s aristocratic families’ home. Seriously? It made this reader want to hop in a car and poke around Rokeby herself.\nDreher, Rod. The Little Way of Ruthie Lemming. Hachette. Apr. 2013. 271p. ISBN 9781455521913. $25.99. MEMOIR\nThe fatal illness of his younger sister Ruthie (equally saintly and vinegar-tongued), leads conservative journalist Dreher to examine what he left behind in his childhood home of St. Francisville, LA, to pursue a writing career in cities such as Philadelphia and DC. The reasons for why “you can’t go home again” are evident to Dreher, who chronicles the tradeoffs between city and small-town life through the lens of his conversion to Catholicism and search for community. VERDICT While Dreher’s account of a family devastated by the illness of a beloved member may comfort readers in similar circumstances, the religiosity of his approach to Ruthie’s illness and death may be harder for others to relate to.\nHainey, Michael. After Visiting Friends. Scribner. 2013. 320p. ISBN 9781451676563. $25. MEMOIR\nThe hazy and conflicting details of his Chicago newspaperman father’s long-ago death bothered Hainey (deputy editor, GQ) enough that he spent years unraveling the story of what really happened that night. Central to this noirish tale is Hainey’s mother, an enigmatic woman who held her family together in spite of (or perhaps with the aid of) secrets.Years of investigation lead to new truths about her as well as the original mystery of his father’s death that Hainey set out to solve. VERDICT Readers may intuit quickly what happened the night of Hainey’s father’s death but the portrait of the bygone world of the Chicago newspaper industry and the slow unraveling of the puzzle surrounding Bob Hainey’s life, rather than his death, will keep readers interested beyond that point.\nParravani, Christa. Her: A Memoir. Holt. Mar. 2013. 336p. ISBN 9780805096538. $26. MEMOIR\nParravani’s twin sister Cara died of a drug overdose at the age of 28 and the author herself danced close to the same edge from time to time. In recounting their tumultuous upbringing, young marriages, and a devastating assault on Cara, Parravani succeeds in “writing Cara back to life” and saving her own life in the process. No punches are pulled here, and Parravani’s matter-of-fact tone does nothing to shield readers from the enormity of her loss. VERDICT Imagine looking in a mirror and not seeing yourself. Imagine living the rest of your life with half of yourself missing. Imagine looking at your own corpse. You don’t have to imagine: Parravani’s story makes it all clear.\nStephens, Liz. The Days Are Gods. Univ. of Nebraska. Mar. 2013. 216p. ISBN 9780803243545. pap. $18.95 MEMOIR\nA move from LA to Utah’s Cache Valley allowed Stephens and her husband to create the rural, horse-owning life they had dreamed of; more importantly, the move opened Stephens’ eyes to where she was really “from.” Life in the valley was as beautiful and difficult as she imagined, but the pull of the place itself—gorgeously described by Stephens—was irresistible to her as a child in a rootless American family. VERDICT The sense of place created by Stephens is notable as is her nonhysterical treatment of the ways and lives of her new Mormon neighbors. Those who dream of a practical escape from the rat race of modern life will find a kindred spirit here.\nWilliams, Mary. The Lost Daughter. Blue Rider: Penguin Books (USA). Apr. 2013. 320p. photos. ISBN 9780399160868. $26.95. MEMOIR\nWilliams’s early childhood in Oakland, CA, the daughter of Black Panther activists, subjected her to poverty, neglect, and abuse. Her informal adoption during adolescence by Jane Fonda changed the material circumstances of her life but, as the last several hundred pages of Williams’s book demonstrate: the past is always with you. William’s attempts to reconcile her two disparate families and lives form the heart of her conversational narrative of a life changed by what looks like chance. VERDICT Williams presents clear-eyed portraits of all the adults who looked after her, or should have. A fascinating picture of Jane Fonda in a maternal role emerges but equally intriguing is Williams’s description of life as a small child living in the close-knit Black Panther community. Williams will remind readers that tensions ran high in the 1970s and that sometimes the collateral damage was human life.\nMacLane, Mary. I Await the Devil’s Coming. Melville House. Mar. 2013. 176p. ISBN 9781612191942. pap. $16. MEMOIR\nOriginally published in 1902, this is the confessional memoir of Mary MacLane, a 19-year-old girl in Butte, MT. Written in diary style, the work is saturated with overstatements and melodrama endemic to teenagers as she explores essential human emotions, such as loneliness, expectation, and longing. Throughout MacLane addresses the devil as a savior liberating her from her dull existence, and eagerly anticipates his arrival; the title derives from the persistent refrain with which she ends many of her diary entries. She ponders questions both mundane and existential that inform the development of her sensual approach to life. A precursor to feminist manifestos, but containing some less than liberated concepts, the author expresses fierce desires during a time when women were expected to be subdued and conventional. The memoir illustrates the discontent that later led to greater rights and opportunities for women. VERDICT Despite its use of antiquated language, the book remains accessible for modern audiences. A fascinating read for those interested in gender and women’s studies, as well as women’s history.—Rachael Dreyer, American Heritage Ctr., Laramie, WY\nMiranda, Deborah A. Bad Indians: A Tribal Memoir. Heyday. 2013. 240p. ISBN 9781597142014. pap. $18.95. MEMOIR\nIn this powerful memoir, poet Miranda (Indian Cartography) dispenses with a chronological telling of her relationship to California’s Spanish missions, sharing transcripts of recordings made by her relatives, her poetry, mission history, and pieces of her own wrenching childhood. The legacy of violence that began at the missions in the late 18th and early 19th century stretches into the author’s relationship with her own children, a testament to how it was handed down through brutalized and marginalized generations. VERDICT This is intense but important reading, especially for those whose American history class discussions of Native Americans began and ended with the Mayflower. For readers of memoir, and history from a point of view too-often unheard.—Kate Sheehan, Middlebury, CT\nWilliams, Jody. My Name is Jody Williams: A Vermont Girl’s Winding Path to the Nobel Peace Prize. Univ. of California. Mar. 2013. 347p. ISBN 9780520270251. $29.95. MEMOIR\nActivist and Novel Peace Prize winner Williams (coauthor, After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines) describes her life as an average woman driven by compassion. Williams grew up in a typical American family, but through education and her own curiosity, she became a powerful activist for those without a voice. A single flyer handed to her before heading into the DC Metro prompted a journey through Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, which then expanded to work in southeast Asia. Williams takes the reader on an exciting and honest story of her work with the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, Medical Aid to El Salvador, and finally the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. A fascinating story, readers will not want to put down this memoir. Williams has the ability to connect with her audience while explaining the not-so-pretty history of Central America and the excessive use of anti-personnel landmines. VERDICT A wonderful glimpse into the life of an activist, sister, daughter, and wife. This memoir is a must read for anyone who wants to be inspired by the not-so-average woman.—Meghan Dowell, New York\nDonald, Mark L. & others. Battle Ready: Memoir of a SEAL Warrior Medic. St. Martin’s. Mar. 2013. 352p. ISBN 9780312600754. $26.99. MEMOIR\nDonald joined the Marines to escape a dysfunctional home after high school. Over the course of his career, he developed into a tough warrior, a Navy SEAL, a medic, and a physician’s assistant. He’s traveled the road from student to instructor and from training in the waters off Coronado to the deserts of Iraq and mountains of Afghanistan. He was a reluctant hero, who saw comrades and friends killed in action, who saved many more, and who came home a changed man. He details those firefights, his struggles with PTSD, and how he found the help that he needed through the love and support of family, fellow SEALs, and service organizations. This book is similar to Service: Lone Survivor, a Navy SEAL at Work by Marcus Luttrell. VERDICT An entertaining inside look at the psyche of special operations warriors, this book will be of interest to those who enjoy military memoirs, with an emphasis on special ops and military medicine, along with a side look at PTSD and its issues.—Martha Bauder, LTC, U.S. Army Reserve Physician\nMcAdams, Frank. Vietnam Rough Riders: A Convoy Commander’s Memoir. Univ. of Kansas. Mar. 2013. 280p. ISBN 9780700618989. $34.95. MEMOIR\nComplete with heroes and villains, McAdams’s (The American War Film: History and Hollywood) story of his days as a Marine in Vietnam has all of the excitement and action of a war movie. He pulls no punches when expressing his frustrations with some of his superior officers; he liberally praises those soldiers who acted above and beyond the call of duty. The turbulence of the mid-to-late 1960s is captured through letters from and interactions with his wife while he was fighting in the jungles of Vietnam. VERDICT This is a highly satisfactory and stimulating read best suited to those who are interested in the Vietnam War and the changes that America experienced in the 1960s.—Martha Bauder, LTC, U.S. Army Reserve Physician"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:560dcf60-769e-47b2-91d4-066cb22d2b9a>","<urn:uuid:4ee1e4e0-7fca-42cb-bd05-6689e1483435>"],"error":null}
