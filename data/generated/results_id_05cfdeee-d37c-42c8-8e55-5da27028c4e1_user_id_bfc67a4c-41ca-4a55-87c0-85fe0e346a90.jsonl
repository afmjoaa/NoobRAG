{"question":"What methods do geologists use to date and locate ancient volcanic formations in hotspot chains, and what insights have these techniques revealed about Earth's magnetic field?","answer":"Geologists use several methods to study ancient volcanic formations. They determine age through radiometric dating of potassium and argon, as potassium atoms decay into argon at a constant rate. Location is determined by analyzing magnetite in rock samples, which aligns with Earth's magnetic pole as magma cools. Through these techniques, researchers have discovered that Earth's magnetic poles reverse approximately every 5,000 years, as revealed by examining lava flows from various volcanic eruptions.","context":["Geologists have long assumed that the Hawaiian Islands owe their existence to a \"hotspot\" -- stationary plumes of magma that rise from the Earth's mantle to form Mauna Loa, Kilauea and Hawaii's other massive volcanoes. But a new study posted on the online version of the journal Science disputes that long-standing paradigm by concluding that the fixed hotspot in the Pacific was not stationary after all.\n\"Our research suggests that the Hawaiian hotspot actually drifted southward between 47 and 81 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary,\" said David Scholl, consulting professor of geophysics at Stanford University and senior research scientist emeritus with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. \"This finding will break across a very cherished idea about how things work in the innards of the Earth.\"\nScholl is one of 11 co-authors of the study that appears in the July 24 edition of Science Express online (www.sciencexpress.org). The lead author is geophysicist John A. Tarduno of the University of Rochester, who earned a doctoral degree at Stanford in 1987. His principal collaborator is second author Robert A. Duncan of Oregon State University.\nUntil now, the prevailing theory among geophysicists has been that, for millions of years, the massive Pacific Plate has been slowly drifting over a fixed hotspot deep in the mantle, creating a trail of volcanoes whose peaks emerge from the ocean as Maui, Oahu and the other islands that make up the 49th state. The Hawaiian Islands are part of a long chain of volcanoes collectively known as the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamounts that stretch some 3,600 miles along the floor of the Pacific -- from the Big Island of Hawaii to Alaska's Aleutian Trench.\nThe segment known as the Hawaiian Ridge, which includes the Hawaiian and Midway Islands, forms a neat line of volcanoes that extends some 1,800 miles northwest across the Pacific. At that point, the Hawaiian Ridge meets the Emperor Seamounts -- an older volcanic chain that abruptly changes course, stretching more than 1,000 miles almost due north to the Aleutian Trench. According to most researchers, this sharp northward bend records a change in the direction of the Pacific Plate as it passed over the fixed hotspot about 47 million years ago.\nTo test this hypothesis and determine the true origin of the Emperor Seamounts, Tarduno, Scholl and other scientists embarked on a two-month excursion aboard the research vessel JOIDES Resolution to collect samples of solidified lava flows from four submerged volcanoes that form part of the Seamounts chain. The expedition was conducted under the auspices of the Ocean Drilling Program, an international research effort to study the world's seafloors.\nArgon and magnetite\nWhen the voyage ended, the researchers conducted geochemical analyses of the lava samples to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of two chemical elements -- potassium and argon.\nWhen a rock forms, atoms of potassium start decaying into argon at a constant rate, regardless of changes in the rock's temperature, chemistry or pressure. By measuring the number of potassium-derived argon atoms in the samples, researchers were able to estimate that the submerged volcanoes formed some 45 million to 81 million years ago.\nTarduno and his team were able to determine where the volcanoes formed by analyzing a mineral called magnetite in the rock samples. As hot magma from an erupting volcano cools, magnetite residues align with the Earth's magnetic pole and become locked in place.\n\"The magnetite behaves like miniature compass needles: The closer they are to the Earth's magnetic pole, the steeper their position,\" Scholl explained. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the Seamounts formed by determining the angles at which the magnetite had frozen.\nUsing these data, the research team concluded that the \"fixed\" Hawaiian hotspot probably crept southward between 81 million and 47 million years ago at a rate of about 44 millimeters a year, \"changing our understanding of terrestrial dynamics,\" they wrote.\n\"Given the central role the Hawaiian-Emperor bend has played as an example of [tectonic] plate motion change, these observations now question whether major plates can undergo large changes in direction rapidly, and whether plate boundary forces alone can play a dominant role in controlling plate motions,\" they noted. \"These data sets indicate a much more active role of mantle convection in controlling the distribution of volcanic islands.\"\n\"This study raises fundamental questions about how the mantle works and how plates work,\" Scholl added. \"What's really going on here? Why do these hotspots drift, and why do they suddenly stop? We know that the mantle moves, now we have to find out how deep the motion goes.\"\nFuture drilling experiments in other ocean basins could provide answers, he noted.\nOther co-authors of the study are Rory D.

The term hotspot is also used when referring to the location on the Earth's surface where such volcanism has been taking place. In 1963, J. Tuzo Wilson came up with the idea that volcanic chains like the Hawaiian Islands result from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a \"fixed\" hotspot deep beneath the surface of the planet.\nGeologists have identified some 40–50 hotspots around the globe. Of these, Hawaii, Réunion, Yellowstone, Galápagos, and Iceland overlie those that are currently most active.\nBy studying hotspots, geologists have been able to track the movement of the Earth's crustal plates. In addition, by examining lava flows from a series of volcanic eruptions, they have come to the conclusion that there is a reversal of Earth's magnetic poles at intervals of about 5,000 years.\nFor a long time, geologists have thought that a hotspot is caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle, called a mantle plume, rising up from near the Earth's core-mantle boundary. With the formation of a plume, magma builds up under a tectonic plate, eventually erupting with basaltic rock, forming what are called Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). The resultant volcano then continues to pour out lava.\nHowever, recent evidence indicates that the upper mantle is hotter and more fluid than what was once believed. As a result, a number of geologists attribute hotspots to convection in the upper mantle, formulating an alternative to the plume model. It has been suggested that the term \"hotspot\" be replaced by the term \"melting anomaly.\"\nEither model provides an explanation of how volcanoes can occur far from the edges of tectonic plates, where plates are subducted into the mantle.\nAlong with these models, there has been a revival of what has been called the \"antipodal pair impact hypothesis.\" It is the idea that pairs of opposite hotspots may result from the impact of a large meteor.\nMost hotspot volcanoes are basaltic because they erupt through oceanic lithosphere (such as Hawaii, Tahiti). As a result, they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes, in which water is trapped under the overriding plate. Where hotspots occur under continental crust, basaltic magma is trapped in the less dense continental crust, which is heated and melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can be quite hot and form violent eruptions, despite their low water content. For example, the Yellowstone Caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history. However, when rhyolitic magma is completely erupted, it may eventually turn into basaltic magma because it is no longer trapped in the less dense continental crust. An example of this activity is the Ilgachuz Range in British Columbia, which was created by an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows.\nAs the continents and seafloor drift across the mantle plume, \"hotspot\" volcanoes generally leave unmistakable evidence of their passage through seafloor or continental crust. In the case of the Hawaiian hotspot, the islands themselves are the remnant evidence of the movement of the seafloor over the hotspot in the Earth's mantle. The Yellowstone hotspot emerged in the Columbia Plateau of the US Pacific Northwest. The Deccan Traps of India are the result of the emergence of the hotspot currently under Réunion Island, off the coast of eastern Africa. Geologists use hotspots to help track the movement of the Earth's plates. Such hotspots are so active that they often record step-by-step changes in the direction of the Earth's magnetic poles. Thanks to lava flows from a series of eruptions in the Columbia Plateau, scientists now know that the reversal of magnetic poles takes about 5000 years, fading until there is no detectable magnetism, then reforming in near-opposite directions.\nHotspot volcanoes should not be confused with island arc volcanoes. Although each will appear as a string of volcanic islands, island arcs are formed by the subduction of converging tectonic plates. When one oceanic plate meets another, the denser plate is forced downward into a deep ocean trench. This plate releases water into the base of the overriding plate as it is subducted, and this water causes some rock to melt. This process results in a chain of volcanoes, such as the Aleutian Islands near Alaska and Sweden.\nBelow is a list of hotspots around the globe. The numbers in parentheses correspond to the numbered hotspots in the figure on the right.\nAll links retrieved January 14, 2018.\nNew World Encyclopedia writers and editors rewrote and completed the Wikipedia article in accordance with New World Encyclopedia standards.

{"question":"What is the impact of recycling paper on natural resources? How does this compare to aluminum recycling in terms of environmental benefits?","answer":"Recycling paper has significant impacts on natural resources - recycling one ton saves 17 trees, 7,000 gallons of water, and 2 barrels of oil (enough to run a car for 1,260 miles). It also provides enough energy savings to power an average home for 6 months. In comparison, aluminum recycling's main benefit is energy savings - recycling one can saves enough energy to power a TV for 3 hours. Both materials are important to recycle, as Americans generate 30% of the world's garbage while being only 5% of the population. The aluminum industry recycles about 600 cans every second, and aluminum cans can contain at least 50% recycled content.","context":["The Power of Recycling: A Balanced Viewpoint for Young Environmentalists\nThe topic of recycling is buzzing all over the world. It's even more relevant for the younger generation as they are the custodians of Earth's future. This article aims to provide an objective and comprehensive overview of recycling, its benefits, and its limitations.\nWhat is Recycling, and Why Does It Matter?\nRecycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable materials and objects. It's all about taking items that would otherwise end up in a landfill and turning them into something new and useful. You can learn more about the recycling process here.\nRecycling is not just about being eco-friendly; it's also about preserving resources, saving energy, and reducing pollution. With the increasing global population and our consumption habits, we are putting immense pressure on our planet's natural resources. Recycling can help mitigate this problem.\nThe Benefits of Recycling\n1. Conservation of Natural Resources\nRecycling helps conserve natural resources. For example, by recycling paper, we save trees, and by recycling plastic, we reduce the need for petroleum, which is used to make new plastic. In fact, recycling one ton of paper saves 17 trees and 7,000 gallons of water source.\n2. Energy Efficiency\nRecycling is generally more energy-efficient than producing new products from raw materials. For instance, recycling aluminum cans saves 95% of the energy needed to produce new ones from raw materials source.\n3. Reduction of Landfills\nRecycling reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Landfills are not only visually unappealing but also cause environmental problems such as soil, air, and water pollution. They produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.\n4. Job Creation\nThe recycling industry creates jobs. A study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that recycling and reuse activities in the United States created 757,000 jobs in 2007 source.\nLimitations of Recycling\nWhile recycling has its benefits, it isn't always the best option. Let's look at some of the limitations.\n1. Not All Materials are Recyclable\nUnfortunately, not all materials can be recycled. For instance, materials like plastic bags, polystyrene foam (Styrofoam), and certain types of glass cannot be recycled in most locations.\nRecycling can be less effective if the recyclable materials are contaminated. This happens when non-recyclable items are mixed with recyclable ones, or when food or other waste contaminates recyclable materials. This contamination can make the entire batch of recyclables unusable source.\n3. Energy and Pollution\nWhile recycling is generally more energy-efficient than producing new products, it still uses energy and can create pollution. For example, the process of recycling paper can release harmful chemicals into the environment.\n4. Financial Cost\nRecycling can be expensive. It requires collection, sorting, and processing, all of which cost money. In some cases, it can be cheaper to produce new products from raw materials than to recycle.\nBalancing Recycling with Other Environmental Practices\nConsidering the limitations of recycling, it's crucial to balance it with other environmental practices. Remember the famous three R’s: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. They're listed in order of importance.\nThe most effective way to minimize waste is not to create it in the first place. For example, you might choose to buy fewer items with excessive packaging, bring your own reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and coffee cups, or borrow or rent items you'll only use once or twice.\nBefore you recycle or dispose of anything, consider whether it has more life left in it. A used glass jar can become a new storage container. An old t-shirt can become a cleaning rag. Items in good condition can be donated or sold for reuse.\nIf you can't reduce or reuse, then recycling is the next best thing. Even with its limitations, recycling is still far better for the environment than sending waste to the landfill.\nMaking Recycling More Effective\nSo how can we ensure that recycling is as effective as possible? Here are a few tips:\n1. Know What to Recycle\nLearn what materials are recyclable in your community and make sure you're recycling the right things. Here is a useful guide to help you.\n2. Clean Your Recyclables\nRinse out containers to remove food and drink residue before recycling. This helps prevent contamination that can make other items non-recyclable.\n3. Don't Wish-Cycle\n\"Wish-cycling\" is when you're not sure if something is recyclable, but you put it in the recycling bin anyway, hoping it is. This can lead to contamination, so when in doubt, find out!\nAs young environmentalists, you hold the power to make a difference in the world. While recycling has its limitations, it's still a crucial tool in our fight against waste and our journey towards a more sustainable future. By understanding the benefits and challenges of recycling, as well as the importance of reducing and reusing, you can help create a healthier planet for everyone.\nRemember, every action counts, no matter how small. So, keep learning, stay curious, and continue to care about our Earth. Your actions today will shape the world of tomorrow.\nWhile I've tried to provide comprehensive information, the topic of recycling is complex and varies greatly by location and other factors. So, keep exploring, asking questions, and seeking knowledge. A wealth of resources is available out there, like the EPA's resources for students and educators and National Geographic Kids.\nRemember, you have the power to make a difference! Happy recycling!","Reducing waste, reusing materials and products, and recycling are some of the most powerful ways individuals, households, and businesses can protect the environment.\nHere's why you should get involved:\n- Saving natural resources: Reusing discarded products and using recycled materials to make new products reduces the use of virgin materials, which often involves harvesting trees and mining the earth. Even better, “source reducing” waste — or avoiding the generation of discards in the first place — saves the most resources of all.\n- Preventing environmental problems that come from landfills: Few people want a landfill in their neighborhood. Unfortunately, we will need landfills as long as we choose to dispose of waste. Although landfills today are much safer than 20 years ago, they are still a poor use of land and a potential source of groundwater contamination and releases of methane and other gases.\n- Saving energy: Enormous amounts of energy are required to make products and materials worldwide. Energy is saved by not using products and materials when at all possible, or by reusing products in their current form. Tremendous energy savings come from using recycled instead of virgin materials in manufacturing.\n- Preventing pollution: Almost all manufacturing processes use water and release wastewater and air emissions into the environment. Reducing and reusing products cuts down on manufacturing pollution, just as the use of recycled instead of virgin materials prevents pollution in industrial processes.\n- Saving money: Households can save money by reusing materials and products and by practicing smart shopping habits that reduce waste.\nReducing the amount of waste you generate is a great step to take towards helping the environment. There are several things that you\n- Use tote bags or bins when shopping, say no to the plastic shopping bag.\n- Select packaging that does not have a lot of excess waste.\n- Use dinnerware that can be washed instead of paper plates and plastic ware.\n- Only buy things that you will use in the immediate future.\nMany commonly discarded items — from single-sided paper to clothing to televisions — are readily reusable in their current form.\nInstead of tossing an item in the trash can or recycling bin, consider ways it might still be usable to you or someone else, or whether it can be repaired if needed.\nGive your discards a chance at a second life by holding a yard sale or donating items to Goodwill, the Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, or other charitable outlets. Contact schools and nursery schools to find out different types of items they reuse for art projects. Donate used books to the Library. Several organizations take used cars and even boats.\nThe energy used to manufacture a product is a direct energy cost. But there are indirect energy costs, too. The energy used to obtain raw materials -- for transportation, distribution and even disposal of an item -- contributes to indirect energy costs.\nDirect and indirect energy costs are referred to as embedded energy -- the total amount of energy a product used in its “life.” Both direct and indirect energy cost can be reduced through recycling.\nTable Comparing Energy Cost of Manufacturing Products from Raw materials vs. Recycled materials:\n|NEWSPRINT||30 Million BTU||10 Million BTU|\n|PET PLASTIC||98 Million BTU||12 Million BTU|\n|HDPE PLASTIC||98 Million BTU||22 Million BTU|\n|GLASS||16 Million BTU||15 Million BTU|\n|METALS|| Aluminum from Ore|\n250 Million BTU\n| Aluminum from Scrap|\n12.5 Million BTU\nSOURCE: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2005 Facts and Figures”\nWhat can I recycle? Many materials can be recycled. Some of the most common are:\nNewspaper Aluminum Cans\nCardboard Steel Cans\nWriting/Copy Paper Plastic Bottles\nMixed Household Paper Glass Bottles and Jars\nMagazines End of Life Electronics\n- Americans represent only five percent of the world's population, but generate 30 percent of the world's garbage.\n- Recycling one ton of old paper saves 17 trees; 2 barrels of oil (enough to run an average car for 1,260 miles); 4,100 kilowatts of energy (enough power for the average home for 6 months); 3.2 cubic yards of landfill space; 7,000 gallons of wate; and 60 pounds of air pollution.\n- Every day, U.S. paper makers recycle enough paper to fill a train of boxcars 15 miles long.\n- If we recycled all of the newspapers printed in the U.S. on a typical Sunday, we would save about 550,000 trees.\n- Recycling the steel from six cars can provide enough steel framing for a 2000 square foot building.\n- The energy saved each year by steel recycling is equal to the electrical power used by 18 million homes each year -- or enough energy to last Irondequoit residents eight hundred years!\n- The steel industry recycles almost 19 billion steel cans into new products each year – about 600 cans recycled every second.\n- Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a television for three hours.\n- Americans throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial fleet of airplanes every 3 months.\n- Aluminum cans produced in the United States can contain at least 50 percent recycled content.\n- Recycling one glass bottle saves enough electricity to light a 60-watt bulb for four hours.\n- If not recycled, one quart of used motor oil could pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water.\n- Half of all polyester carpet made in the United States is made from recycled plastic (PT).\n- Energy saved from recycling helps the environment by reducing energy-related air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRemember - Recycle Today for Tomorrow !\n- Buy recycled products. If we want recycling to work, we must support manufacturers who use recycled materials in their products (post-consumer recycled content) -- whether in the products themselves or the packages they come in. Favor products with a high recycled content, even if they cost a little more. Look to buy more durable, less toxic and products with less packaging. Also, buy only what you need and use what you buy.\n- Consider packaging. Buy products that use less unnecessary packaging or packaging that can be recycled. If you really like or need a certain product with excess packaging contact the manufacturer and suggest that they use less packaging or recyclable packaging.\n- Use Common Services: for example, using the library instead of buying books, or renting tools instead of buying them.\nBuy to reduce waste. Buy in bulk, buy items in recyclable packaging, and avoid disposable items. Use your own reusable canvas bag when you shop.\nMake recycling an everyday activity. Encourage everyone you know to recycle. Share with others. Before throwing away unwanted, but still good, items, check with charitable organizations. Perhaps someone in need could be helped by what might have been trash."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5a5c96df-5f94-4bde-a88f-bf4f0478a151>","<urn:uuid:e3b8ff9f-5ac4-494f-bf73-84bd99cb53fa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are different ways Washington tries to reduce transportation-related environmental impact - through urban planning versus vehicle incentives?","answer":"Washington uses two main approaches to reduce transportation's environmental impact. Through urban planning, House Bill 1099 would update the Growth Management Act to limit urban sprawl and reduce commuting needs by promoting denser development and 'closely packed' elements, which reduces infrastructure maintenance costs and greenhouse gas emissions. On the vehicle incentives side, the state offers multiple financial benefits including sales tax exemptions for clean alternative fuel vehicles (electric, hydrogen, natural gas), insurance discounts of up to 10% for hybrid vehicles and 30% for low-mileage drivers, and weight exemptions of up to 400 pounds for vehicles with idle reduction technology. These approaches work together - one through urban design and the other through individual vehicle choices - to address transportation's 45% contribution to state greenhouse gases.","context":["EVERETT — Climate change is the second-most-common problem that state Rep. Davina Duerr hears about from her constituents.\nTheir No. 1 concern? Transportation, which in Washington contributes nearly 45% of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change.\nThose woes inspired the Bothell Democrat to co-sponsor House Bill 1099, which would update Washington’s Growth Management Act (GMA). The 30-year-old law was designed to limit growth beyond city boundaries. Among other significant changes, the bill would require that the 10 largest counties plan for climate change by reducing greenhouse gases and vehicle miles traveled, and that all counties prepare for climate impacts such as increased fires and floods.\nDuerr’s 1st District is bisected by I-405, which can be a commuter’s nightmare. Mountlake Terrace, Brier, Bothell and Kirkland are on the west; much of unincorporated Snohomish County lies to the east. Policies that reduce the need to commute not only cut greenhouse gases, Duerr said, they save tax money spent on roads, sewers and stormwater systems.\n“It helps if those elements are closely packed,” she said. “The more we sprawl, the more there is to maintain.”\nHB 1099 is one of many bills related to growth management and zoning that the Legislature is considering. It now goes to the Senate, after being approved by the House of Representatives on a party-line vote of 56 to 41. The legislation has been referred to the Senate Housing & Local Government committee.\nRepublicans testified that it wasn’t the right tool to address climate change, or they doubted the climate is changing, or they feared it would worsen the housing crisis.\n“This is a terrible bill,” said Rep. Robert Sutherland, of Granite Falls, adding that it would exacerbate big-city problems such as “gangs, addicts, squalor and tent cities.” Rep. Cyndy Jacobsen said the bill would put “one more layer of complication” on local governments such as Puyallup, where she serves on the City Council.\nIn a Feb. 16 hearing, city and county associations also raised concerns about the cost of new mandates. Their lobbying worked, and the bill now includes assurance that they need not meet Growth Management Act requirements without state support. Construction, business and real estate industry representatives objected to potential new limits on building sites. And environmental groups gave the bill full-throated approval.\nNo group is more eager to see the proposed changes than nonprofit Futurewise, which focuses on land use. Its Washington Can’t Wait campaign puts it this way:\n“This year, the Central Puget Sound counties — King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Kitsap — kick off their next comprehensive planning updates, which lock in plans for the next 8 years. If we don’t pass HB 1099 this year, we will lose another decade to plan for a climate-resilient future. The science couldn’t be clearer: that’s a decade we can’t afford to waste.”\nIf the bill becomes law, its climate change element won’t impact Snohomish County planning. That’s because climate change is already part of the planning process here, said Lisa Dulude, county energy and sustainability manager.\n“At least in my reading of the bill, we’re doing and planning to do what it’s proposing,” she said. “We’ll definitely have all of the elements … adaptation and mitigation, interim targets, transportation and clean fuels.”\nThe bill mandates the creation of model climate change ordinances for local governments that don’t yet have them, and that’s where Dulude foresees statewide impact. The ordinances are essentially templates, created by the state Department of Commerce, which cities and counties could adopt or use as a starting point for writing their own. Commerce would get the lion’s share of state agency money called for by the bill — $8.2 million over six years.\nTom Campbell, chairperson of the volunteer Snohomish County Climate Action Advisory Committee, helped write the original Growth Management Act when he was chief policy advisor to the speaker of the state House. Back then, he said, climate change wasn’t discussed much. Transportation was.\nCampbell wants Snohomish County to move ahead with climate-friendly regulations, in parallel if not ahead of updated state law.\n“If the comprehensive plan element (of the legislation) is adopted, the Department of Commerce is charged with coming up with model ordinances and guidelines to go along with it — and they take forever,” said Campbell, who once served as a deputy director in that department.\nHB 1099 would give the state Department of Ecology regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions, Campbell noted.\n“That’s a bit different — so far, there has been local control, not so many state standards,” he said. “This has always been a tension in growth management planning: What is the state’s role? One can argue that climate change is a new ballgame, that we have to do better at it. It’s an emergency.”\nCampbell developed Clearwater Commons, the sustainable subdivision where he lives. He said homebuilders generally agree that denser, multi-family housing fills a need. “Their concern is a lack of buildable areas. It’s easier to push out an urban growth boundary than to do in-fill,” he said. “Here in Snohomish County, we have a Southwest urban growth area where people want to push low-density sprawl.”\nBryce Yadon, government representative for Futurewise, said there are enough parcels within current urban growth boundaries to meet the demand for housing. More rowhouses and duplexes will drive down housing costs, he said, though he acknowledged that the “further-out, single-family lot” would be less available under an updated GMA.\n“Our bill isn’t restricting available lands,” he said. “We’re saying, ‘Do it in a more holistic way and give people what they want.’”\nThat’s not how the Building Industry Association of Washington sees it. Its communications director, Janelle Guthrie, said the proposed Growth Management Act changes would make it harder to find single-family housing statewide.\n“This bill severely limits rural residential development, which is already limited,” Guthrie said. “Rural communities need housing, too. People need more choices when it comes to where they can live, not less.”\nOne aspect of HB 1099 does not seem controversial. That is the requirement that local governments consider environmental justice. For example, planners should be sure that a largely minority community isn’t left out of easy access to mass transportation or affordable housing.\nThe 31-page bill also includes a reference to sea level rise in the Shoreline Management Act — which is older than, but incorporated into, the Growth Management Act. And it replaces references to “bicyclists and pedestrians” with “active transportation,” a broad category that includes wheelchairs, scooters and skateboards. In other words, an updated GMA would require planners to consider not just mass transit and roads, but sidewalks, too.","Green Driver State Incentives in Washington\nWashington entices locals to go green with numerous money-saving green driver incentives. These eco-friendly perks include emissions test exemptions for electric vehicles, hybrids, and other fuel-efficient vehicles, state and federal tax incentives, auto insurance discounts, and more.\nThese incentives and related green vehicle laws are subject to change. Refer to the content below, your local Washington Department of Licensing branch , and the government's Alternative Fuels Data Center to keep pace with the latest.\nOn January 2, 2020, the state of Washington ended its requirement for vehicle emissions inspections prior to registration and/or renewal. The clean air program begun in 1982 had a projected end date of 2020—as the state has confirmed a significant improvement in air quality, the program is no longer needed.\nFor more information, head over to the Washington Department of Ecology's announcement.\nWA Auto Insurance Discounts for Eco-Friendly Driving and Green Vehicles\nYou might be eligible for an auto insurance discount if your Washington car insurance company rewards green driving habits and/or driving a fuel-efficient vehicle. Consult your auto insurance provider about potential green vehicle discounts such as:\n- Hybrid auto discounts.\n- Alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) discounts.\n- Economy car discounts.\n- Low-mileage discounts.\n- Pay as you drive discounts.\nAuto insurance discounts vary by provider and circumstances. For example, you might receive a 10% discount on car insurance for owning or leasing a hybrid car, while maintaining low mileage can earn you up to a 30% auto insurance discount.\nIf your current Washington auto insurance carrier doesn't offer such insurance rate discounts, find one that does. Compare auto insurance rates online and save some green for going green.\nState and Federal Tax Incentives\nWashington taxpayers can save even more with tax incentives offered by the State and federal government. Read on for specifics.\nNew and Used Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Tax Exemptions\nWashington exempts the following new and used-and-converted vehicles that run on clean alternative fuels from state motor vehicle sales use taxes:\n- Passenger cars.\n- Light-duty trucks.\n- Medium-duty passenger vehicles.\nFor the purpose of these tax exemptions, clean alternative fuel means electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, or propane when used to power a motor vehicle that both:\n- Meet California motor vehicle emissions standards (Title 13 of the CA Code of Regulations).\n- Comply with Washington Department of Ecology rules.\nNote that you can only take advantage of these sales and use tax exemptions. For more, refer to the Revised Code of Washington (82.08.809).\nWashington Natural Gas Tax Exemptions\nWashington exempts new passenger cars, light duty trucks, and medium duty passenger vehicles using compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the following taxes if the vehicle was purchased for $35,000 or less:\nAlso note that natural gas distribution businesses can take advantage of a tax exemption for machinery and equipment used to produce CNG and LNG for transportation fuel.\nFederal Tax Credits for Fuel-Efficient Vehicle Owners\nFederal tax credits offer new fuel-efficient car buyers yet another reason to switch to eco-friendly vehicles.

Specifically, if this equipment is designed to cut back on fuel usage and engine-idling emissions, Washington exempts up to 400 pounds in total gross, axle, tandem, or bridge formula weight.\nTo take advantage of the weight exemption, you (as the operator) must be able to prove:\n- The weight of your idle reduction technology (by written certification),\n- That your idle reduction technology is fully functional at all times (either by demonstration or certification).\nFor further details, refer to Washington Administrative Code (468-38-073)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:600c4bc8-93f3-471a-836a-89c682515712>","<urn:uuid:0e110a31-aeb0-49b3-be0b-631979531067>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences in how 'to be' functions in Greek versus English grammatical systems?","answer":"In Greek, 'to be' (είμαι) is considered the easiest irregular verb and follows a specific conjugation pattern (e.g., είμαι, είσαι, είναι). In English, 'to be' is more complex, functioning primarily as a Non-Continuous verb for stating facts (e.g., 'Joe is American') but can also act as a Normal verb when describing temporary behavior (e.g., 'Joe is being very American').","context":["Most of us have found ourselves in a place where we have the sudden urge to learn how to correctly pronounce that word or sing along to that otherwise completely incomprehensible song. So, we want to learn that language. We search the internet for apps, videos, e-books, and other resources. And thus begins our epic learning journey.\nIndeed, it is all fun and games, until you reach the moment of truth: grammar. A new world opens up before you: tenses, conjugations, suffixes, irregular verbs, auxiliary verbs, you name it. It may seem daunting at first glance – and we totally understand why – but that is no reason to give up hope.\nThe Logic Behind Conjugation: How Does It Work in Greek\nBefore we get started with our Greek conjugation practice tips, let’s first define conjugation and how it works in Modern Greek.\nLet’s not be intimidated by the word “conjugation” itself. It is, in fact, a common practice even in English. Conjugation depicts all of the modifications that can occur to a verb in order to describe changes based on:\nThe conjugation groups are formed as a result of these changes. Each language may have one or more of these groups. The Greek conjugation groups are actually two, and fairly easy to master.\n- Εγώ έχω έναν σκύλο. (I have a dog.)\n- Αυτή έχει μια γάτα. (She has a cat.)\nThe verbs in the example above are conjugated based on all five of the aforementioned characteristics. Both verbs exhibit the following characteristics: indicative mood, active voice, present tense, and singular number. However, without the distinction in the suffices “-ω” and “-ει”, we cannot understand the person of the verb.\nNow, let’s dive deeper into the details of Greek conjugation.\nGreek Verb Paradigm: First Steps Towards Mastering Greek Verb Conjugation\nGreek grammar is not as difficult as you might believe. Nonetheless, the Modern Greek language has eight tenses, two voices, and five moods. It may also appear difficult to pay attention to the number, person, different types of affixes, and auxiliary verbs. A flawless Greek conjugation practice strategy is the key to mastering all of these.\nMaster the Personal Pronouns\nMastering the personal pronoun is the first step before moving on to the most common verb conjugation groups. Before you can learn the inflections for person and number, you must first learn how to express them. For the personal pronoun, see this Greek conjugation chart:\n|1st Person Singular||εγώ||/e’γο/||I|\n|2nd Person Singular||εσύ||/e’si/||you (sing.)|\n|3rd Person Singular||αυτός / αυτή / αυτό||/a’ftos/, /a’fti/, /a’fto/||he / she / it|\n|1st Person Plural||εμείς||/e’mis/||we|\n|2nd Person Plural||εσείς||/e’sis/||you (pl.)|\n|3rd Person Plural||αυτοί / αυτές / αυτά||/a’fti/, /a’ftes/, /a’fta/||they (male / female / neutral)|\nNote: if you need help with the International Phonetic Alphabet for Greek, check out this site.\nCover the Basics: to be (είμαι), to have (έχω)\nBefore learning any other Greek verbs, start with the fundamentals: the verbs to have and to be in Greek. The verb to have in Greek also doubles as an auxiliary verb, making it a crucial verb for the perfect tenses. The verb to be, on the other hand, is the most common – and easiest – irregular verb on the list.\nCheck out this conjugation chart for the verb “είμαι”:\n|Είμαι (Present Tense)||To Be (Present Tense)|\n|Εγώ είμαι||I am|\n|Εσύ είσαι||You are|\n|Αυτός/Αυτή/Αυτό είναι||He/She/It is|\n|Εμείς είμαστε||We are|\n|Εσείς είστε||You are|\n|Αυτοί/Αυτές/Αυτά είναι||They are|\nOn the other hand, the verb “έχω” (to have) is commonly conjugated according to the rules of Conjugation Group A.\n|Έχω (Present Tense)||To Have (Present Tense)|\n|Εγώ έχω||I have|\n|Εσύ έχεις||You have|\n|Αυτός/Αυτή/Αυτό έχει||He/She/It has|\n|Εμείς έχουμε||We have|\n|Εσείς έχετε||You have|\n|Αυτοί/Αυτές/Αυτά έχουν(ε)||They have|\nAs you can see, each verb type in Greek changes depending on the subject. It may appear difficult at first, but by following a few rules and learning the common inflections, it will become second nature!\nHave a Look Ahead: Greek Grammar Basics (Moods, Tenses, Voices)\nAnother piece of information to keep in mind is the different categories that affect each verb form. It is critical to understand the various moods, tenses, and voices in Greek. It will also help you a lot with your Greek conjugation practice.\nThere are only two (2) grammatical voices in Greek verbs (without delving further into linguistic semantics):\n- Active Voice (Ενεργητική Φωνή)\n- Passive Voice (Παθητική Φωνή)\nFurthermore, Greek has a total of three (3) moods or five (5) moods, if we include the participle and the infinitive. Namely:\n- Indicative (Οριστική Έγκλιση)\n- Subjunctive (Υποτακτική Έγκλιση)\n- Imperative (Προστακτική Έγκλιση)\n- Participle (Μετοχή)\n- Infinitive (Απαρέμφατο)\nFinally, Greek has a total of eight (8) tenses. The Greek tenses are the following:\n|Past Tenses||Παρατατικός||Past Continuous|\n|Future Tenses||Στιγμιαίος Μέλλοντας||Future Simple|\n|Εξακολουθητικός Μέλλοντας||Future Continuous|\n|Perfect Tenses||Παρακείμενος||Present Perfect|\n|Συντελεσμένος Μέλλοντας||Future Perfect|\nThese may appear to be a lot, but we promise you’ll get the hang of it quickly!\nTip: You can find a comprehensive guide to Greek Verb Conjugations here.\nLearn the Suffixes: Verb Conjugation Groups\nAfter you’ve mastered the fundamentals of Greek grammar, you should move on to the most crucial aspect of conjugation: Greek morphological inflections.\nThere are two (2) conjugation groups in modern Greek (excluding the irregular verbs). There is a fairly easy rule of thumb for splitting the verbs into these categories. You should ask yourself: “Is the final letter in the active voice accentuated?”. If the answer is no, you have yourself a Group A verb; if it is yes, you should check Group B.\nLet’s review the Greek present active indicative suffixes from the two groups.\nConjugation Group A\n|Active Voice||Passive Voice|\nConjugation Group B\nThe conjugation group B is further split into two classes.\n|Active Voice||Passive Voice|\n|-ώ / -άω||-ιέμαι|\n|-άμε / -ούμε||-ιόμαστε|\n|-άτε||-ιέστε / -ιόσαστε|\n|Active Voice||Passive Voice 1||Passive Voice 2||Passive Voice 3|\nThe second and third versions in the passive voice of the second class contain verbs derived from various Ancient Greek roots. This is nothing to be concerned about right now. Begin by learning the main suffixes, and everything else will fall into place.\nThe Struggle of Greek Irregular Verbs\nThe time for paradigm exceptions has arrived. Irregular verbs are widely despised and, I believe, misunderstood. In contrast to the strict rules of regular verbs, irregular verbs exhibit significant differences. Some of the most common Greek irregular verbs are:\n- Είμαι (/’ime/, to be)\n- Έχω (/’eχo/, to have)\n- Λέω (/’leo/, to say)\n- Πηγαίνω (/pi’jeno/, to go)\n- Βλέπω (/’vlepo/, to see)\n- Δίνω (/’δino/, to give)\n- Ακούω (/a’cuo/, to hear)\n- Τρώω (/’troo/, to eat)\n- Παίρνω (/’perno/, to take)\n- Αφήνω (/a’fino/, to let go)\n- Φεύγω (/’fevγo/, to leave)\n- Καταλαβαίνω (/katala’veno/, to understand)\n- Βγαίνω (/’vγeno/, to go out)\nIn the end, as the saying goes, practice makes perfect. You should always review and revise everything you have learned, by supplementing your Greek conjugation practice with exercises.\nYou can find a list of Greek conjugation exercises in the following sources:\nThe Best Strategy for Effective Greek Conjugation Practice\nNow that you know the basic knowledge you need to conquer, let’s take a look at how you can make your Greek conjugation practice a lot easier.\nFind Your Learning Style\nNot all people are the same. Thus, not all people learn the same way. You can have a different and unique approach to learning, depending on how you prefer to study and learn.\nFor example, if you are a visual learner, you could use videos, flashcards, or images, whereas an auditory learner should focus on podcasts and audiobooks. If you learn better by reading, pick up a grammar book or a novel and give it a try. Finally, if you are a verbal learner, find a Greek native speaker and engage in that awkward two-language conversation!\nKeep Notes or Write a Journal\nWriting is an excellent way to practice a language. You could begin by taking notes on anything new you learn during your Greek conjugation practice. This will help you remember the things that were more difficult for you.\nYou could also keep a journal. This can be a study journal in which you write what you have learned and what you intend to learn. It can also be a daily journal in which you write simple phrases about what happened that day. That is entirely up to you!\nSpeak and/or Chat\nWe understand how intimidating it can be to begin speaking a new language. However, if you can overcome your social anxiety, speaking practice is the best practice there is if you want to achieve fluency.\nSo, you can either talk to a native speaker or chat with fellow learners. Whatever you choose, the benefits are tremendous!\nMedia and Books\nDepending on your preferred learning style, media can be a valuable resource. You could, for example, watch TV shows or movies (check out this list of great cinephile Greek movies). You could also listen to podcasts and audiobooks to become acquainted with various accents and intonations.\nReading books is another excellent way to become acquainted with the language. If a novel seems too daunting, try a children’s book first. For beginners, BookBox has some cute videos of children’s stories with subtitles. If you’re feeling brave, pick a popular book, such as Lord of the Rings or an Agatha Christie story – something you are already familiar with – and test the waters. Make a list of any unknown words and use it to broaden your vocabulary.\nCheck What You Have Learned\nIt may sound meta, but knowing what you know is one of the most important aspects of language learning. When you have completed a milestone or a section of your practice, you should take a moment to reflect on what you have learned.\nTaking notes on what you have studied and going back and revising it every now and then is a good way to not forget what you have covered. Because repetition is the key to learning, you could even schedule a weekly or 15-day checkpoint to reflect on what you have perfected and what you should revise.\nGreek Conjugation Practice: Online Resources\nCooljugator is – as its name implies – a cool conjugator. It helps you to find the correct, conjugated form for over 4,500 Greek verbs. On its homepage, you can also find a list of the most common Modern Greek verbs to help you out.

{"question":"How do maternal health education approaches differ between North Carolina's provider training system and Ghana's community engagement model?","answer":"North Carolina focuses on professional healthcare provider training, specifically targeting physicians, midlevel practitioners, and nurses with education on health equity, implicit bias, and social determinants of health. Ghana's approach, through the T4MCH project, is more community-centered, offering direct education to mothers and families through mobile messaging in local languages, facility-based Knowledge Sharing Sessions, and community-level meetings that involve opinion leaders and family heads to address cultural myths and pregnancy-related complications.","context":["The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has received federal funding that will support a key goal of the state’s Early Childhood Action Plan and the Perinatal Health Strategic Plan, reducing maternal mortality. A total of $10 million was awarded through the State Maternal Health Innovation Program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration to address disparities in maternal health and improve maternal health outcomes, with a specific emphasis on preventing and reducing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity.\nNorth Carolina will receive $2 million each year for five years to strengthen partnerships and collaboration by establishing a state-focused Maternal Health Task Force, improving state-level data surveillance on maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, and promoting and implementing innovation in maternal health service delivery.\n\"Our mission is to improve the health and well-being of our people, which means that we need strong and healthy families, mothers and children,\" said Dr. Kelly Kimple, Women’s and Children’s Health Section Chief. \"This funding allows North Carolina to bolster our perinatal care and serve those in need to improve outcomes for mothers and thereby improve the health of children, particularly among communities of color where unacceptable inequities persist.\"\nDHHS will work collaboratively with stakeholders, health systems, providers, prepaid health plans, individuals with lived experiences and community-based programs to improve the state’s perinatal system of care and improve maternal health outcomes.\nThis will be achieved through various partnerships, state plans and initiatives, including:\n- Convening a Maternal Health Task Force to guide the work and develop a Maternal Health Strategic Plan — an extension of the work of DHHS’s Perinatal Systems of Care Task Force and aligned with the state’s broader Perinatal Health Strategic Plan and Early Childhood Action Plan.\n- Focusing on provider training for physicians, midlevel practitioners, nurses and others related to health equity, implicit bias and social determinants of health along with training students from diverse backgrounds on maternal health issues inclusive of health equity, implicit bias and social determinants of health.\n- Partnering with the NC OBGYN Society, NC Academy of Family Physicians and NC Affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives to recruit and implement a team champion model with obstetricians, family physicians and masters-prepared nurses to identify evidence-based guidelines, educate practices and provide mentoring within their assigned Perinatal Care Region.\n- Partnering with the Office of Rural Health to provide telehealth services to increase access to specialty care services within rural and underserved communities.\n- Partnering with MomsRising and the NC Healthy Start sites to engage individuals with lived experiences within the Maternal Health Task Force and all components of the North Carolina Maternal Health Innovation Program.\nNorth Carolina is one of nine states receiving funding from HHS to improve maternal health outcomes across the country.

Heartbreaks, loss of hope, frustrations and sorrow are just a few of the pain a mother goes through each time she loses a child. A baby’s smile melts the heart and calms the soul of a mother which is the greatest wish of every woman. When a mother holds her newborn baby and looks at that precious smiling face, it feels like all her worries just float away. Unfortunately, at the mercy of some cultural practices and lack of information, some mothers lose their lives and/or that of their babies through child birth after 9 months of sleeplessness. The effect of a mother’s death results in vulnerability of the infants who are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.\nA study published in the Lancet which covered the period from 1990 to 2013 indicates that, the most common causes of maternal deaths are postpartum bleeding(15%), complications from unsafe abortion (15%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (10%), postpartum infections (8%), and obstructed labor (6%). Other causes include blood clots (3%) and pre-existing conditions (28%).\nAccording to UNFPA, four elements are essential to maternal death prevention. Prenatal care is recommended for expectant mothers to receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and fetus. In addition, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses, and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Also, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertension disorders and obstructed labor, and postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery.\nMost of the causes of maternal and child mortalities are preventable but due to the lack of information many are left at the mercy of some religious beliefs and cultural practices which has a negative impact on the lives of pregnant women. Savana Signatures, a non-profit organization in Ghana is implementing the Technology for Maternal and Child Health (T4MCH) project. This project has an ultimate goal of contributing to the reduction of maternal and child mortalities in Ghana.\nThe Mobile messaging and Knowledge Sharing Session (KSS) strategy used by Savana Signatures’ T4MCH project addresses the four main elements recommended by UNFPA. Literate mothers and their partners have the option of registering for weekly SMS reminders whiles non-literates also have the option of registering for the voice messaging with their preferred language. At the moment, the project offers messaging in eleven (11) Ghanaian languages. The couple is registered based on gestation period and monitored until birth and 6 months after to realize the satisfaction of a healthy mother and a smiling baby. It is fulfilling saving the life of a mother by a simple call to remind her of the importance of taking her routine medication prescribed by her health provider, when to go for her next ANC visit, nutrition, danger signs in pregnancy, signs of labor and the need for her to seek medical care where necessary.\nMale involvement is very necessary during the pregnancy and after delivery stages. Men are encouraged to enroll on the mobile messaging platform in order to have firsthand information on the need and benefits of supporting their wives throughout child bearing. Some cultural practices prevent women from attending early ANC which is the most delicate stage of pregnancy. Men are the decision makers in most homes of rural communities, thus the Knowledge Sharing Sessions (KSS), an innovative add-on to existing health talks makes use of ICTs to design, package, and communicate maternal and child health information to pregnant and new mothers, partners and relatives at the health facility and community level. These sessions are in two folds, the facility KSS and the community KSS.\nThe facility KSS is carried out at the health facility for pregnant women, new mothers, partners and relatives who are visiting the health facility for ANC and PNC. The community KSS is held at the community level and brings together opinion leaders, family heads, and decision makers to encourage them to discuss MCH issues and to disabuse their minds on some of the myths about pregnancy and its related complications. This allows dialogue between health workers and community members.\nThe journey towards the reduction of maternal and child mortalities is a collective role. “I never knew how much love my heart could hold until someone called me Mom”.

{"question":"What are the financial implications of trailer ownership versus rental, and how does this compare to potential cyber liability costs?","answer":"The financial implications of trailer ownership include high upfront costs, ongoing maintenance fees, and insurance premiums, while renting offers more flexibility but may be more expensive long-term. When considering these costs, they should be weighed against potential cyber liability expenses. Third-party liability claims can be substantial - for example, a trademark infringement case could cost $700,000, while data loss incidents could reach $1.8 million. Additional cyber-related expenses include privacy notification costs ($30 per person), forensic investigation costs, crisis management expenses, and e-business interruption costs.","context":["How to Choose the Right Trailer Option for Your Trucking Business\nConsider the Type of Cargo You Transport\nOne of the most important factors when choosing a trailer option is the type of cargo you transport. For example, if you transport perishable goods such as fruit or vegetables, you may need a refrigerated trailer to keep your cargo fresh. Conversely, if you transport heavy construction materials, you’ll require a strong flatbed or drop-deck trailer that can handle the weight.\nOther cargo variables to consider include the size, shape, weight, and loading and unloading requirements. Understanding the specific needs of your cargo will help you select the right trailer option for your trucking business. Gain additional knowledge about the topic in this external source we’ve compiled for you. https://www.freightgirlz.com!\nAssess Your Budget\nAnother critical factor to consider when deciding on a trailer option is your business budget. You’ll need to evaluate how much you’re willing and able to spend on maintenance, fuel, trailer insurance, and insurance coverage for the goods you transport.\nIf you’re just starting your trucking business, you may want to consider used trailers instead of new ones. Used trailers tend to be more cost-effective and require less upfront investment. However, be sure to inspect the trailer thoroughly and hire a certified mechanic to assess its roadworthiness before purchasing.\nChoose the Right Trailer Size and Style\nTrailer size and style choice will depend on the volume and weight of your cargo, as well as the types of roads and terrain you will travel on. Trailers come in various lengths, widths, and heights, with different hitch types, tandem-axle options, and side-panel configurations. Your choice will depend on the nature of your cargo and the trucking routes you regularly take.\nWhen selecting the trailer size and style, it’s important to factor in loading and unloading easier. You don’t want to buy a trailer that’s too high to load quickly and effectively or too narrow to drive safely and confidently. As such, ensure you measure the height of loading docks, shipping containers, and entrances of loading yards before making the trailer purchase.\nLook for Quality and Durability\nIt’s vital to consider the durability and quality of any trailer option you’re considering. You need a trailer that can handle the rigors of the road and protect your cargo from external hazards like water, rust, and dust. Trailers that are made of high-grade steel and aluminum tend to be more durable than those made of low-quality materials. Also, consider trailers that have particularly strong bars and hitches.\nIf possible, check whether the trailer manufacturer offers any warranties or certifications that prove their trailers meet safety and performance standards. Look for options that offer extended warranties, as this signifies that the manufacturer backs their trailer’s durability and quality.\nChoose between Buying or Renting Trailers\nFinally, you’ll need to decide whether you’ll purchase or rent your trailer options. Both options come with their respective pros and cons, so it’s essential to consider both before making a final decision.\nIf you opt to purchase your trailers, you’ll have more control over your assets, which is valuable if you plan to operate your business for the long term. You’ll also retain the authority to modify and customize the trailers to fit your unique business requirements. However, purchasing trailers can come with high upfront costs, maintenance fees, and insurance premiums.\nIf you decide to rent trailers, you’ll have more flexibility in terms of scheduling, routes, and types of trailers available for transport. You’ll also avoid paying upfront costs, maintenance fees, and insurance premiums. However, rental options may be more expensive in the long run, and you may have to adjust your business model to accommodate rental scheduling and inventory availability.

{"question":"How does the concept of Guru in Vyasa-puja compare with the divine intellect's role in spiritual understanding?","answer":"The Guru and divine intellect serve complementary roles in spiritual understanding. According to the teachings on Vyasa-puja, the Guru is an incarnation of the divine who facilitates direct service to Radha-Krishna through complete surrender, and without sincere service to the Guru, one cannot attain bhakti even with millions of efforts. Meanwhile, the divine intellect is described as the pure essence and sole true entity, which contains all existence within itself. Both concepts emphasize that true spiritual realization comes through transcending individual ego - in one case through surrender to the Guru, and in the other through recognition that individual existence is simply a form of the universal divine intelligence.","context":["Special On-line Edition for the Appearance Day of\nSri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja\nśrī śrī guru gaurāṅga jayataḥ!\nYear-1 Special On-line Edition\nPosted: 26 January 2009\nnitya-līlā praviṣṭa oṁ viṣṇupāda\nŚrī Śrīmad Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja\nInspired by and under the guidance of\nŚrī Śrīmad Bhaktivedānta Nārāyaṇa Gosvāmī Mahārāja\nThe True Meaning of Sri Vyasa-puja\nby Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja\nSpoken on the eve of Sri Guru-purnima\nand the Disappearance day of Srila Sanatana Gosvami\nin Sri Kesavaji Gaudiya Matha, Mathura, 16 July 2008\nTranslated into English for the first time\nSrila Vyasadeva, who is the incarnation of Lord Narayana, was born on the full moon day of the month of Asadha. In India, everyone worships their spiritual master on this day, which is celebrated with great honour and reverence as Sri Vyasa-puja, or Sri Guru-puja. It is essential, however, that we understand the true significance of Sri Vyasa-puja. Merely placing a garland on the neck of Sri Guru or offering at his feet a few flowers and fruits, some money, sweets, or cloth does not mean that real worship of the guru has been performed. The real Vyasa-puja is to surrender oneself completely at the lotus feet of Srila Gurudeva and to fulfil his desires.\nThis means that one should completely offer oneís independence at the lotus feet of Sri Guru in a mood of surrender: ìO Srila Gurudeva, I am offering everything that belongs to me at your lotus feet.î At the time of His initiation from Sri Isvarapuri-pada, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:\nei ami deha samarpilama tomare\nkrsnapadapadmera amrtarasa pana\namare karao tumi ñ ei cahi dana\nSri Caitanya-bhagavata (Adi-khanda 17.54ñ55)\nO Gurudeva, I have surrendered My body and everything that is Mine at your lotus feet. I shall follow your every instruction. My only wish is to receive your merciful benediction by which you kindly make Me drink the transcendental nectar of Sri Krsnaís lotus feet.\nIf a person can selflessly surrender in this way, it does not matter whether or not he worships his gurudeva with flowers and so forth, for such worship is just a symbolic act meant to instruct the common people. Real guru-puja cannot be performed until the mood of selfless surrender at the lotus feet of Sri Guru appears in oneís heart. Srila Sanatana Gosvami relinquished not only his home but also his post as prime minister, his abundant opulence, his servants and so on, specifically so he could fulfil the desire of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He approached Sriman Mahaprabhu empty-handed, and feeling, ìNow I am Yours,î he completely surrendered himself to Him. This alone is real Vyasa-puja.\nWhat is truly the most desired goal in the world? It is service unto the lotus feet of the divine couple, Sri Sri Radha-Krsna. Serving their lotus feet is undoubtedly our only purpose in life. Although it is extremely rare to achieve this, if one secures the shelter of the lotus feet of a genuine guru, this otherwise almost unattainable goal can be attained. In other words, if we surrender unto the lotus feet of the bona fide guru and practise serving the divine couple according to his teachings, instructions etc, we can attain the transcendental loving service of Sri Sri Radha-Krsna, very soon.\nAlthough Sri Krsna Himself is the origin of bhakti, Sri Guru is His incarnation, or manifestation. Therefore, unless a person sincerely and selflessly serves Sri Guru he will not attain bhakti even if he makes millions of endeavours and even if Bhagavan Himself bestows mercy upon him. It should be understood that Sri Guru is non-different from Bhagavan:\nyasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau\ntasyaite kathita hy arthah prakasante mahatmanah\nSvetasvatara Upanisad (6.23)\nThe true import of the scriptures (srutis) is revealed in the hearts of those great souls who have equally the same unflinching bhakti for their guru and the Supreme Lord.\nThe people of Bharatvarsa (India) are indebted to Srila Vyasadeva. Srila Vyasadeva first divided the Vedas and thereafter compiled their essence in Vedanta-sutra. After that he manifested the Puranas and the Mahabharata, yet his heart still remained dissatisfied. Later, in Sri Bhagavat Purana (Srimad-Bhagavatam), by the mercy of Sri Narada Muni, he described the pastimes of Sri Krsna and narrated them to Sri Sukadeva Gosvami. Srila Sukadeva Gosvamiís worship of Srila Vyasadeva, his father and spiritual master, was the first Vyasa-puja. Sri Sukadeva Gosvami was later worshipped by Srila Suta Gosvami. This was the second Vyasa-puja. In this way, the tradition of Vyasa-puja began. Therefore, Vyasa-puja, or guru-puja, has been practised since ancient times. Worship of the guru is performed even before the worship, or puja, of Sri Krsna.\nOur great fortune is that we are coming in that very parampara, or succession of bona fide gurus, that is comprised of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself, Sri Svarupa Damodara, Sri Ramananda Raya, Srila Rupa Gosvami, Srila Sanatana Gosvami, Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, Srila Narottama Thakura, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, Srila Jagannatha Dasa Babaji Maharaja, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, Srila Prabhupada and my gurudeva (Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja) and his god-brothers. Only in this succession of bona fide gurus is the conception of service to Sri Sri Radha Krsna, especially as a maidservant of Srimati Radhika, acknowledged as the topmost goal.\nThe son of Saci-devi, Gaurahari Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is none other than Sri Krsna but with the mood and complexion of Sri Radha, appeared in this world to bestow this most auspicious gift. Sriman Mahaprabhu Himself did not preach this doctrine but inspired it in the heart of Srila Rupa Gosvami and manifested it in this world through him. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhuís gift ñ service to the divine couple, Sri Sri Radha-Krsna, in pursuance of the moods of Sri Rupa Manjari ñ is solely what He came to give. Although we are so fortunate to be in this parampara, to truly imbibe the concepts of Srila Rupa Gosvami requires sincere and honest effort.\nMany people who come forward to perform sadhana-bhajana, to lead a life of devotional service, become trapped by the illusory potency of the Lord and become attached to maya in her feature as a woman. In this way they entrench their life in misery. We should be ever alert to this. The Gaudiya Matha is not an establishment intended to facilitate this. What is the purpose of the Gaudiya Matha? It is to sincerely and purely follow the teachings of Srila Rupa Gosvami. The Gaudiya Mathaís very existence is based on one objective alone: to follow the instructions of Sriman Mahaprabhu and Sri Rupa Gosvami by becoming acquainted with their teachings and performing bhajana accordingly.\nOne who leads such a life by remaining under the shelter of a genuine guru actually performs Vyasa-puja. Such conduct alone signifies fitting worship of Srila Rupa Gosvami and our entire guru-parampara. If one wishes to perform sadhana-bhajana by following such rules and regulations then one may stay in the matha, but there is no place in the matha for those nurturing worldly (asat) propensities.\nYou all should clearly understand that the matha is not a place for arranging and celebrating marriages. If one wants to practise bhajana in its purest form, then one should reside in the matha and serve Sri Guru and the Vaisnavas, even though one may receive chastisement from them. Sri Naradaís curse upon Nalakuvara and Manigriva proved to be extremely beneficial for them. In the same manner, the chastisement of Sri Guru and Vaisnavas is also highly auspicious. If a person tolerates their chastisement and continues to reside in the matha, then he alone can truly understand their mercy.\nThis Asadhi-purnima also celebrates the disappearance day of Srila Sanatana Gosvami. For us, Srila Sanatana Gosvami is like an incarnation of Sri Vyasadeva because he has written a commentary on Srimad-Bhagavatam and has manifested the great gem-like scripture, Sri Brhad-bhagavatamrta. Sri Brhad-bhagavatamrta alone is the main foundation of all the scriptures written by Srila Rupa Gosvami, Srila Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami and so on. In other words, all the other books of our Gosvamis manifested from this one book alone.\nThat is why Srila Sanatana Gosvami is even the guru of Srila Rupa Gosvami. On the other hand, Srila Sanatana Gosvami has accepted Srila Rupa Gosvami as his guru. Such are the considerations of guru-tattva. If someone feels proud, thinking, ìI have become guru,î then he is not a guru at all. A guru never makes disciples; rather, he transforms others into guru*. One who is a real guru does not even try to become a guru.\n*The Sanskrit word guru (spiritual master) literally conveys ìweighty with significanceî.\nbharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara\njanma sarthaka karií kara para-upakara\nSri Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi-lila 9.41)\nOne who has taken his birth as a human being in the holy land of India (Bharata-varsa) should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people. In other words, he should himself perform the sadhana of suddha-bhakti by accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Guru and inspire others to do the same. This alone is the highest form of benevolence.\nAll of the sadhakas, or practitioners of bhakti, coming in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu should first become acquainted with the teachings of Srila Rupa Gosvami and the principles of guru-parampara, and then they should preach to others. It is necessary to both practise and preach. And for this end, the effort of all brahmacaris and sannyasis will need to be at least a thousand times greater than the effort a householder makes to maintain his home. Throughout the day, not even a single moment can be spent making any other endeavour. One will have to engage his mind full time in the service of Sri Krsna.\nIt is necessary that one understand Srila Rupa Gosvamiís special contribution to our sampradaya and why Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared in this world. In essence, it was to specify our lifeís highest and most prominent goal: to become a particle of dust at the lotus feet of Srila Rupa Gosvami, to become a maidservant of Srimati Radhika under the guidance of Srila Rupa Manjari. This is the sole cherished aspiration for all our previous guruvarga.\nMay you all be blessed with this conception in your heart and may your life thus become successful. All those who have left their homes to perform devotional service or those who are performing it at home should perform Vyasa-puja after having become acquainted with these teachings and principles. In this way, one should try to please Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Gurudeva, and under their guidance try to please Sri Krsna, or Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is the original Vyasa. This alone is the true meaning of Vyasa-puja.\nTranslated by the Rays of The Harmonist team","by Vihari-Lala Mitra | 1891 | 1,121,132 words | ISBN-10: 8171101519\nThe English translation of the Yoga-vasistha: a Hindu philosophical and spiritual text written by sage Valmiki from an Advaita-vedanta perspective.

Know that nothing is produced from, nor destroyed by the ever tranquil spirit of God at any time; but everything appears as the panorama of the one all (topan) God; like the various kinds of ornaments made of the same metal of gold.\n2. Brahma remains forever in his own essence, and never becomes the seed or cause of any other thing; he is ever of the form of our innate conception of him, and therefore never becomes any other than our simple idea of him.\n3. I grant, Oh sagely monitor, that there subsists no separate world nor any other egoism in the one pure Siva (Zeus or Jove), except his own essence of omniscience; but please to tell me, what thing is this world and individual egoisms that seem to be infinite in number, and appear as distinct creations of God?\n4. The essence of God is without its beginning and end, and extends to infinite space and time.\n5. The same also is this transparent cosmos, and the very same is the body of this world; which is simple and of the form of divine intelligence, and neither a void nor any extraneous thing.\n6. The essential property of God being his intelligence, he is said to be of essence of intellect; and as fluidity is the property of water, so is intelligence the essential property of everything; and there is no reason to suppose an unintelligent principle as the prime cause of all.\n7. The Lord is infinite in himself and is so situated in his infinitude for ever, without the grossness of the infinitesimals ever attaching to their pure intelligence in the subjective soul.\n8. We cannot attribute the creation of the impure world, to the pure essence of the divine spirit; because the purity of the divine soul, cannot admit the impurity of creation, which would amount to a duality of purity and impurity in the supreme soul: (which is altogether absurd to believe).\n9. The Lord can never be supposed as the seed or cause of the universe, since his nature is inscrutable and beyond our conception, and cannot be thought of as the root of anything whatever.\n10. Therefore there is no creation or production of an effect, without its cause or seed; nor does reason point out to us, any other source of creation.\n11. Therefore there is no gross creation whatsoever, except of the form of the intellect itself; and hence all that is visible to us, is no other than the solid intellect itself.\n12. The feeling of egoism and the term world, are meaningless words and mere inventions of men; because nothing whatever can be called an effect or product, which has no cause assigned to it.\n13. The duality of the world appears in the unity of God, in the same manner as a flower called the sky flower appears in the hollow vacuum of the sky (by mere delusion). And all things being perishable in their nature, exist only in the intellect in which they live and die. (If the world be of the solid intellect, then the very intellect becomes the cause of the same, by means of the solidification of its own substance;but it is not so, because it is impossible for the same thing to be both the cause and effect of something by itself).\n14. Destruction is not the giver of life to destruction, nor is it a giver of life to perishable things; hence intellect is the giver of light to all: but you may call whatever you like the best.\n15. What difficulty you have, provided all things are to be called one, when all have come from the intellect; the duality what you call, that is the mystery of intellect-chit only.\n16. The intellect therefore is the only true entity, which admits no unity nor duality in it. And therefore, O prince, you must know the nullity of all other entities beside it.\n17. The feeling of thy egoism, is as false as thy conception of any other thing; and thus the idea of egoism proving to be false, what else can there be except the only entity of the intellect.\n18. Thus egoism (being) no other than a form of the intellect, there is no difference whatever between them; hence the words I, thou &c. are mere human inventions to distinguish one from another (when there is in reality no difference in the personality of any body).\n19. Whether you remain in your embodied or disembodied state, continue to remain always as firm as a rock; by knowing yourself only as the pure intellect, and the nullity of all things besides.\n20. By thinking yourself always as the intellect, you will lose the sense of your egoism and personality; and so will your reflection on the contexts of the texts of the vedas, lead you to the same conclusion. (There are numerous texts to the effect that God is the only entity, and this all is naught but God).\n21. From all these know thyself as the pure essence, which is uncaused and unmade, and the same with the first and original principle; that thou art same with the emancipate and everlasting Brahma, and multiform in thy unity; that thou art as void as vacuity, having neither thy beginning, middle or end; and that this world is the intellect and that intellect is the very Brahma himself."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e97a345b-9df3-4104-a11e-65841ae0412d>","<urn:uuid:126b1c95-1570-467a-8ba2-fb7e5b4e871c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the classification systems of igneous rocks compare to those of metamorphic rocks in terms of their defining characteristics?","answer":"Igneous rocks are primarily classified based on their formation process into two main types: intrusive (forming below surface) and extrusive (forming on surface), with cooling rate determining crystal size. In contrast, metamorphic rocks are classified by both texture and chemical/mineral assemblage, being divided into foliated (layered) and non-foliated types. While igneous rocks' characteristics are determined by their cooling conditions, metamorphic rocks' properties are shaped by the transformation of existing rocks under heat (>150-200°C) and pressure (around 1500 bars), leading to profound physical and chemical changes.","context":["metamorphic rockArticle Free Pass\n- Metamorphic variables\n- Metamorphic reactions\n- Textural features\n- Structural features\n- Metamorphic facies\n- Origin of metamorphic rocks: types of metamorphism\n- Hydrothermal metamorphism\n- Dynamic metamorphism\n- Contact metamorphism\n- Regional metamorphism\n- Distribution of metamorphic rocks\n- Classification of metamorphic rocks\nThermodynamics of metamorphic assemblages\nDespite the large number of minerals listed in the Table for each of the four bulk compositions, the actual number of minerals present in an individual metamorphic rock is limited by the laws of thermodynamics. The number of mineral phases that can coexist stably in a metamorphic rock at a particular set of pressure-temperature conditions is given by the Gibbs phase rule: number of mineral phases = number of chemical components − number of degrees of freedom + 2, where the 2 stands for the two variables of pressure and temperature. The degrees of freedom of the system are the parameters that can be independently varied without changing the mineral assemblage of the rock. For example, a rock with no degrees of freedom can only exist at a single set of pressure-temperature conditions; if either the pressure or the temperature is varied, the minerals will react with one another to change the assemblage. A rock with two degrees of freedom can undergo small changes in pressure or temperature or both without altering the assemblage. Most metamorphic rocks have mineral assemblages that reflect two or more degrees of freedom at the time the rock recrystallized. Thus, a typical pelitic rock made up of the six chemical components silica (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), ferrous oxide (FeO), magnesium oxide (MgO), potash (K2O), and water would contain no more than six minerals; the identity of those minerals would be controlled by the pressure and temperature at which recrystallization occurred. In such a rock taken from Earth’s surface, the identity of the six minerals could be used to infer the approximate depth and temperature conditions that prevailed at the time of its recrystallization. Rocks that contain more mineral phases than would be predicted by the phase rule often preserve evidence of chemical disequilibrium in the form of reactions that did not go to completion. Careful examination of such samples under the microscope can often reveal the nature of these reactions and provide useful information on how pressure and temperature conditions changed during the burial and uplift history of the rock.\nMetamorphic rocks only rarely exhibit a chemical composition that is characteristically “metamorphic.” This statement is equivalent to saying that diffusion of materials in metamorphism is a slow process, and various chemical units do not mix on any large scale. But occasionally, particularly during contact metamorphism, diffusion may occur across a boundary of chemical dissimilarity, leading to rocks of unique composition. This process is referred to as metasomatism. If a granite is emplaced into a limestone, the contact region may be flooded with silica and other components, leading to the formation of a metasomatic rock. Often such contacts are chemically zoned. A simple example is provided by the metamorphism of magnesium-rich igneous rocks in contact with quartz-rich sediments. A zonation of the type serpentine-talc-quartz may be found such as:\nIn this case the talc zone has grown by silica diffusion into the more silica-poor environment of the serpentine. Economic deposits are not uncommon in such situations—e.g., the formation of the CaWO4 (calcium tungstate) scheelite when tungstate in the form of WO3 moves from a granite into a limestone contact. The reaction can be expressed as:\nA very simple mineralogical system and its response to changing pressure and temperature provide a good illustration of what occurs in metamorphism. An uncomplicated sediment at Earth’s surface, a mixture of the clay mineral kaolinite [Al4Si4O10(OH)8] and the mineral quartz (SiO2), provides a good example. Most sediments have small crystals or grain sizes but great porosity and permeability, and the pores are filled with water. As time passes, more sediments are piled on top of the surface layer, and it becomes slowly buried. Accordingly, the pressure to which the layer is subjected increases because of the load on top, known as overburden. At the same time, the temperature will increase because of radioactive heating within the sediment and heat flow from deeper levels within the Earth.\nIn the first stages of incremental burial and heating, few chemical reactions will occur in the sediment layer, but the porosity decreases, and the low-density pore water is squeezed out. This process will be nearly complete by the time the layer is buried by five kilometres of overburden. There will be some increase in the size of crystals; small crystals with a large surface area are more soluble and less stable than large crystals, and throughout metamorphic processes there is a tendency for crystals to grow in size with time, particularly if the temperature is rising.\nEventually, when the rock is buried to a depth at which temperatures of about 300 °C obtain, a chemical reaction sets in, and the kaolinite and quartz are transformed to pyrophyllite and water:\nThe exact temperature at which this occurs depends on the fluid pressure in the system, but in general the fluid and rock-load pressures tend to be rather similar during such reactions. The water virtually fights its way out by lifting the rocks. Thus, the first chemical reaction is a dehydration reaction leading to the formation of a new hydrate. The water released is itself a solvent for silicates and promotes the crystallization of the product phases.\nIf heating and burial continue, another dehydration sets in at about 400 °C, in which the pyrophyllite is transformed to andalusite, quartz, and water:\nAfter the water has escaped, the rock becomes virtually anhydrous, containing only traces of fluid in small inclusions in the product crystals and along grain boundaries. Both of these dehydration reactions tend to be fast, because water, a good silicate solvent, is present.\nAlthough the mineral andalusite is indicated as the first product of dehydration of pyrophyllite, there are three minerals with the chemical composition Al2SiO5. Each has unique crystal structures, and each is stable under definite pressure-temperature conditions. Such differing forms with identical composition are called polymorphs. If pyrophyllite is dehydrated under high-pressure conditions, the polymorph of Al2SiO5 formed would be the mineral kyanite (the most dense polymorph). With continued heating, the original andalusite or kyanite will invert to sillimanite, the highest-temperature Al2SiO5 polymorph:\nThe kinetics of these polymorphic transformations are sufficiently sluggish, however, that kyanite or andalusite may persist well into the stability field of sillimanite.\nWhat made you want to look up metamorphic rock?","What are Rocks?\nRocks are mineral aggregates with a combination of properties of all the mineral traces. Any unique combination of chemical composition, mineralogy, grain size, texture, or other distinguishing characteristics can describe rock types. Additionally, different classification systems exist for each major type of rock. There are different types of rocks existing in nature.\nRocks which are found in nature rarely show such simple characteristics and usually exhibit some variation in the set of properties as the measurement scale changes.\nTypes of Rocks\nThere are three types of rocks:\n- Igneous Rocks\n- Sedimentary Rocks\n- Metamorphic Rocks\nIgneous rock is one of the three main rock types. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks.\nThis magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet’s mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition.\nTypes of Igneous Rock\nFollowing are the two types of igneous rock:\n- Intrusive igneous rock: These rocks crystallize below the earth’s surface resulting in large crystals as the cooling takes place slowly. Diorite, granite, pegmatite are examples of intrusive igneous rocks.\n- Extrusive igneous rock: These rocks erupt onto the surface resulting in small crystals as the cooling takes place quickly. The cooling rate is for a few rocks is so quick that they form an amorphous glass. Basalt, tuff, pumice are examples of extrusive igneous rock.\nIgneous Rock Examples\n|Granite||Mica and quartz|\nFor More Information Igneous Rocks And Its Types, Watch The Below Video:\nThe sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material within bodies of water and at the surface of the earth. The process that causes various organic materials and minerals to settle in a place is termed as sedimentation.\nThe particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, the sediment was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of denudation. Sedimentation may also occur as minerals precipitate from water solution or shells of aquatic creatures settle out of suspension.\nTypes of Sedimentary Rock\nFollowing are the three types of sedimentary rock:\n- Clastic sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed from the mechanical weathering debris. Sandstone, siltstone are examples of clastic sedimentary rocks.\n- Chemical sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed from the dissolved materials that precipitate from the solution. Iron ore, limestones are examples of chemical sedimentary rocks.\n- Organic sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed from the accumulation of plant and animal debris. Coal, some dolomites are examples of organic sedimentary rocks.\nSedimentary Rock Examples\nFor More Information On Sedimentary Rocks And Its Types, Watch The Below Video:\nThe metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth’s crust and are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage. They may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth’s surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it.\nMetamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means “change in form”. The original rock is subjected to heat with temperatures greater than 150 to 200°C and pressure around 1500 bars, causing profound physical and/or chemical change.\nTypes of Metamorphic Rock\nFollowing are the two types of metamorphic rock:\n- Foliated metamorphic rocks: These rocks are produced by the exposure to heat and pressure which makes them appear layered. Phyllite, gneiss are examples of foliated metamorphic rocks.\n- Non-foliated metamorphic rocks: These rocks don’t have layers. Marble, quartzite are examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks.\nMetamorphic Rock Examples\nTypes of Rocks in India\nFollowing are the classification of rocks in India:\n- Rocks of the Archaean system: These rocks get this name as they are formed from the hot molten earth and are the oldest and primary rocks. Gneiss is an example and is found in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and some parts of Jharkhand and Rajasthan.\n- Rock of Dhawar system: These are formed from the erosion and sedimentation of the Archaean system and are the oldest sedimentary rocks. These are mainly found in Karnataka.\n- Rocks of Cuddapah system: These are formed from the erosion and sedimentation of Dhawar system. Sandstone, limestone and marble asbestos are the examples and are mainly found in Rajasthan.\n- Rocks of the Vindhyan system: These are formed from the silt of river valleys and shallow oceans. Red sandstone is an example and is mainly found in Madhya Pradesh.\n- Rocks of Gondwana system: These are formed from the depressions in the basins. Coal is an example and is mainly found in Madhya Pradesh.\n- Rocks of Deccan trap: These are formed from the volcanic eruption. Dolorite and basalt are examples and are mainly found in Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh.\n- Rocks of Tertiary system: These rocks are found mainly in the Himalayan regions.\n- Rocks of the Quarternary system: These rocks are found in the plains of the Indus and Ganga.\nStay tuned with BYJU’S to learn more about other concepts of Physics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1ca81af4-514e-4553-bcc7-f52f0fdb106d>","<urn:uuid:e83924cc-6b41-4c24-adbf-e2e1e72a57d0>"],"error":null}

This modern method differs from historical techniques that used linseed oil mixed with pigments and turpentine.","context":["Walkable Art | Vinyl Floorcloths\nPhoto: Beija Flor, Available at Bailey Grey Interiors.\nWhat once was old is new again. With a rich history of adorning floors in the south, vinyl floorcloths are making a comeback. More casual, durable and easily maintained than rugs, vinyl floorcloths protect floors from grime and wear, while dressing up spaces with versatile design options that can be vintage, modern or whimsical. Floorcloths are popular today even with buyers who aren’t tethered to history. Because any pattern that you can imagine is possible, creative design freedom is truly within reach, with product designs that feel personal rather than mass-produced. Since every inch is hand-made by an artist, the addition of a floorcloth to your spaces sums to art, geometry, and history combined.\nFloorcloths are about as vintage as you can get for a good reason—they are wonderfully durable and lie flat on the floor; these classics are easy to clean and bring a burst of color and fun to any space. Non-slip vinyl floor cloths are perfect for kitchens, dining areas and laundry rooms.\nThough elemental in early American design heritage, the textile tradition of painting canvas floorcloths originated in France in the 1400s. These early pieces were small and generally used on tabletops as decoration, considered too precious to place on the floor. In the 1700s, American colonists took the idea one step further and transformed old ship sails into floorcloths. The cloths proved to be an inherently great product—they were durable and stood up to insects, heavy foot traffic and muddy boots. Floorcloths were also easy to clean and helped to control the interior climate by blocking out cold drafts in winter and staying cool underfoot in summer. Floorcloths were used in every area of Colonial homes—in entryways, under dining tables, in kitchens and bedrooms.\nOriginally, floorcloths were designed to resemble imported woven rugs and expensive marble and parquet floors. Primarily imported from England and usually with just one color, early cloths were produced using stencils; eventually, the palette grew to include chrome, blue, black, vermilion and malachite green.\nFloorcloths used a common material of the era—sturdy woven cotton—to address an equally common problem—protection and adornment of bare wood floors. The design staple had extra appeal in the sweltering South, where floorcloths often replaced heavy wool rugs in summer and were used as insulation under carpets in colder months.\nPresident Thomas Jefferson had at least two floorcloths—one in the great hall at Monticello and another in a small dining room—in his words, “to secure a very handsome floor from grease and the scouring that it necessitates.” George Washington had a cloth at Mount Vernon, and John Adams listed floorcloths in his exit inventory when he left the White House. These original, historic floorcloths are rare—literally worn to pieces; only fragments remain to be found, primarily in museums. The Golden Age of the American floorcloth spanned the late 1700s through the mid-1800s; when Sir Frederick Walton invented cheaper, mass-produced and easily available linoleum in the 1850s, it cornered the market.\nThe process of creating an old-style floorcloth in modern times is not lost; each is a work of art. Each floorcloth begins with stretching cotton duck—the tightly woven canvas used in awnings and theater sets—on a simple wooden frame. The canvas is sealed and stiffened with six coats of exterior-grade latex. Period floorcloths used linseed oil mixed with pigments and turpentine, but weren’t as durable and adept at handling high traffic and humidity as modern products.\nNevertheless, the traditional art form survives. After a light sanding, an artist hand paints and employs custom stencils to apply artwork; Greek keys, compass roses, and faux marbling are mainstays. Finally, three coats of clear acrylic and a top layer of bowling alley wax make the one-of-a-kind floor art resistant to cracking, warping, and rolling.\nWalk on the wild side\nIf you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you might want to make your own floorcloth; consider buying a remnant of vinyl flooring and painting your design on the underside. Remnants are easy to cut to size, extremely affordable and have no need of special edge treatment. It’s a fun process, but the tricky part can be coming up with an original design. A few hints: keep it simple or free-form; use two colors or multiple hues. Above all, make the process an expression of your creativity. Any good acrylic paint will work for your design, but don’t forget to protect your work of art with a couple of coats of Trewax once you’ve finished. Most purchased floorcloths come with a skid-proof backing already applied. If you are making your own, use clear silicone painted around the backside edges to keep your floorcloth from slipping.\nPhotos: Spicher and Company\nEverything old is new again\nMiriam Riggs is an area artisan who recently created three traditional floorcloths for the bedchambers at Point of Honor in Lynchburg. A veteran of her craft, Riggs has been making floorcloths for 35 years now, many of them custom designed for historic interiors. For her inspiration at Point of Honor, Riggs looked to laurel wreaths on the carved mantle detail as well as colors and styling from the custom wallpaper found in the house. Riggs explains, “In historic houses such as Point of Honor, I always seek to make the floorcloth based on historically appropriate designs and colors, while also adapting the design to the interior decoration currently in use.”\nMiriam Riggs doesn’t just create historical floorcloths. She also makes modern custom designs based on her clients’ specifications; those floorcloths can be very personal. In her words, “I see my custom designs often as an extension of the client’s imagination. I can help them visualize a concept, and turn it into a functional piece of ‘walkable art.’”\nSandusky House in Lynchburg also has a floorcloth worth a visit to see first-hand. The floorcloth now in the grand entry was designed by Jennifer Frantz of Americana Floorcloths at her studio in Ohio; it was transported from her workshop to Sandusky and installed as a wallto- wall piece.\nMoyanne Harding, owner of Estates and Consignments in downtown Lynchburg is a great fan of new floorcloth styles, preparations and products available, and is especially fond of using them in kitchens, mudrooms, and laundry rooms. In her words, they belong, “Anywhere kids, animals or husbands might bring in dirt.” She says floorcloths have come back en vogue due to their availability in a variety of sizes, patterns and colors. Further, because of their thin profile, modern vinyl pieces present no trip hazards. In her design studio, she showcases samples from a number of lines; pieces can be ordered outright or custom-made, with pricing typically from $20 to $40 per square foot. A leader in the vinyl floorcloth design space, Spicher and Company of Carlisle, Pennsylvania has a fantastic line of vintage-inspired vinyl floorcloths designed by Kolene Spicher.\nBailey Grey Interiors carries the Beija Flor line of vinyl floorcloths; Beija Flor specializes in traditional designs recreated in a contemporary medium; their floorcloths are produced from high quality, layered vinyl sheets. These beautiful pieces are strong, flexible and movable; they are made partly from recycled materials and finished with finely printed designs using a sand embossing technique. ✦"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f8d01a0b-41a3-4e5c-a9ac-f833a65e3114>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do bookkeeping and quality audits compare in terms of their primary focus when examining financial records?","answer":"Bookkeeping and quality audits have different primary focuses when examining financial records. Bookkeeping is focused on recording daily financial transactions of a business, including purchases, sales, receipts, and payments, serving as the foundation for accounting. In contrast, while quality audits may examine financial aspects, they distinguish themselves from financial audits in that their primary objective is not to verify accounting methods' integrity and accuracy. Instead, quality audits focus on assessing products, processes, or systems, though many modern quality audit techniques have their roots in financial audits.","context":["Learn, What is Bookkeeping? Meaning and Definition!\nThe activity or occupation of keeping records of the financial affairs of a business. Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions and is part of the process of accounting in business. Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization or corporation. There are several standard methods of book-keeping. Such as the single-entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry bookkeeping system but, while they may be thought of as “real” book-keeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a book-keeping process. Also learn, “The Language of Business” also called Accounting, but Why? What is Bookkeeping? Meaning and Definition!\nBookkeeping is usually performing by a bookkeeper. A bookkeeper (or book-keeper) is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business. They are usually responsible for writing the daybooks. Which contain records of purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. The bookkeeper is responsible for ensuring that all transactions whether it is cash transaction or credit transaction are records in the correct daybook, supplier’s ledger, customer ledger, and general ledger; an accountant can then create reports from the information concerning the financial transactions recording by the bookkeeper.\nBookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of accounting. Bookkeeping involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of the business. The bookkeeper brings the books to the trial balance stage: an accountant may prepare the income statement and balance sheet using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.\n#History of Bookkeeping!\nThe origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researchers would appear to show that some method of keeping accounts has existed from the remotest times. Babylonian records have been finding dating back as far as 2600 B.C., written with a stylus on small slabs of clay. The term “waste book” was used in colonial America referring to book-keeping. The purpose was to document daily transactions including receipts and expenditures. This was recorded in chronological order, and the purpose was for temporary use only. The daily transactions would then record in a daybook or account ledger in order to balance the accounts. The name “waste book” comes from the fact that once the waste book’s data were transfers to the actual journal, the waste book could discard\n#Meaning of Bookkeeping!\nSince the principles of accounting rely on accurate and thorough records, book-keeping is the foundation accounting. Bookkeepers often times has to exercise analytical skills and judgment calls. When recording business events since the source for most accounting information in the system. Book-keeping involves the recording, on a daily basis, of a company’s financial transactions. With proper bookkeeping, companies are able to track all information on its books to make key operating, investing, and financing decisions.\nBookkeepers are individuals who manage all financial data for companies. Without bookkeepers, companies would not be aware of their current financial position, as well as the transactions that occur within the company. Accurate bookkeeping is also crucial to external users. Which include investors, financial institutions, or the government that needs access to reliable information to make a better investment or lending decisions. Simply put, the entire economy relies on accurate and reliable book-keeping for both internal and external users.\n#Definition of Bookkeeping!\nBookkeeping, often called record keeping, is the part of accounting that records transactions and business events in the form of journal entries in the accounting system. In other words, book-keeping is the means by which data is entering into an accounting system. This can either be done manually on a physical ledger pad or electronically in an accounting program like Quickbooks.\n“Systematic recording of financial aspects of business transactions in appropriate books of account”.\n#Understand Bookkeeping for Example!\nA good example of the business event that requires analytical skills is the trade-in of a vehicle. The bookkeeper must review the transaction and determine how much the old vehicle trade-in value was and the price paid for the new vehicle. He or she must also find out whether any loans require for the new purchase and how much cash was paid for the transfer. Also read, What are the Different Types of Accounting in a Business?\nAs you can see, bookkeepers generally must have a good understanding of accounting principles and GAAP in general. Once the business event has been evaluating, the bookkeeper makes a journal entry in the general ledger to remove the old vehicle and associate accumulate depreciation and record. The purchase of the new vehicle with any applicable gains or losses on the transition.\nThe entire process of analyzing an event and recording the transaction in the accounting system is a good example of book-keeping. Many times accounting and book-keeping are using interchangeably, but this is incorrect. Accounting has a much more broad definition than simply recording transactions in an accounting system.\nAccounting is using to identify events that need to record, recording the transactions of these events, and communicating. The effects of these transactions with people inside and outside of the company. As you can see, bookkeeping is only a small part of the broader definition of accounting.\n#Importance of Bookkeeping!\nProper book-keeping gives companies a reliable measure of their performance. It also provides information on general strategic decisions and a benchmark for its revenue and income goals. In short, once a business is up and running, spending extra time and money on maintaining proper records is critical.\nMany small companies don’t actually hire full-time accountants to work for them because the costs are usually higher. Instead, small companies generally hire a bookkeeper or outsource the job to a professional firm. One important thing to note here is that many people who intend to start a new business sometimes overlook. The importance of trivial matters such as keeping records of every penny spent.\n1.

Is a quality audit similar to a financial audit? Is an audit the same as a surveillance or inspection? These types of questions are often asked by those unfamiliar with the quality auditing profession. As far as what a quality auditor is, Allan J. Sayle says it best:\nAuditors are the most important of the quality professionals. They must have the best and most thorough knowledge of business, systems, developments, etc. They see what works, what does not work, strengths, weaknesses of standards, codes, procedures and systems.\nThe purpose of a quality audit is to assess or examine a product, the process used to produce a particular product or line of products or the system sup-porting the product to be produced. A quality audit is also used to determine whether or not the subject of the audit is operating in compliance with governing source documentation such as corporate directives, federal and state environmental protection laws and regulations, etc. A quality audit distinguishes itself from a financial audit in that the primary objective of the financial audit is to verify the integrity and accuracy of the accounting methods used within the organization. Yet, despite this basic difference, it is important to note that many of the present-day quality audit techniques have their traditional roots in financial audits.\nSystem, process, product and compliance audits\nThe quality system audit addresses the who, what, where, when and how of the quality system used to produce its product. For example, how is the quality system defined? Who is responsible for producing the product? Who is responsible for assuring the quality of the product meets or exceeds customer requirements? What is the extent of management involvement in the daily operation of the quality system? What procedures are used to guide the organization in its production effort? How are they maintained and updated? Who performs that function? Where are the procedures located?\nWhat type of processes are used (both directly and indirectly) to produce the product? How do current procedures support these direct and indirect processes, etc.?\nA quality system audit is characterized by its emphasis on the macro nature of the quality management system. Think of the quality system audit in terms of \"an inch deep but a mile wide, \" i.e., broad and general in nature rather than narrow and limited in scope. A quality system audit is defined as a \"systematic and independent examination used to determine whether quality activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives.\" (ISO 10011-1 (1990)) Further, it is a \"documented activity performed to verify, by examination and evaluation of objective evidence, that applicable elements of the quality system are suitable and have been developed, documented and effectively implemented in accordance with specified requirements.\" (ANSI/ASQC A3 (1987))\nWhere the quality system audit is general in nature, the process audit is much more narrowly defined. Unlike the system audit, the process audit is \"an inch wide but a mile deep.\" It revolves around verification of the manner in which: 1) people; 2) material; 3) machines, etc., mesh together to produce a product. A process audit compares and contrasts the manner in which the end product is produced to the written procedures, work instructions, workman-ship standards, etc., used to guide the manufacturing process responsible for building the product in the first place. Process audits are appraisal and analytical in nature.\nThe process audit is also concerned with the validity and overall reliability of the process itself. For example, is the process consistently producing accept-able results? Do non-value added steps exist in the process? Are processes current in terms of meeting the existing and future requirements of key customers?\nBear in mind the process audit has two active modes of operation—appraisal and analysis. While in the appraisal mode, keep this question in the front of your mind: are personnel involved in the production process per-forming in accordance with company manufacturing process plans, procedures, work instructions, workmanship standards, etc.? In the analysis mode, on the other hand, question the procedures, work instructions, and so forth, used in support of the process(es) being audited—are they helpful or detrimental? Thorough or sketchy? Does duplication of effort exist between sub-functions?\nAre any non-value added steps apparent? Does the overall process complement the expressed or implied quality objectives of the organization: short-term customer satisfaction, long-term repeat business, continued profitability and growth?\nThe word \"audit\" in product audit is somewhat of a misnomer. Actually, a product \"audit\" is a detailed inspection of a finished product performed prior to delivering the product to the customer. It is a test of both attribute and vari-able data i.e., cosmetic appearance, dimension properties, electrical continuity, etc. Results of product audits often provide interesting bits of information regarding the reliability and effectiveness of the overall quality system. Product audits are usually accomplished for one or more of the following reasons:\n1. to estimate the outgoing quality level of the product or group of products;\n2. to ascertain if the outgoing product meets a predetermined standard level of quality for a product or product line;\n3. to estimate the level of quality originally submitted for inspection;\n4. to measure the ability of the quality control inspection function to make quality decisions, and;\n5. to determine the suitability of internal process controls.\nDuring a compliance audit, the auditor examines the written procedures, work instructions, contractual obligations, etc., and attempts to match them to the actions taken by the auditee to produce the product. In essence, it is a \"say what you do—do what you say\" type of audit. Specifically, the compliance audit centers on comparing and contrasting written source documentation (usually the contract) to objective evidence in an attempt to prove (or disprove) compliance with that source documentation.\nFirst Party, Second Party and Third Party Audits\nFIRST PARTY (INTERNAL) AUDIT\nA first party audit is usually performed by the company (or a department within the company) upon itself. It is an audit of those portions of (the) quality assurance program that are \"retained under its direct control and within its organizational structure.\" (ANSI/ASQC NQA-1 (1986)) A first party audit is usually conducted by an internal audit group. However, employees within the department itself may also conduct an assessment similar to a first party audit. In such an instance, this \"audit\" is generally referred to as a \"self assessment.\"\nThe purpose of a self assessment is to monitor and analyze key intradepartmental processes which, if left unattended, have the potential to degenerate and negatively affect product quality, safety and overall system integrity. These monitoring and analyzing responsibilities lie directly with those most affected by departmental processes—the employees assigned to the respective departments under examination.\nAlthough first party audit/self assessment ratings are subjective in nature, the ratings guideline shown here helps to hone overall rating precision. If performed properly, first party audits and self assessments:\n· Provide feedback to management that the quality system is both implemented and effective, and;\n· Are excellent tools for gauging the continuous improvement effort as well as measuring the return on investment for sustaining that effort.\nSECOND PARTY (EXTERNAL) AUDIT\nUnlike the first party audit, a second party audit is an audit of another organizational quality program not under the direct control or within the organizational structure of the auditing organization. (ANSI/ASQC NQA-1 (1986)) Second party audits are usually performed by the customer upon its suppliers (or potential suppliers) to ascertain whether or not the supplier can meet existing or proposed contractual requirements. Obviously, the supplier quality system is a very important part of contractual requirements since it is directly (manufacturing, engineering, purchasing, quality control, etc.) and indirectly (marketing, inside and outside sales, etc.) responsible for the design, production, control and continued supportability of the product. (See Figure 1.3 for an example of a second party audit process flow.) Although second party audits are usually conducted by customers on their suppliers, it is sometimes beneficial for the customer to contract with an independent quality auditor. This action helps to promote an image of fairness and objectivity on the part of the customer.\nTHIRD PARTY AUDIT\nCompared to first and second party audits where auditors are not independent, the third party audit is objective. It is an assessment of a quality system conducted by an independent, outside auditor or team of auditors. When referring to a third party audit as it applies to an international quality standard such as ISO 9000, the term \"third party\" is synonymous with a quality system registrar whose primary responsibility is to assess a quality system for conformance to that standard and issue a certificate of conformance (upon completion of a successful assessment)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:262de5a9-a86f-4c9f-a22c-d07012bae85d>","<urn:uuid:a7f7b371-9bab-4258-bb24-4cdf977e428c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do brain regions affect face recognition ability, and what role does autism play in facial processing networks?","answer":"Face recognition differences may reflect processing or structural differences in the brain, with prosopagnosia potentially involving reduced connectivity between brain regions in the face processing network. Studies have shown that connectivity between the fusiform face area (FFA) of the brain and the left frontal cortex is reduced in those with autism compared to typically developing individuals. Research suggests neural networks involved in visual processing of faces may be one of the most crucial neural substrates affected in autism spectrum disorders. Persistent differences in facial processing neural networks exist between typically developing individuals and those on the spectrum, and face blindness occurs in more than 36% of autistic adults without intellectual disability, compared to around 2% in the general population.","context":["Although most of us can distinguish between and remember hundreds of different faces, some people are better at it than others. “Super-recognisers” can accurately identify faces even when they have only seen them briefly previously. At the other extreme, “developmental prosopagnosics” are significantly impaired at recognising faces in many everyday situations.\nFor the majority of us though, our face recognition ability falls between these extremes.\nBut why are there such huge individual differences? How do these abilities affect us and where do they come from?\nPsychologists have started to investigate such questions, and found several answers. For example, we have discovered that it is linked to personality.\nFace recognition differences may reflect processing or structural differences in the brain. For example, people with prosopagnosia may have reduced connectivity between brain regions in the face processing network.\nAnother idea is that face recognition ability is related to other more general cognitive abilities, like memory or visual processing. Here, though, findings are mixed. Some research supports a link between face recognition and specific abilities like visual processing. But other research has discounted this idea.\nYet another possibility is that individual differences in face recognition reflect a person’s personality or their social and emotional functioning. Interestingly, face recognition ability has been linked to measures of empathy and anxiety.\nEmpathy reflects a person’s ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. In 2010, researchers asked volunteers to try and remember the identity of a number of faces presented one at a time. They were later presented with the same faces mixed together with new faces and were asked to state whether each face was “old” (learnt) or “new”.\nThe performance was measured by the number of learnt faces correctly identified as being familiar. The researchers found that those who rated themselves as high in empathy performed significantly better at a face recognition memory task than those with low empathy skills.\n[caption id=“attachment_100164” align=“aligncenter” width=“700”] Actor Brad Pitt struggles to recognise faces.\nResearch has also found that people who report significantly lower levels of general anxiety have better face recognition skills than those who are have higher anxiety.\nInterestingly, more recent research has suggested the link between anxiety and face recognition ability may be more prominent for women, and may be particularly related to anxiety in social situations (social anxiety).\nSituational anxiety may also play a role. For example, face recognition may be impaired when an eyewitness is asked to try and identify the face of a suspect viewed in a stressful situation.\nIn our own work we have considered the relationship between extroversion and individual face recognition ability. Extroverts are known to be superior at decoding social information and to be more involved in social activities than introverts. It may therefore be that extroverts are more skilled at recognising different identities.\nIn a previous study, researchers collected data from a group of 20 highly extroverted and 23 highly introverted volunteers (from an original sample of 339 volunteers). They found that extroverts performed significantly better in a face recognition memory task compared with the introverts.\nIn our own work we looked at 100 volunteers with a range of extroversion levels. The volunteers were shown famous faces and were asked to try and identify them by giving their name or some other identifying information.\nVolunteers were also asked to say whether two unfamiliar faces belonged to the same person or different people – a task dubbed face matching. While there was no relationship between extroversion and face matching, there was a positive relationship between extroversion and famous face recognition.\nSo to answer our own question, although there is individual variation, extroverts do tend to be better at recognising faces.\nWe do not yet understand the importance and reason for these findings, however. It may be that extroversion causes superior face recognition or that people who are better at identifying faces become more extroverted as a result.\nIf so, then a person’s inability to learn and recognise faces may lead them to become more introverted, to avoid potentially embarrassing social situations. Alternatively, introverted people may meet fewer people and therefore never develop good face recognition skills.\nIt may also work both ways. If you are slightly worse at recognising faces to start with you may end up meeting fewer people, and therefore becoming even worse at it over time. It could also be that both extroversion and face recognition are related to yet another factor that we still don’t know about.\nIn future work, we need to consider how our findings with extroversion fit together with research on empathy and anxiety. We also need to consider how much practical impact these issues have on face identification in applied situations – from identification by police officers to passport control.\nOur own ongoing work is looking at the impact of wider individual factors like altruism and optimism on face recognition. It may be that we soon find even more explanations for why some of us are just better at recognising faces than others.\nAuthor: Karen Lander, Senior Lecturer in Experimental Psychology, >University of Manchester.

Face blindness, or prosopagnosia, means a person cannot recognize that they’ve seen a face before; this condition, found in many on the spectrum, may have serious psychosocial consequences.\nWhat do you see when you look at someone’s face? Where do you look first? Where do your eyes linger? Even though we look at the faces of others many times in a single day, it may be hard to answer such questions.\nMost people look at, and recognize, faces effortlessly. Facial recognition seems trivial, until the possibility of not recognizing loved ones is contemplated. Facial recognition is an intricate, integral part of social communication; for autistic individuals already facing difficulty in social communication this may be especially relevant and taxing.\nFace blindness or prosopagnosia\nThis condition is not about memory. It’s not about forgetting someone and encountering an awkward social encounter. It’s a serious mental condition where the ability to recognize faces is impaired or never adequately developed. There are two types of prosopagnosia:\n- Developmental prosopagnosia: (sometimes referred to as congenital prosopagnosia) is a lifelong, neurodevelopmental condition which is not associated with brain injury or intellectual deficits. It runs in families (Duchaine et al., 2007), manifests in childhood, and often occurs alongside conditions like autism\n- Acquired prosopagnosia: this condition occurs when poor face recognition is the result of brain damage, most commonly after a stroke, brain disease or injury, illness or tumor\nAcquired prosopagnosia became a subject of interest when a report (Bodamer, 1947) described deficits in face recognition of wounded soldiers. Face blindness is often linked to the brain’s right fusiform face area (FFA), but a study (Cohen et al., 2019) suggests no single area is always affected in face blindness. Rather, prosopagnosia may involve an entire network, where impairment in communication between components or different brain regions may contribute to the deficit in face recognition.\nFindings from the study, published in the journal Brain, led the first author Cohen (2019) to suggest that face recognition involves two distinct brain networks. The author is not sure whether face blindness is caused by a disruption in both networks, or whether the condition occurs because of an imbalance between the two networks.\nFor those who realize their skill of recognizing faces is compromised after brain damage, the loss of this skill must be deeply troubling. But would a child with developed face blindness or congenital prosopagnosia be aware of their deficit and its severity in recognizing faces? As it runs in families, and the child may never experience typical face recognition, would they be aware of any difference or impairment? Probably, at least according to a study (Dalrymple et al., 2014) aptly titled: “A room full of strangers every day”: The psychosocial impact of developmental prosopagnosia on children and their families.\nClick here to find out more\nDalrymple et al. (2014) concluded that children are mostly aware of their difficulties with face recognition, they use many different coping strategies as compensation for the condition, and face blindness may have significant social implications for some children. Do these conclusions apply to children with face blindness who are also on the autism spectrum? More research may be needed to establish how autistic kids with atypical facial recognition feel about the condition.\nThe face blindness, autism link\nThe results from a recent study (Minio-Paluello et al., 2020) revealed prosopagnosia potentially occurs in more than 36% of autistic adults without intellectual disability, compared to around 2% in the general population. Another study (Lynn et al., 2018) found connectivity between the fusiform face area (FFA) of the brain and the left frontal cortex was reduced in those with autism, relative to the typically developing individuals.\nThe study concluded by stating underconnectivity and abnormal development of functional connectivity may bring about an inferior face-processing network, in the context of escalating cognitive impairments in autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\nResearch suggests neural networks involved in the visual processing of faces may be one of the most crucial neural substrates affected in ASD (Pereira et al., 2019). This study also mentions real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging as a potential tool to study the visual processing network in ASD. Persistent differences in facial processing neural networks were found between typically developing individuals and those on the spectrum (Pereira et al, 2019).\nInformation based on brain MRI data, particularly functional MRI based neurofeedback, could be used to study visual processing networks in ASD, giving clues to exactly how those on the spectrum recognize faces. Parents with kids on the spectrum may wonder if there is anything they can do to help accommodate atypical face processing, if the condition is present in their child.\nAutistic kids, eye contact and poor face processing abilities\nChildren on the spectrum often find eye contact uncomfortable. Research (Neumann, 2006) discussing mouth fixation offered a possible explanation, which includes abnormal, top-down strategy for allocating visual attention by autistic individuals. The “eye avoidance” hypothesis of autism face processing (Tanaka & Sung, 2016) may be a plausible explanation of atypical face recognition where those on the spectrum avoid looking at the eye region of the face because it is perceived as socially threatening.\nParents with kids on the spectrum often speak about the unfairness of their children being perceived as “rude” in social contexts, especially when there is little understanding of autism and communication deficits. Raising awareness of face blindness could be helpful in educating society; a child on the spectrum may be overwhelmed and insecure in social contexts where it takes considerable effort to recognize a face, a task their peers execute effortlessly.\nFinding eye contact challenging, the child may look at other facial features (often the mouth), or they may look at clothing or other contextual clues to work out who the person is. Kids with face blindness may feel especially intimidated when encountering someone they are familiar with in a new or different environment. My own children seem surprised when they see their teachers in a supermarket; familiar contexts or environments do facilitate face recognition even for neurotypical children.\nWhen face recognition is impaired, social interactions may be strained from the get-go. If autism is associated with face blindness, it is appropriate for researchers to examine whether poor face recognition contributes to social communication deficits, a core autism characteristic. For parents, an awkward social interaction where memory fails and you just can’t place the person, should shed some light on the experience. Could anyone interact in a socially appropriate way with raging doubts about who they’re actually communicating with?\nAddressing face processing\nCleary autistic children with face processing deficits would benefit from early intervention—if face recognition is improved it could facilitate improved social communication. We need more research to identify the underlying mechanisms of face recognition and how this is impaired specifically in those on the spectrum.\nUntil recently clinicians did not seem overly optimistic about a cure for face blindness, probably because the condition seemed almost resistant to treatment. Reviewing successes and failures over the last 50 years of research, a study (Degutis et al., 2014) found compensatory training showed some effectiveness in children with developed face blindness. In adults with congenital prosopagnosia, remedial-training and administering oxytocin demonstrated improvements. Other approaches like transcranial magnetic stimulation are also under investigation as possible intervention for face blindness in those on the spectrum.\nA recent study (Bate et al., 2020) may change the pessimism about treatment for face blindness. The study describes the first remedial face training program appropriate for children. The program, using a modified version of the popular game Guess Who?, led to improvements in face memory—gains which were maintained when evaluated at a one month follow up session.\nAccommodate, compensate, educate\nWith more research and better intervention approaches, atypical facial recognition could be addressed in children on the spectrum. For parents, advocating for their kids becomes even more important when autism is comorbid with a condition like face blindness. Many of the studies above mention the importance of informing relevant people (in the child’s life) about the condition. Teachers, caregivers, and peers need to be educated and informed to help autistic children with face blindness.\nA teacher introducing themselves in a supermarket when they’ve been in the child’s life for a while may seem strange, but it could set the stage for a much easier and more comfortable social interaction. Doing things differently to accommodate different minds should not be regarded as an inconvenience. Rather, changing the way we do things, to accommodate neurodivergent individuals could embolden them to add a fresh perspective, new ideas, and boundless ways of thinking. A win-win for a world increasingly stumped by novel problems.\nBate, S., Adams, A., & Bennetts, R. J. (2020). Guess who?

{"question":"What are the primary ways a player can interact with the world in Factorio, such as building or combat?","answer":"The player has six primary ways of interacting with the world: crafting items from resources using the craft menu (E key), placing entities or tiles using the left mouse button, harvesting resources from resource entities (hold right mouse button), picking up non-placed items from the ground (F key), firing weapons at enemies (Spacebar), and passively using a flashlight that automatically activates during night time and transfers to headlights in vehicles.","context":["Factorio is played from the angled top down perspective of the player.\nThe physical representation (or the Engineer) of the player is the character, who is always at the center of view. In multiplayer, player characters will appear in different colors. Color can be set manually with the\n/color command, see Console. These colors transfer to any entered car or tank, depending on which player is driving them. These colors also transfer to gun turrets, laser turrets or gates, depending on who they were placed by.\nThe character is part of the player and represents the physical existence of the player in the game-world. In technical terms: A character is just one property of the player, and it is the only that can be controlled at a time.\nThe character's maximum health is 250 (without energy shields). The player's health can naturally, slowly regenerate a few seconds after taking damage. The character's main inventory has 80 slots (without bonuses from power armor, toolbelt research, or logistic trash slots). Similar to the stationary radar, the character constantly reveals an area of 5×5 chunks, centered on the chunk the character occupies.\nDistinction between player and character\nTechnically the player is only the \"player-view\". The player is unlike the character, (the little person that runs around on the ground) The character is part of the player, but the player is not just the character.\nYou can for example play in god-mode (such as in the sandbox game mode). In that mode you don't have a character, only a player.\nIn other words, the Player is a term that encompasses both the internal code that defines a player, and the entity in game that interacts with machines/rocks/trees, which is the character. While this distinction is important for modding and understanding the game's core, the terms can be used interchangeably for most conversations. For the purpose of this article, \"player\" will be used.\nThe player has six primary ways of interacting with the world:\n- Crafting items personally from resources using the craft menu (Default open key: E)\n- Placing entities or tiles by selecting them from the inventory or quickbar (Default: Left Mouse Button)\n- Harvesting resources from a resource entity (Default: Hold RMB)\n- Picking up non-placed items from the ground and placing them in your inventory (Default: Hold/press F)\n- Firing weapons at enemies (Default: Press or hold Spacebar depending on weapon)\n- Passively with a flashlight that automatically turns on during the night time (which transfers to headlights if the player is in a vehicle.)\nFor more key-bindings, see Keyboard bindings\nNote: The player can do that only, if his character owns the abilities for this. For example: He cannot fire a weapon, cause he has no weapons-slots.\nWhen a player is killed, it leaves behind a corpse that lasts 15 minutes and contains all items that were located in the player's inventory, quickbar, trash slots, and equipment slots. 10 seconds after being killed, the player respawns at the center of the world, or at a pre-determined player spawn (which can be set via the map editor).\nQuickbar and shortcut bar\n- Main article: Quickbar\nThe quickbar is a user interface component for creating links to items that are always visible at the bottom of the screen. Once created they can be quickly selected at any time without needing to open the inventory. It shows between one and four bars from a set of ten available, each containing 10 slots. Clicking any filled slot will place the chosen item in the player's hand if available in the inventory.\n- Main article: Shortcut bar\nThe shortcut bar is a group of icons for accessing regularly used features such as obtaining blueprints and deconstruction planners with a simple mouse click. It is always visible at the bottom of the screen, appearing to the right of the quickbar. The icons can be hidden and their order can be changed.\n- Main article: Weapons\nTo the left most side of the screen are the player's equipped weapons and armor, along with the types of ammo being used for each weapon. The player can switch between weapons at any time.\n- The character GUI now has a new look.\n- Personal logistics has been moved to a separate tab. Logistic requests and auto trash have been merged into one panel.\n- Using quick inventory transfers in the player inventory of the character gui will transfer the items either to weapons and armor slots or to trash slots depending on the selected tab, regardless of item type.\n- Personal logistics are now unlocked by a single research. This unlocks personal logistic requests and auto trash(unlimited count), plus 30 character trash slots.\n- The character GUI now has a new look.\n- Increased player reach from 6 to 10.\n- Surplus items from crafting are again available for crafting other items. For example, crafting two green circuits will no longer result in two extra copper wires in the player's inventory. This only applies to items that are automatically crafted as a prerequisite; items the player has explicitly requested to craft will not be used to satisfy the dependencies of any further orders.\n- Armors have inventory size bonuses (10 for modular armor, 20 for power armor, 30 for power armor mk2).\n- Changed fast inventory transfer from the main player inventory so ctrl+clicking empty slots doesn't move items to the logistic trash slots.\n- New muzzle flash graphics.\n- Improved player running animation.\n- New player animation, depends on armor\n- Mining a chest now fails instead of spilling items onto the ground.\n- Player gets a separate warning icon when a building is destroyed.\n- Recipe gui contains recipes not craftable by player (however, their tooltip shows machines where they can be crafted).\n- Player moves slower while shooting.\n- Added the ability for the player to request items directly from logistic robots.\n- Player picks all items in range when picking items on the ground, instead of 1 per tick\n- Shooting particles added\n- Player slides around corners\n- Added warning message when the player tries to build in an invalid position.\n- Screen reddens when taking damage\n- Character animations added"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:85029f22-72b2-426c-952f-08a6f7d20bcb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key steps for checking boat steering systems during spring preparation, and how should safety equipment be inspected before launch?","answer":"For steering systems, you need to check if the rudder turns without undue resistance and verify there isn't too much play. All steering and control systems including cables, control box, linkages, and hydraulic systems must be inspected. Any swollen, stiff, or rusty control cables should be replaced. For safety equipment, several checks are required: fire extinguishers should be replaced if needed (manual ones should be inverted, tapped, and shaken), flares must be replaced if damaged or outdated, smoke and carbon monoxide alarms need testing with battery changes, and EPIRBs/PLBs should have their batteries tested and registration verified. Additionally, life jackets must be inspected for mold, rotten threads, or fabric deterioration.","context":["The boat launch after winterization\nThis post is also available in: Italiano (Italian)\nAfter winter storage it is now time to let our cuddle-eager “baby” have a bath.\nLet’s see how to prepare it for the launch.\nAs described in the article about winter storage, some steps are similar and have to be repeated before boat launching, while others have to be carried out in reverse sequence. Among these there are of course water supply and power connections as we need to have them ready for use.\nIf we have covered our boat with an awning for winter storage, we now have to think what to do.\nSurely it is very dirty due to the dust and rain accumulated during the months. It will be necessary to wash it, better when it is stretched taut as this facilitates drying.\nThis will require spending some hours below deck, which can be an agreeable experience if it isn’t hot, yet, otherwise it is really quite unpleasant. So, as an alternative, we can remove the cover and wash the bow deck using a hose or the pressure washer. We will then stretch the awning on the life lines to clean it.\nNot only the awning needs to be washed, but the whole boat. You decide weather more or less thorough depending on the situation.\nThe power is ON, so let’s switch the boards OFF and switch ON the battery charger at 220 V for some days: it will be ok for the batteries giving them regular cycles controlled by advanced electronics, now present in the most modern models.\nInside the boat the deck floors have been left open. Now close them, maybe after wiping them with a damp cloth to remove the dust accumulated in the bilge. Then open all the portlights to let the boat better breathe.\nNow our beloved is starting to get a decent look….\nAnd now it’s the turn of the mattresses. Pull them out and air them in the fresh air. Let’s make the most of this oportunity and wash also the mattress ticking, one after the other.\nThen remove the cooking foil we had used to duly protect the devices during winter storage. Mount the steering wheel (in case it had been removed) and reset the electronics, especially that of the cockpit i.e the autopilot motor (in case of belt system or trimmer)\nRemove the plug from any thru hulls and small holes that had been previously closed. Clean the fridge, which had been left open during winter storage.\nLet’s check the anchor line: chain + anchor. Restore connections and haul all the equipment aboard by means of the winch, also to check its proper working.\nReplace the messenger lines with the halyards using the same method of winter storage: needle, thread and insulating tape with a little lubricant. Then clean the solar panels and reset the wind power system.\nNow it’s antifouling paint time!\nClean the hull with hose and armed brush with rigid sponge, scotch-brite-type. This is useful to remove barnacles and other dirt, if any. As the large cleaning operations have been carried out for winter storage, what is required now is just a touch-up cleaning. So, scraper in hand, let’s check the whole hull searching for areas out of the reach of the brush and, if necessary, remedy, but always gently and carefully.\nLet it dry and then stick blue adhesive paper tape specific for marine use. Stick it at the waterline, the thru hulls and the log small propeller.\nTape also the prop-shaft as well as the transducers. Of course we have removed and properly cleaned the propeller in winter. If not, this too has to be protected.\nChoose the antifouling that best suits your hull and apply it following the product directions. (to choose the best antifouling paint for your boat,\nread this article). The ideal is to apply 2 coats of paints and then a third one at the waterline, then 50/70 cm down.\nPay attention, if possible, and apply the antifouling paint some days before the boat launch (1-2 days before would be perfect): the paint will better fulfil its purpose once it is in water.\nLet us turn now to the motor. Screw the diesel oil filters and back flush by means of a special lever on C pump. Loosen the dedicated bolt on the filter holder and wait until fluid diesel oil has replaced air bubbles. Do not forget to tighten everything. And let’s make the most of it by checking all tightenings: diesel oil and sea-water filters, impeller, etc.\nAlso all the seacock clamps have to be checked as they may require to be tightened or replaced if they seem to be in poor conditions. However, clamps have to be replaced every 5 years while, as for valves, it depends on the type in use, if made of metal or reinforced plastic (Randax-type).\nIt is worthwhile to take a look at the electric board and switch ON the power (12 V) in order to check all the utilities. Make sure the onboard lights i.e. navigation lights, mooring and motor lights are working properly.\nDo not forget to check the expiry date of flares and distress rockets. If expired, the have to be replaced. The same for the gas tube in the kitchen: if to be replaced, do it and then light all the kitchen burners.\nAlso the date of the liferaft service has to be checked. If expired, let’s have it serviced.\nLet’s test bilge pumps: both manual and electric ones.\nAs for the manual one check if the rubber of the bellow is in good conditions. Verify of course its general conditions.\nAs for the electric ones, check the impeller and replace the membrane in case it is friable and porous.\nLet’s fill the diesel oil and the fresh water tanks. Test the fresh water pump and if necessary drain the air inside it by opening all the faucets one after the other.\nIf you have removed the WC pump, install it again. If this is not the case, wait until you are in open see and then perform the first test.\nInstall the bimini splash guard and set up the easy jack as well as the lazy jack circuit.\nSails have to wait until launch as boatyards/marinas do not allow to rig and hoist sails when the boat is not in water. However, to save time, cleats and furling headsail could be set out.\nLet’s clean the tender, inflate rib tubes and prepare the lines required to the mooring: we are almost ready to get in the water!\nLet’s clean the fenders and fit them. Give the correct tension to the backstay that had been duly dismantled for storage, as well as to shrouds, should these be loose, too. Disconnect the battery charger, connect the solar panels, disconnect 220 V and the water system.\nWe are now ready to launch!\nThe crane will lower the boat until it enters water. The first thing to check is the tightening of valves/seacocks after they have been duly closed. If there is no leakage, open the motor seacock and start the motor. Let the motor run for some minutes, then test the inverter (forward/backward, don’t worry lines will hold us still) then, when we are ready, let the mooring go and sail to the place we have chosen in the dockyard or to the anchor point “in that nice bay over there”.\nLet’s reach the masthead to check the shrouds. Cable-end fittings, rivets and inox cables must be checked at least once a year.\nNow we can rig sails, open bath and kitchen valves and test the WC.\nFor those who have a desalinator onboard, when both ready and willing to, perform the rinse cycle of the liquid for winter storage following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNow we can start to truly relax, ready to enjoy the new season.\nEnjoy and fair wind to everybody!\nScrittore e fotografo, collabora con vari media e svolge corsi sul \"cambio vita\" e gestione della barca, da cui il sito sailyx.com.\nE' autore del libro \"Si può fare – Come vivere un vita da sogno con 500€ al mese\" e di vari saggi e mini ebook inerenti la vela.","Boat Safety Checklist For Summer\nBy Tom Neale\nGood spring prep increases safety and fun for the entire boating season. Follow these tips to help you build your own list\nClick here to download the printable version\nCheck things that might have deteriorated during winter, including exterior wiring connections for navigation lights, dock lines (chafing or freeze damage), life jackets (mold, rotten threads or fabric), paper charts, pipes including cockpit drains that were subject to ice damage, and hose clamps.\nMove the rudder. If it turns with undue resistance or if there is too much play, find the cause and fix it. Check steering and control systems (cables, control box, linkages, hydraulic systems). Replace swollen, stiff, or rusty control cables.\nReplace deteriorated zincs. Clean contacts of wires attached inside the hull to zinc bolts. If the wire is corroded at the terminal, replace with tinned boat wire.\nCheck engine oil levels, particularly if your boat was left in the water. High levels may indicate water intrusion that requires work immediately to save the engine. Check oil reservoirs including tilt/trim on outboards, some windlasses, and hydraulic fluid in steering systems.\nCheck that vent hoses haven't become clogged.\nIf your boat has been under cover, check for deck leaks, particularly around wooden areas. Run water from a hose over possible problem areas.\nCheck for freeze damage where water may have entered confined areas. Examples are around gel coat cracks, the rudder shaft seal, prop shaft seal, and thru-hull fittings. Examine cored transoms on outboard boats for cracks that could have allowed water into the transom.\nFor I/Os, carefully check the bellows for any deterioration.\nCheck and test communications equipment. Test EPIRB/PLB batteries, and verify that the registration is current. Verify that your MMSI is correctly entered into your DSC radio, and/or update your information at www.BoatUS.com/MMSI.\nTest navigation equipment. Depth-finder transducers may be damaged by cold, particularly if water has migrated through cracks in the plastic.\nLoad test batteries. Check the electrolyte level and specific gravity if applicable. A simple voltage reading with a volt/ohm meter won't tell the whole story, nor will just testing to see if it can turn over the engine.\nReplace fire extinguishers if needed. Invert hand-helds, tap hard on the bottom with the palm of your hand, and shake. Do automatic extinguishers need servicing?\nReplace flares if they show any sign of damage or are outdated.\nIs your toolbox wet inside from condensation or leaks? Are tools such as pliers and adjustable wrenches rusted?\nTest bilge pumps and alarms. If the float and alarm switches for your bilge pump(s) can't be activated manually, or you can't reach them, use a hose to fill the bilge enough to see that the pumps and alarms work.\nTest bilge blowers and check their hoses for tears or disconnected fittings.\nCheck for moisture in the fuel tank. If you didn't leave your tank topped up to almost full with appropriate additives and you've been using E10 gas, you may have water in the tank from condensation and phase separation, which could damage your engine. Draining and replacing the fuel is sometimes needed. If it is, hire a qualified professional. Replace fuel filters even if new.\nCheck fuel lines and fittings. Look for signs of leaks such as discoloring around a fitting. Replace any line or fitting looking impaired, per ABYC and USCG standards or better. Secure any loose lines.\nCarefully examine the galley stove. Check connections and plugs for the electric stove and check the burners. For gas stoves, check fittings, line, and emergency shutoff solenoid valve and solenoid wire connections at the switch and solenoid.\nCheck end plates of engine heat exchangers for white or greenish discoloration indicating water seeping past seals. Many manufacturers recommend these seals be replaced every year.

{"question":"What metadata capabilities are available in Google Books Ngram Viewer versus InfraNodus for text analysis?","answer":"Google Books Ngram Viewer's dataset is annotated with morphological and syntactic data, allowing users to search for inflected forms, parts-of-speech categories and syntactic properties. In contrast, InfraNodus focuses on different types of metadata analysis, primarily using network analysis to identify topical clusters, betweenness centrality of words, and structural gaps in the discourse. While Google Books Ngram Viewer emphasizes linguistic metadata, InfraNodus emphasizes relational metadata between words and concepts in the text.","context":["The capability of search tools to retrieve words with specific properties from large text collections\nLiezl Ball, and Theo Bothma.\nIntroduction. With the increase in the availability of digital text collections for humanities researchers, tools to enable enhanced retrieval are required. If words with very specific properties could be retrieved from a text collection more accurate linguistic and other analyses can be made. There are a range of properties and metadata that could be specified for retrieval, from morphological data up to bibliographic data. Furthermore, the bibliographic data should not only be on item level but extended to the text-level. For example, in an anthology each section could be encoded with the author of that section. Such extended metadata will enable fine-grained retrieval.\nMethod. In this study, current tools were evaluated to determine to what extent they allow users to retrieve words with specific properties from a text collection.\nAnalysis. The analysis is limited to the following criteria: interface design, metadata, search options, filtering and search results.\nResults. Currently, it is not possible for a user to retrieve words with specific properties from a text collection.\nConclusion. An extended set of metadata should be used to encode text to enable retrieval of words on a fine-grained level.\nThe amount of digital text data available is increasing rapidly. Researchers from different disciplines are interested in using these data in their research. Though one might associate the use of large amounts of data with the natural sciences, researchers in the humanities are increasingly interested in the use of large digital collections for research. Some of the well-known large digital text collections include Google Books, Internet Archive and HathiTrust.\nThe availability of such data, and technology to process the data, are opening up new possibilities in the field of humanities (e.g., Howard, 2017; Nicholson, 2013; Rydberg-Cox et al., 2000). Some tools have been developed to help users to search for information in large digital text collections, for example the Google Books Ngram Viewer (https://books.google.com/ngrams). Using this tool, a user can see the usage frequency of a term over a period of time. Some interesting research using this tool has been done (e.g., Acerbi et al., 2013; Michel et al., 2011; Ophir, 2016).\nThough there are some exciting developments, there are some criticism against current tools and methods. For example, Google Books Ngram Viewer has been severely criticised for the lack of metadata (e.g., Koplenig, 2017). Furthermore, there are some additional features that could enhance the tools, specifically in terms of metadata. If texts are encoded with detailed metadata more powerful searches will be possible. Two examples will suffice. Morphological metadata could be added to enable a user to search for specific inflected forms of irregular verbs; or metadata could be used to indicate structures in a text. For example, if a document contains multiple languages, each section could be encoded with tags to specify the language of that section; this will enable a user to search for words in a specific language on a very detailed level. This means that texts need to be encoded on different levels, from metadata to indicate structure in texts to detailed morphological data.\nThis study forms part of a larger research project to determine how texts could be encoded on a detailed level to improve retrieval of words or phrases with specific properties from large digital text collections.\nThe first step in answering the broader question will be to examine the most popular tools used currently for the retrieval of words from a large text collection and answer the following question:\nTo what extent do current tools allow a user to retrieve words or phrases with specific properties?\nSignificance of the topic\nThis research makes an important contribution in the field of information seeking and use. The overwhelming amount of text data available will only be effectively utilised if useful tools are developed that enable users to retrieve the relevant information in terms of their information needs. This study focuses on the ability of users to retrieve words with specific properties from a text collection. By evaluating current tools, recommendations can be made for further development of advanced search tools used on large digital text collections. Improved tools can help researchers, authors, and other users to observe trends and analyse the results.\nExamination of tools\nSix tools that can be used to search for words (or phrases) in a digital text collection (corpus) are examined to determine to what extent a user can search for words or sections of texts with specific properties. The six tools that have been identified are the Google Books Ngram Viewer, HathiTrust+Bookworm, Perseus Project, Voyant Tools, TXM and BNCweb. These tools are used to search in large digital text collections. These tools are examined according to the following criteria: interface design, metadata, search options, filtering and search results. More criteria, such as complexity of use, help files and corpus design, could be considered in future studies. Key features in these categories are highlighted. It is beyond the scope of this paper to offer extensive detail of each tool.\nGoogle Books Ngram Viewer\nThe Google Books Ngram Viewer shows the relative frequency of words (or phrases) used over a specified period of time. The data used by this tool are from a selection of books from Google Books. An example of a search is shown in Figure 1. In this example the tool is showing all instances of well where it is a noun, of well where it is an adjective and where well modifies done.\n- Interface design: The interface is simple and intuitive to use. A user can simply enter a single word or phrase in the search field. An example search is available to demonstrate the use of the tool.\n- Metadata: The dataset is annotated with morphological and syntactic data.\n- Search options: Apart from entering a single word or phrase, a user can also compare terms by separating the terms by commas. It is possible to search for inflected forms, parts-of-speech categories and words that modify other words (syntactic properties). Truncation can be used to replace whole words in a search. Other search options are also available.\n- Filtering: It is possible to filter by date and language. The dataset includes eight languages. There is one subset for genre, which is the English fiction dataset.\nSearch results: The results are displayed in a graph. The results do not link to the underlying data directly and it is not possible to see examples in context. Below the graph are links to predetermined searches in Google Books for the search terms used in the specific search.\nThe HathiTrust+Bookworm) also visualises the frequency of words over a period of time, however a user can filter the results using bibliographic metadata. The data used by this tool come from the HathiTrust Digital Library. In Figure 2 a search for the terms carriage and chaise is shown. Filters, such as publication country, class and resources type, have been applied.\n- Interface design: The interface is clean and simple. A user can enter a search term in the input field and apply filters. More input fields can be added. An example search is available to demonstrate the use of the tool.\n- Metadata: Only bibliographic data are available.\n- Search options: Single word searches are allowed, but not searches for phrases. No truncation or other commands are available.\n- Filtering: There are 19 bibliographic filters that can be applied to each search term. There is an additional filter for date that can be applied to the entire search.\nSearch results: The frequency counts are shown on a graph. It is possible to click on a point on the graph and see a list of results for that point. The items in the list of results link to the texts in the digital library. However, it only links to the volume, not the term(s) in context.\nPerseus Digital Library\nThe Perseus Digital Library) was specifically developed to explore the possibilities of digital collections. The focus was originally on Greek and Latin material, but the collection has expanded. Figure 3 shows the results of a search for all forms of the Latin word suis, limited to the Greek and Latin collection.\n- Interface design: The interface is fairly simple. Descriptive labels are used for search options. However, it is presumed that the user has some knowledge of the type of materials in the collection.\n- Metadata: The texts in the collection are encoded with XML to indicate structures in the text, for example paragraphs. The texts are parsed to enable searching for inflected forms.\n- Search options: The general search options include searching for the occurrences of words in texts (as demonstrated in figure 3) or to search for more information about a single word. A user can also select a word as it appears in a text and link to more information about that word. Other search options are also available.\n- Filtering: Results can be limited to specific collections.\n- Search results: The type of results depends on the type of search. Either a list of instances where a word appears in context is returned, or more information about a word is returned.\nVoyant Tools) is a free, online tool for text analysis. Texts to be analysed are added by the user. The main page contains several panels, each with a different tool useful for text analysis (for example to view trends). Figure 4 shows a section of the tool.\n- Interface design: Voyant tools has a user-friendly interface, which consists of one platform with different tools.\n- Metadata: There are no specific metadata. Texts encoded in XML may be uploaded.\n- Search options: Some tools on the platform have a search option, where a user can search for a single word or a phrase. Some features are available to construct a query, for example, wildcard and proximity operators. Integration with XML is possible and XPath expressions can be used to select sections of an encoded texts when importing the texts.\n- Filtering: If using XML, then some form of filtering is possible.\n- Search results: Each tool will produce different results. Pertinent to this study is the tool that shows occurrences of words in a text in a graph and the tool that shows words in context.\nTXM is a free text analysis environment. One of the main aims was to be compatible with encoded texts (for example, texts encoded with Text Encoding Initiative). It is a powerful tool and it is beyond the scope of this study to offer an in-depth description of all the features of this tool. Specific features relevant to this study will be highlighted. Different corpora can be imported and studied. A query in the concordance is shown in figure 5. This example query searches for a sequence of four words, where the first word must be a verb, the second word must be le, the third word must be a noun and the last word in the sequence must end in an -e.\n- Interface design: It is a powerful tool with numerous features, and consequently the tool does not have a simple interface.\n- Metadata: Various levels of metadata are available. Bibliographic metadata are included for each text in a corpus. The structure of the texts that are imported may be encoded. Words may be annotated with morphological data.\n- Search options: Queries may be written in a query language, allowing for powerful queries. Truncation and wildcard characters can be used. It is possible to search for lemmas, part-of-speech categories, single words or phrases. It is also possible to search in textual structures, such as paragraphs, by using the tags used in the encoding. There are also query assistants which help a user to construct a query through using a graphical user interface.\n- Filtering: Filtering is achieved through the search options.\nSearch results: Various types of results can be retrieved. The concordance lists the retrieved instances in context. It is possible to link to more context.\nThe BNCweb (CQP-Edition)) is one of the tools that are used to explore the British National Corpus (BNC). The interface is simple, while allowing users to enter complex queries based on a corpus query language. The results of a search are shown in Figure 6.\n- Interface design: The interface is simple and intuitive.\n- Metadata: The data (BNC XML edition) include grammatical, structural as well as bibliographic data.\n- Search options: Various advanced search options are available. For example, there are wildcard characters to search for patterns or variations of words, one can search for a word form with a certain part-of-speech tag, lemmas, word sequences and within certain text structures that were encoded.\n- Filtering: Filtering is allowed according to the available bibliographic data.\nSearch results: The default option is to display retrieved instances in context. It is possible to link to more context and see information about the text the instance is from. Other display options are available.\nThere is increasing interest in using large digital text collections for research purposes. Several tools have been developed to allow a user to explore such data. These tools allow researchers to do more than what is possible using a general search engine. There are options to visualise trends, make selections based on morphological or syntactic properties, retrieve sections of encoded data or filter according to bibliographic data. However, there are several limitations in the tools currently available. Tools with simpler interfaces do not allow users to filter on a detailed level. Some tools allow very specific filtering but are complex. None of the tools in this study allows a researcher with little prior training or knowledge of encoding (such as XML), to search for words (or phrases) with specific properties in a large collection of texts and ideally view the usage frequency of the word(s) over time. More work should be done to determine what metadata can be used to encode texts to enable meaningful retrieval, and how a tool can use such metadata to support retrieval in an easy and intuitive manner.\nAbout the author\nLiezl Ball is a lecturer in the Department of Information Science at the University of Pretoria, South Africa.

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how insight can be produced for a certain domain of knowledge using InfraNodus text network visualization tool.\nWhile the exact definition of “insight” may vary depending on the context, it is generally associated with “aha” moments, problem-solving, new discoveries, and the ability to get an overview over a situation.\nVideo Tutorial (4 minutes):\nIn this particular example we will show how you can use InfraNodus to get insight about a particular topic of interest: “text network visualization”.\nClick the top left menu button, then choose the + add new graph menu option, name your graph, and click save.\nYou will be forwarded to the new empty graph window\nIn order to generate insight you need to start with something. You can:\nWrite a short abstract (300-500 words) describing your situation or problem\nCopy and paste your existing notes on a certain subject\nCopy and paste an existing article or a Wikipedia post on the subject\nImport Google search results on the subject\nFor the example below we will use InfraNodus to import the top 40 Google search results for the query text network analysis to gain some new insights on this topic.\n- Copy and paste the data or click the “import from search” button:\n- For our example, we will click on \"+ Search\" button and then type in the Google search query we want to visualize the results for: text network analysis\nAdd the name of the graph and then click “Import”…\nYour graph will be visualized as a network and you should open the Essence tab (top menu) to see the overview of the main results.\nHere are the main features you should know about. You can learn more in our tutorial on How to interpret network graphs.\nThe bigger nodes have a higher betweenness centrality. Those are the words with the highest influence in the narrative: they connect the different topics present within the text and have a high frequency.\nIn our example: text, network, analysis, method\nThe nodes that are closer to each other on the graph and have the same color comprise topical clusters. These are the words that tend to co-occur more often in the same context in your data.\nIn our example:\n1. network, analysis, text\n2. analyze, study, paper\n3. identify, graph, topic\n4. tool, word, post\nThis visualization and topic modeling feature of InfraNodus already gives us a good idea of the kind of discourse that happens online about text network analysis.\nWe can see people talk about methods, there are studies and papers on the subjects (so we can assume that this discourse occurs in the scientiic context).\nWe can also see that most of it is happening around the subjects of identifying topic graphs and also the tools used for TNA.\nSo the current discourse around TNA focuses on the methods, studies, and tools for topic modeling and most of it is happening in the scientific realm.\nIf you look a the list of topics identified by InfraNodus, you can see the topic #4: tool, word, post.\nWe don’t really know what it means, but using InfraNodus we can get exactly to the part of the data that mentions all of these terms to see what context they appear in.\nIn order to do that:\n- Select the words / nodes:\n- either by clicking the nodes on the graph, or\n- clicking them on the essence or analytics tab, or\n- entering them into the search pane below\nYou will then see the filtered version of the graph\nClick the Data tab in the top menu and you will see exactly the part of the text that contains all or most of the terms you selected:\nFrom the results above you can see that these clusters refer to the tools that allow one to build word clouds from user posts — a practical application of text network analysis.\nUsing the graph we can discover the gaps in the existing discourse, which will lead us to new ideas.\nIn order to do that, we click the Insight tab at the top menu. The InfraNodus algorithm analyzes the structure of the graph and detects:\n- which topical clusters are underdeveloped, and\n- not well connected together\nIt then proposes to bridge the structural gap between them by asking a question that would link these two clusters together.\nYou can try this on your data. To give an example, in our case:\nWe can see that there may be an interesting relation between\n- tool, word, post (the TNA apps and tools that create word cloud from posts)\n- identify, graph, topic (topic modeling using graphs)\nFor instance, we could ask a question: “is there any way to implement topic modeling into word cloud tools”? — this may lead us to a new idea or a new research direction.\nAnother powerful feature of InfraNodus is that it allows you to remove the nodes from the graph in order to see what’s hiding behind them. The algorithm will automatically recalculate the topical clusters and the most influential words, showing you the new results and highlighting the new structural gaps.\nFor example, you can click on the most influential words (and also very obvious) words, such as text, network, analysis:\nThe new topical clusters are automatically calculated:\n- analysis, study, research\n- identify, graph, topic\n- discourse, generate, bias\n- method, visual, propose\nNow we can discover the more specific parts of the discourse, which relate to discourse analysis and visual methods for data science.\nIf you click on the Insight tab in the top menu, you will see the new topical clusters and the proposed relation between them:\nIn our example, it’s a link between a scientific paper on the visual method for text network analysis that we wrote (it appeared in the search results) and a post on using discourse structure analysis to estimate bias we made in Towards Data Science journal. Therefore proposing that it could be interesting to link the two approaches or, as they are already linked (both were written by the same person), it could be interesting to publish a scientific paper on the discourse structure analysis method as an update to the earlier approach.\nI encourage you to try the methodology above on your own data and please, send me your feedback or questions — I would be curious to know how it works for you!\nHope you enjoy this tutorial!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:45e5bb56-4896-4e41-9faf-c8ab4e048d59>","<urn:uuid:6fed30d9-5869-4301-bde3-c06b64c356dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main features of Ethan Stiefel's 'Bier Halle' ballet, and how does it incorporate traditional Viennese music?","answer":"Bier Halle uses music by Johan and Josef Strauss, including the well-known Pizzicato Polka, and is set in a Germanic beer hall. The ballet features various character dancers including flirts, studs, a baker, a butcher, a local dignitary, a huntsman, and a beer maiden. The piece notably showcases Gillian Murphy as the Beer Maiden, who performs a Coppelia-like clockwork dance that transforms into a ballet princess-worthy display, including a majestic turn around the stage en pointe.","context":["Three new ballets in Made to Move made to entertain\nMade to Move\nRoyal New Zealand Ballet\nSt James Theatre\nAuckland - ASB Theatre\n8 - 10 March 2013\nTakapuna - Bruce Mason Centre\n13 - 14 March 2013\nPalmerston North - Regent on Broadway\n17 March 2013\nDunedin - Regent Theatre\n20 March 2013\nAshburton - Ashburton Trust Event Centre\n23 - 24 March 2013\nWith their latest triple bill, Made To Move the Royal New Zealand Ballet have premiered three new works which have a balance between the classical and contemporary and between the challenging and the dependable.\nJavier de Frutos’s work The Anatomy of a Passing Cloud is the one work which has the most obvious local connection. It is danced to the music of the Pacific and the costumes are strongly influenced by Pacific designs. While de Frutos has been inspired by his growing interest and love of Pacific music he is also aware of the political dimensions of colonization as they have affected both New Zealand and the Pacific. But he does not look at these aspects as some sort of social anthropologist, there is a personal dimension for him. “I was born in a former Spanish colony and Venezuelans have the habit of turning their backs on the indigenous and local and looking to Europe where they think things are better”\nIn many ways he is dealing with issues arising out of his own culture as much as the issues of the Pacific and its past “I have not thought of my interest in the Pacific as being some sort of ethnographic story, I just wanted to hear new music and sounds and see new landscapes and let that influence how I thought and out of that I created the new work.”\nLike his previous two works for the RNZB (Milagros and Banderillero) there is a strong element of ritual to the work and like Milagros there is more than a passing reference to The Rite of Spring.\nThe work initially seems to be celebratory but then takes on a more unsettling quality with the intense physicality leading to the men and women striking and abusing each other. At times their actions are a physical manifestation of the relentless drumming and then there are more tender responses to some of the sweet music of the Yandall Sisters.\nThe dancers work within a large circle of light, like the searing blast from a Pacific nuclear explosion or a clockwork mechanism or even a radio dial around which the dancers engage in fluid and elegant movement in which arms and legs are like fern fronds and falling leaves. At other times the work is suggestive of atomic particles colliding and ricocheting around the stage creating chain reactions of intricate movement.\nThe dancers respond to the music but there is also spoken word and the dancers respond with a primitive form of semaphore or signing.\nWhile the music is of the Pacific the movements and gestures are universal. At times the dancers seem to be responding in a Pacific style but at other times the dance could be traditional Indian dance or flamenco.\nThe final dance sequence is brilliant with a display by Abigail Boyle and Dimitri Kleioris who demonstrate an electrifying mixture of aggression and tenderness capped off with a profound backward contemplative glance by Boyle as she leaves the stage.\nAndrew Simmons’ work Of Days is a dance which focuses on the way dancers relate physically and emotionally to each other.\nHe has said that “When I planned it there were small recurring motifs started to appear – there is a man, a woman passes by and falls out of his arms. The four women, each saying goodbye, something has happened in their lives, but there is no story”\nInstead of a narrative Simmons has created an emotional environment which is calm, subdued and minimal. The body language of the dancers determine the emotional connections whether it people passing in the street or two lovers.\nIt can also be seen as a balletic essay on the nature of intimacy in dance. For an art form which has all the components of sensuality and physicality the display of intense intimacy is often conveyed with a sense of detachment. It is this ambivalence which the dance captures.\nThe work is much enhanced by some atmospheric lighting which highlights the dancer’s limbs, capturing the flex of muscles and the shapes made by arms and legs. This creates elegant patterns, at times the dancers seem to be on different trajectories and then at other times attracted by the gravitational pull of another dancer mirroring and reflecting their steps and movements.\nAny contemporary choreographer who suggested using the music of Johan and Josef Strauss for a ballet would be taking a big risk. The saccharine tunes and obvious rhythms of the waltzes and polkas could easily make for an underwhelming ballet.\nBut, Ethan Stiefel is a brave choreographer and his Bier Halle using the music of the Strauss brothers is a clever and delightful ballet.\nHe manages to make the work a homage to the Viennese music of the late 18th century, a classical appropriation, a kitsch work which is a pastiche of the sentimental and stereotypes as well as a crowd pleaser.\nHow the Royal New Zealand Ballet ends up with a Germanic beer hall dance on its programme is a mixture of influences. There is Stiefel's interest in the parallels between the beer hall culture and New Zealand’s own pub culture, there is his fascination with the polkas and waltzes of Vienna and there is his own German heritage.\nThe beer hall is peopled by a host of characters who provide their own individual character dancers, the flirts, the studs, the baker , the butcher, the local dignitary the huntsman and the beer maiden.\nGillian Murphy is the Beer Maiden and the ballet could have been designed merely to show off her extraordinary talents.\nIn the middle of the piece she takes to the stage to dance to the music of the well known Pizzicato Polka.\nThe music with its lively rhythms has her performing a Coppelia-like clockwork dance which morphs into magical display of dancing worthy of any ballet princess, ending with her providing a majestic turn around the stage en pointe.\nHer dancing with Qui Huan (The Hunter) is impeccable and his solo work show him to be a dancer of remarkable skill.\nThe comedic dancing of Kohei Iwamoto (The Bird) and Paul Mathews (The Nerd) were rumbustuous and entertaining while Laura Jones (The Baker) and Harry Skinner (The Butcher) gave some inspired dancing.\nAntonia Hewitt and Clytie Campbell as the two Flirts were nicely paired with the two Studs (Jacob Chown and Dimitri Kleiois) who provided great displays of athletic ability.\nThese three dances are a worthy trio to open this sixtieth year of the Royal New Zealand Ballet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1f90decf-549a-445a-86fc-c6b9df11598e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What kind of guitar did Joe Satriani teach while working at a guitar store in Berkeley?","answer":"Joe Satriani taught guitar lessons at a guitar store in Berkeley to make a living. He focused on teaching students how to navigate the fret board and how to feel the guitar, without pushing specific aesthetic approaches.","context":["Grateful Web Interview with Charlie Hunter\nGrateful Web recently had an opportunity to speak to guitarist, composer and bandleader, Charlie Hunter.\nGW: This is Dylan Muhlberg of Grateful Web here with jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter. We’re gonna catch up with him about his influences, his projects and what he’s got going on right now. Thank you so much for joining us Charlie.\nCH: Thank you for having me.\nGW: What were your musical influences from childhood?\nCH: So many different things. My mom had all these old blues records around the house and listening to the radio I took in a lot of soul music. Some of the more obvious stuff too like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.\nGW: Growing up in Berkeley, California, during High School, you received instruction and guidance from legendary guitarist Joe Satriani. What did you take away from learning from him?\nCH: He was just a local guitar teacher for everybody there in Berkeley. And it wasn’t unusual for me to take lessons from him. Because everybody did. So I was lucky that respect. He was a great teacher of showing you how to get around on the fret board and how to feel the guitar. He didn’t push any specific aesthetic things on me, just really how to get around on the guitar.\nGW: So was he well into his professional career at the time and was just volunteering his time for the students?\nCH: He wasn’t volunteering his time. He was making a living at the guitar store.\nGW: Got you. So you’re from a generation of incredible progressive jazz musicians that have furthered the medium beyond anyone’s expectation. Les Claypool, Stanton Moore, Skerrik, Will Bernard just to name a few. One unified link is that none of you seem to adhere to a certain style or genre. Why do you prefer to bend the idea of genre when you compose or play?\nCH: I don’t even think of it. You have your influences and you try to be honest. You listen to lots of different music and do your best to be as honest as you can about it.\nGW: Who are some of vital musicians in the jazz community that have either influenced your style of playing or inspired you to continue to play?\nCH: There are too many people to name. Everyone you come in contact with teaches you all the time. You’re just trying to learn as much as you can and have your ears open.\nGW: Getting back to your style of playing, you pick on bass and guitar harmonics simultaneously; genuinely performing what it takes two sets of hands to play for most. How did you develop such dexterity and that specific part of your style?\nCH: You just practice and practice. Constantly. And that’s just how it is. The more you practice the easier it gets. Every day I go out into my shed and I try to figure out how to get better. And that never stops.\nGW: The axe you perform on is a custom guitar built just for you that most closely resembles a bass guitar. How was it built in particular for you?\nCH: We’ll I had been evolving the idea of this guitar over the years. And I just tried to hone in on what I wanted more and more. My first one Ralph Novack made for me about twenty-five years ago at this point. I’ve been evolving that ever since. Jeff Traugott out of Santa Cruz, California made the current one I play on.\nGW: So is it a bass guitar?\nCH: No, I call it a seven-string guitar. It’s got most of the range of a bass and most of the range of a guitar.\nGW: I’ve truly never seen anyone play like you. I’ve seen musicians like Steve Bailey and Victor Wooten who know how to play on multiple harmonics but that performance last weekend [at Dazzle Lounge, Denver] was something.\nCH: Thanks Dylan. It always again comes back to lots and lots of practice, playing with great people, and getting you butt kicked. There’s really no other way to do it. No short cuts.\nGW: Last year for Grateful Web I interviewed guitarist John McLaughlin. I asked him to describe the creative task of composition. He told me it was too daunting of a task to articulate. That he didn’t consciously preconceive what was coming, but that melodic suggestions built into something larger eventually. When you compose do you have a particular approach or is it too daunting to articulate?\nCH: If I’m thinking about writing. I just work off of a nice melody and play on it until it’s done. [Laughs] And that’s about that.\nGW: I have to say that I first learned of you not through the New Orleans and New York jazz circuits, Denver’s scene is still developing…\nCH: You got tons of great musicians in Colorado in both Denver and Boulder. It’s no lie. You have Ron Miles and Greg Garrison. I’m not taking that man. [Laughs]\nGW: Right on. So the band that I discovered you through that you were part of for a while was Garage A Trios. You played side by side with some really killer players and common collaborators. All the members had extremely outgoing musical personalities. Was it challenging to collaborate with such hyper active personalities all at once?\nCH: No because they just did everything that I told them to [Laughs]. We’re just friends’ man. It was just having fun. And what you need to understand about a situation like that nobody runs the show. Nobody has invested everything into a certain idea or premise. Everybody just had a really good time.\nGW: Listening to Garage A Trios it definitely sounds like you guys were having a good time.\nCH: Yeah, it was great when we did it.\nGW: You have a new album out with drummer and old friend Scott Amendola, “Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead.” You’ve continued to collaborate with Scott over the years. Could you take about the project and playing with Scott?\nCH: Like you said he was on a bunch of my Blue Note records in the early days, and part of my quartet with Kenny Brooks and others. We worked together lot through the 90s and have always stayed in touch musically and otherwise. We’ve just been playing together for years so it seemed to come naturally.\nGW: What do you think about the separation of the higher musical integrity of the jazz community versus the jam band scene? Do you think things are best kept separate of that the two should coincide more often?\nCH: Basically there are two kinds of music. There’s good music and the other stuff. The goal is to make people feel good. However you do that is great. Just because the jam band music most of the time doesn’t work for me doesn’t mean for others it isn’t their jam.\nGW: I wanted to thank you for your time. Certainly a pleasure to watch you perform at Dazzle Lounge the other night and hope to see you in Colorado in not too long.\nCH: Great, can’t wait to come back."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e664f41a-a55e-4b78-bf59-8b93797971d3>"],"error":null}

Please list key characteristics.","answer":"The Brest Belarus nesting dolls feature specific design elements including natural faces, folded arms, fringe on babushkas, red dot lips, vests, and pointed heads on gnomes. In contrast, traditional Belarusian folk weaving is characterized by light linen fabrics with red patterns, predominantly geometric designs. The weaving typically combines bleached and non-bleached flax with red cotton wool threads. While the nesting dolls have a more figurative artistic approach, the Belarusian weaving demonstrates variety through different thread combinations and geometric patterns, particularly in traditional clothing and towels.","context":["“More Than They’re Stacked Up To Be” Stacking/ Nesting Dolls by Carol E.\nCarol had a very large display with these charming and beautiful dolls spread out with their multiple little ones of various sizes.

Their concept was to turn the nesting dolls into a symbol of Russia. They caught on in a big way and stacking dolls eventually became a trademark of Russian folk art. In 1900 Mamontov wife presented the first Matroyoshka (“mother”) Russian made nesting dolls at the World Exhibition in Paris.

D.","About the Museum\nThe Museum of the Belarusian Folk Art in Raubichi was opened at the end 1979. It is located in the former Krestogorsk Roman catholic church, built in 1862, and is located near by atheletic building on biathlone \"Raubichi\" 24 kilometers from Minsk.\nTo the moment of the creation of the museum Krestogorsk Roman catholic church, built in pseudo-Gothic style, was nearly completely ruined. Restoration was led by the group of architects of the Special research-and-production restoration workshops of the Ministry of Culture of the BSSR under direction of the Chief architect S. Drushits. Reconstruction of the building and designing of the equipment was realized by \"Belgiprotorg\" institute . The group was under direction of the Honoured Architect of the Republic V. Aladov. The first acquaintance of the visitors of the museum with public art begins already on stairway, leading to the constant exhibition. Two platforms of the stairway are equiped with special barriers-shop windows, which present dolls from flax in the national cloth and wooden coffers, inlaid with straw. From stairway spectators fall into introductory hall, where stand the wooden pews, long table. This premises is for the school occupations, work of the masters of the public art. Thence, the spectator come into the constant exhibition. In different years the Museum of the Belarusian Folk Art in Raubichi was headed by Tatiana Stepina, Valentina Pisarenko, Svetlana Krel, Olga Zalutskaya.\nThe exhibition of the museum introduces with traditional peasant art of the 16 - early 20th century and with works of modern masters, working in the most wide-spread type of the public art - weaving, pottery, carving and painting on wood, straw wickerwork and vines. The exhibits are in the closet-shop window of 2 meter height. Six small carrying shop windows breaks certain monotony of the utter shop-front line. The pews with cross-bar backs, decorated by carving occupy middle of the hall. The pews were organically inserted in the interior and terminated the decoration of the whole hall. When designing the museum it was immediately provided possibility for organization of the concerts. On the white background of the walls the dark furniture looks solemnly. The upper belt is more light: four forged chandeliers, solved in tradition of old-time lighting armature of the cult buildings, and stained-glass windows. The strict color combination of the black chandeliers and light arcs brighten the multi-coloured stained-glass windows, on coloring very close to the national folk weaving. Weaving is one of the most ancient types of folk art. Ways of processing flax and wool, technology and ways of weaving, types of cloth, as well as customs and rites, in which homespun tableclothes, towels, shirts, braided and weaved belts take significant place, were formed for centuries. Exhibition presents peasant suits of the late 19 - early 20th cc., towels and decorative fabrics of the 20th century from different regions of Belarus. Unique character of the public clothes is dictated by its purpose and local tastes. For Belarus it is traditional light linen fabrics with red pattern. Shirts, fronts, headdresses in the collection of the museum, in spite of traditional character of accomodation of the ornament and prevalence of the geometric patterns, varied and have brightly expressed regional particularities. Having all known techniques of fabrics, using basically combination of the bleached and non-bleached flax with red cotton wool threads, weavers obtained the amazing variety of the decor. Products from woolly fabrics - spreads and skirts - multicolored. They are executed by the most simple ways of the entanglement of threads. Variants are reached by the combination of the multicoloured threads. Appearance in the Belarusian village in the 80s of the 19th century of the factory fabrics and artificial dye staffs has to a considerable extent influenced upon coloring of fabric products and the nature of the cloth. The old-time fabric headdress of the towel type is displaced by factory silk, calico and woolly multicoloured kerchiefs. From factory fabrics - broadcloth, velvet, silk - the sleeveless jackets are made, decorating their by braid, deftly weaving in the pattern metallic buttons and knobs. Natural evolution of the ornament, coloring and technology of spread weaving. Their artistic look was formed in the first half of the 20th century. For modern fabrics is typical large ornamental forms and contrasting use of colour. Holy Gates of the late 18 - early 19th centuries is exhibited near traditional utensils. Master uses several elements of the wickerwork, from which forms the elaborated pattern from jagged strokes and squares of different sizes. A bit of bright colour broadcloth is in the middle of each square. Golden straw serves it as special setting, and the bit of colour fabrics begins to shine, as a semiprecious stone. Holy Gates is a certificate highly developed art of the straw wickerwork, which the Belarusian masters possessed from old times. Modern artists have saved the traditional handicraft industry. At fabrication of the small boxes and baskets they use the same ways of the wickerwork, as their predecessors in the 18th century . Art of the wickerwork in the Republic became actively develop for the last thirty years. The exhibition presents all known with old times ways of straw use in the artistic creative activity: aplique work on fabrics, home subjects, dolls, toys. Their creators work at different artistic enterprises of the Republic, each master has favourite subjects and images, attitude to the material. Belarusian masters contributed a significant contribution to the history of art of wood-carving. \"Belarusian wood-carving\" is mentioned in the document of the 17th century, when Belarusian carvers, decorating iconostasis at Izmailovo, Donskoy and Novodevichiyev monasteries, executing fretworks in the Kolomno palace, started to work under \"Chamber of carved and joiner's business\" in Moscow state. Works of the rural masters, who worked on order of their fellow-countrymen, from Negnevichy, Zabolotya, Mezhevichy: carved Holy Gates, sculpture of the 18th - early 20th centuries is of great interest at the recent exhibition. They, even at difference of the creative manners, saved general line, characteristic to all works of public masters. They are united by the knowledge of plastic characteristics of the material. By the end of the 19th century old-time art of wood-carving was saved only by separate masters. They cut sculpture for rural churches, as well as dolls for public theatre -batleyka. Great group of wood monuments forms the home peasant utensils and labour instruments. Already to the 11th - early 13th centuries Belarusians had all ways of wood processing - carving, cooper's craft, knew the lathe. Modern art of wood-carving is presented by works of the well-known in the Republic amateur carvers - A. Pupko, K. Olshevsky, K. Kozelko, who continued glorious traditions of the Belarusian carving. Potteries in the collection of the museum pertain the 20th century. But it is possible by them to form the image about the forms of peasant utensils and their use in the life of Belarusians in past. Pots and макитры for preparation of the food, tureens for meal, pitchers and milk jugs for milk, гляки and слоики for keeping of the products, whistles and clay toys of the master decorated in the most simple way, known by all potters of the world: обваркой, томлением, painting on terra-cotta surface, covering by glaze. Home potter's utensils of the Belarusians practically has no painting. Decorative effect is reached by elementary ways. The innate feeling of the form, professional possession of the material prompt the master necessary variant of decoration. Чернолощеная ceramics of Pruzhany, light, terra-cotta with red painting from concentric circle and \"commas\" containers of Gorodno, Gordok utensils, covered by liberally splashed by colour glaze on the form, it is rather various and attract, first of all, by its functionality and simplicity of decoration. Special group of monuments in the exhibition are works from Ivenets factory, which of small do-it-yourself artel changed in the leading centre of artistic pottery in Belarus. Works of one of the creators to artel in Ivenets - V. Kulikovsky, as well as I. Molchanovich, M. Zverko, A. Prokopovich, working in the tradition of old Ivenets ceramics and reviving the forgotten art of the fabrication of figured containers in the manner of ram, bears, bisons are presented in the museum.\nPublic art of the Belarusians is inimitable.

{"question":"How do the metaphorical representations of the soul differ between Keats' cricket and Whitman's spider?","answer":"The cricket in Keats' poem represents the continuity of nature's poetry through seasons, singing from the stove during winter and reminding listeners of the grasshopper's summer songs. In contrast, Whitman's spider represents a soul searching for connection, launching forth filaments into the vacant surrounding space. While both are patient creatures, the cricket maintains nature's existing harmony while the spider actively seeks to create new connections.","context":["John Keats’ Sonnet “On the Grasshopper and the Cricket” was written on December 30th 1816. Keats was born in England in 1795 and died of tuberculosis when he was just 25, by which time he had composed an astonishing amount of powerful poetry. This poem was written when he was 21. The poem was written as a response to a sort of competition between himself and his great friend, Leigh Hunt, as to who could write the best verse, in a short time, on a specified topic. Keats won on this occasion, although he generously avowed that he preferred the other poet’s attempt.\nKeats the poet delighted in and concretised nature using sensuous and detailed images. In this poem he gives tongue to a message which rings clear and true. The opening line of the poem begins with this assertion:\n“”The poetry of earth is never dead””\nAnd the first line of the sestet re-affirms this announcement:\nThe poetry of earth is ceasing never””\nWe are reminded repeatedly and aesthetically as only Keats can do, of the constant music of nature. Sometimes it’s the grasshopper’s song, and at others it’s the cricket’s chirp, come day or night, summer or winter. Thus nature and poetry become as one—a conviction dear to Keats.\nHe underlines forcefully that through the changing seasons, from spring to scorching summer through autumn to frost-biting winter, Nature’s poetry and music continues, ever-present. One must learn to discern the melody, the signature print of each season to appreciate natures’ unending continuity\nThe omnipresence of nature is forever enchanting, and bountiful, and her “poetry” is unspoiled, though the cyclic rhythm of the seasons comes and goes.\nThe Poetry of earth is never dead:\nWhen all the birds are faint with the hot sun,\nAnd hide in cooling trees, a voice will run\nFrom hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;\nThat is the Grasshopper’s—he takes the lead\nIn summer luxury,—he has never done\nWith his delights; for when tired out with fun\nHe rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.\nThe poetry of earth is ceasing never:\nOn a lone winter evening, when the frost\nHas wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills\nThe Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,\nAnd seems to one in drowsiness half lost,\nThe Grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.\nThe core theme of the poem is expressed by a contrast of the octave with the sestet, of the sonnet form. While in the octave, a hot summer is described, the sestet contains scenes of a freezing winter.\nIn the octave, Keats calls the grasshopper the poet of summer .On a scorching day when the blazing rays of the sun threatens to sap every drop of energy, the birds stop singing their delightful songs and seek refuge in the cool shade under the leafy boughs of the trees. Exhausted and languishing in the intolerable heat, they fall silent.\nEven so the music of earth does not stop, for it is at this hour that one can hear the tiny grasshopper. This little Grasshopper– “he takes the lead”, as his voice sounds from “hedge to hedge.” The luxurious summer heat does not deter his merriment and unflagging energy for fun.\nHe flits about in the air, filled with the fragrance of the freshly-mown grass in the meadows. When he is exhausted or a little breathless he rests beneath a pleasant cooling weed for a fleeting moment before resuming into song again with renewed vigour. Thus the little creature keeps alive the poetry of earth in the searing heat of summer.\nIn the sestet we find a different season and a new kind of poetry. Winter arrives with its icy touch, imposing a death-like silence on the surrounding landscape. Nature is now bleak and desolate, with a curtain of frost .The snow lies like a mantle on the ground and all creatures seek the shelter of their own homes .Even then, the tireless bard of winter keeps the music of earth alive.\nBreaking the painful silence of a long, cheerless winter evening, comes the Cricket’s shrill notes from somewhere near the stove. His joyous song permeates the air becoming louder every moment as the radiating heat from the stove warms the room. In contrast to the dull, lifeless weather, the happy chirping of the cricket sounds thrilling infusing new energy into ones soul .It reminds one that life exists and the silvery snow will soon melt once more to make way for the spring.\nThe poet describes the image of a man half asleep, beside the stove, lulled by the warmth of the fire and the monotonous drone of the cricket. He is about to doze off into a slumber. In this drowsy state, he hears the cricket’s high pitched notes drifting about in the air and mistakes it for the merry notes of the grasshopper singing gleefully among the hills on a warm mid-summer day.\nThe poet thus reiterates his belief in the continuity of the cycle of seasons– what the grasshopper starts in summer is carried on by the cricket throughout the long winter till the grasshopper takes over again with the re-emergence of summer. In this manner, nature continues the cyclic order of seasons with her very own minstrels taking upon themselves the responsibility of keeping alive the poetry of earth.\nThe sonnet begins with the speaker stating that the earth’s poetry never dies. In summer, the grasshopper runs among the hedgerows singing his song and then rests in the shade. In the frosty silence of winter, the earth’s poetry continues—now the cricket, singing from the stove, shrills a song that’s as warm and summery as the grasshopper’s music.\nThe speaker/poet appreciates nature in its most precise detail, his keen observation missing nothing. What he sees in nature is beauty at all times, under all circumstances, and it induces directly in himself, poetic expression of sensual power. Nature and poetry are almost interchangeable and he is convinced and perhaps wants to convey to the reader too, that neither will perish. The symphonies of earth are deathless.\nThe poem, it words and the way they are arranged, emanates a tone of admiration and a feel of softness. We come across a lot of “soft” consonant sounds such as ‘poetry’, ‘earth’, ‘birds’, ‘voice’, ‘hedge’, ‘luxury’ and other words that compel us to murmur the poem carefully when spoken aloud.\nThe speaker continues his argument of the continuing expression of poetry by presenting the reader with a winter example and a summer example as if to say, “Rain or shine, cold or hot, poetry persists.”\nThe title of the poem highlights the role of both Grasshopper and Cricket as main players. The Grasshoppers happiness never decreases while the Cricket’s warmth steadily increases, until the line between summer and winter blurs and one is aware of nothing except the beautiful melodies of both tiny creatures blending into one unceasing song.\n“The Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,\nAnd seems to one in drowsiness half lost,\nThe Grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.\nThe use of capitals for both the Grasshopper and the Cricket is thus of significance.\nThe structure and arrangement of this poem is of immense importance to Keats in helping him get his message through. This poem follows the structure of a Petrarchan sonnet and consists of an octave and a sestet. The starting lines of both the octave and sestet are similar, that is; “The poetry of the earth is never dead.” And “The poetry of the earth is ceasing never.” Keats does this as he wants to reinforce what he is trying to say and it also acts as a divider between the octave and the sestet.\nKeats refers to nature as “the poetry of the earth” because nature just like poetry consists of different elements, tones and voices and can be perceived in different ways by the interpreter. The octave describes summer and the grasshopper while the sestet describes winter and the cricket.\nThere are several examples of assonance through out the poem. To describe the summer, Keats uses words with an ‘o’ sound for example lone, stove, song and drowsiness and he uses words such as frost and wrought to describe the chilling sensation of winter. The shape of the poem also mimics the action of a falling leaf which again refers to the topic of natural beauty.\nKeywords – On The Grasshopper and The Cricket (3.1), On The Grasshopper and The Cricket Summary (1.5), Summary of On The Grasshopper and The Cricket (2.6), On The Grasshopper and The Cricket Analysis (1.2), On The Grasshopper and The Cricket (4.2), On The Grasshopper and The Cricket Meaning (1.9)","Boghani, a ed walt whitman: poems essay questions gradesaver, 16 august 2014 web cite this page a noiseless patient spider a child said, what is the grass.

{"question":"Which is more focused on personal interpretation - autoethnographic research or phenomenological research methodology?","answer":"Autoethnographic research is more focused on personal interpretation compared to phenomenological research methodology. Autoethnography explicitly embraces the researcher's personal experience and critical analysis as key components of the research process, requiring them to understand and interpret how experiences connect to broader political, social, economic, and cultural processes. In contrast, phenomenological research, particularly transcendental or psychological phenomenology, deliberately minimizes the researcher's interpretations and instead focuses on providing pure descriptions of participants' experiences. In phenomenological research, researchers must 'bracket out' their own experiences and perceptions, aiming to perceive everything freshly as if for the first time, while focusing primarily on describing rather than interpreting the participants' experiences.","context":["What does it mean to do autoethnography? What even is it? To the critics, autoethnography is rather disparagingly labelled ‘mesearch‘ and a form of personal story-telling that is far too narcissistic to be considered proper research. However, such a view tends to resolutely align traditional scientific objectivity with truth, and so personal accounts become far too unscientific to be able to produce generalisable results. But it is painfully obvious by now, that the truth has a rather variegated existence these days.\nMany urban cultural geographers (and indeed, those beyond the discipline) will utilise autoethnography in their own research: some of the most compelling (albeit not entirely unproblematic) research monographs of late have been autoethnographical; Alice Goffman’s ‘On the Run’ and Bradley Garrett’s Explore Everything come to mind. But we also teach it. Students are extremely receptive to it as a method, and not just because it can avoid anxiety-producing encounters with strangers in the field. I find that those students willing to embrace it properly will wield it as a potent critical weapon against the stifling striation of the contemporary city. Yet despite our best efforts in the classroom beforehand, there is always some confusion as to what constitutes autoethnography as a methodological perspective in the field.\nAutoethnography (which can embrace psychogeographic elements but is not synonymous with them) involves immersing yourself in the city with all the various human and nonhuman equipment at your disposal. Ellis et al (2011) argue that it is the combination of biography and ethnography. They argue that methodologically, it “must use personal experience to illustrate facets of cultural experience, and, in so doing, make characteristics of a culture familiar for insiders and outsiders” (ibid: 276). While being rather too insistent with their modal verbs, it is important to emphasise that this ‘cultural experience’ that is the focus of study, could be anything from the smell of a new book, to the ethnic diversity of an entire city neighbourhood. What’s important is that an autoethnographer describes and critically analyses that experience in light of the complex assemblages of which it is actively a part of, or marginalised as distinct from. Within urban studies, this means understanding the deep and rich fabric of city life, and how it contributes to, and is a symptom of political, social, economic, ethnic, technological, representational, mediated and yes, cultural processes (and all those unidentifiable processes in between).\nMuch to the dismay of some students, to undertake such a task then is far from easy. It requires a deep comprehension of how urban life is stitched together and how it can be torn apart; a comprehension that can only come about through exposure to that which has been analysed, written, filmed, recorded and/or represented before. It also requires the ability to add your own narrative to that with your own recording and representation. The medically normalised quintet of senses that form the traditional foundations of the sensing body is more or less enough. But extending this to non-human appendages (most readily a smart phone but it can be anything, it doesn’t have to be smart at all – I’ve always enjoyed etching the surfaces of random bits of the city) all adds to the experience and the potential for representational distortions one way or another. A recent study by Jackson et al. (2019) has exemplified this expertly with their multi-sensory ethnography of two sites in Peckham, South London. Their analysis critiques, extends and augments most vociferously the ‘vertical geographies’ literature, but they could have just as easily (and no doubt, just as poetically) talked further into the literatures on gentrification, ethnic diasporas, architectural geographies, identity politics or smart city development.\nSo, having spent the last few years leading Royal Holloway’s New York field trip – for which this most esoteric of methods has become a firm favourite among students – I wanted to re-familiarise myself with the method I so often extol. And so I put myself in front of myself as one of my students, embarking upon a quasi-psychogeographic, but no less autoethnographic walk down Roosevelt Avenue with a colleague of mine, Dr. Ben Newman. In so doing, the hope was to understand in a little more detail part of the city I seldom visit, and, as Ellis et al (2011) inspire us to do, to ‘make its characteristics familiar to insiders and outsiders a like’.\nI say psychogeographic, only in so far as it was an unplanned walk after a spot of lunch. The morning had been spent wondering around Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, a site constructed for the ’39 and ’64 World’s Fair. It’s a place steeped in rather laconic historical voices that speak of googie-soaked utopian visions of an exciting near-future (see Figures 1 and 2). A gaze that we can retrospectively say was totally naïve (given the privatised and narrow-minded world that has been created since), but one that is no less in dire need of resurrection.\nAs inspiring as that place was, it’s for another post. Our lunch was consumed at a Columbian bakery under the 111th St Station on the 7 Line, after which a quick stretch of the legs was required rather than long buffeting subway ride back to Manhattan. It became clear that the long stretch of Roosevelt Avenue that cut a gun-barrel straight route through Queens toward Williamsburg was an ideal place (in the most Doreen Massey-full sense of that word as I can possible emphasise) for an autoethnographic engagement, but one that was elicited from the five senses that are available to me as a fully-abled human.\nThe first thing that imposes itself on yourself was the palimpsest of transport infrastructures that entraps the flow of both fleshy and machinic bodies (see the video below). The elevated train line is oppressively low, with the vanishing point between it and the road frustratingly (from the point of view of the urban voyeur on the hunt for that perfectly geometric photo) out of sight.\nThe shop frontages begin to invade the consciousness, begging the urban scrapbooker to be captured either photographically or at the very least, in a stand out memory (see Figures 3 – 8). Visually, their varying colours, arrangements of displays, locations on or off the street, shapes and accessories create a kaleidoscopic vision of an urban realm that mixes the globe together into one intersection. As Massey (1991: 29) stated “places do not have single, unique ‘identities’, they a full of internal contradictions”. Sure. I mean, to see a Man City flag (Figure 7) fluttering away certainly brought up my own internal conflicts…\nAurally, Roosevelt Avenue was cacophonous. Ben and I struggled to hear each other at times, particularly when passing the major arterial surgery that was being performed on the 7 Line above by MTA engineers (listen to the clip below). But as we fell silent, the soundscape of the city enveloped us, and we ruminated just how much of the city as an entity was experienced via aural features alone. The blare of Latin beats bleed into the drone of car horns which segues into the shouts of angry pedestrians which was drowned out by the screech of the subway car above; the intoxicating mix of the urban soundscape evidences how everyday urban life takes up so much mental bandwidth that we have become so accustomed to blocking out. So if either of us ask students to be quiet and not talk to each other on future urban walks, you’ll know why. Indeed, sound walks are a tried and tested, but perhaps under-utilised cultural geographic method (see Butler, 2006, 2007). I was also struck about how people who lack the ability to hear may have felt this sound as it certainly resonated deep within my core, something that a revisiting of ‘sound’ walks as a method may do well to uncover perhaps?\nOlfactory (and if particularly potent, gustatory), the route was a mix of exotic fruits, vaporising bitumen, cooking meat, car fumes, perfumeries, and that metallic smell that you get near subway stations and knackered old train cars. If there was one urban smellscape that could overcome the lingering taste of the amazing Colombian lunch we’d just had, then it was this inner-city New York thoroughfare.\nTactually, the pounding of my feet (couched in the ever-so-slowly wearing down trainers) against the pavement produced a rhythm that began to take over any conscious attempt to control it. The encounter with each new crosswalk (as tends to happen in New York) blended into one totalising affective experience of traversing the city. The rhythm and pacing of walking, waiting, then walking again combines with the subtle (often) precognition of gauging whether you can make the opposing sidewalk with only 05 left on the pedestrian sign. Also, as you scour the terrain beneath your feet, obstacles have to be overcome, potholes require navigation, and errant trash cans need to be avoided (Fig 9).\nTiredness overtook us, and as we reached Jackson Heights station, it seemed like as good a terimus as any to reintegrate ourselves into the transportation infrastructure. Once in the carriage lurching back toward Manhattan, I gaze out upon the cross-cutting networks of transportation sprawling beneath the elevated track (Fig 10 and 11). Being carried – almost gliding – over the cacophonous, polychromatic and multi-sensory city below, I begin to refer back to Sharon Zukin’s theorisation of ‘authenticity’ (Zukin, 2008, 2010). I wondered whether what we had just traversed was part of the ‘lost soul’ of New York that she so eloquently describes, or part of the reimagining of a newer, but no less sensory authentic urban experience?\nWhich ever of those I chose to land on, it took an autoethnographic study to find out…","Phenomenological Research is a kind of qualitative research.\nIt’s a qualitative research.\n- It describes the meaning for several individuals of their lived experiences of a concept or phenomenon.\n- Phenomenologists focus on describing what all participants have in common as they experience a phenomenon.\n- The purpose of phenomenology is to reduce individual experiences with a phenomenon to a description of a universal essence (grasp of a very nature of the thing) (van Manen, 1990).\n- This human experience may be phenomena such as insomnia, being left out, anger, grief, etc.\n- The researcher then collects data from people who have experienced the phenomena, and develops a composite description of the essence of the experience for all of the individuals. This description consists of ‘what’ they experienced and ‘how’ they experienced it (Moustakas, 1994).\n- Researchers first turn to a phenomenon that seriously interests them. They reflect on essential themes, what constitutes the nature of the lived experience. They write a description of the phenomenon, maintaining a strong relation to the topic of inquiry and balancing the parts of the writing to the whole. Then the researcher tries to interpret the lived experience or phenomenon.\n- Moustakas’s (1994) transcendental or psychological phenomenology is focused less on the interpretations of the researcher and more on a description of the experiences of the participants. Transcendental means: everything is perceived freshly as if for the first time.\n- The type of problem should be one in which it is important to understand several individuals’ common or shared experiences of a phenomenon.\n- These lived experiences and phenomena are conscious and directed toward an object.\n- In a psychological or transcendental phenomenology, the researcher must bracket out his own experiences.\n- Data are collected from the individuals who have experienced the phenomenon.\n- Data collection is usually done through in-depth interview or multiple interview with the participants.\n- Observations, journals, art, poetry may also be used to collect data.\n- The participants are asked two broad and general questions: (1) what have you experienced in terms of the phenomenon? And (2) What contexts and situations have typically influenced or affected your experiences of the phenomenon?\n- Building on the data from the first and second research questions, data analysts go through the data and highlight ‘significant statement’ sentences or quotes that provide an understanding of how the participants experienced the phenomenon. Moustakas (1994) calls this stage “horizonalization’. Next the researcher develops clusters of meaning from these significant statements into themes.\n- The significant statements or themes are then used to write a description (not interpretation) of what the participants experienced (textural descriptions). They are also used to write a description of the context or setting that influenced how the participants experienced the phenomenon (imaginative variation or structural description).\n- From the structural or textural descriptions, the researcher then writes a composite description that presents the ‘essence’ of the phenomenon called ‘the essential or invariant structure or essence). This passage focuses on the common experiences of the participants. It is a descriptive passage, a long paragraph or two and the reader should come away from the phenomenology with the feeling."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:790820a9-b088-4ec7-92ef-1c8e1fbb47b0>","<urn:uuid:4f53c048-3cf7-495b-939b-1e48889ce485>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the role of midwives in Italy historically empower women during childbirth, and what modern support systems like doulas are now filling this traditional caregiving gap?","answer":"Historically in Italy, midwives had professional autonomy in community-based practices and were highly respected by their communities before the 1950s. They established individual relationships with women over time and managed childbirth independently. However, this changed dramatically with the medicalization of childbirth in the 1950s-60s, when midwives became hospital employees under medical supervision. Their autonomy was further reduced in 1978, and by 1999, they lost their 'professional' status entirely. Today, this traditional caregiving role is being filled by professionals like postpartum doulas, who provide crucial physical, educational, and emotional support to new families. Doulas help with breastfeeding, newborn care, household organization, and emotional support for both parents. Research shows their presence leads to greater parental satisfaction, fewer mood disorders, and better breastfeeding success, effectively providing the personalized care that midwives once offered.","context":["Let’s travel to ancient Rome to explore the theme of natality by focusing on birthing – the natal event in which a new person enters the world. As a result of each natal event is that the world is forever changed; it can never be the same again.\nMy lens is focused narrowly on parturition from the perspectives of the mother and the midwife who brings a child to light. Like Janus, I look back to the Roman culture of antiquity for mythology and ritual related to childbirth and midwifery, and I look ahead in time to note the diminished role of midwifery in contemporary Rome.\nOne of the practices of ancient Roman culture was to secure patriarchy by recognizing legitimate children born in legal marriage. The myths and rituals related to childbirth recognized the risk that women undertook to ensure the continuity of the human community. It also reflects the cultural value placed on child development, a value that is reflected in the Montessori Method and Italy’s current system of nursery schools.\nItalian immigrants arrived in Canada in the early 20th century, bringing their midwives with them. There were three factors that supported the continued use of midwifery among Italian immigrants: personal preference for midwives, lack of doctors who spoke Italian, and lack of funds for hospital births (Declercq & Lacroix, 1996, p.386).\nIn Rome today, the medical profession manages the risk of childbirth while midwives struggle to be recognized as a legal occupation. Prior to the medicalization of childbirth in the 1950s and 1960s, Italian midwives had professional autonomy in community-based practices and enjoyed the respect and confidence of the communities they served. After the 1960s, midwives became hospital employees subject to medical supervision: “The control exercised over pregnancies and labour by gynaecologists destroyed the individual relationship established over time between women and their midwives.” In 1978, Italy introduced deep changes to the health system which further reduced Italian midwives autonomy and function and in 1999, a new health reform law abolished midwives “professional” status (Spina, 2013, np). This massive culture change took only fifty years and illustrates Haarmann’s postulate: “If innovation is the product of a thinking oriented exclusively toward technological advance, then the knowledge that is constructed upon it defies the appreciation of the usefulness of knowledge related to natural phenomena and is in conflict with it” (Haarmann, 2007, p.259).\nMyth, Ritual, Symbol and Sign in Italian Culture\nRecognizing that birthing was a high risk event, the ancient Romans created a pantheon of spiritual helpers to protect mother and babe at every stage of parturition and child development. Juno Lucina was the primary deity of childbirth and she was invoked for an easy delivery and healthy child (Figure 13). When parturient mothers invoked Juno Lucina, they let their hair down and loosened their clothing to symbolize removal of constrictions that might obstruct labor. Juno predates the founding of Rome; she was a deity familiar to many ancient Italian cultures.\nMany cultures have deities who preside over childbirth in recognition of its risk and its importance to cultural continuity. In North African cultures, Tanit/Neith, as Opener of the Ways, opens the cosmic pathways so that new soul could be born (Iles, 2007, np; Griffis-Greenberg, np). This function was also assigned to Greek Athena. Other Greek goddesses of childbirth were Artemis, Hecate as midwife, and Eleithyia who wields a torch or raises her arms to summon a child to the light. On Malta and in Carthage, Juno Caelestis was merged with Tamazight Tanit and Canaanite Astarte in the cultural transition from Canaanite (Punic) era to the Roman era because the three goddesses presided over births and were associated with light (Stuckey, 2009, np). Childbirth is a primary function of Buryatian Umai and Hindu Uma. Ixchel is a Mayan goddess of childbirth, lunar cycles, and pregnancy. Pi-hsia-yuan-chun is a Chinese goddess who presides over birth. Tamayorihime is an ancient Japan Sea Goddess who watches over the birth waters to ensure a safe delivery. Yemaya is a Nigerian Goddess Of Beginnings and Mother of Waters who watches over the birth of children and protects children during childhood. Freyja is a Nordic goddess associated with easing childbirth. Ninhursag is the Sumerian Womb Goddess and midwife of the gods. Sheela-na-gig means ‘to open’.\nThe culture of ancient Rome is rich in birthing ritual. The Temple to Juno Lucina on the Esquiline Hill was dedicated in 375 BCE. The grove and temple were public spaces, open to men and women, and according to Dolansky, Ovid may have actually witnessed the rites that he bids women to perform in the following set of directives:\n- Bring flowers to the goddess: in flowering plants this goddess delights.\n- Garland your heads with delicate flowers.\n- Say, “Lucina, you have brought us all to light.”\n- Say, “Come; answer the prayers of a woman in labor.”\n- But if any of you is pregnant, let her loosen her hair\n- and pray that the goddess gently ease her delivery\n- (Ovid [Fast. 3.253–258] trans. by Dolansky, 2011, np).\nThe temple and grove on the Esquiline were linked to several rituals related to childbirth. A Roman father donated a coin at Juno Lucina’s temple, in accordance with an ancient ritual begun by Servius Tullius in the sixth century BCE. The Matronalia festival on March 1 honoured motherhood and on that day, married women made procession to the temple to Juno Lucina (Dolansky, np).\nWhen a woman entered labour, it was custom to place a key, symbol of Janus, in her hand with the aim of ensuring an easy delivery (Figure 14). Janus is the keeper of gates; he guards all passages, particularly those related to time and motion. At parturition, he is invoked to open the birth passage.\nLanguage is the most complex of signs, so I chose to focus on the layers of meaning in the word “Lucina”. Juno Lucina, Goddess of Childbirth, brings a child into the light. ‘Lucina’ derives from Latin lux, which means “light” or “daylight”. Other words from this Latin root are lucid and luminous. Some scholars suggest that Lucina is derived from lucus, meaning grove, because her grove had an ancient and celebrated tree at which offerings were made after a birth, but this interpretation limits Juno Lucina to Rome. I accept that Lucina derives from lux meaning light. Furthermore, Lucina is an epithet for Diana in her capacity as a childbirth goddess, and together Juno and Diana Lucifera are sometimes known as the Lucinae.\nBirthing – exploring the process of bringing to light\nIf cumulative cultural knowledge is concentrated into myth and handed down from one generation to the next, then the ancient Romans compiled their scientific and psychological knowledge about the birthing process and concentrated it in a body of myth that was used for generations by birthing mothers and midwives. Here are some of the many deities that played a role in the birthing process. Juno Lucina, Goddess of Childbirth, is the primary deity presiding over the delivery and is responsible for bringing the newborn to the light. Diana, the Roman equivalent of Artemis, is Opener of the Womb and watches over childbirth (Gimbutas, 1999, p.156). Carmenta, patron of midwives, arrives with Prosa, Postverta and Egeria. Together, they are known as the Carmentae. Prosa assists in normal births when the baby presents head first and Postverta assists if the baby presents breech. Egeria determined the fate of the child. Parturient mothers and midwives made sacrifices to the Carmentae to petition her to bring out the baby without difficulty (Turcan, 2001, p.19). The Parcae are three goddesses of fate related to birthing. Nona and Decima determine the right time for birth, assuring the completion of the nine-month term while Partula oversees partus, the initial separation from the mother’s body. Levana, like Artemis, is the goddess who aids the midwife in lifting the baby and laying it on the ground where the midwife cuts the umbilical cord in a symbolic ceremony of connection to Earth. Vaticanus ensures the baby’s first cry. While the midwife swaddles the child and presents it to the mother (Calame, 2001, p.167; Turcan, 2001, p.20), Juno Februa delivers the woman of the placenta (Turcan, 2001, p.19).\nThe Roman pantheon had deities to help a mother nurse her babe, to strengthen the baby’s bones and to teach it to eat and talk. Just as Umai watched over a child’s first years, Roman deities protected and assisted a child to ensure healthy development. Haarmann postulates that mythology is cultural knowledge that endures intergenerationally when it demonstrates usefulness (Haarmann, 2007, p.204f). The ancient Roman myths of birthing deities demonstrated usefulness for generations because they were a repository of the culture’s scientific knowledge about the birthing process.\nSuperposing Christianity on ancient Rome would have altered birthing and midwifery practises. By 337 CE, paganism was criminalized. In 371 CE, the Edict of Intolerance permitted persecution of pagans and destruction of temples. By 431 CE, Christian leaders, realizing they could not eradicate pagan devotion to female deities, elevated Mary as “Mother of God”. Churches dedicated to Virgin Mary were built on the sites of the demolished goddess temples: Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore (432 CE, see photo) occupies the site of Temple to Cybele near the former Temple to Juno on the Esquiline (see map below). Basilica Santa Sabina on the Aventine (432 CE, see map below) is located adjacent to the site of Temple to Juno Regina and appears to have re-used 24 marble columns from that temple. Is Mariology merely a thin veil overlaying the ancient cosmology of the Great Mother – a covert syncretism?\nWhen Arendt focuses her philosophy of natality on politics in the public sphere, she “places it within a masculinist tradition” (Tyler, 2009, p.1). She viewed women’s labour in childbirth as hidden in the private sphere of the household. Imogen Tyler breaks with Arendt when she writes, “Birth has been systematically disembodied and appropriated by scientists, philosophers and artists.” (p.2). Tyler answers Arendt by rethinking birthing from the perspective of the public sphere. She observes that women are no longer confined to the private sphere, but they can enter the public sphere of employment or politics only by splitting and disavowal of their maternal capacity and responsibilities (Tyler, p.2). Tyler’s thesis is that feminism needs to find ways to hold birth and those who give birth at the centre of politics (p.3). She advocates the use of art in public places, particularly medical places, to indicate “a political aesthetic in which the birthing woman is resolutely the active subject and not the abject object of the birth scene” (p.4). This type of ‘coming out’ has the effect of ‘bringing to light’ – making public that which was private in order to give it voice. Tyler’s innovative notion of matricentric politics needs a matricentric cosmology in order to give it coherence in contemporary Western society where patriarchy has become increasingly covert.\nNaomi Goldberg argues that a simple lie must be maintained for patriarchy to function. “This lie is the denial of the womb that gives us birth. The lie of patriarchy is that the Father is the only true parent” (cited by Christ, 1997, p.67). The patriarchal lie that the mother is merely “the furrow for the seed man plants was ‘repeated by Aristotle and influenced western scientific views for centuries” (Christ, p.65).\nIn summary, the scientific knowledge of the birthing process was contained in the mythology of birthing deities. The value on healthy child development embedded in the ancient myths is alive in contemporary culture, in spite of the medicalization of childbirth. What were the value and knowledge shifts that caused Roman culture, like other Western cultures, to relinquish birthing to an impersonal and secular medical system? I conjecture that the contemporary culture of Rome places its faith in the medical system because it produces a higher rate of natality or live births. When mythology is used as a repository of scientific cultural knowledge, it requires continual critical thinking and renewal in order to remain current, relevant and useful. Failure to refresh the body of myth with new knowledge about birthing would reduce the usefulness of the myth in the birthing process. Failure by midwives to apply critical thinking to birthing myths could manifest as superstition. An outdated science performed in blind faith could deteriorate into superstition, similar to the blind faith of Christian fundamentalism that resists critical thinking by insisting on a literal approach to sacred texts.\n|Temple to Juno Regina on Aventine Hill near current site of Santa Sabina church.||Temple to Juno on Palatine Hill adjacent to Augustus’ palace.||Temple to Juno Lucina on Esquiline Hill close to current Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica.|\nSee Reference page for details on citations.","Pregnancy, childbirth, and becoming a new parent present times of challenge and development, whether it be for the individual or the family. Annemarie van Oploo once shared, “Childbirth is a time when a woman’s power and strength emerge full force, but it is also a vulnerable time, and a time of many changes presenting opportunities for personal growth” (Schwegel, 2005). A new addition to the family requires extra physical, educational, and emotional support. A postpartum doula provides this care by offering a helping hand, a listening ear, and a plethora of resources. Her presence is invaluable and truly makes a difference in the lives of many new families.\nThere are multiple benefits to hiring a postpartum doula for the first few months after baby’s birth, a time also known as “the fourth trimester.” Research indicates that those who hire a postpartum doula make an easier transition at home after baby is born, which ultimately affects family members’ physical and emotional health. These individuals also experience greater parental satisfaction and fewer mood disorders (DONA, 2002). More specifically, families who acquire the help of a postpartum doula experience greater success with breastfeeding, greater self-confidence, and a smaller incidence of postpartum depression (DONA, 2002). The postpartum doula not only “mothers the mother,” but she also tunes into all family members’ needs. In fact, when the postpartum doula “mothers the father,” he is better able to take care of his partner so that she can adequately provide for and nurture their baby. For example, a large factor in breastfeeding success is a supportive partner (Giugliani, 1994). Simple acts such as partner providing snacks, extra pillows, and words of encouragement aid mothers in achieving successful breastfeeding relationships with their babies.\nIt is crucial that women and their families receive postpartum support, especially in North America. Our culture highly values independence, which in turn may lead many individuals to think they must handle their personal issues alone. Unfortunately, this matter carries over into the postpartum period and influences our society’s ideals of the “perfect parent.” The postpartum doula fills this void and prevents isolation from occurring. She becomes a crucial asset in certain situations: The family having no friends or family nearby to help, the mother experiencing a difficult birth, the mother giving birth to a premature baby or multiples, etc. The doula helps to foster a support system that families can utilize in the present and future.\nAccording to DONA’s Standards of Practice, the postpartum doula provides support after the baby’s birth as well as up to three months in the family’s home. Certified postpartum doulas affiliated with DONA have completed a 27-hour workshop training, read an extensive list of books pertaining to the postpartum period, and created an informative list of local and national resources. They understand newborn characteristics and basic care, help with breast and/or bottle feeding, assist with light household organization and meal preparation, and provide sibling support if applicable. Their services have been evaluated by at least three families as well as a healthcare professional. Although she does not provide medical assistance, a postpartum doula can make referrals for other professionals if needed. A doula is a generalist, but she has the power to connect families with other experts in the community, helping families to feel cared for and educated.\nAccording to DONA’s Code of Ethics, every woman who desires to have a doula should be able to have one. Doulas should set reasonable fees when working with clients. If a doula is not available for a mother who requests postpartum assistance, it is that doula’s responsibility to refer the mother to other doulas who are available (either through local resources or DONA). Follow-up with new moms is crucial in order to ensure they get the help that they need and deserve. When a doula decides to work with a client, she must demonstrate dependability. This involves creating and sharing a contract that discusses services provided, back-up support, refunds, fees, etc. Doulas should always maintain confidentiality when working with their clients. This simple action illustrates respect of privacy and will allow a mother to feel more secure in the care of her doula.\nDad and baby, skin-to-skin.\nBringing a new baby into the home not only presents physical challenges, but emotional and mental ones as well. Yes, all moms will have to recover from childbirth and experience sleepless nights, but they, along with other members of the family, will have to adjust their roles, too. Women are now mothers, men are fathers, and the only child is now a big brother or sister. Luckily, this transition will not be as unsteady with a postpartum doula’s guidance. Doulas steer new parents in their new roles as caretakers. When the doula models, demonstrates, and explains certain behaviors and techniques, parents (and siblings) receive concrete instructions and develop coping skills for working with the new baby (Kelleher, 2002). In this way, family members learn how to bond with and integrate baby into their family unit. By providing a nonjudgmental outlook, reassurance, and evidence-based information, the doula fosters independence and confidence in new parents. She helps them to feel empowered and adequate for this challenging yet rewarding new responsibility. Every family will benefit from a postpartum doula’s practical, yet special touch. A doula truly makes the difference!\n*All content written and compiled by Lindsey Rupp. Please contact me before using anything found here.*\n\"DONA International – Code of Ethics for Birth Doulas.\" DONA International. 2005.

{"question":"How does the scientific collaboration process differ between atmospheric polar research teams and planetary exploration teams like those working on Voyager?","answer":"In polar atmospheric research, collaboration happens through on-site interaction between experimental groups and theorists who help with mission planning and data interpretation. They work together via a large LAN network with over 200 nodes to share data products and communicate. For Voyager, collaboration occurred between different specialized teams - like the radio science support team and infrared instrument team - who worked independently on their specific aspects but shared data and findings. The Voyager teams also had longer timelines between major events (like planetary flybys) compared to the more frequent flight missions in polar research, where weather conditions and daily planning play a crucial role in operations.","context":["A Most Excellent Adventure\n(click on pictures to enlarge)\nData Analysis and Theory\nHaving an instrument perform on a research aircraft is only a small step in the process. The data collected have to be analyzed and interpreted. Each experimental group generally does its own data analysis and some of its own interpretation. Running an instrument and analyzing data on one of these missions is more than a full time job. So, some theorists actually come into the field to help with mission planning and data interpretation. Most of these theory teams run models in order to predict the future of the chemistry of the atmosphere. However, in order for the model to predict accurately, it has to be consistent with the data that is being gathered. It is a never ending process between measurement and theory to fine tune a model so that it will give an accurate prediction.\nWe are connected to a huge LAN (local area network) with over 200 nodes. That network is in turn connected to the WAN (wide area network) via a high speed line to Stockholm where it eventually reaches you. This not only allows data products to be moved back and forth between Kiruna and the various home bases, but allows the people here to keep in contact via email. This sequence pictures some of the experimenters working on their data after a flight or doing email. Picture A shows Bob with the JPL water instrument . B shows Bob and David with the Canadian CPFM instrument. Picture D is of Dave with Georgia Tech, while E shows Karena and Suresh from Cal Tech all of whom are associated with the CIMS instrument.

Picture H is the bulletin board with some of the data and reminders for the NOy/ACATS team. Picture I shows Dale and Pavel from ACATS reducing data while J shows some of Pavel's IDL code and graph.\nOne of the most important aspects of a mission like this, is the mission planning. This planning includes what is interesting scientifically as well as the local and enroute weather for the airplane. The ER-2 is a very specialized aircraft with long, glider-type wings, and a skate-board type landing gear. The runway braking conditions and crosswind conditions are very important for the safety of the flight. Whereas, these conditions can be determined in real time at take off, the landing conditions have to be forecast. There is sparse satellite and ground observational data available for this remote location, so Greg, the forecaster, has to rely on several model predictions as well as a few polar orbiting satellite images. Even with modern technology, the remoteness of Kiruna requires that Greg fine tune things as he goes along with regards to the influence of the Norwegian mountains to our west.\nOne of the aspects of operating in this polar region during the winter is to be close to the polar vortex which is a large circulation pattern of stratospheric air that circulates the polar region. The ER-2 typically does an eight hour flight. At 400 knots the ER-2 can only get 1600 nm away from base, so it has to based relatively near the phenomenon of interest. Therefore, when doing experiments that involve the polar vortex, details of that vortex on a day to day basis is important. Satellite images along with models that track air parcels are used to determine where the next flight track should be. Picture A shows Leslie and Randy from NASA Goddard studying a computer output.

Linda Spilker continues to work on the Cassini mission, exploring Saturn, its moons and its rings, documented in PBS NOVA’s DEATH DIVE TO SATURN. Both programs air on PBS Wednesday, September 13 (check local listings for times).\nAs their surnames suggest, the Doctors Spilker are married to one another. Linda Spilker wears a ring, designed by Tom Spilker in honor of their twentieth wedding anniversary that depicts Saturn surrounded by its rings.\nASSIGNMENT X: Did you meet while working on the Voyager project, or did you already know each other?\nTOM SPILKER: No. We met after the Voyager project.\nLINDA SPILKER: We were both working at JPL, and we met after Voyager had ended for both of us. We both worked on Voyager through the Neptune fly-by in 1989, and then we didn’t meet and get married until 1997. We have a lot in common.\nAX: What was your role on Voyager?\nTOM SPILKER: I was with the radio science support team as a graduate student, and we did things to make sure that the radio science experiments that we did at each one of the planets worked out properly.\nLINDA SPILKER: I worked on Voyager as the experiment rep for the Infrared Instrument. That just meant I was the interface between JPL and the science team. I really had a lot of fun with that. I had just gotten out of college when I started at JPL, and I learned so much about what Voyager was doing, and really, really enjoyed that opportunity, and actually used Voyager data to write my PhD thesis. I went back to UCLA, used Voyager data of the occultations of the rings, watching as a star goes behind the rings. So I feel really a connection, since I used that data for the next step in my career.\nAX: What did the data illustrate?\nLINDA SPILKER: For the rings [of the planets], it showed an incredible amount of detail. We [originally[ thought the rings were just these bland sheets of material, and instead, there were all of these different structures, these features in the rings, down to a hundred-feet resolution. It was tremendously exciting to go from one idea that was wrong to seeing something up close in such detail.\nAX: Are there elements in the rings that we would find here on Earth, or are they particular to Saturn?\nLINDA SPILKER: It turns out that all four of the outer planets have rings – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have ring systems, and the rings are made of individual particles, millions of them, that orbit around Saturn. They bump into each other, and they create these beautiful waves and beautiful structures. The Earth doesn’t have a ring, and the moon doesn’t have a ring, so it’s really something unique. But what’s neat about the rings is, they’re an analogy for the disc from which the solar system may have formed. So understanding how the rings work might tell us how planets formed around our sun.\nThe particles in Saturn’s rings are mostly made of water ice, ninety-nine percent water ice. So you’d find that in your freezer as ice cubes. There’s only a little tiny bit of material [in the rings] that’s not ice. We don’t know for sure if it’s silicates, or maybe organics, or iron, or exactly what it’s made of, but the rings are everyday material, water ice.\nAX: Do you know why some planets have rings and some don’t?\nLINDA SPILKER: It looks like all the giant planets have ring systems, but the inner planets are probably too small to hold onto the particles you’d need to make a ring. In the case of the Earth, since we have a great big moon, it would kick out any ring particles that tried to circle around the Earth.\nAX: So it has to do with the gravitational pull of the planet, and the smaller planets don’t have enough gravity to make rings?\nLINDA SPILKER: Right. Although what’s interesting is, we found an asteroid, or actually it’s what we’d call a trans-Neptunian object, a TNO, it’s like an asteroid, but further out in the solar system, and here’s this body, Chariklo, a little tiny thing, that has two rings around it. So you never know what can get a ring or not.\nAX: Both Voyager I and Voyager II launched in 1977. What years did the Voyager project encompass for you?\nLINDA SPILKER: I think the mission first got started, building the spacecraft in 1972. Voyager flew by Jupiter, both of the Voyagers, in 1979, two fly-bys of Saturn 1980, 1981, a Uranus fly-by in 1986, and a Neptune fly-by in 1989, and I have two daughters and I tell them that their births are based on the alignment of the planets, because there was a five-year window between the Saturn fly-by and the Uranus fly-by, and so I, like a lot of moms on Voyager, started their families and had their families in that five-year window.\nAX: What sorts of things are we learning from Voyager?\nLINDA SPILKER: Well, some of it, by understanding the weather on these other planets – they’re simpler, they don’t have a solid surface, they’re mostly just gas, hydrogen and helium. And then, like I said, for the ring systems, like at Saturn, studying and understanding how the ring particles interact, how they form bigger particles, can tell us something about how the planets formed in the early solar system. So that’s going back a ways, but that’s something. And also, two of the moons that Voyager observed up close, Enceladus at Saturn and Europa at Jupiter, have liquid water oceans underneath their icy crusts. And we wonder if there might be life in those oceans. So Voyager started this incredible progression of our search for knowledge, to try and answer questions that led to missions like Galileo and Juno and Jupiter, Cassini in its orbit of Saturn. I now work on the Cassini mission – I’ve been with Cassini for almost thirty years.\nThe giant planets are just mostly a giant atmosphere, and then as you get deeper into the planet, the atmosphere compresses, until the hydrogen becomes a liquid. It gets so much pressure, like a million atmospheres’ pressure, the hydrogen becomes a liquid. So there’s no solid surface, like the Earth has. There might be a little rocky core right in the middle, but no surface we could stand on if we went to a giant planet.\nAX: So when we look at the ringed planets, what we’re seeing when we look at the planet at is essentially a giant ball of atmosphere, with a little core, but we don’t see the core?\nLINDA SPILKER: Right. We don’t see the core, it’s too far down and it would be too hot, and you’d be crushed before you ever got to it.\nAX: And this is why Cassini is going to crash into Saturn, because the spacecraft can’t actually land on it …?\nLINDA SPILKER: But you could land on the moons. The moons are made mostly of water ice, just like the rings, and you could go back and land on one of the moons in these places.\nAX: And is the water actually like water here on Earth?\nLINDA SPILKER: It’s exactly like the water [on Earth]. It’s water ice, the same thing that we think of that we have here on Earth. H2O. Exactly the same.\nAX: Does that fact tell us anything about either the nature of water or the nature of things in the universe?\nLINDA SPILKER: I think that tells us that the cloud from which the sun and the planets formed was basically the same material, and so whether you’re at the Earth or further out, all the way out to Pluto, it’s the same water, the same H2O. There’s a lot of water in our solar system, and as you go further from the sun, that water doesn’t have a chance to evaporate, so it can freeze into the moons in the outer solar system. In the outer solar system, water ice is kind of the rock. It gets frozen solid, hard as a rock, and then you start to get interesting things like, one of the moons around Saturn, Titan, has liquid methane in lakes and seas at its north pole. So pretty soon, it gets really cold, water ice is a rock, but then these other things can condense and become a liquid, so that’s really intriguing, too.\nAX: Are any of the Voyager project workers actually STAR TREK fans who call it “V’ger,” as it is referred to in STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE?\nLINDA SPILKER: [laughs] I don’t call it V’ger, but I love that movie, and in fact, I have a fun story. Some friends of mine went to see it and I had no idea what it was about. So they told me, “You have to go see this movie.” So I went to see it, and we got really good seats toward the front, and I hadn’t figured out it was Voyager until the very end, and as they’re walking down the steps and there’s the Voyager spacecraft, all my friends are looking at me to see what I would say when it turned out, here’s Voyager. “Oh, my gosh.” I was totally shocked. I love this movie.\nWe don’t call it V’ger, we call it Voyager. But we think of Voyager very fondly, and there’s a special place in my heart, since Voyager is the first mission I worked on right out of college. To think that it’s still going strong, still out there – Voyager II is in interstellar space, and it’s amazing to think about that. It is actually out in the material between the stars and going strong. I’m very proud to have worked on Voyager.\nAX: What is Voyager’s measurement technology based on? That is, computers are based on the Enigma Machine – what is that technology based on?\nTOM SPILKER: It’s a thing called an ultra-stable oscillator. They generated these as part of the post-World War II technology development. You can make something that will make the frequency of a radio transmitter, using one of these ultra-stable oscillators as the reference, make that frequency exquisitely stable, and so that you know this is exactly what frequency this spacecraft is transmitting. And so you can measure things like Doppler shift, which tells you about the gravity of the thing that it’s flying by. You can also, when the signal is going through the atmosphere, measure how much that atmosphere changes the frequency.\nAX: What do the signals tell you?\nTOM SPILKER: We use the radio waves – the way they propagate, the way they travel through things like atmospheres – we send the spacecraft such that it goes behind the planet as seen from Earth, and just as it’s going behind the planet, those radio waves are traveling through the planet’s atmosphere to get to Earth. We look at how that atmosphere changes those radio waves, and we can tell all kinds of things about that atmosphere – how much atmosphere is there, what its pressure is, what its temperature is, what chemical species in some cases are in that atmosphere, like ammonia. We’re very sensitive to ammonia, so we can make those measurements that none of the other instruments can make. And then there are other experiments that we can do with a radio signal that will tell us, how much does this planet weigh, how much does this moon weigh, how much mass is there? And it gives us a very, very accurate measurement of how much stuff is in that planet, or how much stuff is in that moon. It goes back to figuring out where the solar system came from. Knowing those things is very important for that.\nThis interview was conducted during PBS Nova’s party for the summer 2017 Television Critics Association (TCA) press tour at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.\nFollow us on Twitter at ASSIGNMENT X\nLike us on Facebook at ASSIGNMENT X\nArticle Source: Assignment X\nArticle: Exclusive Interview with scientists Linda Spilker and Tom Spilker on the new PBS NOVA series THE FARTHEST – VOYAGER IN SPACE"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:98b0164d-214c-426b-9a9c-9946dd381b8f>","<urn:uuid:625376df-7583-45d7-8287-3fba39ab985f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the nutritional benefits of fermented foods, and how do they specifically impact the immune system's cellular function?","answer":"Fermented foods offer multiple nutritional benefits: they are more digestible, have more easily available nutrients, may have a lower glycemic load, and are enriched with beneficial microorganisms that improve gut health. For example, sourdough bread has been shown to have a lower glycemic load than regular white bread. Regarding immune system impact, research has demonstrated that probiotic supplementation increases the activity of both white blood cells and natural killer cells, which are part of our innate immune response. These cells act as a surveillance system, recognizing and killing foreign microorganisms while signaling other immune cells. However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and which specific probiotic strains are most beneficial for immune function.","context":["Check out my latest collaboration with Doc Smo, the pediatric blogger! Explore the world of fermented foods and what they can do for you and your kids.\nPick up any medical journal or health magazine and it won’t be long before you hear some discussion about the health benefits of probiotics and fermented foods. Interest in how the microbial world enhances your child’s health is more than a fad or craze; it is becoming fundamental to understanding how your child stays healthy. This knowledge is literally transforming medicine. That is why today’s pedcast is so important and why we are so lucky to have one of my favorite guests returning to Portable Practical Pediatrics, Dr. Charlotte Rouchouze, a food expert and host of the popular blog, The Children’s Table. Welcome Dr. Rouchouze- thank you so much for taking time to join me and my audience today.\nQ1. First of all, what the heck is fermentation?\nCR: First and foremost, fermentation is a transformation. It is a way of transforming food using invisible yeasts and microbes that are naturally occurring in the environment. In a way we might think of it as harnessing decay for our own uses. The vehicles for this transformation can include a variety of “bugs” such as yeast or lactobacilli- they’re the little guys that do the work, basically digesting certain parts of the food and altering it in various ways. Specifically, the process usually involves converting sugars to alcohols, gases, or acids. If starch or sugar-rich foods are left to ferment with active yeast, the fermentation will produce carbon dioxide, invite probiotic bacteria, and slowly convert carbohydrates to alcohol.\nFermentation has been used for thousands of years as a way of preserving food, but with the advent of modern processed food, fermentation was largely replaced with other methods that are less time consuming to produce, more consistent, and allow food to be kept at any temperature and humidity. These include high heat canning, freezing, the development and use of shelf-stable fats and preservatives, and perhaps most importantly, refining, which reduces the perishability of food by removing the perishable parts. But we’re realizing there was more to fermented foods than longer life. And the new methods strip some crucial things from traditional preserved food.\nQ2. How is a fermented food different than non-fermented foods and why should parents care if a food is fermented or not?\nCR: The resulting food is different in a variety of ways. 1) Generally it is more digestible and has more easily available nutrients; 2) it is protected from spoilage thanks to the fermenting bacteria and resulting acids pushing away the dangerous bacteria; 3) it may have a lower glycemic load thanks to the microorganisms consuming the sugars. For example, sourdough bread has been shown to have a lower glycemic load than plain white bread. 4) it has a unique and enhanced flavor; and finally 5) it is enriched with all the microorganisms that do all this work, which have been shown to improve gut health.\nNow, I did learn that just because a food is fermented, doesn’t mean it necessarily still has live cultures. So there is a distinction to be made there. Once bread is baked, the cultures are killed. If a product is boiled or pasteurized following fermentation, it will no longer contain live bacteria. Similarly, alcohol no longer contains probiotics as far as I know. You can still derive certain benefits from fermented foods such as digestibility, increased availability of vitamins, etc. without there being live cultures, but the benefits that you hear about regarding probiotics would require a product that is live, and would most likely be found in the fresh or refrigerated sections of the grocery store.\nQ3. What about kids? How can kids get health and nutrition benefits from fermented foods?\nCR: Kids with digestive problems might be the most likely to benefit from fermented foods. The benefit can be either from the live probiotics or from the enhanced digestibility from fermented foods. For example, you might give your child plenty of live cultures in the form of yogurt. In addition, if you suspect your child (or you for that matter), has a problem digesting certain foods, you could explore fermented versions. So if you have a hard time digesting milk, yogurt and cheese are likely to be easier on you. Trouble with soy? Try miso or tempeh, which are fermented. Likewise for gluten, whole grains, etc. Sometimes even a simple soak with yogurt, buttermilk, or other lactic acid starter will considerably improve the digestibility. Fermenting can also lower the glycemic load of a food, if you’re interested in controlling sugars. Sourdough white bread has a lower glycemic index than regular white bread, for example.\nPS –Probiotics also shorten diarrheal illness, reduce the frequency of illness, and lower the chance a child will acquire an antibiotic-associated diarrhea. We’ve also found a benefit for babies and children if their mothers consumed probiotics late in pregnancy. Those children have lower incidence of allergies and eczema.\nQ4. Where can we find them?\nCR: There are plenty of fermented foods at the supermarket, but if you’re looking for living cultures, i.e. probiotics, it’s a bit tougher because of the fact that these delicate bacteria don’t mix so easily with our mass-market food industry. So you may need to either go to specialty stores or make your own if you want them live. But high quality yogurt, kefir, fresh sauerkraut or pickles, kombucha (a fermented tea) are all good options. Look for the ‘Live and active’ seal on yogurt, or a package that states that it contains live cultures. Asian stores have lots of fermented products, such as miso (soy), kimchee and lots of other pickles, fish sauce, and more. Miso, which does contain live cultures, is a really wonderful product to use at home, and it lasts a long time in the refrigerator. I’ll give you a recipe that I love that you can use as a quick sauce for noodles or a dip for pretty much anything.\nAnother area of exploration if you’re up for some experimenting is to use cultures on your own to make things. You can use a high quality packaged food such as yogurt or kombucha that you can then propagate on your own. Or, some yeasts and lactobacilli can be cultivated from just raw ingredients. I have a sourdough starter that I started about a year ago, and with it, I can ferment and rise any dough. So one batch of sourdough that you cultivate using only water and flour can be used indefinitely to quickly ferment all kinds of flour. You can read about this kind of experimenting in Sandor Katz’s books and on his website. Basically, if you leave live cultures in a warm place with more carbohydrates, they will act on those and continue to multiply. Live cultures from yogurt can be used to make lots of other soured dairy products, crème fraiche, etc. or to make fermented cereals. It turns out that most traditional societies eat both their dairy and their grains in fermented form, and many of these can be simply made at home. Try soaking oatmeal with twice the volume of water and a couple tablespoons of yogurt, leaving it at room temperature the night before you plan to eat it. The next day, you can either eat it as is or heat as usual. This results in a wonderful, creamy and slightly tangy oatmeal cereal. See recipe below.\nIt’s possible that a lot of people have lost their taste for fermented food, since they often have a tangy, or even “funky” flavor. But once you have recultivated a taste for traditional fermentation, nothing will replace that complexity and yes, funk.\nSoon you might find yourself fermenting everything! You may end up with loads of bubbling jars on your counter and a spouse whining about funky smells coming out of the fridge. No personal experience here of course…\nPS: Sounds like fun, and maybe a good way to get your child interested in science and cooking at the same time.

Until next time.\nRecipes to try:\nIrish Oatmeal (adapted from Sally Fallon, Nourishing Traditions)\n- 1 cup quick cooking steel cut (Note: Fallon recommends toasting and grinding whole oats, but I have simply used quick cooking steel cut oats. Toasting is an additional optional step. You could also use rolled oats if desired)\n- 2 cups warm filtered water\n- 4 tablespoons yogurt, kefir, whey, or buttermilk with live cultures\n- 1 tsp sea salt\n- 1 ½ cups filtered water.\nCombine oats, warm water, and yogurt in a large jar or container, and cover. Leave in a warm spot for 7-24 hours. When ready to eat, bring an additional 1 ½ cups of water to the boil, add soaked oatmeal, and cook over very low heat, stirring frequently, for several minutes until desired consistency is achieved. Depending on what kind of oatmeal you have used, this may take more or less time.\nAlternate method: Miso porridge- substitute 2 tsp miso for yogurt and eliminate the salt. Continue as outlined above.\nMiso Tahini Dressing (recipe from Isa Does It, by Isa Chandra Moskowitz)\n- ½ cup to ¾ cup water\n- ¼ cup mellow white miso\n- ¼ cup tahini (sesame paste)\n- 1 clove garlic\nBlend all ingredients in the blender and blend to desired thickness. Serve over roasted vegetables, whole wheat or buckwheat noodles, or lentils.\nRecommended books and articles:\n- Sandor Katz The Art of Fermentation, Chelsea Green Publishing, White River Junction, VT, 2012.\n- Sally Fallon Nourishing traditions, New Trends Publishing, Washington, DC, 2001.\n- Author Michael Pollan on the topic of sourdough bread:\n- Consumer Reports Ratings of Yogurts:","Probiotics and the Immune system\nUpdated: Jan 14, 2021\nOur immune system is getting a lot of attention at the moment; how we can ‘boost’ it through nutrition is everywhere.\nI’m very sorry to disappoint you, but there is no immune boosting miracle nutrient that can magically make our immune system function perfectly and stop us from catching a virus. Or any disease or illness for that matter. However, all is not lost. There are other aspects of our overall heath that can be influenced by our diet, which may improve our immune function.\nInterest in our gut health has sky rocketed in the last few years, with research being undertaken on how our gut microbiome interacts with the rest of our body. There has been emerging and convincing evidence that our microbiome is extremely important for optimal health; not only to decrease the risk of developing or acquiring diseases, but it may also play a vital role in ensuring good mental health.\nWhat is our microbiome?\nOur large intestine is colonised by millions of resident bacteria. These bacteria have been found to have many beneficial roles in our body, including helping our immune system fight off foreign microbes. The more gut bacteria we have and the more diverse the strains of bacteria, the more health benefits we will get.\nSo how can we increase the number and diversity of these important microbes?\nThis can be achieved through our diet. For example, we can consume foods that are known to be prebiotics (compounds that will feed the bacteria so they can grow and increase in number). There are also probiotics. Many of you may have heard of these as supplements endorsed by the health and wellness industry on social media to be the next best health supplement for 'eternal life' and wellbeing. Probiotic supplements are strains of bacteria that you can take which will colonise our large intestine and directly increase the number of bacteria.\nBut are these supplements really a magic cure, and will taking them boost our immune system?\nA recent systematic review and meta-analysis (a study reviewing all the evidence that has been published), evaluated the scientific evidence of the effects of probiotic supplementation on the function of specific immune cells in the elderly (1).\nWhat were these researchers measuring?\nThe researchers wanted to determine whether probiotic supplements influence the function of specific immune cells; white blood cells known as neutrophils and also natural killer cells. These cells are part of our innate immune response. This immune response acts as a surveillance system, the cells can recognise foreign microorganisms and upon recognition of a virus for example they kill it and signal to other immune cells, activating the whole of the immune system. Measuring the activity of these cells after taking probiotic supplements may be able to give us an indication of how well our immune system is working.\nWhat did they find?\nThe researchers compared the results of 17 controlled trials, each of which looked at the effect of probiotic supplementation in healthy elderly people for 3 to 12 weeks. They found that probiotic supplementation increased the activity of both the white blood cells and the natural killer cells.\nSo, should we be all taking probiotics?\nI don’t want to be a kill joy but don’t rush to order huge quantities of these supplements thinking that they are the magic pill. Despite these interesting findings and the positive effect that probiotics appears to have on our immune system, more research is still needed. So please refrain from panic buying probiotics!\nWhat are the issues with this research and why is more research needed?\nTo start with, the trials were only undertaken over relatively short periods of time, so we have no idea what the long terms effects will be if people are taking these supplements for more than 12 weeks.\nAnother question which has not been answered is which probiotic strain is best. There are many different types of bacteria strains which are used in supplements, each of which carry out varying roles with varying health benefits. However, the individual strains of probiotics were not looked at in this study, so we don’t actually know which one is best for supporting out immune function.\nThese studies were also only analysing the use of probiotics in healthy elderly people. Will probiotics have the same effects in elderly people with pre-existing health issues or who are already suffering from an illness? I know for a fact that my grandparents can’t be classed as ‘healthy’, so what effect will these supplements have on their immune system? And will these beneficial effects also be seen in younger people?\nAnd lastly, despite these positive findings, that probiotic supplements increase the activity of certain immune cells, what does this mean in terms of how our immune system responds to a foreign microorganism? Will the probiotics actually enhance our immune response and make it better at fighting off the virus or bacterial infection? The clinical outcomes of probiotic use were not measured, so we have no idea what the overall effect of these supplements have on our immunity.\nIt's not all doom and gloom…I promise\nFor now, the best thing we can do for our gut microbiome and our immune system is eat a well-balanced diet, high in fruit and vegetables and dietary fibre. Fibre is the nutrient that bacteria in our guts LOVE to eat, it is a prebiotic, and none of us are eating enough of it. Fermented foods that contain live bacteria are also readily available to buy such as kefir and kombucha.\nBelow I have listed foods which are high in fibre that can promote gut health, in addition to foods that already contain bacteria; your pre- and probiotics! Try to include as many of these in your diet as you can, varying them week by week.\nThese are generally fermented foods and include:\nKefir - fermented milk\nKombucha - fermented tea\nMiller LE, Lehtoranta L, Lehtinen MJ.

{"question":"How do the life trajectories of Richard Semon and Conrad Waddington compare in terms of their academic careers and institutional affiliations?","answer":"Richard Semon and Conrad Waddington had quite different academic career paths. Semon started as an associate professor at the University of Jena in 1891 but was forced to resign in 1897 due to a personal scandal, after which he worked as a private scholar in Munich without institutional affiliation. In contrast, Waddington maintained stable institutional connections throughout his career, holding positions at Cambridge University and Christ's College, followed by becoming Professor of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. He also spent one year (1960-1961) as a Fellow at Wesleyan University's Center for Advanced Studies. While Semon's lack of institutional affiliation may have contributed to the neglect of his work, Waddington's institutional positions helped establish him as an influential figure in developmental biology.","context":["Semon, Richard (1859-1918)\nSEMON, RICHARD (1859-1918)\nRichard Wolfgang Semon is a relatively unknown but nevertheless important figure in the history of research on learning and memory. Although little noticed by both his contemporaries and memory researchers today, Semon anticipated numerous modern theories and, perhaps ironically, created one of the best known terms in the memory literature, engram.\nSemon was born in Berlin on August 22, 1859. His father, Simon, was a stockbroker, and the Semon family became part of the upper echelon of Berlin Jewish society during Richard's childhood. Simon's severe losses in the stock market crash of 1873 imposed a much humbler lifestyle on the family. Semon's older brother, Felix, left Germany after receiving a medical degree and practiced in England, where he became a historic pioneer of clinical and scientific laryngology.\nAs a child, Richard Semon expressed a strong interest in biology and zoology. He attended the University of Jena—a major European center of biological research—and received a doctorate in zoological studies in 1883 and a medical degree in 1886. While at Jena, Semon was influenced heavily by the famous evolutionary biologist Ernst Haeckel, whose monistic philosophy stressed the importance of attempting to unify diverse biological phenomena within a single set of theoretical principles.\nSemon's career as an evolutionary biologist developed rapidly during the 1890s. Shortly after assuming an associate professorship at Jena in 1891, he led a major expedition to Australia in search of the \"missing link.\" The expedition was responsible for the discovery of 207 new species and twenty-four new genera. When he returned from Australia in 1893, Semon continued his research at Jena until 1897, when his life changed dramatically. He became involved with Maria Krehl, then wife of an eminent professor of pathology at Jena, Ludolph Krehl. The ensuing scandal in Jena led to Semon's resignation. He and Maria moved to Munich, where he began working as a private scholar, and the pair eventually married.\nSemon wrote two major books on memory during the next twenty years: Die mneme (1904), translated as The Mneme (1921), and Die mnemischen Empfindungen (1909), translated as Mnemic Psychology (1923). His work attracted little attention, and Semon's acute dismay about his lack of recognition is evident in letters written to his colleague and ally, the Swiss psychiatrist August Forel (Schacter, 1982). Depressed over the neglect of his work, troubled by Germany's role in World War I, and shattered by his wife's death from cancer, Semon took his own life on December 27, 1918.\nTheory of Memory\nA full appreciation of Semon's ideas about human memory requires a look at the biological context from which they emerged. His first book, Die mneme, embedded human memory a more global theory that broadened the construct of memory to include more than simple remembering of facts, events, and the like. Semon argued for viewing heredity and reproduction as forms of memory that preserved the effects of experience across generations. He referred to the fundamental process that subserved both heredity and everyday memory with a term of his own creation, \"Mneme.\" According to Semon, Mneme is a fundamental organic plasticity that allows the preservation of effects of experience; it is Mneme \"which in the organic world links the past and present in a living bond\" (1921, p.12).\nSemon distinguished among three aspects of the mnemic process that he believed are crucial to the analysis of both everyday memory and of hereditary memory, and he described them with additional terms of his own invention in order to avoid the potentially misleading connotations of ordinary language: engraphy, engram, and ecphory. Engraphy refers to the encoding of information into memory; engram refers to the change in the nervous system—the \"memory trace\"—that preserves the effects of experience; and ecphory refers to a retrieval process, or \"the influences which awaken the mnemic trace or engram out of its latent state into one of manifested activity\" (Semon, 1921, p.12). In attempting to apply these constructs to the analysis of hereditary memory—that is, to understanding how the experiences of one organism could somehow influence its progeny—Semon encountered a variety of biological phenomena that led him to place great emphasis on ecphory as a crucial determinant of memory.\nSemon's speculative ideas on hereditary memory met with severe criticism because they relied heavily on the discredited doctrine of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which had been developed by the French biologist Lamarck (Schacter, 2001). Nevertheless, the concern with ecphoric processes that emerged from this analysis enabled Semon to develop new perspectives on human memory that elaborated without any reference to hereditary phenomena in his second book, Die mnemischen empfindungen. At the time that Semon wrote this book, memory researchers paid almost no attention to the ecphoric or retrieval stage of memory; they were caught up almost entirely with processes occurring at the time of encoding or engraphy (Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Eich, and Tulving, 1978). By contrast, Semon developed a detailed theory of ecphoric processes and argued that succssful ecphory requires that the conditions prevailing at the time of engraphy (i.e., encoding) are partially reinstated at the time of ecphory. He laid great emphasis on this latter idea, elevating it to a \"Law of Ecphory.\" This concern with the relation between conditions of engraphy and ecphory anticipated rather closely such modern notions as the encoding-specificity principle and transfer-appropriate processing.\nSemon also developed novel ideas about the beneficial effects of repetition on memory. In contrast to the then widely accepted idea that repetition of a stimulus improves memory by strengthening the preexisting engram of that stimulus, Semon argued that each repetition of a stimulus creates a unique, context-specific engram; at the time of ecphory, the multiple, separate engrams are combined by a resonance process that Semon termed homophony. This multiple-engram approach to repetition effects, with its strong emphasis on ecphoric processes, anticipated a number of recently influential conceptualizations, such as the multiple-trace model developed by Hintzman and colleagues (Schacter et al., 1978).\nNotwithstanding the prescience of many of Semon's ideas, his contemporaries ignored his contributions. This neglect may be due to several factors: his theoretical emphasis on ecphoric processes at a time when few were interested, his social isolation as a private scholar without institutional affiliation, and his discredited Lamarckian approach to hereditary memory. Curiously, the one construct developed by Semon that appropirated by subsequent researchers—the engram—did not represent a novel contribution and was one of the less interesting parts of his otherwise innovative theoretical approach.\nSchacter, D.

He had wide interests that included poetry and painting, as well as left-wing political leanings.\n* 1 Life * 2 Epigenetic landscape * 3 Waddington as an organiser * 4 References * 5 Selected works o 5.1 Books o 5.2 Papers * 6 External links\nWaddington, known as \"Wad\" to his friends and \"Con\" to family, was born to Hal and Mary Ellen (Warner) Waddington, 8 November 1905. Until nearly three years of age, Waddington lived with his parents in India, where his father worked on a tea estate in the Wayanad district. In 1910, at the age of four, he was sent to live with family in England including his aunt, uncle, and Quaker grandmother. His parents remained in India until 1928. During his childhood, he was particularly attached to a local druggist and distant relation, Dr. Doeg. Doeg, who Waddington called \"Grandpa\", introduced Waddington to a wide range of sciences from chemistry to geology. During the year following the completion of his entrance exams to university, Waddington received an intense course in chemistry from E. J. Holmyard. Aside from being \"something of a genius of a [chemistry] teacher,\" Holmyard introduced Waddington to the \"Alexandrian Gnostics\" and the \"Arabic Alchemists.\" From these lessons in metaphysics, Waddington first gained an appreciation for interconnected holistic systems. Waddington reflected that this early education prepared him for Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy in the 1920s and 30s and the cybernetics of Norbert Wiener and others in the 1940s.\nHe attended Clifton College and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He took the Natural Sciences Tripos, earning a First in Part II in geology in 1926. He took up a Lecturership in Zoology and was a Fellow of Christ's College until 1942. His friends included Gregory Bateson, Walter Gropius, C. P. Snow, Solly Zuckerman, Joseph Needham, and J. D. Bernal. His interests began with palaeontology but moved on to the heredity and development of living things. He also studied philosophy.\nDuring World War II he was involved in operational research with the Royal Air Force and became scientific advisor to the Commander in Chief of Coastal Command from 1944 to 1945. After the war he became Professor of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. He would stay at Edinburgh for the rest of life with the exception of one year (1960–1961) when he was a Fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. His personal papers are largely kept at the University of Edinburgh library.\nWaddington was married twice. His first marriage produced a son, C. Jake Waddington, professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, but ended in 1936. He then married Justin Blanco White, daughter of the writer Amber Reeves, with whom he had two daughters, mathematician Dusa McDuff and anthropologist Caroline Humphrey.\nIn the early 1930s, Waddington and many other embryologists looked for the molecules that would induce the amphibian neural tube. The search was, of course, beyond the technology of that time, and most embryologists moved away from such deep problems. Waddington, however, came to the view that the answers to embryology lay in genetics, and in 1935 went to Thomas Hunt Morgan's Drosophila laboratory in California, even though this was a time when most embryologists felt that genes were unimportant and just played a role in minor phenomena such as eye colour.\nIn the late 30's, Waddington produced formal models about how gene regulatory products could generate developmental phenomena, showed how the mechanisms underpinning Drosophila development could be studied through a systematic analysis of mutations that affected the development of the Drosophila wing (this was the essence of the approach that won the 1995 Nobel prize in medicine for Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric F. Wieschaus). In a period of great creativity at the end of the 1930s, he also discovered mutations that affected cell phenotypes and wrote his first textbook of developmental epigenetics, a term that then meant the external manifestation of genetic activity.\nWaddington also coined other essential concepts, such as canalisation, which refers to the ability of an organism to produce the same phenotype despite variation in genotype or environment. He also identified a mechanism called genetic assimilation which would allow an animal’s response to an environmental stress to become a fixed part of its developmental repertoire, and then went on to show that the mechanism would work. He thus demonstrated that the ideas of inheritance put forward by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck could, in principle at least, occur.\nIn 1972, Waddington founded the Centre for Human Ecology.\nWaddington's epigenetic landscape is a metaphor for how gene regulation modulates development. One is asked to imagine a number of marbles rolling down a hill towards a wall. The marbles will compete for the grooves on the slope, and come to rest at the lowest points. These points represent the eventual cell fates, that is, tissue types. Waddington coined the term Chreode to represent this cellular developmental process. This idea was actually based on experiment: Waddington found that one effect of mutation (which could modulate the epigenetic landscape) was to affect how cells differentiated. He also showed how mutation could affect the landscape and used this metaphor in his discussions on evolution—he was the first person to emphasise that evolution mainly occurred through mutations that affected developmental anatomy.\nWaddington as an organiser\nWiki letter w cropped.svg This section requires expansion.\nWaddington was very active in advancing biology as a discipline. He contributed to a book on the role of the sciences in times of war, and helped set up several professional bodies representing biology as a discipline.\nA remarkable number of his contemporary colleagues in Edinburgh became Fellows of the Royal Society during his time there, or shortly thereafter.\nWaddington was an old-fashioned intellectual who lived in both the arts and science milieus of the 1950s and wrote widely. His 1960 book \"Behind Appearance; a Study Of The Relations Between Painting And The Natural Sciences In This Century\" (MIT press) not only has wonderful pictures but is still worth reading.\nWaddington was, without doubt, the most original and important thinker about developmental biology of the pre-molecular age and the medal of the British Society for Developmental Biology is named after him.\n1. ^ Robertson, Alan. 1977. \"Conrad Hal Waddington. 8 November 1905–26 September 1975.\" Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society 23, 575-622.

Vintage-correct triple bound dark tortoise pickguard installed.\nNotes: The Fifties were in full swing, and life was at the touch of a button. Push button light switches had been available since the 1880's, and by the late 20's, Zenith had home radios with push button tuning, which by the mid-'30s had migrated into automobiles. By 1954, Chrysler upped the ante with its Dynaflyte transmission, which positioned gear buttons conveniently on the dashboard. But Epiphone beat Detroit by some three years with this extravagantly featured model, whose ingenious 'Varitone' pickup selector put a rainbow of voicings right at the player's fingertips.\nMaking its debut in 1951, the Zephyr Emperor Regent was Epiphone's electric version of their massive Emperor Regent cutaway acoustic archtop. The first examples bore the designation \"Zephyr Emperor Vari-Tone\" after the unique six pushbutton pickup selector switch system. (The name was quietly changed after a few months, perhaps after a reminder that the term had been in use by Gibson for their Varitone tailpiece adjuster for over a decade.) Renamed the Zephyr Emperor Regent, and finally simply the Emperor Electric, the big guitar was Epi's top-of-the line electric model, equivalent in price and prestige to its main competitor, the Gibson Super 400CES, which was introduced that same year.\nFeaturing a deeper cutaway than its Gibson rival, the Zephyr Emperor Regent improved upper fingerboard access by two to three frets over the cutaway Super 400, and upped the pickup count by featuring three adjustable 'Tone Spectrum' (aka 'New York') single coil pickups, with cream Bakelite mounts. Discontinued after Gibson purchased the Epiphone company in 1957, this rare model was the firm's most costly electric guitar, and the versatility of its pickup selector, featured by artists as diverse as Harry Volpe, Duke Robillard and Elvis Costello, has never been matched by Gibson to this day.\nThis majestic blonde was produced in mid-1953, and is one of about 20 known examples produced in its batch. Epiphone spared no ornamentation for this top-of-the line guitar: a veritable showpiece of extravagantly figured tonewood, with tiger flame maple laminate in the top, sides and neck, and rare bubble (or blister) maple on the back. The pale mother-of-pearl block fingerboard inlay is inset with vertical wedges of luminescent Paua abalone, which also appears in the ornate tree-of-life inlay in the peghead and logo.\nLovingly maintained, this big guitar shows a lustrous, deeply ambered natural finish unusually free of pick, buckle, or thumb wear. (A small drip line in the finish is visible near the control knobs, and apart from a few random finish dings on the neck, the guitar shows few signs of play altogether.) The fingerboard is smooth and straight, the Pat. Pend. Frequensator tailpiece is solid, and original multi-ply binding remains tight to the body, with a few small shims here and there.\nThe neck has a comfy solid C profile, and the action is smooth and low over fine original fretwork with a fresh high precision setup. The single-coil 'Tone Spectrum' (or 'New York') pickups are clear and detailed, and the exclusive Vari-Tone pickup selector (later copied by Guild for their X-375 model) permitted unprecedented variation in tone colors at the touch of a button. And all nestled in its original deluxe brown Lifton plush lined Epiphone logo hardshell case, every bit as lovely as the guitar itself.\nAs regal as a Chrysler Imperial, the Zephyr Emperor Regent embodies 50's push button technology at its most exuberant: it's got everything but the tail fins. One only: call now.\nSetup: Truss rod adjusted; bridge height adjusted; bridge compensation strobe tuned; string slots at nut and bridge inspected and recut as necessary; bridge foot and saddle radius inspected; bridgewheels and tuners lubricated; fingerboard and bridge conditioned; body and neck cleaned and hand polished.

{"question":"How has Aboriginal art evolved from its traditional forms to contemporary media, and what historical challenges have Aboriginal artists faced in gaining recognition in the art world?","answer":"Aboriginal art has evolved from traditional forms like rock art, sand paintings, and body decorations to embrace modern media while maintaining its spiritual essence. Traditional forms included rock paintings dating back 50,000 years in Arnhem Land, bark paintings, wood carvings, and fibre weaving. Over the past 40 years, artists have incorporated Western materials like acrylics, canvas, lino prints, and fabric printing. More recently, artists have begun using photographic film and computer technology. Despite this evolution, the spiritual storytelling aspect remains constant. Historically, Aboriginal artists faced significant challenges in gaining recognition. In the nineteenth century, Aboriginal people were classified as primitive, and their art was often displayed alongside flora and fauna specimens in museums. It wasn't until the 1970s that Aboriginal art in urban areas gained attention from the wider art world, coinciding with the granting of citizenship rights in 1967 and the first acknowledgment of land rights in the mid-1970s. Today, Aboriginal art from all styles and media is recognized as a vital expression of the contemporary world, and artists are no longer discriminated against based on race, gender, geography, or classical European models.","context":["Here's how to find the best places to buy a piece of Aboriginal art.\nBy Sue Gough Henly\nContemporary Aboriginal art offers an exciting journey of discovery into one of the world's oldest surviving cultures. Yet because it is so different from Western art it can be difficult to know how to identify and buy authentic pieces. Here are some insider tips from knowledgeable locals.\nAustralia's amazing Aboriginal art\nGet to know the meaning behind the art\nTraditional indigenous art practitioners do not see themselves as artists but storytellers. Since they have no written languages, their creations are all about sharing their spiritual association with their specific landscape or \"country\" as well as communicating their obligations to this \"country\" through their Dreaming stories and songlines. There are not one but many different indigenous cultures, each with its own language and belief system, spread across every part of Australia. (The term \"Aboriginal\" refers to mainland Australia, while \"indigenous\" refers to the mainland as well as the Torres Strait Islands, which are also part of Australia.)\nAs a result, there is a great diversity of artistic styles and media, from the well known dot paintings of the Western Desert to the Western Kimberley's ghostlike Wandjina creation ancestors with huge mouthless faces. These creations can be in many different media. Traditionally, there was rock art, sand and body paintings, ochre bark paintings, wood carvings and fibre weaving (portable art that's still available today). Over the past 40 years, Western acrylics and canvas have been introduced as well as lino prints and fabric printing. While the media may be contemporary, the spiritual storytelling remains the same.\nDevelop an idea of which style of Aboriginal art you like\nVisit the indigenous collections at Australia's major museums to educate yourself about the different styles of art. Key collections can be found at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, The Araluen Art Collection in Alice Springs, the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin. There are also three major indigenous art events each year that celebrate the best new indigenous art: the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards exhibition at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin from August through October; The Desert Mob event held at the Araluen Arts Centre in Alice Springs in September; and the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair in July. Remember to consider a wide range of artistic endeavours including acrylic paintings, weavings, bark paintings, poles, and screen-printed paintings and fabrics.\nMake sure it's authentic\nAs with any art form, indigenous art has authentic works and imitations. It gets more complicated when you learn that the majority of indigenous works are not signed. You can, however, be assured that works are authentic if you buy from members of the Aboriginal Art Association of Australia, the Australian Commercial Galleries Association or the Indigenous Art Code. Those are the blue chip industry bodies that provide authentication and pay artists fair commissions. High profile auction houses such as Sotheby’s, Christie's and Lawson-Menzies are also sources of reputable Indigenous art.\nBrowse at commercial galleries\nA number of exceptional commercial galleries across the country have knowledgeable staff that can give professional advice on what to purchase given your interests and budget. In Sydney there is the Kate Owen Gallery, Aboriginal-owned Boomalli, and Cooeeart. In Melbourne check out Alcaston Gallery, the Aboriginal-owned Koorie Heritage Trust, The Emily Museum, Vivien Anderson Gallery and Lauraine Diggins Fine Art. In Alice Springs visit Mbantua Gallery, Tjanpi Desert Weavers and the Many Hands Gallery. In Darwin explore Mason Gallery and Outstation Gallery. In Hobart Art Mob is the go-to gallery. In Perth check out Japingka Aboriginal Art. Brisbane has the Fireworks Gallery, Suzanne O’Connell Gallery and Mitchell Fine Art Gallery. Aboriginal-owned Tandanya is the gallery to visit in Adelaide. In Cairns check out the Canopy Art Centre and in Port Douglas go to the Australian & Oceanic Art Gallery. A number of professional dealers also market and sell indigenous artwork online. These include former Sotheby’s expert D'Lan Davidson and long-time art centre dealer Martin Wardrop at Aboriginal Art Online.\nTravel to remote Aboriginal art centres\nThere are dozens of community-based Aboriginal art centres, many in remote areas, all over Australia. These centres organise the delivery of supplies to artists and market their art nationally and internationally, often online. Two key umbrella organisations are Desart, which represents 30 Aboriginal art and craft centres in Central Australia, and the Association of Northern and Kimberley Aboriginal Artists of Australia (ANKAAA), which is the peak advocacy and support agency for Aboriginal artists working individually or through 48 remote art centres spread across one million square kilometres (390,000 square miles) in Arnhem Land, Darwin/Katherine, the Kimberley and the Tiwi Islands. Key art centres include Warmun, Waringarri and Mowanjum in the Kimberley, Buku-Larrnggay at Yirrkala in Arnhem Land, Balgo in Western Australia, Maruku near Uluru and Tiwi Designs on Bathurst Island. The first art centre in Australia using modern acrylics and canvas was Papunya Tula in the Western Desert. You can buy work at its gallery in Alice Springs. If you would like to visit remote art centres, Palya offers art tours by small plane.\nMore articles like this\n5 amazing ways to experience Australia’s Aboriginal culture","World of Dreamings\nTraditional and modern art of Australia\nAn exhibition held at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg | 2 February - 9 April 2000\n- Dr Brian Kennedy, Director, National Gallery of Australia\n- An introduction to Aboriginal art by Susan Jenkins and Carly Lane\n- The Aboriginal Memorial We have survived, by Djon Mundine\n- The Aboriginal Memorial 1987-88 A description\n- John Mawurndjul The resonating land by Luke Taylor\n- All the world The paintings of Nym Bandak by Kim Barber\n- 'Who's that bugger who paints like me?'

This exhibition focuses on the work of six artists: Nym Bandak, Fiona Foley, Emily Kam Kngwarray, John Mawurndjul, Tracey Moffatt, and Rover Thomas. It also includes two major collaborative works from Arnhem Land and Cape York: The Aboriginal Memorial, a magnificent set of painted hollow log coffins by 43 artists from Ramingining, and a group of ceremonial sculptures by Wik artists. While the work of these artists is based in age-old traditions, it embodies the realities of Aboriginal Australians living in the modern world: a world that has undergone great social, political and cultural upheavals since Europeans colonised the country over two centuries ago. These upheavals continue to have repercussions today. Aboriginal art is at the very frontier between indigenous and non-indigenous Australia and reflects the contemporary realities of its makers.\nArt, specifically Aboriginal art created in a European-dominated Australia, can be seen as a medium of negotiation between cultures, and of the exchange of ideas and beliefs; exchanges that are not always equal. The circumstances in which the paintings by Bandak and the Wik sculptures were made, involved the active participation of anthropologists and missionaries. Fiona Foley and Rover Thomas question the 'official' histories of Australia. A focus of the films and photographs of Tracey Moffatt is the definition of identity in a multicultural society. Emily Kam Kngwarray and John Mawurndjul, to varying degrees, have become favourites of the marketplace. The Aboriginal Memorial, on the other hand, was made specifically to register an Aboriginal voice in the clamour of Australia's celebration of two centuries of European occupation. These are but some of the contexts in which art by Aboriginal people operates. Simultaneously, this art expresses the complex of the relationships between the individual, the group, the land, the ancestral beings and the spiritual forces which have invigorated Aboriginal life for generations, past and present.\nAboriginal art is the oldest continuing art tradition in the world. While Europeans mark the start of their third millennium, Aboriginal Australians are marking (at least) their fiftieth. Archaeological research indicates that rock paintings in Arnhem Land in northern Australia date back 50,000 years and rock engravings in southern Australia at least 30,000 years, predating Palaeolithic rock paintings of Altamira and Lascaux in Europe. Graphic symbols and designs found in such rock art continue to be used by artists today.\nAboriginal art manifests in a wide range of forms and media: from ancient rock art to ephemeral body decoration, ground paintings and sand sculptures; from bark paintings and sculpture in wood to jewellery and woven fibres. In recent decades, introduced media such as synthetic paints and canvas, print making materials, textiles, photographic film and computer technology have extended the means by which Aboriginal artists express themselves.\nThere is not one but several traditions of indigenous art in Australia, each with a distinct visual language, its own vocabulary of icons and symbols. Designs usually have layers of meanings, determined by the context in which they are used - whether in a ceremony with a restricted audience of initiates, or in the public domain of the uninitiated. Artists distinguish between the different levels of meaning: the 'inside' stories for the initiated and the 'outside' interpretation. This enables them to make sacred images in the public domain without compromising the work's true cultural significance, nor the artist's integrity.\nTraditionally, the great themes of Aboriginal art relate to the Ancestral Realm, commonly known as the Dreaming. The term 'Dreaming', however inadequate, is used by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike. It does not mean a state of dreams or unreality, rather a state of reality beyond the mundane, incorporating the spiritual and physical worlds.\nThe Ancestral Realm refers to the genesis of the universe and to the supernatural and ancestral beings who created it - beings whose spiritual powers continue to influence and sustain successive generations of Aboriginal people. In the Dreaming these beings and creator ancestors travelled across the unshaped world in both human and non-human form, creating the landscape and laying down the laws of social and religious behaviour. Much Aboriginal art concerns stories (also known as Dreamings) about the epic deeds and activities of the creator ancestors. The entire Australian continent is covered in an intricate web of ancestral tracks. Some are specific to, and contained within, a region whilst others span across regions, connecting those whose land they cover.\nThe powers of the supernatural and ancestral beings are present in the land, in natural species and within individuals. Activated through ceremony, they continue to sustain their human descendants. An individual's links with the ancestral beings and the land, and his or her spiritual and social identity, are expressed through totems of natural species and phenomena, which feature in ritual songs, dances and through the creation of art.\nBefore European colonisation, more than 200 distinct languages and up to 600 dialects were spoken across the continent. Equally, there is a myriad of cultural practices, spiritual beliefs and art traditions and styles.\nSimply, indigenous Australian art can be categorised according to a number of stylistic regions, in which artists share common visual vocabularies and specific media. Among those represented in this exhibition are the 'Top end' (Arnhem Land and its surrounds), the Kimberley, the desert and Cape York. In addition, artists such as Fiona Foley and Tracey Moffatt have been raised in the cities, outside traditional communities.\nArnhem Land, in the tropical north, is one of the richest art producing regions in the country. Covering some 114,000 square kilometres, it is renowned for hundreds of rock art sites, mighty rivers, freshwater lagoons, jungles, forests, mangrove swamps and sandy beaches.\nAt least 30 distinct languages and dialects are spoken in Arnhem Land, each as different as, say, Russian is to English; yet the region's clans (or extended family groups) have close associations through similar social organisation, spiritual beliefs and ceremonial activity.\nThe major forms of artistic expression are weavings in natural fibres produced mostly by women, sculptures and bark paintings. Painting on sheets of bark of the eucalyptus tree is the most distinctive form of art in the region. The tradition stems from painting on the inside walls of bark shelters, rock art and paintings on the human body for ceremonies (bark paintings are often considered to be reflections of the body). The tradition was stimulated during the twentieth century by the desire of Europeans to collect portable examples of local art.\nThe bark is best stripped from the stringy-bark tree (Eucalyptus tetradonta) in the wet season of October to March, when the rising sap makes it easy to remove. It is then cured either on a fire and flattened under weights. The outer surfaces are cleaned by stripping excess bark, then the inner painting surface is made smooth.\nThe standard colours used in bark paintings are red and yellow ochre, white kaolin or pipe clay, and black charcoal. These powdery pigments are mixed with binders to make paint. Traditionally, birds egg or orchid juice were used but in recent decades artists have favoured commercial wood glues which have similar qualities and are readily available. The most common brush used to execute the fine cross-hatching on barks is a short stemmed brush with only a few long hairs attached. Other brushes are made from such things as the frayed ends of sticks. Today, commercial brushes are also used.\nCross-hatched patterns, referred to as rarrk or miny'tji, are common throughout Arnhem Land. These are achieved by building up layers of lines using the fine hair brush. The patterns are used to give the surface a visual vibrancy, which evokes the power of the ancestors. This can be seen, for example, in John Mawurndjul's paintings, which have direct references to body designs.\nThe Aboriginal Memorial is an installation of 200 hollow log coffins, of the type used in secondary mortuary ceremonies in Arnhem Land to keep the bones of the deceased clan members. This collaborative piece was made on the occasion of the Bicentenary of Australia's white settlement, in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict, but who were denied proper burial. It was the artists' hope that the bicentennial year would mark a transition of Australia from an unjust and racist past to a more egalitarian future.\nTo the west of Arnhem Land and Darwin lies Wadeye (Port Keats) in the Daly and Fitzmaurice rivers area, home of the Murrinhpatha and related peoples. This coastal area features sandy beaches, mangrove swamps, creeks, rivers and low hills. Bark painting was introduced to the area in the 1950s, following the commercial success of this portable collectable art form in nearby Arnhem Land. Wadeye bark paintings are distinctive, however, as artists commonly fashion them into an oval shape. The style of painting has similarities with the rock art of the area. Also distinctive is the extended palette, which included greens (a mixture of yellow ochre and black), purples (red ochre and black) and pinks (red ochre and white).\nNym Bandak was the pre-eminent artist of the Wadeye community; a prolific bark painter, he lived through a period of great social and cultural upheaval. Bandak produced the paintings in this exhibition in the late 1950s at the request of the anthropologist W.E.H. Stanner, who sought to investigate the artist's conception of his environment. The result was not only a unique group of works but a long encounter and friendship with Stanner, which lead to a better understanding of indigenous culture by European Australians.\nThe Kimberley area in the north west of Australia, ranges from monumental rock formations in the east to where the desert meets the sea in the west. This area has a great diversity of language groups and art styles. The Kimberley is home to the ancestral Wandjina (agents of procreation) whose images first appeared in rock paintings in the region about 3000 years ago.\nThe practice of making headdresses and other paraphernalia for ceremonial dances in the Kimberley lead to the recent use of painted boards which are carried across the dancers' shoulders. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a school of painting emerged in the eastern Kimberley of which Rover Thomas was the leading figure.\nIn contrast to the lush tropical north of Australia, vast areas of the centre of the continent are desert. This harsh environment of sandhills, mountain ranges, rock formations, plains, saltpan lakes, seasonal waterways and rare permanent waterholes is the country of several distinct but related groups who share systems of graphic representation and iconography.\nThe desert was the birthplace of one of the most important movements in modern Australian art, known as the Papunya movement. In the early 1970s senior men at the government settlement of Papunya, west of Alice Springs, began to make portable paintings in acrylic using the traditional symbols of their ceremonial sand drawings, ground paintings and body painting.\nThe developments at Papunya spread in time to other desert communities, including Utopia, north east of Alice Springs, where the Utopia Women's Batik Group began in the late 1970s. By 1988, the artists at Utopia had begun painting on canvas. They employed a range of styles, including naturalistically rendered landscapes and the ubiquitous symbols of the desert.\nIn the work of Emily Kam Kngwarray, symbols are used sparingly to transcend the narrative aspect of the Dreamings they evoke. Kngwarray's strong gestural marks and fields of colour express the resonance of ancestral power in the landscape, as does the cross-hatching in Arnhem Land bark paintings.\nThe areas of Cape York in far north Queensland and the islands of the Torres Strait, which form a bridge to Papua New Guinea, are home to a number of different groups.\nWest Cape York Peninsula is the country of the Wik people, whose art has some affinities with that of Arnhem Land across the Gulf of Carpentaria to the west. The Wik have intentionally limited their engagement in the public art world -most of their art continues to be made specifically for ceremonies - although in recent times, weavings and sculptures have been made more frequently for the public domain. The sculptures in this exhibition were made for a public performance of an initiation ceremony.\nThe influence of Queensland sculptural traditions is evident in some major 'urban' artists' work. Fiona Foley, for example, a southern Queenslander, references the forked stick form in her installation work.\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who live in rural and urban areas, away from traditional environments, have played a significant role in the resurgence of indigenous culture. Such people are not concentrated in one cultural bloc and often have grown up away from their homeland or language group, without the traditional upbringing often expected of Aboriginal people.\nAboriginal art practice in areas where indigenous people are a minority dates back to the nineteenth century, with artists such as William Barak (c.1828-1903) and Tommy McRae (1836-1901). Their distinctive drawings give us rare glimpses of life at the time through Aboriginal eyes.\nArt by Aboriginal people in the city was neglected by the wider art world until the 1970s when Aboriginal social and political movements gained public attention. In 1967 citizenship rights were granted to all Aboriginal people and the first acknowledgment of their rights to land occurred in the mid 1970s. Such reforms provided indigenous artists with opportunities that were previously denied them.\nAn entire generation of artists has emerged in the cities and towns. Not restricted to stereotypical notions of Aboriginal art, they are able to freely use a range of materials, media and recent technology. Such artists articulate various subjects - notions of identity, the link to land, and other political issues concerning the indigenous view of Australian history. The so-called 'urban' movement has flourished to the point where such artists are now at the cutting edge of Australian art. The resulting work presents unique perspectives born of distinctive experiences.\nThe work of all the artists in this exhibition is intended to inform and educate its audience about the breadth and scope of art by Aboriginal people in recent years. It is also intended to challenge stereotypical perceptions of 'Aboriginality' based on notions of the 'authentic' and the 'primitive'.\nTracey Moffatt, for example, has consistently taken the stance that the categorisation of 'Aboriginal artist' is limiting. A maker of photographs and films, she regards herself as an Aboriginal person who makes art; she in fact spends most of her working time in New York.\nFrom New York to Milmilngkan in Arnhem Land, this exhibition represents the broad diversity of art by Aboriginal people at the turn of the century.\nIn the nineteenth century, Aboriginal people were classified as primitive and their material culture often shared spaces in museums with 'strange' specimens of Australian flora and fauna. By the twentieth century, with the beginning of serious anthropological interest in Aboriginal culture and society, it became clear that the preconceived ideas were in fact 'primitive' rather than Aboriginal people themselves. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Aboriginal art in all its styles and media, and from every part of the continent, is recognised as a vital and dynamic expression of the contemporary world. Today, artists are no longer disregarded on the basis of race, gender, geography and the domination of classical European models.\nThe interest in Aboriginal art which has flourished since the 1970s has created new opportunities for indigenous artists, as their work leaves the communities to be shown in museums and galleries around the world. Meanwhile, the imperatives to produce art for traditional purposes continue, and the expanded environment in which indigenous art now operates has created further compelling reasons for artists to continue expressing the values of their culture to the wider world. In the public domain, Aboriginal art can be appreciated for its spirituality and aesthetic qualities, and as a reflection of the social and political achievements and aspirations of the peoples who create it.\nSusan Jenkins and Carly Lane"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2233b5f5-2ef9-487d-82c5-22174e1a1a30>","<urn:uuid:f54ee2fb-0db4-40af-98e7-71e5c6dec018>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do I properly release a catfish caught from deep water to ensure its survival? Please provide step-by-step instructions.","answer":"First, watch for signs of decompression issues when the fish surfaces - if it rolls on its side/back, shows little movement, or has a hard, bloated belly. To safely release the fish: 1) Let the fish swim alongside the boat for 1-2 minutes, allowing natural release of excess gases through thrashing movements. 2) If needed, bring the fish aboard and massage its belly while keeping it moving. 3) For difficult cases, place the fish in a live tank to monitor until pressure is relieved. Avoid using PVC tubes for manual burping as this can damage the fish's organs. Only release the catfish once you're certain it has relieved its pressure and can swim normally.","context":["Precautions of catching deep water catsCATC Support\nPrecautions of catching deep water cats\nCatfishing in the winter can be categorized in my book as one of the best times to catch a trophy sized catfish on the Ohio River as they have migrated to and have gathered in numbers to their deep-water lairs where they appear to be most comfortable at during these cold harsh winter months and they will spend most of their time and energy cruising these haunts for food.\nThese areas also attract many other species of fish during the winter months including many types of schooling forage fish such as carp, shad, and mooneye which is one of the reasons the big ole cat is drawn to these deep water areas because it’s (What’s for Dinner) and these types of fish is also your best choice for bait as well, because it’s on the main menu for the big cats.\nOne technique commonly used to catch these winter time catfish is precision anchoring on deep water holes. First by locating specific pieces of structure or cover on your depth finder and motoring above the area moving up current then dropping your anchor and casting your baits to that specific area.\nAnother anchoring technique called bounding down is not as target specific but rather more of a cast and search technique working along the vast areas of these deep holes and runs.\nThis method involves moving from an anchored position frequently downstream and re-anchoring again 50-75 yards apart looking specifically for active and feeding catfish while also keeping your baits in one scent trail as an attractant for the cats to follow and search for as you work downstream.\nThe most common rig to fish for these deep water cats is the Carolina rig but keep in mind these winter months can produce some of the biggest pigs of the year and your tackle needs to be able to handle these big fish.\nBig catfish tackle\nThere is nothing worse to a fisherman than seeing this massive catfish surface only to have him surge and snap the wrong size tackle inches from being landed.\nHere is what I use and recommend in “big fish” tackle. First I use 80 lb. test braided main line from McCoy fishing line.\nBraided main line\nNext, I thread a 3-8 ounce slip sinker on and then attach a 150lb. barrel swivel with a Palomar knot and then tie an 18-inch piece of 50 lb test Monofilament leader line to the other end of the swivel with an improved clinch knot.\nThe last step is to attach a hook to the end of the leader line. For this, I use number 0/10 Mustad circle hooks and tie it on using a Snell knot.\nThis is my Go-to rig when I’m anchoring on these big deep water catfish.\nWinter time catfish rig\nYour equipment should be compatible with the size fish you are searching for as well. Most any medium to heavy duty rod and reel combos that are available at most local dept/sports stores will get the job done and are great deals if you are only fishing a few times a year, but if you are fishing more consistently for the big cats you may want to do some research and purchase some longer lasting quality equipment.\nCaution, releasing catfish that has been caught from deep water could be fatal to the fish.\nI have already touched on the bait choices for attracting these deep water wintering catfish along with the Where, When and How to catch them but I would also like to talk about the importance of a safe release.\nRelease you say.\nYes, over the last 10 years the lure of catching these behemoth size creatures has risen in numbers to where the sportsmen are now categorizing catfish as a sports fish and are introducing new regulations in favor of protecting them.\nThese large adult fish should never be kept for table fair as they have spent many, many years exposed to the toxins that have flowed within the water shed. The smaller younger catfish are much better for eating and has less of a risk of toxins.\nSo as a sportsman who fishes for catfish year round, my interest is to protect the large adults as well as the growing population so we can help sustain a healthy and strong fishery. Taking care of my catch for a safe release ensures that future anglers will have a chance to experience the adrenaline pumping hard fight that these magnificent fish give us which brings us to my main topic within this article.\nReleasing deep water catfish\nA catfish’s swim bladder is an internal gas-filled organ that contributes to the ability of a fish to control its buoyancy and Hooking catfish in deep water and reeling them up too quickly will result in gas expansion in their swim bladders causing them to float and not being able to return to the bottom when released, causing death. Keep in mind however that this is a year-round issue and not just limited to winter time only.\nDecompression is needed\nAlthough many anglers today have the best intentions when it comes to “catch and release” practices and want the best for the fishery but many novice anglers are unaware of this issue and will often release their fish with the pressurized swim bladders. They may appear to swim away but will resurface downstream struggling just out of sight and away from the anglers who just released it and more than likely will not make it.\nLearning the signs of this decompression phenomenon and knowing how to treat them for a safe release will help ensure positive population growth which is an important part of the conservation and management of a very cool resource.\nRecognizing the problem is fairly easy, experiencing it is just as easy and even though an angler is aware of this issue and tries to bring a deep water blue cat up from the depths slowly to allow it to decompress naturally, certain variables out of our control will just allow the fish to surface too quickly, creating this health risk for our majestic and noble adversaries.\nThe first signs of this problem will be noticed when the catfish first surfaces at the boat and just rolls on its side or back then shows little or no movement and no fight but appears to want to float in an unnatural state. Inspect the belly section before you let it go.\nA fat belly from a fish that has fed heavily will look totally different from those that had been pulled to the surface too quickly.\nEven when the fish has been gorging its self, the belly will remain soft to the touch and shouldn’t be mistaken for the oddly shaped and bloated look with extremely hard pressurized bellies which will be tight drum like to the touch caused from expanding gasses that developed during the fight.\nNot to worry though as this is an easy fix when needed.\nAll these fish needs to do is relieve some pressure as in a “BURP” so to say and most times you can help them do it naturally by stalling your catch at the boat. Once you can see that fish is hooked good let it swim alongside the boat for an extra minute or two.\nIn most cases the fishes sudden movements of thrashing and twisting will naturally release these gasses, removing the risk of becoming a floater and resetting the pressure on the fish’s swim bladder so to say.\nIt just takes a little time for them to blow off these excess gasses and they can be returned safely.\nMost of the time this can be achieved by simply letting them swim around a bit to the surface to blow the pressure and the constant movement helps the process happen quicker but other times, there are other instances where you may have to bring fish on board and place them in a controlled live tank to monitor while you help it recover for a safe and sure release.\nAnother effective option is to manually Burp them with a tube that has been inserted down their gullet.\nSome anglers prefer to use a ½ inch PVC tube about 18 inches long to perform this action but this is my least favorite way to do it and my last resort as I feel this can sometimes cause more harm than good in the long run.\nAlthough this way is one of the fastest ways to achieve your end goal of burping the fish, it can sometimes damage the fish’s esophagus as the fish begins the resist and thrash with the hard tube inserted 15” inches within their bodies vital organs.\nIt’s a double-edged sword.\nYou’re trying to save the fish by manually burping the fish so you can release it for future action but end up slowly killing the fish because an infection from a hole that was punched in its stomach lining from a piece of PVC that was improperly pushed in their gullet while thrashing and resisting on deck.\nI just like to take the little extra time with them at the boat to help them Burp when possible.\nBut In some situations like faster current, when you cannot leave them at the side of the boat for a period of time I’ll bring them into the boat and lay them on deck for a few minutes massaging the bellies, the best medicine I’ve found is just keep them moving and it seems to work out of them.\nIf I’m still unsure, I will hold them in a live tank to be certain that the fish has relieved its pressures and can be safely released.\nPassing this information on to others I feel will help in conservation awareness with the growing numbers of catfish enthusiast not only in Kentucky but across the nation as well. It’s important to share in the responsibilities of good conservation practices from our sportsman and educate our future enthusiast so they can continue to promote and maintain healthy fisheries while also growing a positive family outdoor activity.\n“If we are going to play with these huge cats we should respect them and strive to put them back in their environment just as good as when we pulled them from it”."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a1655b7-70a4-4e4e-a3e4-eb90cef5f6cb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the signs of emerald ash borer infestation in trees, and what current research efforts are being conducted to control its spread in North America?","answer":"Signs of emerald ash borer (EAB) infestation include loss of foliage, new shoots appearing on the tree trunk, and bark cracking or bulging where larvae have been feeding. Trees typically die within 3 years of infestation. As for control efforts, current research focuses on biological control programs using parasitoids (Oobius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Spathius galinae) to suppress EAB populations. These biocontrol agents are being released and studied in various regions including Michigan and Northeast states like Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York to evaluate their effectiveness in protecting North American ash resources.","context":["Here in Montreal, there have recently been a lot of tree losses due the emerald ash borer (EAB). When walking around my neighbourhood, my heart breaks when I see big, beautiful ash trees flagged for removal because of the wrath of the EAB. All this had me wondering: how did it all start and how do we stop it? Logically, if it is killing these trees at such an alarming rate, then it can’t possibly be natural, or at least not natural for this part of the world.\nThe EAB has been a problem in North America since it was first noticed, in Detroit and Windsor back in 2002, but of course, the insect probably arrived on the continent, several years earlier. The pest is native to Asia, living in and feeding off trees of similar genus or family to the ash tree. It is not considered a pest in Asia because Asian ash trees tend to be more resistant and the pest occurs at lower densities, however, its behaviours and impacts are much different in North America. The EAB most likely arrived in solid wood packing material that was being imported to North America. Finding the ash tree as a suitable host, it was able to establish and multiply, causing increasingly devastating losses to ash tree populations. This is particularly problematic for urban areas because ash trees are frequently planted in urban forests due to their shaded-providing and aesthetic properties.\nThe adult EABs are not the ones that cause significant harm the trees, it is actually their larvae. They live underneath the bark, feeding off the internal fibres of the tree, specifically, the phloem and the cambium of the tree, impeding water and nutrient supply to outer parts of the tree, causing it to die within 3 years.\nIt is difficult (unless you are a professional) to notice if an ash tree is infested before it is too late for treatment. Some noticeable signs are loss of foliage and new shoots appearing on the trunk of the tree, which is the tree’s natural response to loss of foliage. Closer to the end of its life, the bark of the tree will crack open or bulge near to where the larvae have been feeding.\nOnce a tree is infested, in can either be treated or cut down. Treatment is only possible for larger ash trees (15 cm or more in diameter) that have lost less than 30% of their foliage. In urban areas, smaller trees and trees that are too far gone, must be cut down as there is no other way to save it and they are at risk of falling down suddenly and harming someone.\nCutting down all infested trees, is not an effective solution to eliminating the EAB problem, as the EAB will just find another host tree. There is still a lot of research being done on this front, and it is suspected that biological controls and natural tree resistance can be possible contributors to the control or eradication of the EAB in North America. Biological controls have a long history of causing more problems than they solve, so it is possible that with population control via treatment of infested trees and regulations on transported materials, the problem will eventually be solved as ash trees gain natural resistance.\nHere are some pictures I’ve taken of local ash trees that have been seriously infested:","Project Number: 8010-22000-031-061-I\nProject Type: Interagency Reimbursable Agreement\nStart Date: Jun 1, 2022\nEnd Date: Sep 30, 2024\nEmerald ash borer (EAB) is the most destructive invasive forest pest in North America, causing widespread mortality of ash trees in urban landscapes and natural forests. First discovered in Michigan in 2002, EAB has now spread to 35 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and five Canadian provinces. Costs of treating or removing and replacing even half of the ash trees growing on municipal property in urban and suburban communities were projected to exceed $1.1 billion per year. The proposed research aims to develop and test a sustainable EAB management approach that relies on releases of introduced biocontrol agents (parasitoids) to protect North American ash in both urban and natural hardwood forests. The proposed work will focus on evaluation of effectiveness of the current biocontrol programs in protecting North American ash resources through suppressing EAB populations at regional levels by releasing EAB egg and larval parasitoids (Oobius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Spathius galinae). Objectives: The proposed research has two specific objectives: (1) Monitor and evaluate the long-term impact of introduced EAB biocontrol agents on ash regeneration and growth from seedlings, saplings, basal sprouts, and surviving ash trees at our previous (long-term) biocontrol study sites in both Lower Michigan and several Northeast States (Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York), where all three biocontrol agents (O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. galinae) were either sequentially or simultaneously released more than five years earlier. (2) Determine the establishment, spread, and impacts of more recently released parasitoids on EAB population densities and ash health at the new study sites in Lower Michigan and two selected Northeast States (Connecticut and Massachusetts), where releases of these introduced agents were completed between 2018 and 2021.\nThe proposed work will be carried out in two distinctive regions: (1) infested areas of lower Michigan, where EAB was first detected in 2002 and (2) the Northeast region (Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York), where EAB was first detected between 2010 and 2013. In Michigan, six, secondary mixed-hardwood bottomland forests containing both green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) and white ash (F. americana L.) received releases of O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. agrili from 2008 to 2010 (Duan et al. 2013), and S. galinae from 2015 to 2017 after confirmation of successful establishment of O. agrili and T. planipennisi (Duan et al., 2020). More recently, three additional forests from this region were also selected as new study sites (~60 km from the six earlier sites) with simultaneous releases of O. agrili, T. planipennisi and S. galinae from 2018 to 2021. While historical data on ash crown condition, EAB densities and associated mortality factors including the introduced biocontrol agents have been collected from the earlier (long-term) biocontrol study sites (along with the paired no-parasitoid release control plots), these newly established biocontrol release sites have not been sampled for establishment, spread and impacts of the newly released biocontrol agents on EAB infesting ash trees and/or saplings. In the Northeast region (CT/NY/MA), where, the six, long-term sites consisted of secondary mixed-hardwood forests containing green and white ash trees received O. agrili, T. planipennisi, and S. galinae were released simultaneously from 2015 to 2017 (Duan et al., 2019). More recently, several new forest sites were also established with simultaneous releases of these three biocontrol agents from 2018 – 2020. Historical data on ash crown condition, EAB densities, and associated mortality factors including the introduced biocontrol agents have been collected from the earlier established (long-term) biocontrol forests in this region; however, no data have been collected there from the additional new sites that were established from 2018 to 2020."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7512ce80-7c9f-4a8b-b04e-13cbfef499aa>","<urn:uuid:8326ad2c-8b26-4630-a27f-094a8a87570f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the recommended treatment approaches differ between early-stage gingivitis and advanced periodontitis, and what are the long-term health implications of leaving either condition untreated?","answer":"Early-stage gingivitis can usually be treated through maintaining good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing. However, if left untreated, it can progress to periodontitis, where gum tissue pulls away from teeth and pockets develop, requiring more intensive treatment including surgical or non-surgical periodontal treatments. The health implications of untreated conditions are significant - gingivitis leads to bleeding gums and inflammation, while untreated periodontitis can result in bone and tooth loss, chewing pain, sensitive teeth, and loose teeth. Furthermore, chronic periodontitis is associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels, which may increase cancer risk. Studies have linked untreated gum disease to various cancers, including pancreatic, esophageal, and head and neck cancers, as well as other systemic health issues like cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.","context":["Maintaining Oral Health Naturally\nThe Importance of a Good Oral Health Routine\nThis article was featured in the Manitoba Post as part of a series on Lowering Your Risk of Cancer\nInflammation is linked to just about every health concern including arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and degenerative diseases like cancer. Inflammation isn’t always a bad thing, however. When it lasts for a short period of time (up to a few days), the inflammatory process helps the body recover from injury or infection, and dissipates once healing is underway. This acute inflammation stage is a normal and positive process. It's chronic, continuous inflammation that is the cause of so many health problems. Chronic inflammation is associated with accelerated aging (sometimes called inflammaging), which is connected to many age-related diseases including type II diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.\nOne of the primary causes of chronic inflammation is gum disease. In the United States, 47.2% of adults over 30 have some form of gum disease. It’s more common in men than women, and the prevalence increases with age -- 70% of men over 65 have some form of gum disease.\nIf your teeth bleed when you brush, this can be caused by excessive plaque build-up which triggers inflammation. Plaque is the sticky layer of bacteria that accumulates on the teeth, especially along the gum line. Proper oral care can remove the plaque that causes gingivitis (the technical term for inflammation of the gums and the first phase of gum disease). In addition to brushing and flossing, regular use of an oral irrigator, an interdental proxy brush, and a tongue cleaner can help restore red, bleeding, or inflamed gum tissue to pink, vibrant, healthy gums, and prevent gingivitis from progressing to periodontitis.\nIf gingivitis is left to progress without proper treatment, gum tissue may begin to pull away from the teeth, and pockets can develop where the teeth meet the gums. These spaces are a breeding ground for bacteria, which can build up into a condition called periodontitis, characterized by a loss of attachment between the tooth and bone. This can lead to further gum infection and result in chewing pain, sensitive teeth, receding gums, even bone and tooth loss. One of the clearest indicators of periodontitis is when you feel your teeth are loose and may fall out, but the proliferation of oral bacteria can also cause persistent bad breath. Periodontitis damages the soft tissue and bone that hold the teeth in place. This common condition affects over 11% of the world's population. There are some excellent dental mouthwashes including Peri-Gum that can help heal gum tissue while reducing the pockets that harbor harmful bacteria.\nMany studies have found a strong association between chronic periodontitis and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Produced by the liver, CRP is considered a specific marker indicating inflammation in the body and can be measured by a blood test (any acute or chronic infection results in elevated levels). High CRP levels are associated with cancer, as inflammation may facilitate the progression of tumors and angiogenesis (the development of new blood vessels to support cancer cell growth). Surgical and non-surgical periodontal treatments have been shown to reduce levels of CRP which may lower the risk of various cancers.\nResearch from Finland has found a link between gum disease and different types of cancer, and that the oral bacterium Treponema denticola may be responsible for gastrointestinal cancers. As published in the International Journal of Cancer, an analysis of almost 70,000 adults over a 10-year period found a strong association between gum disease and pancreatic cancer. In another study at Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center, after controlling for potential effects from smoking, alcohol, and body mass index, researchers found that three types of oral bacteria are linked to two fatal forms of esophageal cancer. There is also evidence that specific types of oral microbiota that cause gum disease are associated with head and neck cancer.\nMost people are unaware of the tremendous overall health benefits of oral probiotics. This exciting new area of research is showing that their regular use can help reverse gingivitis and periodontitis by correcting imbalances in the oral microbiome. As with the gut microbiome, the oral cavity requires a balanced ecosystem where beneficial bacteria predominate. Poor oral hygiene and oral plaque increase levels of pathogenic oral bacteria like P. gingivalis and Treponema denticola. Probiotic antimicrobial peptides produced by lactic acid bacteria called (bacteriocins) can help treat gum disease by crowding out the bad strains that thrive on dental plaque. Specific strains shown to be effective include S. Salivarius BLIS K12 and M18, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and the Lactobacillus-based strains reuteri, Brevis, and Acidophilus. By increasing levels of these beneficial oral bacteria, harmful bacteria is inhibited. In addition, oral probiotics can help reduce ear, nose and throat infections (including tonsillitis and strep throat).\nSee your dentist regularly, have frequent cleanings, and implement an oral care routine to help balance your oral microbiome. You should clean your teeth in the proper order, starting with flossing (use small floss picks or regular floss), followed by brushing (electric toothbrushes including the 30 Second Smile are recommended), an interdental brush, and an electric oral water irrigator like the Hydrofloss, proven to remove subgingival plaque (below the gum line). I also recommend tooth powders including Good Gums and Theraneem.\nMaintaining good gum health, and using healing mouthwashes and oral probiotics can help prevent, and even reverse gum disease, lowering the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.","Oral health means much more than healthy teeth, oral health is essential to general health.Safe and effective disease prevention measures exist, so that everyone can voluntarily decide to improve oral health and prevent disease.\nPreventive dentistry focuses on the ability to help individuals achieve and maintain maximum oral health throughout their lives. The prevention of disease by using proper brushing techniques, flossing, fluoride applications, and space maintainers are introduced to patients as a part of preventive dentistry. This helps the patient a lotbecause of long term benefit and cost effectiveness.\nPREVENTION OF GUM DISEASES AND BAD BREATH\nPREVENTING DENTAL CARIES\nPREVENTION OF MALALIGNMENT\nPREVENTION OF EXTRACTION\nPREVENTION OF TMJ PROBLEMS\nGum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected and thereby causing foul smell.\nIt’s estimated to affect more than half of all adults in the INDIA to some degree. And most people experience it at least once. It is much less common in children.\nIf you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.\nIf gingivitis is not treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects the tissues that support teeth and hold them in place. In the INDIA, up to 25% of adults are estimated to have severe periodontitis, with many more affected less severely.\nIf periodontitis is not treated, the bone in your jaw can decay and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.\nGum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria, which forms when you eat and drink.\nSome bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are very harmful for the health of your gums. If you do not remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it will build up and irritate your gums, leading to redness, swelling and soreness.\nYou should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth. Click here for your appointment\nMild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups.\nIn most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They will also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future.\nIf you have severe gum disease, you will usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery or laser treatment may need to be carried out. This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics).\nIt is important to have regular dental check-ups so that any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early.\nIf you have never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one to two years for a check-up.\nYou may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you have had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment.\nMaintaining good oral hygiene through brushing and flossing your teeth is one of the most effective ways to prevent tooth decay.\nSome simple changes your diet can also help.\nBrushing tips to prevent dental caries:\nBrush your teeth for at least two minutes last thing at night before you go to bed and on one other occasion every day. Apart from bedtime, it doesn’t really matter when the other time you brush your teeth is – providing it’s at least an hour after you last ate.\nDon’t brush your teeth straight after a meal as it can damage your teeth, especially if you’ve had fruit, fizzy drinks, wine or any other food that contains acid. Leaving an hour will give your saliva a chance to neutralize the acid.\nIt is also important you brush your teeth in the right way. The following advice may help:\nPlace the head of your toothbrush against your teeth, then tilt the bristle tips to a 45 degree angle against the gum line. Move the brush in small circular movements, several times, on all the surfaces of every tooth.\nBrush the outer surfaces of each tooth, upper and lower, keeping the bristles angled against the gum line.\nUse the same method on the inside surfaces of all your teeth.\nBrush the chewing surfaces of the teeth.\nTo clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make several small circular strokes with the front part of the brush.\nBrushing your tongue will freshen your breath and clean your mouth by removing bacteria.\nDo not rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing as this washes the protective toothpaste away. Just spit out excess toothpaste.\nTry not to eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after brushing.\nIt is important to replace your toothbrush on a regular basis because they wear out and become less effective in removing plaque. Most toothbrushes need to be replaced every two to three months.\nIt doesn’t matter whether you use an electric or manual toothbrush. They’re both equally as good, providing you brush with them properly. However, some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush.\nFlossing is an important part of oral hygiene. It removes plaque and food particles from between your teeth and under the gum line, where a toothbrush cannot always reach.\nYou should ideally clean between your teeth at least once a day with floss. This can be done before or after brushing your teeth at night.\nYour dentist or hygienist can advise you on flossing techniques, but the following tips may help:\nTake 12-18 inches (30-45cm) of floss and grasp it so you have a couple of inches of floss taut between your hands.\nSlip the floss gently between the teeth and into the area between your teeth and gums, as far as it will go.\nFloss with 8-10 strokes, up and down between each tooth, to dislodge food and plaque.\nYou can use interdental brushes instead of flossing, especially if your teeth are very close together and you find it difficult to maneuver dental floss through the gap.\nUsing an alcohol-free dental mouthwash that contains fluoride can also help prevent tooth decay.\nHowever, this should not be used directly after brushing your teeth. Choose a separate time to use mouthwash, such as after lunch. Do not eat or drink for 30 minutes after using a fluoride mouthwash.\nLimiting the amount of sugar you eat and drink is important to prevent tooth decay and also has wider benefits for your general health. Have sugary food and drink only at mealtimes and don’t eat sugary snacks between meals.\nMost of the sugars we eat and drink are contained in processed and ready-made food and drinks. These include:\nHealthier alternatives for snacks and drinks include cheese, fruit and vegetables, and unsweetened tea or coffee. Some artificial sweeteners have been shown not to contribute to toothy decay, so they may be a good alternative if you like to add sugar to any foods or drinks.\nChewing sugar-free gum after you have eaten may also help prevent tooth decay. When you chew gum, your mouth produces saliva, which neutralizes the acid in your mouth before it can damage your teeth.\nSome medicines can contain sugar too, so you should ideally use sugar-free alternatives whenever possible. Your GP or pharmacist should be able to advise you about this.\nRead more about lifestyle tips for healthy teeth.\nChecking food labels\nCheck labels on foods to see how much sugar they contain. Sugar comes in many forms, so look out for the following ingredients:\nIngredients are usually listed in order of the amount used, with the main ingredient listed first. If sugar, or one of the ingredients above, is near the top of the ingredients list, it may mean the food is high in sugar.\nSome products also use the traffic light system as part of their labelling to indicate whether they are high or low in sugar, where a red light indicates a high amount of sugar and a green light indicates a low amount of sugar.\nIn general, high in sugar means more than 15g of sugar for every 100g of product and low in sugar means less than 5g of sugar for every 100g\nPREVENTION OF MALALIGNMENT\nPreventive orthodontics are procedures topromote the development of a normal occlusion and aid in preventing malocclusion from developing.\nInterceptive orthodontics are procedures to restore a normal occlusion once a malocclusion has started todevelop.\nGenetic and environmental factors can contribute to the development of malocclusionand can span several years, rendering it difficult to determine specific causative factors. These malocclusions should be diagnosed at the earliest within the age of 6 to 8 year old. Preventive treatments are done accordingly based on the jaw size whether to maximize or minimize its growth in case of a bony malalignment. If incase of the dental malalignment where only the teeth is overcrowded, the milk teeth needs to be extracted called as serial extraction which intrude would pave way for the ascending permanent to erupt properly. Thus, preventing future orthodontic treatments.\nIn case of extraction of decayed milk tooth SPACE MAINTAINERSare advised to maintain the extracted space so that the permanent teeth can erupt in its position without causing malalignment.

When you extract a tooth, the problems that you face are\nHence saving a tooth is very important. Acutely infected tooth can be saved by ROOT CANAL TREATMENT PRODURE AND PLACING CROWNS.\nCertain teeth like WISDOM TOOTH OR GROSSLY DECAYED TOOTH can never be save. But if you have an option given by your dentist that your tooth can be saved, do save it then to avoid future problems.\nPREVENTION OF TMJ PROBLEMS\nOften jaw problems resolve on their own in several weeks to months. If you have recently experienced TMJ pain and/or dysfunction, you may find relief with some or all of the following therapies.\nMoist Heat: Moist heat from a heat pack or a hot water bottle wrapped in a warm, moist towel can improve function and reduce pain. Be careful to avoid burning yourself when using heat.\nIce: Ice packs can decrease inflammation and also numb pain and promote healing. Do not place an ice pack directly on your skin. Keep the pack wrapped in a clean cloth while you are using it. Do not use an ice pack for more than 10 – 15 minutes.\nSoft Diet: Soft or blended foods allow the jaw to rest temporarily. Remember to avoid hard, crunchy, and chewy foods. Do not stretch your mouth to accommodate such foods as corn on the cob, apples, or whole fruits.\nOver the-Counter Analgesics: For many people with TMJ Disorders, short-term use of over-the-counter pain medicines or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen, may provide temporary relief from jaw discomfort. When necessary, your dentist or doctor can prescribe stronger pain or anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, or antidepressants to help ease symptoms.\nJaw Exercises: Slow, gentle jaw exercises may help increase jaw mobility and healing. Your health care provider or a physical therapist can evaluate your condition and suggest appropriate exercises based on your individual needs. A recent study found therapeutic jaw exercises bring earlier recovery of jaw function compared to splints!\nRelaxation Techniques: Relaxation and guided imagery can be helpful in dealing with the pain that accompanies TMJ dysfunction. Deep, slow breathing enhances relaxation and modulates pain sensations. Some have found yoga, massage, and meditation helpful in reducing stress and aiding relaxation.\nSide Sleeping: Sleep on your side using pillow support between shoulder and neck.\nRelax Facial Muscles: Make a concerted effort to relax your lips, and keep teeth apart.\nYawning: Use your fist to support your chin as you yawn to prevent damage to the joint and prevent your jaw from locking open.\nIn addition, avoid: Jaw clenching. Gum chewing.\nBUT TO PREVENT TMD: Missing posterior teeth has to be immediately replaced according to your original height of you jaw which is very very important.\nBe sure to discuss your jaw limitations with your doctor prior to surgery or a long dental appointment so he/she uses extreme caution. Anesthesia, often used during dental procedures, can affect mouth opening and damage the joint. If possible, avoid long dental appointments requiring an open mouth for more than 30 minutes.\nRemember, if your TMJ problems get worse with time, you should seek professional advice. However, first and foremost, educate yourself."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:36f22c35-ad1d-4f86-b6b0-7349867526a8>","<urn:uuid:1b3ab23f-f347-4703-a1be-92a65da10ae9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the data classification levels used in sensitive data management compare with the FIPS 140-2 security levels in terms of their gradation from lowest to highest protection?","answer":"The data classification levels and FIPS 140-2 security levels both follow a graduated approach to protection, but with different structures. Data classification typically uses three main levels: Public (lowest protection, for shareable data with minimal risk), Private and confidential (medium protection, for data like addresses), and Restricted (highest protection, for sensitive data like credit card numbers). In contrast, FIPS 140-2 defines four security levels: Level 1 provides the lowest level of security, Level 2 adds tamper-evidence requirements, Level 3 requires high probability of detecting physical access attempts, and Level 4 provides the highest security with complete protection and detection of all unauthorized physical access attempts.","context":["February 15, 2019\nWhat is Sensitive Data Classification?\nSensitive data can be a number of things. The easiest way to think about it is to think of personal data you would not want to be shared with just anyone. There are several common pieces of sensitive data:\n- Financial information – credit card numbers, bank account information, and social security numbers.\n- Government information – any document that is classified as secret or top-secret, restricted, or can be considered a breach of confidentiality.\n- Business information – accounting data, trade secrets, financial statements or accounts, and any sensitive information in business plans.\n- Personal information – addresses, medical history, driver’s license numbers, or phone numbers.\nAny of these pieces of data are things you could not be comfortable in data sharing with someone who should not have access. Unfortunately, a data breach can occur leaving you feeling exposed and increases the risk of identity theft. Businesses are continually evolving protection protocols and regulations to ensure data protection.\nData Discovery and Sensitive Data Classification Security Measures\nOne way to try and determine how sensitive, specific data is, and therefore how it should be classified, is to think about how the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that information or restricted data would impact your organization in the case of an unauthorised disclosure.\nThe following table is taken from the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publication 199 published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides a framework for determining the impact that can be applied to the sensitivity of information.\nSensitive Data Classification\nHere are the three security objectives and how to determine the level of influence (low, moderate, or high):\nConfidentiality: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.\nPotential impact: The unauthorized disclosure of information could be expected to have a limited (low), serious (moderate), or severe/catastrophic (high) adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.\nIntegrity: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non‐repudiation and authenticity.\nPotential impact: The unauthorized modification or destruction of information could be expected to have a limited (low), serious (moderate), or severe/catastrophic (high) adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.\nAvailability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.\nPotential impact: The disruption of access to or use of information or an information system could be expected to have a limited (low), serious (moderate), or severe/ catastrophic (high) adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.\n(Source: National Institute of Standards and Technology “FIPS Publication 199: Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems”)\nAs the potential impact level moves from low to high, the sensitivity increases, and therefore, the classification level of data should become higher and more restrictive. If your classification schema ranges from public to top secret, for example, data with a low impact across the board might be classified as public, while data with a high impact in any one area might be considered top secret.\nOnce you’ve developed a framework for classifying data, you develop your business’s classification schema with additional business criteria and an understanding of your specific types of sensitive data.\nProtecting Data with a Data Classification Policy to Determine Impact Level\n- Data classification should be your first step in protecting proprietary information. Since various pieces of data have varying levels of sensitivity, there are different levels of protection. As someone who is in charge of data security for a business or an organization understanding the level of sensitivity required for protection is a crucial piece of the protection puzzle. As a general rule of thumb, there should be a minimum of three data classification levels. Public – what data is okay to share with the public? Anything that is not personal or sensitive such as a person’s name. This means that there would be very little to no risk if this data were accessed, this type of information likely does not need to be encrypted or have major protection.\n- Restricted – this is the most sensitive data, meaning if someone were to hack into a database and access it, it would pose a risk to the person whose information it is. This could include anything that could lead to identity theft like credit card numbers or a social security number.\n- Private and confidential – access to this data would cause a medium risk to the person affected. For example, this could include someone’s address. It allows someone to be aware of where someone lives. However, they would not have any more personal information on someone.\nMany data security policies have been created and adapted across the business world to help protect the business and the consumer. Various companies and agencies have in-house security policies as well. Some of the most protected sensitive data is in the medical field, as medical organizations have many acts or policies to adhere to such as HIPPA. One of the most common ways of protecting sensitive data is through the use of data encryption. This changes the information from the clear or plain text to something that cannot be read without the ability of the decryption key. No one should be worried about sharing their personal data without explicit consent.\nAt Spirion we are here to help protect and secure the business’ and consumer’s sensitive data.

Let us be a part of your security policy.","Planning for Data Security\nExternal hackers and internal employees and former employees threaten the integrity of cancer registry data. To address these risks, organizations need to know—\n- Who has access to the databases?\n- How are administrative passwords stored?\n- What are the policies for auditing system security and looking for suspicious activity?\n- What is the procedure if security is breached?\nPreventive security measures such as encryption, access control, and strong user identification technologies help protect sensitive data from external and internal threats.\nDeveloping a Security Policy\nAll registries that submit data to the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) should have a security policy that is specific to the needs of the registry and the organization in which the registry operates. This includes registries that are a part of a larger public health department, a university, or an institution that provides information technology support for several programs. The security policy of the organization in which the registry operates must meet or be modified to accommodate the specific concerns of the cancer registry.\nCDC’s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control has compiled the following information in support of CDC’s NPCR to help cancer registries create or audit their current security policy. This information is not intended establish cancer registry security policy, but to guide cancer registries as they address security issues.\nMany NPCR programs are part of a larger public health department, university, or institution that provides technical support for several programs and usually has a security policy in place. Each NPCR program and its organization’s technical support staff are responsible for making cancer registry data secure. Both will devote time to security training and monitoring, and to reviewing and updating the security document.\n- Designate a CTO. The first step is to identify or designate a person who works directly with the registry director to ensure data security. This person is often called the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and is typically a senior information technology professional supporting the cancer registry.\n- Find out if you have a security policy. Next, the registry should determine if a security policy has been written. If so, the CTO should review it and identify any needed updates. If not, the CTO should lead the development of a new policy specific to the needs of the registry.\n- Develop a new security policy, if needed. The CTO will obtain existing institutional security documents and work with registry staff to develop a single security document detailing national, institutional, and NPCR security policies and standards.\n- Execute the policy. Technical support and registry staff should work together to execute the security plan and enforce security policies.\n- Review and update the policy. At a minimum, the security document should be updated annually to include advances in technology and updates to prevailing standards.\nThe Security Document\nEach registry should have a comprehensive security document that describes in detail the data security risks, policies, and procedures specific to that registry. Components of the security document include—\n- Standards from—\n- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n- Federal Information Processing Standard 140 (FIPS).\n- The North American Association for Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) Standards for Cancer Registries Volume III, chapter 6, “Security and Confidentiality.”\n- Certification and Accreditation Process Guide, as referenced in the CDC Unified Process.\n- Risk assessment and management.\n- Networking and privacy security policies.\n- Plans for encryption of data on mobile services and portable media.\n- Plans for encryption of data in databases.\n- Disaster recovery plans.\n- Ongoing security training.\n- Requirement to audit security policies regularly.\n- Plans for vulnerability and source code security scan and archiving of log files.\n- Requirement to review and update the security document annually based on changes to risk factors, technology, and policy.\nThe registry’s security document must accommodate the specific concerns of the NPCR program. It should ensure that security responsibilities are assigned to organization technical support and NPCR program staff, and authorize all information technology systems and software applications processing prior to installation.\nPeriodic internal auditing is key to maintaining the security document. Auditors review the major components of the security document and provide objective opinions to the registry on the degree to which risk management, control, and governance (which comprise the registry’s policies, procedures, and operations) support—\n- Achievement of the parent organization’s objectives.\n- Appropriate assessment of risk.\n- Reliable internal and external reporting.\n- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n- Compliance with NPCR’s standards for the registry.\nThese assessments help maintain or improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the registry’s information technology risk management, internal controls, and security. In addition, auditors’ recommendations benefit line management. As stated in NAACCR’s Standards for Cancer Registries Volume III: Standards for Completeness, Quality, Analysis, Management, Security and Confidentiality of Data,external icon the registry’s parent organization may fulfill this function.\nFIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security—\n- FIPS 140-2 Level 1: Provides the lowest level of security.\n- FIPS 140-2 Level 2: Enhances the physical security mechanisms of level 1 by adding the requirement for tamper-evidence.\n- FIPS 140-2 Level 3: Requires physical security mechanisms that have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at physical access, use, or modification of the cryptographic module.\n- FIPS 140-2 Level 4: Provides the highest level of security defined in this standard. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms protect the cryptographic module completely, with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access.\nPlease visit FIPS 140-2 pdf icon[PDF-1.4MB]external icon for more information."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:83d02df2-05fa-445a-8204-5e66738fe3ba>","<urn:uuid:58e8d33c-920d-4697-aece-cd54a9b11e4b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is complaint documentation crucial in business operations, and what role do umbrella insurance policies play in comprehensive business protection?","answer":"Complaint documentation is crucial because it helps maintain brand reputation, ensures quality service, and minimizes legal disputes. It's important to record complaints with privacy and data protection in mind, maintain written records of all communications, and document investigation outcomes. Written documentation helps avoid misunderstandings and provides evidence if legal issues arise. Regarding comprehensive protection, umbrella insurance policies provide coverage above and beyond other liability coverage types. They protect against unusually high losses when the policy limits of underlying policies (such as general liability and auto liability) have been exhausted, and can also extend to employment practices liability and directors and officers liability insurance.","context":["We have all been there ourselves. From taking to social media to spending hours on an automated phone waiting queue to writing a formal letter or email. From a parcel that has not been delivered or faulty item to a service outage, we have all contacted a company to complain about a service or product that has, quite simply, failed to live up to our expectations.\nIt may be a Wi-Fi signal outage, a new television that has not been delivered on time, human error, food that has arrived raw or cold to the table, or broken goods.\nProcessing, escalating and acting upon complaints has become a natural part of our jobs as professionals, regardless of the industry we are in. Recording a complaint and acting on this form of customer feedback expeditiously is vital to maintaining brand reputation, trust and ensuring a quality service to new and returning customers.\nEach business should have a formal policy outlining their customer complaints’ procedure. This avoids customers ending up in endless loops being thrown between each department of your business. A joined-up approach should aim to provide a satisfactory outcome within a suitable timeframe and offer a degree of reassurance. In most cases a form of apology and reason for why things may have went wrong, or not delivered a satisfactory service, should also be offered. Your policy should aim to resolve their complaint, provide feedback to managers for the relevant department, act as insight for management for your business’ shortcomings and minimise any potential legal disputes. In an ideal world, feedback resulting from customers’ complaints should be communicated by managers to staff at ground level, such as through daily, weekly or monthly staff meetings, and form part of their regular staff training.\nYou should provide your staff and personnel, including subcontractors, guidance and briefings around handling of customer complaints. This is especially important for frontline and customer-facing roles, as well as uniformed staff. Training and policy awareness for your uniformed staff is just as important; their interactions with customers can ultimately have legal implications for your business. Why is this important now more than ever? We have seen throughout the pandemic and in recent times on social media that frustrated customers are using their phones to record interactions with companies and their staff, and videos may be admissible as evidence in a legal context and in court. A post or negative video about your company lasting no more than 30 seconds can go viral in a matter of a few hours.\nReminding uniformed staff about their behaviour when commuting to and from work when wearing your branded uniform is just as important. Afterall while they are wearing your uniform, they are representing your company image.\nFor issues which are not time sensitive and if the customer’s complaint requires further investigation beyond a reasonable timeframe, such as 14 days, confirm receipt of the customer’s complaint preferably by email. Emailing avoids the possible few day delay that you would expect by post.\nIf you are a small business you may choose to give your customer a call for that more personable approach and offer reassurance that you are taking their feedback seriously.\nFor serious complaints which have significant legal implications, such as matters related to personnel misconduct and health and safety, the advice would always be to respond in writing to avoid getting into an argument, misunderstandings or legal implications from mistimed and misinformed admissions of fault.\nWhen sending a letter or email confirming receipt of their complaint, send a link or attach a copy of your complaints procedure. Briefly outline approximately when the customer should expect a further update and who their point of contact for the complaint is.\nIdeally you should ask the customer to include as much detail as possible, such as order number and date, and send a copy of any supporting evidence if applicable. This will allow you to cross-check your own internal records, interactions with the customer and make an informed decision about next steps.\nIndependence vs Credibility\nA complaint should ideally be handled by someone independent and not related to the individual or area of your business that the complaint is regarding. This impacts on the credibility of the outcome and trust in your company. A complaint handler should familiarise themselves with how a company works, relevant policies, applicable UK law, internal staffing structure and each department’s general responsibilities. You will then know who to contact about a specific issue, which helps if you are working for a multinational company with many different departments or companies with head offices and regional locations. This can improve with how efficiently a complaint is dealt with and being able to thoroughly investigate with an understanding and knowledge of the operational side of the business.\nBe sure to cross-check any past emails, letters and communications with the customer, including the correspondence with the customer about this transaction or order, if that is the case. Providing the customer with a different reason about why an order or issue was not quality checked or delivered on time, for example, can be embarrassing and lead to confusion.\nComplaint handling should have transparency, honesty and your company’s values at its core. Covering up and failing to admit mistakes will only ultimately breed a culture of unaccountability, costly recurring mistakes, and a lack of trust from a customer’s perspective.\nTone and address\nThink carefully about how you wish to address the customer when responding to their complaint. If you are a multinational or corporate company, using their title (such as Mr, Mrs or Ms) and surname along with a formal tone should be the standard template.\nA small business replying to a regular customer who they have met before may choose to address them by their first name. This of course is dependent on the seriousness of their complaint.\nRead to understand\nTake the time to understand what went wrong from the customer’s perspective, who may have been involved or been on shift at the time to identify possible faults and improve working processes.\nIn one or two sentences summarise the customer’s complaint, repeating the subject and issue/s brought to your attention. This will help avoid confusion and allow the customer to clarify in a return letter should you have misread or misunderstood the matters flagged in their complaint.\nTake the time to digest the customer’s complaint in its entirety, allowing you to understand and empathise for the issues and the customer’s personal circumstances.\nThanking the customer, empathise and offer apology\nThank the customer for their custom, patience in allowing you time to investigate and for taking the time to write to you about their negative experience.\n“Thank you for email dated 1st January 2021. I am sorry to hear about your recent experience. We have received your complaint and will be investigating. I offer my apologies for any inconvenience caused during these very stressful times. We take all complaints very seriously. I will provide a further update in due course.”\nOffering an apology does not necessarily have to be an admission of fault. Equally empathising for the customer’s personal circumstances can set a good personal tone. However if the cost to your business is minimal and if proven a service has not been delivered, the customer would typically appreciate your transparency and honesty in admitting a mistake.\n“I am sorry to hear that you experienced issues with your order.” – indirect apologetic admission\n“I would like to apologise about your order arriving faulty or damaged.” – direct apologetic admission\nOffer reason for why things may have went wrong\nBe it a staffing, infrastructure or technical issue, offer a reason or reasons for why things may not have gone as smoothly as intended. This will help the customer understand and nicely accompany your written apology.\nThe customer does not need to know about the intricacies of your day-to-day business. Explaining in a few sentences that it was a miscommunication at operational level, low staffing due to Covid-19, logistics issue due to stock or being a peak time for service, planned maintenance or simple human error, should be sufficient.\nThe above does of course depend on the complexity and seriousness of the complaint. Sure, the above will work for missed deliveries and service outages, among other issues. A complainant would wish to have a more lengthy response to a complaint about serious matters such as personnel misconduct, health and safety, equality and diversity issues, and also products bought of significant financial value. This is due to increased stress, anxiety, mental health and potential cause of injuries. Your response will ultimately reflect to the customer the time investment of your investigation into their complaint.\nProvide point of contact\nProviding the full contact details of the point of contact for the customer, or the complaint handler, in all communications is a must. Include their full name, job title, postal address, head office address and telephone numbers.\nResolution, Action and Signposting\nThis is the bit you should aim to finish on. Make it clear about how you will use the information the customer provided you about their experience to improve. Think the typical ones: quality assurance, additional staff training, infrastructure and technology upgrades, or disciplinary action (often reworded as staff training or a ‘reminder about our company’s values’). This is your chance to turn a negative into a positive, so finish it off on a positive note.\nSignposting relevant charities and organisations that can help the customer may be appropriate. If required by law, industry or membership body, include details about the customer’s right of appeal and signposting independent complaint handling bodies, such as the IOPC for police officers’ conduct or the Financial Ombudsman Service for financial disputes.\nOffering the customer a small incentive to return as a customer of your business, such as a gift voucher or merchandise (e.g. key ring), can often go a long way to make the customer feel special. However this may only be appropriate for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors. Again, this very much depends on the seriousness, tone and nature of the customer’s complaint and if a satisfactory outcome has been reached.\nBefore pressing send or slipping the letter into an envelope make sure you proofread your letter. Triple check tone, spelling mistakes, avoid jargon and acronyms that may alienate the customer etc. Include the date the letter was produced and use your company email or letter template. A badly written formal letter or email with spelling mistakes and typos will set a bad first impression, as you may have never dealt with this customer before.\nBe sure to record the complaint with security, privacy, confidentiality and data protection in mind. Complaints should be handled in private, so complaints received over social media should be signposted to your complaints procedure policy. Although some complaints received over social media can usually be resolved informally without a formal process.\nThe format, style and contents of a complaint are transferable across both private and public sector, regardless of industry. Your conflict resolution skills in listening to the customer or taking the time to understand what happened, where and when, and why, can go a long way to improving your business outputs.","Commercial/Business Insurance Information\nMost small businesses need to purchase at least the following four types of insurance.\n1. Property Insurance\nProperty insurance compensates a business if the property used in the business is lost or damaged as the result of various types of common perils, such as fire or theft. Property insurance covers not just a building or structure but also what insurers refer to as personal property, meaning office furnishings, inventory, raw materials, machinery, computers and other items vital to a business’s operations. Depending on the type of policy, property insurance may include coverage for equipment breakdown, removal of debris after a fire or other destructive event, some types of water damage and other losses. It may also provide operating funds during a period when the business is trying to get back on track after a catastrophic loss.\n2. Liability Insurance\nAny enterprise can be sued. Customers may claim that the business caused them harm as the result of, for example, a defective product, an error in a service or disregard for another person’s property. Or a claimant may allege that the business created a hazardous environment. Liability insurance pays damages for which the business is found liable, up to the policy limits, as well as attorneys’ fees and other legal defense expenses. It also pays the medical bills of any people injured by, or on the premises of, the business.\n3. Business Auto Insurance\nA business auto policy provides coverage for autos owned by a business. The insurance pays any costs to third parties resulting from bodily injury or property damage for which the business is legally liable, up to the policy limits.\n4. Workers Compensation Insurance\nIn all states but Texas an employer must have workers compensation insurance when there are more than a certain number of employees, varying from three to five, depending on the state. Workers comp insurance, as this coverage is generally called, pays for medical care and replaces a portion of lost wages for an employee who is injured in the course of employment, regardless of who was at fault for the injury. When a worker dies as a result of injuries sustained while working, the insurance provides compensation to the employee’s family. An extremely small business, such as one operated by one or two people out of a home, may not need workers compensation insurance. But it often needs more property and liability insurance than is provided in a typical homeowners policy.\nOther Types of Business Coverages\n1. Errors and Omissions Insurance/Professional Liability\nSome businesses involve services such as giving advice, making recommendations, designing things, providing physical care or representing the needs of others, which can lead to being sued by customers, clients or patients claiming that the business’s failure to perform a job properly has injured them. Errors and omissions or professional liability insurance covers these situations. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy limit. It also provides legal defense costs, even when there has been no wrongdoing.\n2. Employment Practices Liability Insurance\nEmployment practices liability insurance covers (up to the policy limits) damages for which an employer is legally liable such as violating an employee’s civil or other legal rights. In addition to paying a judgment for which the insured is liable, it also provides legal defense costs, which can be substantial even when there has been no wrongdoing.\n3. Directors and Officers Liability Insurance\nDirectors and officers liability insurance protects directors and officers of corporations or not-for-profit organizations if there is a lawsuit claiming they managed the business or organization without proper regard for the rights of others. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy limit. It also provides for legal defense costs, even where there has been no wrongdoing.\n4. Key Employee Insurance\nLife or disability income insurance can compensate a business when certain key employees die or become disabled. These coverages cushion some of the adverse financial impact that results from losing a key employee’s participation.\n5. Umbrella Policies\nAs the name implies, an umbrella liability policy provides coverage over and above a business’s other liability coverage. It is designed to protect against unusually high losses. It provides protection when the policy limits of one of the underlying policies have been used up. For a typical business, the umbrella policy would provide protection beyond the general liability and auto liability policies. If a company has employment practices liability insurance, directors and officers liability, or other types of liability insurance, the umbrella could provide protection beyond those policy limits as well.\nIf you would like information about other types of business insurance, please call our agency.

{"question":"What similarities exist between attribute objects in AutoCAD and parametric automation in Rhino when it comes to modifying design elements?","answer":"Both systems allow for dynamic modification of design elements - AutoCAD through Attribute objects that serve as meta-data describing object characteristics, and Rhino through parametric automation where key values can be updated to automatically reflect changes in the model. In both cases, this enables designers to modify elements without having to recreate the entire model from scratch.","context":["In my previous article I discussed AutoCAD Block objects and other related objects related to the AutoCAD Block class.

Now, in this article, I mainly focus on the AutoCAD Attribute class.\nI am using the pyautocad module for this article, but I can also use communication modules such as pythoncom, and win32com.\nWhat is an AutoCAD Attribute object?\nThe AutoCAD Attribute object is basically a meta-data that describes the characteristics of an AutoCAD object. For example, it can describe the characteristics of AutoCAD Block objects.AttributeReference is the object class containing text that characterizes some AutoCAD block object.\nAs I have already explained in one of my previous articles covering AutoCAD Block objects the AutoCAD Block is an element of the BlockCollection class.

I recommend that you check out that blog post for comprehensive understanding of the AutoCAD Block class.\nfrom pickle import TRUE from pyautocad import Autocad, APoint, aDouble acad = Autocad(create_if_not_exists=True) ip = APoint(0, 0, 0) b1 = acad.doc.Blocks.Add(ip, \"Attributed_Block_1\") pl = b1.AddPolyline(aDouble(0, 0, 0, 10000, 0, 0, 10000, 5000, 0, 0, 5000, 0, 0, 0, 0)) l = b1.AddLine(APoint(0, 250, 0), APoint(10000, 250, 0)) l = b1.AddLine(APoint(5000, 250, 0), APoint(5000, 0, 0)) #0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .... 10 a1 = b1.AddAttribute(50, 0, \"DATE\", aDouble(200, 100, 0), \"DATE\", \"Date: 17/07/2022\") a2 = b1.AddAttribute(50, 0, \"DWG\", aDouble(5200, 100, 0), \"DWG\", \"Drawing Name: Drawing 1\") a2.MTextAttribute=True br = acad.model.InsertBlock(APoint(50, 50, 0), \"Attributed_Block_1\", 1, 1, 1, 0) print(\"Does the Block contain any Attributes: \", end=\"\") print(br.HasAttributes)\nNow, I can see that a reference to the AutoCAD Attributed Block has been created in my document.\nBelow I demonstrate the properties of the Attribute object and the AttributeRefrence object that I created.\n#General Properties print(\"Attribute alignment: \", end=\"\") print(a1.Alignment) print(\"Layer of attribute: \" + a1.Layer) print(\"Is the direction of text backward? \" + str(a1.Backward)) print(\"Is the attribute reference constant ? \" + str(a1.Constant)) print(\"Entity transparency value: \", end=\"\") print(a1.EntityTransparency) print(\"Field length of the attribute: \", end=\"\") print(a1.FieldLength) print(\"Text height: \", end=\"\") print(a1.Height) print(\"Attribute insertion point: \", end=\"\") print(a1.InsertionPoint) print(\"Is attribute reference invisible: \" + str(a1.Invisible)) print(\"Can the attribute or attribute reference be moved relative to geometry in the block ? \" + str(a1.LockPosition)) print(\"Object name: \" + a1.ObjectName) print(\"Oblique angle of the object: \", end=\"\") print(a1.ObliqueAngle) print(\"Is the attribute preset? \" + str(a1.Preset)) # apreset attribute sets the attribute to its default, or preset, value when the user inserts the block. print(\"Rotation of object: \", end=\"\") print(a1.Rotation) print(\"Scale factor for the object: \", end=\"\") print(a1.ScaleFactor) print(\"Style name of the attribute object: \" + a1.StyleName) print(\"Is the attribute set for verification: \" + str(a1.Verify)) O/p: Attribute alignment: 0 Layer of attribute: 0 Is the direction of text backward? False Is the attribute reference constant ? False Entity transparency value: ByLayer Field length of the attribute: 0 Text height: 50.0 Attribute insertion point: (200.0, 100.0, 0.0) Is attribute reference invisible: False Can the attribute or attribute reference be moved relative to geometry in the block ? False Object name: AcDbAttributeDefinition Oblique angle of the object: 0.0 Is the attribute preset? False Rotation of object: 0.0 Scale factor for the object: 1.0 Style name of the attribute object: Standard Is the attribute set for verification: False\nSimilarly, there are some other properties that define the attribute name, attribute content, and type of text. And so on. See the code and program output below.\n# multiline text / text properties if(a2.MTextAttribute==True): print(\"Attribute content: \" + a2.MTextAttributeContent) print(\"Boundary width of multiline text: \", end=\"\") print(a2.MTextBoundaryWidth) print(\"Multiline text direction: \", end=\"\") print(a2.MTextDrawingDirection) print(\"Prompt string of an attribute: \" + a1.PromptString) print(\"Tag string of the attribute: \" + a1.TagString) print(\"Text string of the attribute: \" + a1.TextString) print(\"Alignment point of the text: \", end=\"\") print(a1.TextAlignmentPoint) print(\"Attribute text generation flag: \", end=\"\") print(a1.TextGenerationFlag) O/p: Attribute content: Drawing Name: Drawing 1 Boundary width of multiline text: 0.0 Multiline text direction: 5 Prompt string of an attribute: DATE Tag string of the attribute: DATE Text string of the attribute: Date: 17/07/2022 Alignment point of the text: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Attribute text generation flag: 0\nAs I show in above code there is a property for multiline text that returns the value of text direction. It has five possible return values in the form of integers. Those options are as follows:\n- acBottomToTop: 1\n- acByStyle: 2\n- acLeftToRight: 3\n- acRightToLeft: 4\n- acTopToBottom: 5\nMethods of the AutoCAD Attribute class\nSome methods of the Attribute and AttributeReference class are similar to other methods of other AutoCAD object classes. I list some of the important methods below:\nI demonstrated the use of the AutoCAD Attribute, AttributeReference, and AttriburtedBlock classes. Obviously, the most important thing is implementing this information in our day-to-day life to automatize repetitive and costly tasks in an effort to increase productivity.

I have been a C++ programmer for a number of years, but Python is my first choice for quick development and concise code.\nRhino is a three dimensional CAD program which supports NURBS and surface unrolling. NURBS, Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines, are a standard mathematical model for describing curves. Surface unrolling is the ability to create a flat shape from a three dimensional surface.\nParametric automation is the ability to create an object based on key values. When the key values are updated, the object under automation reflects those changes.\nThus, \"Python Rhino Automation for Parametric Kite Design\" translates to creating a Python program which scripts a Rhino CAD model of a kite. This model can be updated by changing key features of a kite. There is no need to create the model from scratch by hand when an element of the kite design changes.\nMotivationA program such as foilmaker (stable link needed) or surfplan are the mainstream kite design programs. These are excellent in their domain, but like any program, are bound by the standard trade off of features vs. ease of use. If you have never designed a kite before, these programs are the place to start. They are effectively a system for parametric kite design where the set of parameters and the method for meeting them is determined by the program.\nWhen a kite designer is not satisfied with the available parameters or how the parameters are solved, two paths are left: using a CAD program or implementing a new kite design program to cater for their special needs. Examples:\n- Hangtime kite design software takes the \"new kite design program\" approach to achieve long panels with smooth lines for inflatable kites.\n- Tom White has programs which specialize in NPW single skin kites.\n- Olivier gives an excellent walkthrough of the complete customization of all parameters of kite design available when using a CAD program.\nThe \"new kite design program\" solution removes the limitations of the mainstream kite design program which bothered the author of the new program, but also introduce a new fixed set of parameters and solutions to those parameters. Using a CAD program gives ultimate flexibility, but if a design decision changes, the model must be rebuilt by hand to incorporate the new idea.\nThis article aims to achieve the best of both worlds: ultimate flexibility of a CAD program, combined with the ease of changing fundamental design parameters. Caveat et emptor: nothing is free! This requires some (relatively simple, depending on your ambition) programming. I don't take any credit here - I beleive it was Andy Wardley who pioneered parametric kite design using Perl. Check out his article to see the other area he pioneered.\nAutomating Rhino with PythonThere are three approaches or levels to automating Rhino:\n- Command Pasting: a simple set of Rhino commands are pasted into the command window.\n- Command Languate Automation: a program is created to generate the commands which are pasted into the command window.\n- COM Automation: Rhino is controlled at the component level.\nCommand PastingRhino has a command window which can be used tell Rhino what to do.\nCopy the following text and paste it into the command window, and some lines will show up in the Rhino viewport.\nline 3,4 22.5,3\nSee also the code used on the NPWC v8 page. This level of Parametric Design is appropriate if the parameters being varied are quite simple, like the control points for drawing the wing panel on the v8 page.\nCommand Language AutomationThis approach is a level of indirection from from Command Pasting where code is written to generate the commands, instead of editing the command code directly. To elaborate on this I will go through an example to create a kite skin based on the following parameters:\n- Tip width, how wide the tips of the kite should be.\n- Tip start angle in degrees. This controls the aspect ratio of the kite.\n- Number of notches to sew in fabric.\n- How deep to sew the notches. This controls the LE/TE ratio.\n- The total concavity of the trailing edge in degrees.\n- Trailing edge length.\n# python script to generate Rhino commands for SSTEA # 2007-4-1, v1.0, Bill Ola Rasmussen, based on NPWK code # 2007-4-6, v1.1, Bill Ola Rasmussen, vertical notch from math import sin, cos, pi, radians # parameters ------------------------------------------------------------------ tw = 3 # - tip width sa = 45 # - start angle (degrees) nc = 6 # - notch count nd = 60 # - notch depth % (controls LE/TE ratio) tc = 8 # - TE concavity (degrees) tl = 50 # - TE length # conversions ----------------------------------------------------------------- sa,ca,tc = radians(sa),radians(sa),radians(tc) # math operates with radians nd = nd*.01 # convert percentage tl = tl/float(nc+1) # convert TE length to TE segment length tc = tc/float(nc*2) # convert TE concavity to half notch concavity na = 2*ca/nc # notch angle without tc (same as TE notch deflection) # all notches are vertical, only calculate angles once cpa = na/2+tc-pi/2 # control point angle of notch lwa = (cpa-pi/2)/2 # left wall angle of notch\nThe second block sets up utility classes for calculations on lines, points, and splines. These classes represent their respective concepts, and allow themselves to be expressed as Rhino commands.\n# classes --------------------------------------------------------------------- class Point: '2D Point from x and y values.' def __init__(self, x, y): self.x,self.y = float(x),float(y) def __str__(self): # rhino script format return '_point '+self.pt() def pt(self): return '%f,%f'%(self.x,self.y) def to(self,a,m): 'Make new line from point: angle a, length m.' return Line(Point(self.x,self.y), Point(self.x+cos(a)*m, self.y+sin(a)*m)) def toP(self,p): 'Make new line to Point.' return Line(self,p) class Line: 'Line segment from two Points.' def __init__(self, p1, p2): self.p1,self.p2 = p1,p2 def __str__(self): # rhino script format return '_line %s %s'%(self.p1.pt(),self.p2.pt()) def mid(self): return Point((self.p1.x+self.p2.x)/2,(self.p1.y+self.p2.y)/2) def intersect(self, line): 'Intersection of two lines.

The code sets a starting location and draws lines for each trailing edge segment and splines for each notch. The key thing that happens here is that the center control point for the spline is defined so that each notch creates a concave juncture at the trailing edge (when the tc parameter is positive).\n# start of main code ---------------------------------------------------------- print '_selall\\n_delete' # clear previous drawing start = Point(0,0) te = start.to(ca,tl); print te # virtual trailing edge tip = start.toP(Point(0,tw)); print tip ete = tip.toP(te.p2); print ete # extended trailing edge for i in range(nc): # notch splines depth = (1-nd)*te.p2.y lsw = te.toY(lwa,depth) # left spline wall mnl = lsw.to(pi/2,1) # mid notch line cpl = te.to(cpa,1) # control point line ccp = mnl.intersect(cpl); print ccp # center control point print Spline(lsw.p1, ccp, lsw.p2) rsw = lsw.toY(-lwa,lsw.p1.y); # right spline wall print Spline(rsw.p1, ccp, rsw.p2) # TE ca -= na te = rsw.to(ca,tl); print te tip = te.to(pi/2,tw); print tip ete = tip.toP(te.p1); print ete # extended trailing edge print '_zoom extents' print 'done, angle error: %f, y error: %f'%(ca+sa,te.p2.y)\nWhen the above three blocks of code are joined together and run in the Python interpreter, the following output is produced:\n_selall _delete _line 0.000000,0.000000 5.050763,5.050763 _line 0.000000,0.000000 0.000000,3.000000 _line 0.000000,3.000000 5.050763,5.050763 _point 5.267103,3.543256 _curve 5.050763,5.050763 5.267103,3.543256 5.267103,2.020305 _enter _curve 5.267103,2.020305 5.267103,3.543256 5.483442,5.050763 _enter _line 5.483442,5.050763 11.669338,8.622191 _point 12.038653,6.048716 _curve 11.669338,8.622191 12.038653,6.048716 12.038653,3.448877 _enter _curve 12.038653,3.448877 12.038653,6.048716 12.407969,8.622191 _enter _line 12.407969,8.622191 19.307439,10.470899 _point 19.755940,7.345638 _curve 19.307439,10.470899 19.755940,7.345638 19.755940,4.188360 _enter _curve 19.755940,4.188360 19.755940,7.345638 20.204441,10.470899 _enter _line 20.204441,10.470899 27.347298,10.470899 _point 27.795799,7.345638 _curve 27.347298,10.470899 27.795799,7.345638 27.795799,4.188360 _enter _curve 27.795799,4.188360 27.795799,7.345638 28.244301,10.470899 _enter _line 28.244301,10.470899 35.143771,8.622191 _point 35.513086,6.048716 _curve 35.143771,8.622191 35.513086,6.048716 35.513086,3.448877 _enter _curve 35.513086,3.448877 35.513086,6.048716 35.882401,8.622191 _enter _line 35.882401,8.622191 42.068297,5.050763 _point 42.284637,3.543256 _curve 42.068297,5.050763 42.284637,3.543256 42.284637,2.020305 _enter _curve 42.284637,2.020305 42.284637,3.543256 42.500977,5.050763 _enter _line 42.500977,5.050763 47.551740,0.000000 _line 47.551740,0.000000 47.551740,3.000000 _line 47.551740,3.000000 42.500977,5.050763 _zoom extents\nCopying the above command language into the Rhino command window produces the lovely kite skin design below:\nThe key to this excercise is that we can create a totally new drawing - just change a parameter in the Python file, run the program again, then paste the output into Rhino to create another drawing. Various adjustments can be made, and we do not need to draw by hand from scratch when a requirement changes.\nThe purpose of this particular skunk works skin design will be kept secret for now. [Update: no longer a secret, see the FoilNose2 page.] However, some clues can be gleaned from my theory of sparless single skin kite design: the combination one necessary condition and one key value helps determine if the kite will fly. The necessary condition is that there are no unsupported (e.g. unbridled) convex sections on the (3D) outline of the kite. The one key value is the ratio between the length of the leading edge and trailing edge of the kite.\nThe code presented enforces the necessary condition via the tc parameter. Adding the ratio calculation and reporting is left as a excercise for the reader.\nCOM AutomationWhen even more control over Rhino is desired, COM automation can be employed to interface to Rhino. This opens up the possibility to manipulate objects after drawing them. I will leave this for an entirely new article, as this one has already grown large enough. Until then, you can click on the image to see a kite model created using Python via the Rhino COM interface.\nClosingUse an existing kite design program if it fits your needs. Programmed CAD automation can be used for design cases where existing programs are too limiting.\nVariations are possible. This article uses Python and Rhino, which means a Windows environment. My main computer now runs Ubuntu, so I would love to learn how to accomplish something similar with Blender."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4a51f912-2488-4bd2-8734-b547c8483265>","<urn:uuid:6bbc496d-8023-4fb0-a26a-ed1a54c37e74>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which mining method has safer working conditions: cave mining or underground coal mining?","answer":"Based on the available information, cave mining appears to have safer working conditions compared to underground coal mining. While cave mining has technical challenges, they are mainly related to ground conditions and design parameters rather than immediate safety threats. In contrast, underground coal mining is explicitly described as dangerous, with specific hazards including explosive gases like methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide that can build up in confined spaces. Coal mining has had numerous fatal accidents - in 2010 alone, 3,242 people died in coal mining accidents, and there was a major disaster in West Virginia that killed 29 people. Coal mines have continued to experience fires and explosions that have killed hundreds of miners over the years.","context":["Addressing the Challenges and Future of Cave Mining\nFirst Presented:Australian Centre for Geomechanics Newsletter\nIt is important in an industry such as cave mining to keep up-to-date knowledge, experience and best practice at the forefront to maintain the best possible level of safety for all involved. Unfortunately, much knowledge is proprietary to commercial research project sponsors. The Australian Centre for Geomechanics Caving 2018 Symposium, with Collaborating Organisation SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., will provide the global mining industry with the opportunity to explore the latest cave mining developments, technologies and practices.\nThere are over 50 global cave mining projects in various stages of studies and development. Despite the fact that the cave mining method is more than 100 years old, it is only within the past 20 years that this method has spread from initial cave mining centres to six continents. There are currently approximately 17 cave mining operations in 11 countries.\nThe interest in cave mining is being fuelled by the depletion of near surface orebodies suitable for open pit operations, relatively high production rates and low operating cost. Also, a number of open pits have a continuation of the orebody below their economic depth, and further exploitation of often large low-grade resources at depth would not support a more expensive mining method. In recent years, besides the economics of high strip ratio, the environmental concern also plays an important role when comparing open pit mass mining and caving. Cave mines can have a significantly smaller footprint than a comparable open pit, since waste mined is only limited to underground infrastructure development.\nCave Mining Principles and Economics\nTraditionally, cave mining was a method based on the principle of undercutting rock and then naturally letting it cave. However, this mining method has been extended to very strong rocks which would not easily cave or would not be suitable for caving due to very coarse fragmentation. To mitigate this problem, pre-conditioning techniques have been developed to generate more fractures and reduce the fragments to a manageable size. This is achieved by hydraulic fracturing and, in some cases, in combination with confined blasting. Although some discussion is needed about the potential impact on in situ stress that is required for cave mining, several cave mines are in operation with preconditioned rock masses and several others are being developed. The most extensive work undertaken is at Cadia East mine and Northparkes Mines in Australia, and Andina and El Teniente in Chile.\nCaving methods can be used with any type of commodity since it is the geological and geotechnical context that is important. There are many parameters to consider but typically the orebody needs to be at least 100 m thick for cave mining to be economical. In the past, typical caving heights were 150-250 m. Most of the designs which are on the drawing board today have caving lifts in excess of 350 m. Although higher lifts generally result in better NPV, they also have higher business risks of resource sterilisation, dilution, stability of the drawpoints, and extraction level in general.\nBy contrast, orebodies with relatively small horizontal footprints can also be mined economically if they have sufficient height and metal content to justify the capital expenditure. Good examples are Northparkes Mines in Australia, and the diamond mines in South Africa and Canada.\nMechanised cave mining includes several variations of the method, including block, panel, incline and front caving. Most of the current mines and projects utilise either block or panel caving but after several years, Ekati Diamond Mine, Canada successfully introduced an incline cave at their Koala Mine.\nCave mining differs significantly from other typically more selective underground mining methods in a number of areas. Because cave mining is a bottom up method that relies on first establishing a large fixed infrastructure underground that will provide a very long term production platform, the initial capital costs are typically very high.\nTo offset the impact of the large capital expenditure on project value, a consequent high rate of production and an increased tonnage per drawpoint is required. In this day and age, several cave operations are running at upwards of 50,000 tpd and newer operations are being constructed for nameplate capacities of 100,000 tpd and more.\nChuquicamata and New Mining Levels at the El Teniente project in Chile; Oyu Tolgoi projects, Mongolia; Grasberg caving complex, Indonesia; and the Resolution Copper project in Arizona all fall into the supercaves category. It has to be stressed that there are no examples where tonnage over 100,000 tpd was achieved on a sustained basis from single cave footprint, although El Teniente produced higher tonnage from concurrently mining several caves.\nIn terms of logistics, once a cave mine is in production, the execution is relatively straightforward. The production footprint remains fixed and mining consumables typically revolve around secondary breaking with campaign maintenance within the production drives. It is important that strict draw control is maintained and the extraction level is not experiencing excess damage requiring repairs.\nTechnical Challenges of Cave Mining\nAs the number of cave mining projects increases, there are also heightened expectations for high production rates and caving lifts, and greater depths to be achieved. The analysis of the cave mine performance is far from satisfactory. In the past two decades, at least 12 cave footprints were put into production and all experienced some level of unforeseen difficulty related to ground conditions, fragmentation, mining induced seismicity, mudrushes, and underestimating ground support, or simply breaking basic cave mining rules, specifically in the area of undercutting and draw management.\nOn a positive note, in hindsight, most of the challenges could have been prevented with better upfront knowledge, correct design or draw disciplines. The other disadvantage of cave mining is the long lead time, it typically takes 7 to 10 years, or longer, from initial studies to production and the site may underestimate the logistics and skillset required for cave mining development and operation.\nBecause the cave mine has to be fully developed before all design parameters are known to a high degree of confidence, the design should be robust and technical success should have priority over economics, especially when greenfield projects are considered. Although the cave mine may not require the same level of resource definition in terms of drillhole density as selective underground mining method, the geotechnical and structural geology knowledge has to be typically higher than for other methods. Some of the information needed for the final feasibility design may not be possible to obtain from the drill core, and underground characterisation exposures may be necessary.\nFuture of Cave Mining\nCave mining is moving to new frontiers with high production rates, strong rock masses, very high caving lifts and greater depth. In forefront of such projects is Resolution in Arizona where their shaft was sunk to 2,100 m to develop deep copper porphyry.\nBlock and panel caves are very suitable for highly automated equipment like remote control loaders, trucks and crushers. A future supercave could potentially have less than 50-60 people underground.\nCave Mining Toolbox\nThe ever-increasing speed of computing and the sophistication of numerical modelling codes enable many mining companies to model complex mining problems. Better and more reliable instrumentation such as MPX cables, Smart Marker System (Elexon), and Cave Tracker (Mining3) also provide excellent data for calibration of such models. However, do not count on the high reliability of numerical models without calibration. Reliable and accurate input information for numerical models are typically available only after the cave is designed, developed and operating. The track record of predictive models without comprehensive calibration, especially for greenfield projects, is not very good and does not necessarily increase confidence in the design in comparison to other empirical tools and benchmarking. Additionally, complex processes such as cave propagation, subsidence geometry, and material flow in a cave mine cannot be yet reliably modelled.\nVisit www.caving2018.com for more information.","Most of the world’s coal reserves are buried deep underground. Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth’s surface—sometimes as far as 300 meters (1,000 feet).\nHow far down do coal mines go?\nCoal that occurs at depths of 55 to 90 m (180 to 300 ft) are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of 60 m (200 ft) are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam 20–25 metres (60–90 feet).\nHow does underground coal mining work?\nUnderground mining involves opening one or more portals or shafts into the earth that follow or intercept coal seams that are too deep for surface mining methods. As the ‘room’ is mined, large ‘pillars’ of coal are left behind to support the weight of the overburden and rock layers above. …\nCan coal burn underground?\nAcross the globe hundreds of fires burn low and slow on dirty fuel beneath the earth, smoldering for decades or even centuries. These fires are known as coal seam fires. They occur underground when a layer of coal in the earth’s crust is ignited.\nWhat is the deepest coal mine in the United States?\nAs noted in my previous post, Black Diamond’s Mine #11 once held the distinction as being the deepest coal mine in America. At 6,200 feet, that’s a long way. To put it in perspective, 6,200 feet is over a mile – 1.17 miles to be precise.\nIs coal mining still dangerous?\nCoal mining is still dangerous. In 2010, West Virginia had the worst coal mining disaster in the US in 40 years, when an explosion killed 29 people. … That year, 3,242 people died in coal mining accidents. Coal mines have continued to have fires and explosions, killing hundreds of miners over the years.\nHow much does a coal miner make an hour?\nAn experienced Coal Mine Worker with 10-19 years of experience earns an average total compensation of $24.22 based on 14 salaries. In their late career (20 years and higher), employees earn an average total compensation of $19.\nHow dangerous is underground mining?\nMines are often home to many dangerous gases including carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide. Due to the confined spaces, these gases are not always able to escape, building up within the mine. … The most common gas to cause underground mine explosions is methane.\nWhy is coal mining bad?\nAlong with adding to greenhouse gas pollution, burning coal emits toxic and carcinogenic substances into our air, water and land, severely affecting the health of miners, workers and surrounding communities.\nWhat is the best way to mine coal?\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal. Depth, density, and thickness of the coal seam are the factors that are taken into account while selecting the mining method for coal extraction.\nWhy can’t the Centralia fire be put out?\nBecause of these firefighting problems, fires like Centralia aren’t extinguished unless they directly impact nearby communities or are near a gas line or are otherwise imminently dangerous, Stracher says.5 мая 2010 г.\nWhat is the longest burning fire in history?\nFueled by coal seams\nA coal seam-fueled eternal flame in Australia known as “Burning Mountain” is claimed to be the world’s longest burning fire, at 6,000 years old. A coal mine fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania, has been burning beneath the borough since 1962.\nWhy are coal fires so hard to put out?\n“Unlike timber, coal when it gets hot has massive thermal mass which is very hard to extinguish. … Coal fires are created by the interaction of carbon, oxygen and heat, which in turn produces carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and more heat to fuel the reaction.\nDoes the US still mine coal?\nCoal mining in the United States is an industry in transition. Production in 2017 was down 33% from the peak production of 1,162.7 million short tons (1,055 million metric tons) in 2006. Employment of 50,000 coal miners is down from a peak of 883,000 in 1923. … In 2015, the U.S. exported 7.0 percent of mined coal.\nWhich state has the most coal mines?\nWhere is the largest coal mine in the US?\n1. North Antelope Rochelle, US – 1.7 billion tonnes. The largest coal mine in the world by reserves is the North Antelope Rochelle coal mine in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, US. The mine was estimated to contain more than 1.7 billion tonnes of recoverable coal as of December 2018."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:53f8162e-8a20-4691-8030-5c9dadcc188f>","<urn:uuid:851ce887-f915-46f3-a568-dc7a55152b02>"],"error":null}

The cameras are positioned to capture Earth's surface and limb as seen from the ISS - one pointing in the station's movement direction, two pointing aft, and one pointing straight down at Earth. The system sequences through different camera views automatically, with brief gray and black color slates appearing between camera switches.","context":["Last month, at the top of the SSEP Homepage, we added a new section titled “Multimedia”, which includes currently 3 multimedia resources, each accessible by opening up a ‘toggle’. The new multimedia section is meant to provide SSEP students, teachers, and their communities a real world connection to the International Space Station, its crew, and the fact that this vehicle is right now traveling over the Earth at an altitude of 260 miles (47 times higher than Mt. Everest), at the fantastic speed of 4.5 miles per second (17,000 mph or 27,600 km/hr).\nWith this blog post we wanted to provide an overview of two of these multimedia resources, and how they can be used by teachers as powerful teachable moments, as well as provide a wonderful family activity at home.\n1. ISS Current Location\nWouldn’t it be cool to know what part of Earth the International Space Station is passing over right now? It would give you an understanding of what the astronauts are seeing when they look down from space at this very moment, or alternatively, where on Earth you’d need to be right now to see ISS fly overhead (assuming its night time there). In fact, it would be pretty cool to know if ISS is on the day-lit side of Earth or on the night side. Are astronauts looking down on an Earth illuminated by sunlight, or on a dark Earth punctuated with lights from human population centers? Well. the good folks at the European Space Agency, an International Partner on ISS, have made it so–\nThe ISS Current Location tracker below was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA’s Columbus laboratory is a component of the ISS. Visit the ESA website for more information on the tracker.\n2. HDEV Live View of Earth from ISS\nNow for the next cool multimedia resource, which allows you to see what the astronauts are seeing right now when they look out an Earth-facing window on ISS. In the portal below is high definition video of your world being telemetered to Earth LIVE from the International Space Station. To determine what portion of Earth is in view, use the ‘ISS Current Location’ above.\nWe invite you to use this live video feed to get into the spirit of exploration on the frontiers of space – expand the video window (in a classroom, use a LCD projector to display on a large screen), select and play an audio file below, and look down from 260 miles above Earth’s surface. (Suggestions for other audio tracks are welcome:)\nIf the image is black, ISS is on the night side of Earth. To check, use the ‘ISS Current Location’ above.

{"question":"How has the presence of fanatic Islamic groups affected the development of education in Egyptian faculties of education, and what changes occurred after 2014?","answer":"Prior to the 2014 revolution, members of fanatic Islamic groups held leadership positions in the faculty of education, which hindered educational development for decades. After 2014, new leadership emerged that is now attempting to modernize education by adopting the credit hour system, updating outdated curricula, and establishing partnerships with foreign universities.","context":["The purpose of this study was to explore the cultural orientation of the students in the faculties of education in Egypt towards the phenomenon of globalization as manifested in the visions of the professors and the students, and the curricula of these faculties. Thus, the study aimed to explore to what extent the cultural attitudes of the prospective teachers and the professors in the faculties of education in Egypt motivate/ hinder the globalization of teacher education.\nThe second section presented the theoretical perspective, which is the transformationalists view of globalization. This perspective represents a mid-way point between the Hyper- globalists and Pessimist globalists. Transformationalists believe that globalization does not necessarily lead to the supremacy of the culture of the western world, but rather it leads to the exchange and integration of cultures, and thus eastern civilization can also affect Western civilization. This section also discusses the different views of globalization and their impact on higher education, and the importance of globalizing the teacher education. Finally, this section discussed the initiatives of reforming the faculties of education in Egypt in the context of globalization, exploring the actual reforms in the governmental universities in response to these initiatives and the current challenges.\nThe method used consisted of I) Document analysis of the curricula of the faculties of education that discuss the topic of globalization. II) Individual interviews to explore the cultural attitudes of both students and professors of the faculties of education. Finally, the thematic approach was adopted to analyze the transcribed data.\nThe findings of the analysis of the documents indicated the incompatibility of what the students of the governmental faculties of education in Egypt taught about globalization and the new policies of the modern state that encourage the globalization of higher education. In spite of this, the findings of the fieldwork indicated the existence of a positive attitude towards globalization in the faculties of education in Egypt, and serious attempts by the current leadership of government colleges to change the regulations of faculties of education to adopt the credit hour system and to enable change of the current curricula that all the participants described as outdated. The current leaderships are also seeking to establish expanded partnerships with foreign universities to develop education in the college. The findings of the study also indicated that the presence of members of the fanatic Islamic groups in the leadership positions in the faculty of education before the revolution of 2014 had prevented the development of education in the college for decades.\nKeywords: globalization, internationalization, attitudes, higher education reform\nInternational & Comparative Education Department\nMA in International & Comparative Education\nIbrahim M.

{"question":"Can someone explain comprehensive steps for storing tractor during winter months and preparing it for spring use?","answer":"For winter storage of a tractor and spring preparation: First, for winter storage: 1) Disconnect the battery and remove it from the tractor 2) Store the battery in a warm place 3) If the tractor has a clutch, release it to prevent the disc from rusting to the flywheel. Then, before starting the tractor in spring: 1) Drain the old oil 2) Drain the old fuel to prevent accumulated dirt and water from damaging the engine 3) Consider changing the filters and fluids. These steps will help protect the tractor during hibernation and ensure proper functioning when resuming use.","context":["Bumper sticker recently spotted on a tractor: “If I’m not working, you’re not either.” For many a farm owner, the tractor is the trusty workhorse… the safe, sturdy, dependable piece of equipment without which many tasks—or even running the farm—would be impossible. Whether you have a new tractor or ride around on an old or “previously appreciated” model, regular maintenance is the key to protecting your investment.\nStable Management spoke with some experts to get their advice on keeping your tractor in tip-top shape and rarin’ to go. (The recommendations in this article apply to diesel tractors, which comprise the bulk of tractors available today. Also, this article offers general guidelines that might not apply to your tractor. Consult your owner’s manual or tractor dealership for maintenance information that is specific for your manufacturer and year of tractor.)\nGood tractor maintenance begins with your eyes. First, read and consult the owner’s manual for regular service and maintenance information specific to the model that you own. If you don’t have a maintenance manual, check online for information. People who have very old tractors (as in classic or vintage) can visit useful websites such as Yesterday’s Tractor Co. (www.ytmag.com), which is full of useful information and also offers discussion forums, a parts marketplace, and an interesting department called “stuck and troubled.”\nOther Internet resources that offer information and support include www.tractorlinks.com (for antique and/or classic tractor enthusiasts), www.tractorhome.com, www.mytractorforum.com, and www.justanswer.com (this site does ask a fee for the answers it provides).\nNext, use your eyes for an overall inspection. Replace missing or worn clamps, bolts, nuts, or screws, and tighten any loose connections. The team at Massey Ferguson warns, “Loose fasteners can damage thread parts, linkages, and bushings, can loosen tolerances on tight-fitting mechanisms, and can waste your time on repairs that could be prevented.”\nMake sure the loader or other attachments are connected properly, and that all pins and bolts are in place. Tighten fuel tank mountings if necessary. Inspect hoses for leaks and loose connections, and belts for signs of wear or rot. Also, be sure to check fluid levels in the battery, transmission, radiator, and hydraulic system. Be alert to possible signs of abnormal wear, both on the tractor chassis and the tires. The checklist on page 25 provides a summary of items to review regularly.\nOil and Fluids\nTemple Rhodes of Temple Rhodes Excavating manages 3,000 acres of farmland in rural Maryland. When asked what he considers to be the most important steps to keeping his equipment in great shape, he doesn’t hesitate. “Check the oil, transmission fluid, and water regularly,” he advises. The frequency of your checks will vary, depending on hours of use. “During the summer, when we typically run our equipment 10 to 15 hours a day, we check fluids and oil daily. If we were using the tractor for one or two hours a day, we would only need to check once a week. In the winter, we check every 20 hours,” Temple explains. Colin Campbell of Campbell’s Services in Bridgewater, Connecticut, recommends checking the oil level daily before climbing into the driver’s seat. You should also check front axle fluid every eight hours.\nHow often should you change your oil? “We recommend changing the engine oil after the first 50 hours that you use the tractor, and every 100 hours after that,” Colin says. Temple Rhodes likes to use 15W40 oil in his tractors, but prefers synthetic oil for vehicles like farm trucks because it lasts longer. “Whatever you do, make sure you add the new oil before you use the tractor again,” warns Colin Campbell. “Running without oil is catastrophic and expensive.”\nIf your oil is dirty or if you have just purchased a used tractor, have the oil analyzed to rule out the presence of impurities. Exxon offers this service directly to large commercial operations like Temple’s. Small farm owners can take the sample to their nearest tractor dealership. John Deere and Case are two dealerships that offer this service.\nYou’ll replace the oil filter whenever you change the oil—generally, after the first 50 hours you use your tractor, then every 100 hours. Air filters need to be changed whenever they get clogged. Colin Campbell offers this tip: “Look through your air filter from the inside, and hold up a light to the outside. If you see a good amount of light, your air filter is okay. If the light is dim or you can’t see it at all, replace the filter immediately.” In his years of experience as a dealer and mechanic, he’s seen some filters get clogged up in as little as nine hours, and others that go 250 hours before needing a change. “It all depends on usage. As a rule of thumb, plan on checking the air filter every eight hours; more often if you’re working in very dirty conditions,” he offers.\nTo help keep track of changes, Temple Rhodes writes the hours down directly on both the oil and air filters. “That way, the information is right in front of me, and I’m more likely to keep up with oil and filter replacements,” he says.\nYou’ll want to check all electrical connections to the battery to ensure that they are still wired tightly. “The biggest problem is buildup of corrosion on the battery cables, which can cause your battery to go dead,” Colin Campbell explains. “So, keep your batteries clean—especially where the battery post meets the inside of the terminal—and make sure the connection is tight. If you can twist the cable, it is too loose.” Check the fluid level in each cell. Test the battery with a voltage meter—a reading below nine volts means you need to add a new battery to your shopping list.\nWheels and Tires\nRegularly inspect the wheel bearings for signs of wear and tear. Tighten wheel lugs according to your owner’s manual. The mechanics at Massey Ferguson recommend tightening the lugs after the first 10 hours of use on a new tractor, then every 50 hours after that.\nThe choice of tractor tire—radial or bias ply—often depends on the rim and the operating conditions of the vehicle. “Radial tires have more grip than bias ply tires, but both types wear similarly,” says Temple Rhodes. Goodyear notes that bias ply tires have traditionally been used for both on and off-road applications. Radial tires are preferred in situations where heat buildup with bias ply tires is anticipated, as in traveling on hard roads.\nRegardless of the type of tire your tractor sports, proper maintenance prolongs the life of your tires and also helps you use fuel more efficiently. Inspect the tires every 25 to 50 hours, checking for nails, thorns, and signs of dry rot and cracking. Maintain the tire pressure at proper levels; generally, around 12 lbs. for radial and 18 lbs. for bias ply tires. However, recommended inflation will vary according to the type of work being done, the work surface, and the load of any attachments. The Tire and Rim Association of America (TRA), the standardizing body for the tire, rim, valve, and allied parts industry in the United States, publishes recommendations for setting air inflation based on the load. This information is available in the TRA Year Book or online at www.us-tra.org. Tire manufacturers and tractor dealerships also have this information.\nIf your tractor is equipped with hydraulics, check the pressure regularly. Colin Campbell explains, “The biggest thing is to keep moisture out. Also, the oil loses its ability to perform over several hours of use.” He recommends changing the hydraulic fluid and oil after the first 50 hours of use. Once past that milestone, change the filter every 200 hours, and the oil every 400 hours. Changing the hydraulic fluid can involve dealing with 15 gallons of fluid, so you might consider having the nearest tractor dealership perform the maintenance.\nBelts and Seals\nRegularly examine belts for signs of cracking, rot, and damage. Inspect the seals as well, checking for fluid leaks that indicate wearing or damage. “I advise customers to replace belts and seals as needed only,” says Colin Campbell.\nYou probably can see the grease zerks on your tractor, but Massey Ferguson also recommends consulting your owner’s manual to avoid missing hidden zerks. Grease zerks contain a spring-loaded ball that compresses when pressure is applied with a grease gun, allowing grease to flow through the fitting into the application. After pressure from the gun is released, the spring-loaded ball returns to the head of the zerk, preventing grease from escaping and dirt from entering.\nPeriodically apply lubricating oil to the nuts, bolts, and joints of your tractor. This helps prevent rusting and seizing up.\nStoring Your Tractor\nIf you winter in Florida and plan to leave the tractor behind in the cold, it’s wise prepare the tractor for its hibernation. Colin Campbell recommends disconnecting the battery, removing it from the tractor, and keeping it in a warm place. If your tractor has a clutch, release it to keep the disc from rusting to the flywheel.\nBefore starting the tractor in spring, drain the oil and the old fuel to prevent accumulated dirt and water from damaging the engine. You might also consider changing the filters and fluids.\nKeep It Clean\nA clean tractor is a healthy tractor. Dirt, grass clippings, and debris can all damage your tractor and contribute to rust, as well as wear and tear.\nMild soap and water, applied to the body and underside, can clear away mud, grime, acids, and chemicals. Clear the radiator screens of accumulated dirt and grass. To remove greasy buildup on the engine and body, use your favorite brand of automotive degreaser. However, don’t overdo it. “Washing is a double-edged sword. It helps protect the condition of the chassis and keeps dirt out of the pivots, but it can cause the electrical system to corrode and short out.” Campbell encourages owners to keep a good balance of occasional cleaning, with plenty of time between washings to let the tractor dry out.\nA Note About Climate\nTractor stressors and maintenance needs can vary with extremes of climate. In areas with salt air and humidity, such as Florida, for instance:\n• Battery terminals require regular cleaning, and the tops of the batteries need to be washed with a baking soda solution to neutralize accumulated salt.\n• Motor oil is changed more frequently than usual.\n• An additive is added to fuel tanks to prevent the growth of algae.\n• Air filters need to be changed often.\n• The radiator needs to be pressure-washed every three months because the salt air creates electrolysis between the copper tubes and aluminum fins. If this is not done, the radiator will spring leaks.\nIn very cold climates, such as the Midwest:\n• Heavy duty batteries—900CCA (cold cranking amps) or more—are recommended.\n• Synthetic oil is preferred, because the tractor will usually start more easily.\n• Block heaters (especially percolator types) are recommended.\n• A fuel additive is essential.\nYour dealership can provide maintenance tips specific to your area.\nThe biggest mistake you can make with respect to tractor maintenance is not doing it. Always consult your tractor dealer and/or the owner’s manual for suggested maintenance schedules, and be sure to operate the tractor within its recommended capacity. With proper care, maintenance, and usage, your tractor should provide you with years of dependable service."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:97a2f856-ee0c-4af5-a62c-65342bee0cb5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the storage capabilities of modern Army depots, and how have their roles evolved from World War II to present day humanitarian missions?","answer":"Army depots have evolved significantly in their storage capabilities and roles since World War II. The Hawthorne Army Depot, which began as a Naval Ammunition Depot in 1930, became a crucial staging area for ammunition, bombs, and rockets during World War II, chosen for its remote location after a devastating explosion in New Jersey in the 1920s. In modern times, army depots have developed sophisticated storage capabilities, as exemplified by the Leghorn Army Depot in Italy, which features 582,000 square feet of humidity-controlled storage and 67 ammunition magazines. The role of these facilities has expanded beyond military purposes, with Leghorn being uniquely positioned to support humanitarian missions, serving as USAID's only military warehousing partner and supporting disaster relief operations worldwide.","context":["7 Killed in explosion at Nevada Marine training exercisePosted: Updated:\nRENO, Nev. (AP) -- Seven Marines from a North Carolina unit were killed and several injured in a training accident at a military depot in western Nevada that serves as a storage site for munitions and an important training facility for special forces headed overseas.\nThe cause of the accident at the Hawthorne Army Depot shortly before 10 p.m. PST Monday is under investigation, officials said in a statement from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp LeJeune, N.C.\nIt was not immediately clear how the Marines were killed. Officials earlier characterized it as an explosion, without giving specifics about what happened.\nThe injured were taken to area hospitals for treatment and further evaluation.\nRenown Regional Medical Center in Reno, the area's major trauma hospital, took nine patients, including one who died, three who are in serious condition and five who are in fair condition, according to spokeswoman Stacy Kendall. All the patients are men under the age of 30, she said. Kendall described their injuries as penetrating trauma, fractures and vascular injuries. The identities of those killed were not released pending notification of their families and a 24-hour waiting period after that.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many were airlifted and how many were transported by ground, and Kendall didn't know if any patients were sent to other hospitals. A nursing supervisor at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center said her hospital hadn't taken patients from the incident\n\"We send our prayers and condolences to the families of Marines involved in this tragic incident. We remain focused on ensuring that they are supported through this difficult time,\" said the force's commander, Maj. Gen. Raymond C. Fox. \"We mourn their loss, and it is with heavy hearts we remember their courage and sacrifice.\"\nThe Hawthorne Army Depot stores and disposes of ammunition. The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles.\nHawthorne has held an important place in American military history since World War II when it became the staging area for ammunition, bombs and rockets for the war. The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection says that the depot employed more than 5,500 people at its peak. Nevada was chosen for the location because of its remoteness in the wake of a devastating explosion at the government's main depot in New Jersey in the 1920s.\nIt opened in September 1930 as the Naval Ammunition Depot Hawthorne and was redesignated Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant in 1977 when it moved under the control of the Army, according to its website. In 1994, the site ended its production mission and became Hawthorne Army Depot. The site currently serves several purposes for the military, including storing ammunition and explosives and providing what the military calls an ideal training facility for special forces preparing for deployments to similar desert terrain in places like Afghanistan.\nNevada's political leaders expressed their sympathy.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., gave his condolences to victims of the explosion during a Tuesday morning speech on the Senate floor.\nNevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller tweeted:\n\"I am deeply saddened to hear of the incident at the Hawthorne Army Depot this morning,\" Republican Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said in a statement. \"The men and women who work and train there put service ahead of self each and every day. Kathleen and I wish to extend our deepest sympathies to those killed and their families. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured and we pray for their speedy recovery.\"\nJelinek reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Michelle Rindels contributed to this report from Las Vegas.","The small Army depot is located off a scenic tree-lined Italian highway, seemingly innocuous and quiet. But just behind the front gate stands a battalion with tremendous capability and worldwide reach. The 3rd Battalion, 405th Army Field Support Brigade (AFSB) at Leghorn Army Depot launches international support to Soldiers and other organizations from this small but capable installation.\nOne of the unit’s current high-profile missions includes reset and handling of left-behind equipment (LBE) for deploying and redeploying units throughout the European theater of operations. The battalion is currently conducting reset and LBE operations on more than 1,100 pieces of military equipment for the 172nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT), the 170th HBCT, and the 173rd Airborne Combat Team.[raw][image align=”left” caption=”The battalion maintained equipment for the 173rd HBCT through its LBE program while the unit was deployed.

These state-of-the-art facilities, combined with a talented and dedicated workforce, ensure that Soldiers receive equipment in far better condition than when they sent it to us.”\nIn addition to expansive maintenance and repair facilities, the battalion oversees an extensive warehousing operation. The battalion operates 15 warehouses, encompassing more than 582,000 square feet of humidity-controlled storage capability, larger than an American football field. Controlled humidity provides an optimal storage environment and cuts in half the maintenance requirements for stored equipment, thereby conserving manpower and repair parts.\nIn the area of ammunition operations, the battalion maintains 50 earth-covered and 17 above-ground ammunition storage magazines within the Pisa Ammunition Storage Area (ASA), next to the depot. The underused ASA can store several thousand short tons of ammunition for strategic or operational missions, with direct access to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe battalion’s substantial storage capability, combined with logistics experience, led to interagency agreements with nonmilitary organizations including the U.S. State Department and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DSCA rely on the battalion for the storage, maintenance, and distribution of humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and crisis supplies and equipment. Whenever disaster or crisis strikes, USAID may call upon the battalion to help transport supplies to a disaster zone or to support a combatant commander.\nThe 3rd Battalion’s support to this humanitarian mission sets it apart from other Army organizations.[quote align=”right”]I truly believe that the unique combination of logistics and transportation capabilities, state-of-the-art facilities, and an experienced and talented workforce give the battalion tremendous strategic importance.[/quote]\n“In the past, we largely utilized military installations for our warehousing operations,” said Robert Demeranville, Senior Logistician for USAID. “However, that is no longer the case. All of our warehousing operations have been moved to commercial locations, with the exception of the materials at the battalion in Italy. They are the only military unit that handles this sort of work for us now.”\nPierce considers the USAID mission a source of pride for the battalion, noting that it has supported USAID missions in more than 45 countries over the past 10 years, including recent aid missions in Haiti and Pakistan.\n“We consider ourselves a partner to USAID in their humanitarian relief efforts,” Pierce said. “We take great pride in being able to deliver the materials they need in a timely and efficient manner, doing our part to alleviate people’s suffering as quickly as possible.”\nThe battalion’s mission is further enhanced by its location.\n“Our location in Italy gives us a unique logistics capability,” said Alberto Chidini, Host Nation Executive Advisor to the Commander and Battalion Project Manager for the USAID mission. “Because we have access to so many modes of transportation, we can execute loading and transportation missions quickly and efficiently, ensuring that the aid reaches the disaster area as quickly as possible.”\n“I truly believe that the unique combination of logistics and transportation capabilities, state-of-the-art facilities, and an experienced and talented workforce give the battalion tremendous strategic importance,” said COL Ronald Green, Commander of the 405th AFSB, which is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany. “I remain impressed by both the quality of their service to the Soldier and the breadth and scope of their mission.”\n- JENNIFER L.

{"question":"How does the approach to filtering frequencies differ between stereo widening in production versus live sound mixing?","answer":"In stereo widening production, filtering is primarily used within delay processors to impact the perception of the stereo field, with specific attention to how different frequency treatments affect the width. In live sound mixing, the High Pass Filter is considered one of the most useful tools, specifically designed to preserve high frequencies while removing unnecessary low frequencies. The live approach is more focused on practical sound management, where filtering helps prevent feedback and clean up the mix, while studio stereo widening uses filtering more creatively for spatial effects. Additionally, in live situations, output EQ must be set correctly first to make input channel EQ more effective, while studio widening typically focuses on processing individual elements.","context":["Using a Delay to Manipulate Stereo Width\nUsing a delay effect to create and manipulate stereo width. Make your mixes wider!\nUsing Delay to Manipulate Stereo Width is a detailed video tutorial explaining how to use a delay effect to manipulate the stereo width of audio.\nStereo wideners are all the rage nowadays. It seems that producers love to widen their mixes so as to afford a hyped stereo image. The idea is to give the listener an immersive experience with sounds that seem to move in 3D rather than 2D. However, one of the problems associated with too much widening is that of stereo field collapse. There comes a point whereby too much widening will result in a skewed stereo image where the middle information is lost and the sides collapse.\nMost stereo widening trickery incorporates the Haas Effect and the process we are going to explore is that of using a stereo delay to create width on a drum beat.\nThe Haas effect, also known as the precedence effect, is a psychoacoustical effect described in 1949 by Helmut Haas that pertain to the localisation of sound sources. In a nutshell: when one sound is followed by another with a delay time of approximately 40 ms or less the two sounds are perceived as a single sound.\nThe most common Haas effect technique is to create a copy of the audio you want to widen, pan each copy to the stereo field extremes (L and R) and apply a small delay to one side. This comes across as a single large stereo field of sound.\nThe problems associated with stereo wideners when used on stereo sources are that when summed to mono the stereo widening effect is lost and the sound comes across as just an echo albeit with a ton of phasing artifacts. That is not to say that stereo wideners cannot be used on sound sources or entire mixes – it is simply a case of managing mono sources within a mix context and excessive use of wideners can actually play against you.\nA better approach is to use stereo wideners that use Mid/Side processing.\nMiddle and Side\nBasically, the stereo sound is split into middle (M) and sides (S) using a process we call ‘Matrixing’. Once the signal is in M/S we can treat the sides (known as the difference) and the mid (known as the sum) separately. After the processing, the signal is encoded back into the standard stereo format. This process may sound complicated but when you see it in action you will realise how simple it is to use and yet so powerful in action.\nMost stereo wideners use Mid/Side processing to allow the user to work on either component in isolation. By inverting the phase of each channel and adding a small amount of this phase-inverted signal to the opposite channel, you can add spaciousness to any stereo sound. Some stereo widening plugins incorporate this exact process and the results can be both pleasing and solid in control.\nThere are many ways to apply widening processes to a sound: from using stereo effects to phase trickery, from panning mono sources to phase inverting one channel and feeding it into the other channel and so on. In fact, most of today’s processing plugins come with some form of stereo widening but in this tutorial, we are going to use the Old School technique of using a stereo delay to create stereo width.\nIn the Using Delay to Manipulate Stereo Width video, I show you how to use a stereo delay plugin to manipulate the stereo width of a drum beat. I explain all the functions of the stereo delay and how to use it to manipulate the stereo width of the drum beat. I run through all the parameter settings making sure to provide you with the best settings to use in your mix projects. I end the tutorial by showing you how the filters in the delay processor can have a huge impact on the perception of the stereo field.\nThe plugin used in this video:\nTopics covered in this video are:\n- What is Stereo Width\n- Using Dual Mono for Width\n- What is a Delay effect\n- How to use a Delay\n- Modulation and the Matrix\n- Timeless Delay effect configuration and tricks\n- Nodes and Filtering\nIf this tutorial was of help maybe these will also be of benefit:\nDelay Effect – what is it and how does it work\nUsing a Flanger to create Stereo Effects\nDelay Effect – Cross Feedback and Style\nUsing a Delay to create a Crackle Effect\nUsing a Delay to create Chorus\nStudio and Multi Effects Masterclass","How To Mix Live Music\nYou will learn how to use each feature of these mixing consoles, and how to apply them practically to your regular music mixing jobs. We have lots of tips, tricks, advice and experience to share with you. When you know what you’re doing, mixing live music becomes a whole lot more enjoyable and creative.\nIn this video, we will talk about how to choose the right mixing console for your work, and what tools and accessories you should always take to work!\nIn this 3rd part of the training series “How To Mix Live Music”, we are going to get the mixing console connected to all the other sound equipment: microphones, amplifiers and loud speakers. You should aim to do all your connecting before switching on the power!\nBut before we begin connecting, let’s do some planning!\nBefore we start using the mixing desk, we are going to talk about microphones: how to choose the most suitable types, and where to put them for the most common types of instrument!\nLast time we chose our microphones, and placed them near the instruments on stage. Now we’re going to bring the sounds from the stage into our mixer, and make the optimal settings for each input.\nThis time we have a very important topic, which I have witnessed even some seasoned professionals get wrong from time to time. It is “Gain Structure”. It is crucial to understand if you want to get a clean and consistent mix every time!\nIn Chapter 7, we will see how a small button can be a big help: it's the “High Pass Filter”. So our first question: what is a “High Pass Filter”? High Pass Filter is one of the most useful tools on a live mixing console, as it leaves all the high frequencies alone, while filtering out the un-necessary low frequencies.\nThis video will give you an introduction to the types of EQ available on most popular analog and digital live mixers, and it will help you understand how to operate all the controls safely.\nThis time we will be EQing our outputs, that is the speakers for the audience and for the performers on stage. If you get this right first, it is going to be easier to EQ all the input channels. Taking time to work on the outputs first will save time when working on the inputs later.\nIn this chapter, we will focus on drums as in kick, snare, hat, toms and overheads, probably the loudest instruments in the band, and the ones with the most focused range of frequencies. Each mic used will require different treatments.\nWe've already got the drums sounding good, now we are going to move on to the electric bass, guitars and keyboards, the key instruments for most rock and pop bands.\nNow we are going to start applying EQ to acoustic instruments such as guitar, violin and brass. Some of these instruments are quite sensitive and care needs to be taken to avoid feedback. Even electro acoustic guitars that is hollow-bodied guitars with built-in electronics to capture the sound. They can feed back if placed close to a stage monitor speaker.\nThis time we are going to be EQing vocal mics. The human voice is so versatile and varied amongst male and female that you might think each style will need different treatment, but actually there are just a few basic principles to be applied, and remember, for a live performance, most singers should be using a dynamic cardioid microphone.\nWe've got setup, we've tuned the PA to suit the room, and EQed all the inputs. Now we are going to jump down a mixer to the pan and the faders. The pan position will normally stay static during a performance, but the fader is the most frequently adjusted control on a mixer, hence it being the most tactile.\nWe've set input gains, high pass filters, EQs and pan. Now it's time to focus on the faders. How to balance the sound of a band and keep listening and tweaking as the performance progresses.\nThis time, we are looking at how to use the aux buses to create monitor mixes for the band on stage. Auxes are a versatile set of output buses found on most mixing consoles. They can either be mono or stereo, pre-fader or post-fader, and they all have a variable level control for each input channel.\nHave you ever wondered what the matrix on a mixing console is used for? In this chapter, we are going to find out, and we will talk about using the mono or sub buses, too.\nIn this chapter, we are looking at compressors, how and when to use them. The effect of a compressor might be subtle, but it's a very important and useful processor in pop and rock music. Once you've mastered how to use it correctly, your mix can be greatly improved.\nNoise gate is the topic for this chapter, what are they? And when are they useful? Like compressors, these were never found on a mixing console until digital mixers started to become popular in the mid 1990s.\nWe've almost completed out mix applying EQ, compression and noise gates to their inputs, and using pan, faders and groups to adjust the blend of all the instruments and voices. Now, we are going to apply some compression to the outputs.\nIn this chapter, we are going to add some reverb into the mix. This is particularly useful on vocals and solo acoustic instruments to give them a bit of a lift above the core band mix, but its use depends a lot on the acoustics of the performance venue itself.\nIn this chapter, we are going to experiment with tap delay. This effect can be used in a couple of different ways. The first way is to use it continuously with quite a short delay time to increase the presence or size of a sound. The other way is to emphasize individual notes, phrases or words either for lead vocals or solo instruments.\nNow we've covered the theory of gain structure, EQ, dynamics, groups and effects, let's put it into practice. We have a live band coming in and we are going to do a soundcheck. Let's be reminded of everything we've talked about so far this series.\nThis is the last chapter, and we are going to do some live recording. This can be useful for both the sound engineer and the musicians to listen back and evaluate the performance. It can be a useful rehearsal tool, or upload it to social media, or just keep it as a nice souvenir."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:02001ef7-94fb-4121-af37-80933c981187>","<urn:uuid:9992e297-83a2-4424-b346-7058e7bdf086>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the color detection mechanisms in human eyes relate to RGB and CMYK color systems? Compare the biological and technical aspects.","answer":"The human eye's color detection system is directly related to RGB color processing, while CMYK is a separate technical solution. The eye contains about 7 million cones that can only sense three specific frequencies of light: red, green, and blue, which are the same primary colors used in the RGB color system for screens and monitors. These three 'primary' colors are processed by our brain to create color perception. Meanwhile, CMYK is a four-color process (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) specifically designed for printing and operates differently from our biological vision system, using subtractive color processes to produce various hues by absorbing and reflecting light off colored surfaces.","context":["Using the correct color mode in your design is essential to getting your message across. Learn the distinctions between RGB and CMYK color profiles with this simple overview.\nCover image via Rostislav_Sedlacek.\nThere can be a lot of confusion behind RGB and CMYK color modes. If you’re a designer, it’s crucial to differentiate the color profiles since designing in the wrong mode can affect the tone and message of your document. In this article, we’ll decipher the characteristics of each profile and when to use RGB and CMYK in your designs.\nThe RGB color profile consists of Red, Green, and Blue hues that combine to create extensive variations of colors. This color mode exists exclusively in screen displays, such as in computer monitors, mobile, and television screens. Even though RGB is present across all electronic devices, the color elements vary across systems and models. An image you see on an iMac may display differently than the same image on a Dell desktop computer.\nInstead of utilizing ink to produce hues, the RGB profile partakes in additive processes to produce color by blending light. This is the exact opposite of subtractive color processes, such as mixing paints or dyes. The presence of all RGB primaries at full intensity yields white, while the absence of color produces black. When you turn a monitor or screen off, you see an absence of RGB color, resulting in black. The color displays on your screen result from the presence of those RGB base hues.\nIn Adobe Illustrator, you can see how mixing RGB primaries at different intensities can vary the color output. When isolated, the primary hues generate vibrant shades. Red and green combine to yield yellow, green and blue mix to create cyan, and blue and red produce magenta.\nRGB produces a large array of colors; this color profile features a larger gamut, or color range, than CMYK. Above, you can see how Illustrator provides a gamut warning for RGB colors that can’t be successfully translated into CMYK. This occurs when an RGB color exists outside of CMYK printing abilities. Instead, the color will convert to a CMYK equivalent, which could affect the tones of your design. When printing a design produced in RGB color profiles, the print output will be different from the online preview.\nWhen to Use RGB Color Mode\nTo avoid color profile complications, always set a document in RGB when designing for social media, digital design, or online advertisements. Set any design or image that will exist on a screen or monitor as RGB. If you design in CMYK for an online-only design, you’ll limit your color options due to CMYK’s limited gamut range.\nThe CMYK color profile contains Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black) that combine to produce a range of hues. This four-color process works for any type of printer. When zoomed in on printed images you can see the four-color dots that layer to create different hues and gradations. Dots per inch result from printing and involve the CMYK color profiles. Although all printers produce prints in CMYK, the end result may vary among different styles and models of printers.\nIn RGB color spaces, all primaries combine to produce white with additive color processing. CMYK modes combine with subtractive color processes, meaning all primaries mask to yield to a blackish hue. This process is similar to when you mixed paints and dyes as a kid to make that unsightly dark color. As inks and dyes are layered upon each other, they subtract from the white of the paper.\nNotice how the CMYK sliders differ from the RGB sliders. Zero intensity of all primaries produces black in RGB color profiles; in CMYK color profiles, the absence of color produces white. Cyan and magenta create a blue, magenta and yellow create red, and yellow and cyan produce green. The combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow develop an off-black shade. Key, or black, comes in to add shades to each primary due to the primaries’ inability to combine and create black.\nWhen to Use CMYK Color Mode\nReserve CMYK for printed designs. Set products such as business cards, flyers, posters, and packaging in the CMYK color profile, and do yourself and the print shop a favor by always setting your document to CMYK before exporting or printing. Doing so prevents unbalanced colors that can result from RGB colors translated into CMYK equivalents.\nChanging Color Modes in Creative Cloud\nMost Adobe Creative Cloud programs will default to RGB color modes. You can easily adjust modes in the New Document panel under the Color Mode dropdown, or within the program itself. Not all programs support RGB to CMYK conversions, but with Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, you can switch in just one click.\nIn Adobe Illustrator, you can switch colors modes by navigating to File > Document Color Mode > RGB Color or CMYK Color. This will affect the output of your vector shapes when shifting between color modes.\nWithin Photoshop, you can change color profiles by going to Image > Mode > CMYK or RGB Color.\nNavigate to the Color Panel within the software. If the panel isn’t visible, hit F6 to bring it up. Hit the dropdown symbol and select CMYK or RGB.\nLooking to expand your knowledge on essential design terminology? Check out these educational posts:","Color has three distinct properties:\nHue – spectral color name\nValue – lightness or darkness\nSaturation – brightness or dullness\nAlthough you see color in our brain, it is the eye that has the receptors that tell your brain what you are looking at. There are two sets of receptors in the retina in the back of the eye: rods and cones.\nThere are about 125 million rods (named for their shape). They are very sensitive to light but are mostly color blind. We use them in dim light and so the saying: “all cats are gray in the dark.”\nThe color detectors in the eye are the cones. There are about 7 million of these in three forms concentrated in the center of vision. Individual cones can only sense one of three narrowly defined frequencies of light: red, green and blue. The response from these three “primary” colors is sorted in our brain to give us the perception of color. One or more of these color receptors malfunctions in a color blind person.\nColor is a property of light. Our eyes see only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is made up of the wavelengths of light between infrared and ultraviolet radiation (between 400 and 700 nanometers). These frequencies, taken together, make up white (sun) light.\nWhite light can be divided into it’s component parts by passing it through a prism. The light is separated by wavelength and a spectrum is formed. Sir Isaac Newton was the first to discover this phenomenon in the seventeenth century and he named the colors of the spectrum.\nIf the ends of the spectrum are bent around and joined a color circle (color wheel) is formed with purple at the meeting place.\nColor has three distinct properties: hue, value and saturation. To understand color you must understand how these three properties relate to each other.\nThe traditional color name of a specific wavelength of light is a hue. Another description is: spectral color. All of the colors of the spectrum are hues. There are only limited hue names: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Magenta and cyan are also hues.\nValue is concerned with the light and dark properties of color. All colors exhibit these properties. The hues have a natural value where they look the purest. Some colors, like yellow, are naturally light. Some, like violet, are darker.\nAll hues can be made in all values. Adding white paint will make any pigment lighter. Adding black paint will make most pigments darker, but will cause yellow paint to shift in hue to green.\nValue can exist without hue (see achromatic). Black, white and gray are values without color.\nSaturation is concerned with the intensity, or the brightness and dullness of color. A saturated color is high in intensity — it is bright. A color that is dull is unsaturated or low in intensity. Another term for saturation is chroma. A color without any brightness (no hue) is achromatic (black, white and/or gray.\nThere are two theories that explain how colors work and interact. The light, or additive theory deals with radiated and filtered light. The pigment, or subtractive theory deals with how white light is absorbed and reflected off of colored surfaces. This course will investigate the pigment theory.\nLight theory starts with black — the absence of light. When all of the frequencies of visible light are radiated together the result is white (sun) light. The color interaction is diagramed using a color wheel with red, green and blue as primary colors. Primary here means starting colors. These are the three colors that the cones in the eye sense. This is an RGB color system (Red, Green and Blue).\nThe primary colors mix to make secondary colors: red and green make yellow, red and blue make magenta and green and blue make cyan. All three together add up tomake white light. That is why the theory is called additive.\nYou can see an example of light theory in action almost every day on a computer monitor or a colored television. The same three primary colors are used and mixed by the eye to produce the range of colors you see on the screen.\nPigments behave almost the opposite of light. With pigments a black surface absorbs most of the light, making it look black. A white surface reflects most of the (white) light making it look white. A colored pigment, green for instance, absorbs most of the frequencies of light that are not green, reflecting only the green light frequency. Because all colors other than the pigment colors are absorbed, this is also called the subtractive color theory.\nIf most of the green light (and only the green light) is reflected the green will be bright. If only a little is reflected along with some of the other colors the green will be dull. A light color results from lots of white light and only a little color reflected. A dark color is the result of very little light and color reflected.\nThe primary colors in the pigment theory have varied throughout the centuries but now cyan, magenta and yellow are increasingly being used. These are the primary colors of ink, along with black, that are used in the printing industry. This is a CMYK color system (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and (K)black). These are the secondary colors of the light theory."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:24845e0f-9c7f-46e4-81ac-3a59c9a12fef>","<urn:uuid:00770ee0-d111-4865-ae9a-e792bf3d8ef6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare how rhythm is expressed both in Mbaqanga (South African popular music) and in traditional African music practices?","answer":"Mbaqanga, which emerged from traditional Marabi Jazz and has rural Zulu roots, expresses rhythm through a Big Band Swing style. In contrast, traditional African music approaches rhythm as an inherent, shared element that mirrors the earth's heartbeat and exists within the human framework. Traditional African rhythm involves multiple types: walking rhythm based on pace, dancing rhythm expressing joy, meditative rhythm bringing forth chants, and driving rhythm perpetuating life. These all interconnect with fundamental rhythms like heartbeat and breath. While Mbaqanga developed as a popular genre in South African shebeens incorporating Western musical elements, traditional African rhythm maintains a deeper connection to natural cycles and employs complex polyrhythms that create harmonic resonance frequencies.","context":["- 1 African Popular Music\n- 2 West Africa\n- 3 Music blogs with downloads\n- 4 Sources\nAfrican Popular Music\nThe term African Popular Music doesn't refer to any particular genre or sound, it's a commonly used generic term to describe all forms of modern music from Africa. Most of these genres incorporate western influences like Rock, Rhythm & Blues and Jazz into the basic sounds of African Folk Music.\nBongo Flava is a creation by Tanzanian youth beginning in the late 1990s. The genre takes roots in Hip Hop from the United States of America and fusing various other genres including Rhythm & Blues, Afrobeat, Dancehall, as well as some of the native Tanzanian music of Taarab and Dansi.\nHighlife originally began in Ghana as a blend of brass band music with the more danceable and less \"official\" rhythms of rumba and Calypso in the 1930s. Later the genre became more Jazz & Swing influenced and has often been somewhat incorrectly called a jazz subgenre. Highlife is very popular in Nigeria, Ghana and their neighbouring countries and also paved the way for the globally better known Afrobeat.\nNotable artists: Sir Victor Uwaifo, Eddie Quansah, Otarus, Celestine Ukwu, The African Brothers, Gasper Lawal, Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe, The Anambra Beats.\n- Rough Guide To Highlife This Rough Guide is jam-packed with some of the biggest hitters in highlife history.

These popular music styles mainly consist of a combination of a worldwide popular genre like Jazz, Gospel, Rock or Electronic music, with the melody, the rhythm, the traditional instruments, etc. of a local, regional or ethnic Southern African traditional music, for examples Zulu, Sotho, Afrikaan or San (Bushmen) folk music leading to local specific style, playing and interpretation.\nBulawayo jazz is a style of afro-jazz that emerged from the city of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe in the early 1950s. The lead is assured by the alto sax in ensembles including tenor sax, trumpet, guitars, double bass, tubas and trombones.\nBulawayo jazz has been brought in the occidental world by Hugh Tracey, who recorded the material of Bulawayo Jazz: Southern Rhodesia, Zimbawbe 1950, '51, '52 in the early 1950s. Along with Gypsy Jazz, it's the sole jazz scene existing outside of the USA in the late-1940s/early-1950s.\nA prominent Zimbabwean jazz player from the 1950s was August Msarurgwa. Msarurgwa was the leader of The African Dance Band of the Cold Storage Commission of Southern Rhodesia and composed the hit \"Skokiaan\". This may be the most well-known Bulawayo jazz song and has been covered by such artists as Louis Armstrong, The Four Lads, Alma Cogan, Bill Haley and His Comets and Herb Alpert, among many others.\nThe style is no longer leading the scene in Zimbabwe, replaced by modern popular genres like Kwaito. Nevertheless, some artists like The Cool Crooners are still playing Bulawayo jazz in clubs in Bulawayo and Harare.\nEmerging from South Africa in the early 1990s, Kwaito is a music genre that takes influence from Disco, Hip Hop, and - most obviously - American and British House music. Its songs usually feature deep basslines, looped samples from more traditional styles of African music, and often sung or rapped vocals, which are usually male.\nThis sound from South Africa emerged from Marabi in the early 1950s. Kwela is rooted in Malawi and local South African traditional music such as Zulu music, and is influenced by Jazz as well. The four bar themes get repeated and mildly varied. The happy melodies of Kwela are mostly played by different flutes such as pennywhistle flutes and are often accompanied by banjo or guitar. Kwela became popular in Malawi as well and was prominent worldwide in the 1950s. The most significant artists are South African Lemmy \"Special\" Mabaso and Spokes Mashiyane, Malawian Donald Kachamba, as well as South African Elias & His Zig Zag Jive Flutes who performed in 1958 the internationally famous song Tom Hark.\nMarabi is a Jazz and Southern African Popular Music style with origins in the 1920s. This genre came to existence in the ghettos and the shebeens of Johannesburg and is rooted in traditional South African music. The formerly simplistic organ and piano style (resembling Ragtime to a certain extent, and often accompanied by different percussion instruments and later on also played by reeds) was brought to a larger audience and taken to a higher artistic level by artists such as Abdullah Ibrahim, Johnny Dyani, Basil Coetzee, The African Jazz Pioneers, Miriam Makeba (early period) and others. This sound came to prominence as it was used as a form of protest against the exploitation of the people of South Africa. From a more Swing-based Marabi combined with Zulu and Xhosa cultures emerged Kwela and Mbaqanga. These made the international popularity of Marabi music genres increase respectively in the 1950s and the 1960s.\nMbaqanga is a popular Zulu genre of South African music, that emerged from the traditional Marabi Jazz and Swing as well as Kwela popular South African genres. Mbaqanga is much more based on Big Band Swing. It appeared in the early 1960s from South African shebeens. Like Kwela, Mbaqanga has rural Zulu roots and continues to influence musicians worldwide today. The early prominent Mbaqanga artists were Makgona Tsohle Band, Mahlathini and Mahotella Queens, Sipho Mchunu accompanied by Johnny Clegg with Juluka band. Today this genre is less active although Mahotella Queens reduced to three members are still performing.\nMbube is a form of Southern African Popular Music, traditionally performed A cappella in a powerful and loud way.\nNotable artists: Solomon Linda, Miriam Makeba, Ladysmith Black Mambazo.\n- Soweto Never Sleeps: Classic Female Zulu Jive\n- Mbube Roots - Zulu Choral Music from South Africa, 1930s-1960s\nShangaan electro is an Electronic Dance Music genre from South Africa with very fast BPM (around 180) and features MIDI keyboard sounds and marimba. The genre took form around 2005 with the productions of Richard \"Nozinja\" Mthethwa who wanted to make marimba-based Shangaan music but with a faster pace.\nNotable artists: Penny Penny, Tshe-Tsha Boys, Mark Ernestus, Anthony Shake Shakir.\n- Living Is Hard: West African Music in Britain, 1927-1929 LIVING IS HARD… is the first in a series of compilations drawing on the exquisitely rare 78s housed in EMI’s Hayes Archives. While the archives represent a staggering diversity of music from all corners of the globe, for this outing, the producers at Honest Jon’s choose to focus on West African transplants residing in the British Isles during the height of the modern colonial era. Serving as a unique snapshot into the immigrant experience, the music represented is a window into the folk and community-based traditions of the African Diaspora--and a revealing look at the beginnings of modern-day genres such as high-life.

However, the first West African calypso recordings in the modern style are from Freetown, Sierra Leone in the early 1950s, by Ebenezer Calendar and Famous Scrubbs. In arrangements blending African and European instruments, the brass plays out the legacy of colonial military bands, albeit hair-down and a little ramshackle now; and the beautiful creole lyrics are as upful, quick, current, musical and intimate as any classic calypsonian's.

From a young child dancing with the ankle beads, to a young maiden playing uhadi, to a married women playing all the instruments and to a mother with a child. The cycle of traditional music continues endlessly through the Xhosa tradition from conception to death, from incarnation to afterlife.\nThe African experience is a continuation of poetry music and dance. Music is the foundation of African education. Music is part of the child's everyday life. As soon as the child is able to walk, s/he is encouraged to dance. Dance is a product of song. In Zulu : Melody (indlela) is translated to mean a footpath and Music (umculo) to mean singing. They say, “If you can talk you can sing and if you can walk you can dance.”\nIn African Music, music is produced by the people for the people. “The African mother sings to her child and introduces him to many aspects of his music right from the cradle. She trains the child to become aware of the rhythm and movement by rocking him to music, by singing to him in nonsense syllables imitative of drum rhythms. When s/he is old enough to sing, s/he sings with her/his mother and learns to imitate drum rhythms b rote. As soon as he can control his arm, he is allowed to tap rhythms, possibly on a toy drum. Participation in children's games and stories incorporating songs enables him to learn to sing in the style of her/his culture, just s/he learns to speak its language. By singing songs which contain a moral, her/his mother teaches her/him what his people consider to be right or wrong.” 1\nTHE PLAN FOR AFRICAN MUSIC: Hugh Tracey presented a paper on the 24 th September 1965 at Liverpool University entitled ‘A Plan for African Music.' 2 the full essay can be reproduced in the book.\nHis ideal was “to bring indigenous African arts and particularly African music into the normal curriculum of African schools, colleges and eventually into the Universities themselves.” Through research, “We are to codify the logic which lies behind the creation of indigenous styles of music and thus to bring it naturally, without prejudice, into the realm of African education …” 2\nTHE UNITING PRINCIPLE IN MUSIC THEORY : RHYTHM: A holistic education teaches a single principle and that principle can be resonated harmonically throughout all possible principles that exist thereafter.\nRhythm is the heartbeat of a song. As long as the heartbeat of the song is pumping the song has life. The starting point for African rhythm is in the present moment. Rhythm is something that is yours that you call on when it is needed. It is something that is inherent and it is shared. It exists within the human framework. It mirrors the rhythm of our mother earth which has her own heartbeat.\nRhythm is musical language that has a frequency resonation and vibration all of its own. Polyrhythm keeps the dance alive and exciting. The human body is a rhythmical creation. A human being is a rhythmical body born into the rhythm of life. The present moment is a gift from the creator it is always in the present where we must begin. It is in the present when the rhythm will begin. Tune into the rhythm of the music we are listening to, here how the instruments interplay weaving their multi-coloured tapestry of lived experience .\n“Art is identical with Education. Knowledge of this kind is the very stuff of education,” Hugh Tracey.\nRhythm is something that is yours that you call on when it is needed. It is something that is inherent and it is shared. It exists within the human framework. It mirrors the rhythm of our mother earth. Mother Earth has a heartbeat. Picture how nature's orchestra is always playing, the birds singing and the wind blowing through the trees. When I start my rhythm I start my rhythm as one with this infinite orchestra that I am experiencing. Music can be solo and or collective.\nCYCLICAL TIME: Ancient music does not express its mathematic foundation through the division and addition of time the same way we do in the West. (Source unknown)\nThe Western linear system has been used to explain this unsuccessfully as African rhythm does employ a cyclical time. Should you imagine a line of figure of eights lying on their side connecting one to the other, you can accurately plot a course down the centre all the way from one end to the next and you will have an accurate assessment of the time of the song. However, the line running down the centre (linear time) is not an exact reflection of the figure of eight (cyclical time).Through cyclical time you are creating more experience (as seen by the action off the circular shapes) in the same time as plotted on the linear line. It therefore appears that the cyclical time is existing outside of time or beyond time.\nAfrican cyclical rhythm is existing inclusive of and beyond linear time. A musical phrase or a musical passage has a rhythmical life. It exists in all three dimensions. Should you wish to make an impression of it on paper using linear notation you will compress it to 2 dimensions. You lose the 3 dimensional experience of actually playing that rhythm yourself and then are left having to recreate the 3 dimensional experience from the 2 dimensional impression of it. Cyclical rhythm involves the whole body and can only be learnt through participation. We are invited to do these rhythm exercises with your morning breathing or your evening stroll and with your daily activities and even if possibly in your sleep time.\nRHYTHMICAL PATTERNS: There is no obstacle to rhythm : anyone can explore rhythm in a freestyle unrestricted way.\nThese are the types of rhythms we can employ: The Walking Rhythm relies on the pace that I walk; The Dancing Rhythm expresses the joy in my stride; The Meditative Rhythm brings chants from my soul and the Driving rhythm perpetuates life. All these rhythms rely on a network of interconnected rhythms: The Rhythm of the human heartbeat that is the pumping action of life and the Rhythm of the breath that nurtures the body.\nIntegrating our rhythmical practices with breathing or breathwork leads to deep meditation and trance states, which is regarded as very beneficial to the soul experience.\nPOLYRHYTHM: Consider two rhythms : foundation rhythm the heartbeat and our improvisational rhythm the breath beat. The relationship between two rhythms is Polyrhythm. It is unique to Africa.\nFor instance a famous African Polyrhythm is placing 3 beats into 2 of the heartbeat. Each of the three beats holds an equal time that is equal to two of the heartbeats.\nScientifically what you have created here are frequencies that exhibit a harmonic resonance frequency. The frequency of the heartbeat rhythm and the frequency of the triplet placed inside it creates a harmonic resonance frequency that is 3 : 2. This is equivalent to the perfect fifth melodic interval.\nPerfect Fifth is the anti-clockwise direction of the Cycle of Fifths. The clockwise direction of the cycle of Fifths in the Perfect Fourth. The Perfect Fourth has a rhythmical frequency of 3 : 4\nINDIGENOUS AFRICAN SCALE: The most ancient melodic instrument across Africa is the musical bow. When you strike the string of the bow and watch it vibrate, you will notice that the string moves most in the centre and least where it is tied to the bow. The player can therefore play either portion of the string therefore producing two sets of fundamental notes.\nA tswana induna playing nokukwana called the fundamental of the string, or the first note, molodi. MaDosini (2) called the open note “playing an umhobe (uncontrolled) sound /pitch … it is merely crying /sounding ‘on its own/ by itself '.”\nAndrew Tracey says, The bow provides the scales of all Southern African music. Of the two fundamental notes, there is an open note (the player not touching the string) VU and a closed note (the player touching the string) VA : The tuning of these two fundamentals are usually a tone apart but can be a half tone apart. The fundamental note of the string yields a harmonic series through ‘partial vibrations.' Dargie (2) has found that the hexatonic scale is ubiquitous to this music.\nThe Archives of Traditional Music: Tribute to Hugh Tracey\n\"If the roots of your art are firmly planted in your own Soil, and that soil has anything to give you, you may still gain the whole world and not lose your own soul.\" RV Williams.\nHugh Tracey was born in 1903 in England. His father was a country doctor and preacher. In 1929 he came to Southern Rhodesia to join his brother an ex serviceman in the second world war, to help on the farm. He was near Mashingo and he loved Karanga, which he spoke fluently. While learning the language he learnt the songs and drumming on the farm. He published his first book ‘Songs of the Kraal.' Hugh Tracey's achievements are well known in the recordings of indigenous African music. He made recording an art in communicating and decoding the expression of the musicians; in translating the language in the lyrics and narrative into English; and the music into high quality sound recordings. Hugh Tracey was known as magadagada, like a sewing machine that never stopped. He achieved to put African music on the map.\nHe had a great love for the composers and musicians of Southern Africa. He wrote: “Accomplished musicians the world over belong to a kind of a guild which can be detected in their manner and bearing – regardless of social, racial or economic background. It was largely on this account that I managed to discover so large an elite of musicians at all levels of African society during the course of the tours,” The liner notes of the records state, “Tracey's hand held microphone technique was a reason for the clarity of his recordings; he never used a stand, on the principle that the performers had no experience of working to a microphone. At the end of each session he invariably played back the tape to the delight of the performers. He noted on one occasion, an mbira player on hearing himself played back, said, “I can die now, it does not matter, because I am inside that record now.” “In 1931 Hugh Tracey visited the Royal College of Music in London and met composers Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst. He played his recordings from Zimbabwe to them and they enthusiastically encouraged him to discover and record. Future musicians, they said, would greatly benefit.” In his career spanning 50 years, he lead 19 field excursions throughout sub-Saharan Africa. These were long trips with a crew, several vehicles and a diesel generator that would have to be parked a long way away so that it would not be heard.\nHe kept notebooks detailing the environment and circumstances in which the communities were living. He recorded over 3000 musical items and collected over 400 musical instruments, wrote a dozen books and countless essays, presentations and scripts. He published as much as he could in his own lifetime through the establishment of ILAM (International Library of African Music), and their publication African Music Journal. ILAM was built in 1954 on a farm in Johannesburg. It has been called, “One of the greatest depositories of African music.” The majority of all this music of Africa Hugh Tracey recorded has been not so much composed as remembered. It is folk music. “Knowledge of this kind is the very stuff of education,” wrote Hugh Tracey. “It may well be that local folk music is one of Africa's most important social assets,” he writes. “Folk musics are handed on from father to son, from musician to musician. Folk music is always alive in the minds of the people. It requires the immediate response of the folk around to participate in a form which they can manage.” Hugh Tracey draws an interesting comparison between African music (which he describes as dynamic) and Western music (as aesthetic).\nAll African music shares practicality in common. “Every piece of folk music works for its living,” he writes. Hugh Tracey's life work was to ensure that African culture would not be lost or forgotten to the African people. Traditional cultural practices of dance, music and instruments are preserved together with a foundation of great wisdom. “The musical arts of Africa provide a channel, a veritable fiord, into the heart of African spiritualities. If the composers know their own hearts, they become our mouths,\" says Hugh Tracey. It is believed that ancestral spirits mediate between the living and the ‘Supreme being.' They are watching over their families like a ‘cloud of witnesses.' He wrote: ‘Ancestral spirits mediate between the living and God, the supreme being 'Mulingqangi'. His/Her pleasure is music and dance.' Music is a calling. “Patriotic and nostalgic considerations apart, there should always be room in formal education for a study of one's own national music, and today more so than ever, with radio entertainment making unparall eled demands upon musicians, and “majority rule” in music threatening to make Americans of us all,” writes Hugh Tracey. Hugh Tracey presented a paper on the 24th September 1965 at Liverpool University entitled ‘A Plan for African Music.' He quoted Sir Herbert Read as saying “art is a token of mutual understanding,” and then saying himself that “Art is identical with Education.” Hugh Tracey's ideal was “to bring indigenous African arts and particularly African music into the normal curriculum of African schools, colleges and eventually into the Universities themselves. ”\n“We are to codify the logic which lies behind the creation of indigenous styles of music a nd thus to bring it naturally, without prejudice, into the realm of African education, ” said Tracey. Hugh Tracey was fascinated by the mbira (thumb piano). This instrument is unique to Africa. From the design of the mbira he created an instrument called kalimba which was ‘a blend of the traditional African idea of the mbira and a western scale.' The company African Musical Instruments (AMI) was born to accommodate the demand for this instrument that came initially from America in the late 1950's. The instrument factory, African Musical Instruments (AMI) was set up on the farm.\nA special passion for Chopi Music\nChopi musicians by Hugh Tracey “I have devoted most of my holidays from official duties to visiting those areas where the Chopi are to be found, and taking notes in the hope of learning all I could before making gramophone records.” Chopi play large orchestras of Timbila orchestras and orchestral dances called Mijodo. A Ngodo is an orchestral dance in 9 to 11 movements. “They speak with one voice and move with one spirit by mystical participation in the compelling music.” … “The orchestral ground is developed by the composer himself and by his fellow musicians as they play.\nThe composition becomes communal with the players of the various pitches of Timbila (treble, alto, tenor, base and double bass) improving their own parts. They all conform to the master pattern set by the composer. Southern Mozambique 1943 – 63: Music of Chopi, Gitonga, Bonga, Tswa, Tsonga, Sena, Nyungwe and Ndau Opening track features young girls on gourd flutes (ocarinas) recorded in the Quissoca District. “These ocarinas are made from the hard spherical flute of the mutamba orange tree and have 3 holes, one for blowing and 2 for fingering. Notes can also be easily lipped down in pitch. Small girls from 5 or 6 start to play these home-made 3 note instruments for amusement, usually in duet with one chigowilo, always smaller, thus higher pitched.” On track 3 we hear 13 xylophones led by Shambini, recorded at Quissoco. Mtsitso are introductory movements played by the orchestra alone, without song or dance, before the dancers enter. On track 7 we hear the mzeno movement from the timbila dance, it is considered to be the climax.\nHugh Tracey notes, “Komakomu's sparkling playing style is in evidence, playing kudala, single note melody on the high notes, or doubling the song in octaves.” On tracsk 8 to 10 we heard mandowa dance played on mbira recorded at Nova Mambone District. The mandowa acrobatic tumbling dance uses four drums. On track 16 we hear the music of the Tswa people, who live North of the Chopi and play an almost identical xylophone called muhambi. On track 19 we hear the hexatonic mbira performed by Jose Machokole, from Save River Mozambique. This is one of the very few African mbiras with 3 ranks or manuals of keys and a 3 octave range, played with 2 fingers and 2 thumbs…"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:47e540ac-6909-4c41-9d80-f793fe8bdc4b>","<urn:uuid:e2486bbf-34f9-417b-950c-c856653feca7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the historical development of therapy duration and intensity compare between traditional OPT treatment program vs LSVT approach for improving quality of life?","answer":"The two therapies have different intensity and duration structures. OPT is structured as a comprehensive course offering 12 instructional hours with multiple sessions covering various aspects like muscle movements, oral habits, feeding, and speech clarity exercises. In contrast, LSVT follows a more concentrated, intensive approach with therapy administered four times per week for four weeks, with sessions lasting one to two hours per day.

It also can be used for people who have other neurological conditions. LSVT programs are administered in an intensive manner — four times per week for four weeks — and are tailored to each patient.\nThe emphasis is on exaggerated activity to compensate for PD’s movement and speech symptoms. For movement issues, therapists ask patients to move in BIG or amplified ways, whether they’re walking, buttoning shirts and pants, getting keys or change out of pockets, or writing. For speech, the focus is on a single goal: LOUD speaking. Activities may include sustaining a vowel sound such as “ah,” oral reading and speaking activities that increase in complexity (word and paragraph length).\n“The majority of PD patients I send for therapy find it to be extremely helpful,” says Kelvin L. Chou, M.D., professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Michigan Medicine and co-director of the STIM (Surgical Therapies Improving Movement) Program.\nHow LSVT works\nMichigan Medicine physical therapist Krysten Salla says LSVT BIG trains people with Parkinson’s to exaggerate their physical movements so movements that feel “too big” to them appear normal. Certified PTs, such as Salla, and occupational therapists use specific techniques to improve bradykinesia (slow movement), hypokenesia (small movement) and kinesthetic awareness (sensory deficits). Salla notes that LSVT does not treat dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movement).\nWith the program, patients need to tolerate one to two hours of activity per day, four days per week, for four weeks. “The patients who tend to benefit most from BIG therapy are those who report some difficulty getting out of a bed or chair,” Chou says.\n“Speech-language pathologists who use the LSVT LOUD program target the specific speech problems related to Parkinson’s disease, such as softness and difficulty forming sounds clearly,” says speech-language pathologist Jen Gostlin. Patients are trained to increase healthy speech loudness during 16 one-hour sessions over four weeks.\n“The patients who benefit the most from LOUD therapy are those who report being asked to repeat statements twice,” says Chou.\nLSVT therapy benefits\nPatients usually report significant improvements in their quality of life. Salla says LSVT BIG patients typically notice improvements in walking, getting in and out of chairs, and rolling in bed as well as overall flexibility, balance, strength and endurance. Because the program is specific to individual patients and their needs, results are based on personal goals.\nAs for whom it can help, Salla says, “the people with Parkinson’s disease who benefit the most from LSVT BIG therapy are early on in their diagnosis or have minimal to moderate functional deficits.”\nPeople who are having some difficulties but are still able to walk and get in and out of bed with little or no assistance can greatly benefit. The program requires cognitive effort to change habits and reprogram the brain to make bigger, more efficient movements, so patients who have little to no cognitive problems are the most successful.\nGostlin reports that LSVT LOUD patients can notice improvements in speech volume, voice quality, disordered rate and articulation, facial expression and intelligibility.\nShe notes that the best candidates for LSVT LOUD therapy are at the early stage of diagnosis, have higher levels of cognitive ability and are motivated to complete daily home exercises.\nKeys to success\nEssential components of both LSVT BIG and LSVT LOUD are follow-through, practice and carryover to home. Patients are asked to incorporate the BIG and LOUD principles and strategies into their everyday lives for greatest success to improve their quality of life.\n“It’s important to remember that those who get the most out of the program are those who practice the exercises they learn in class at home,” says Chou. “Those who continue their exercises after the program is over will maintain the benefit, while those who do not continue their exercises will eventually lose the benefit.”\nAssistance at U-M MedRehab\nUniversity of Michigan Briarwood MedRehab in Ann Arbor offers both types of LSVT therapy. Prospective patients need to obtain a referral from their physician. Patients may also benefit from completing both the BIG and LOUD programs together if indicated. Referrals should specify LSVT and Briarwood MedRehab.\nA multidisciplinary team of clinicians (physical therapist, occupational therapist and speech-language pathologist) will determine if the patient is appropriate for the program. At the end of the program, MedRehab offers a group class one or two times a week; this is a private-pay option.\nOn the LSVT Global website, you can search for an LSTV clinician in your area."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:601c974e-5523-46bb-96df-585a0a6ef720>","<urn:uuid:eff41741-d8db-47bb-97bf-723baa8c3280>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) relate to each other in terms of their historical significance and scope?","answer":"The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA) was the first federal legislation mandating building accessibility and primarily applies to federal facilities through the ABAAS (Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards). The ADA, signed in 1990, is a broader civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disabilities and applies to both public and private sectors. The ADA was later amended in 2008 to broaden the definition of 'disability' to protect a larger demographic. While the ABA focuses specifically on federal building accessibility standards, the ADA has wider scope including websites as 'places of public accommodation' under Title III.","context":["The Architectural Barriers Act and the Federal Government\nLearn lessons from the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards for federal buildings to deepen your knowledge and application of universal design.\nDid you know? The Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS) are the most widely applied physical access requirements for the design and construction of Federal facilities. The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA), was a signature achievement in the history of disability rights as the first Federal legislation mandating that buildings be accessible.

Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Since then lawsuits targeting sites over ADA violations have skyrocketed. Ensure your site is ADA compliant to avoid lengthy and expensive legal battle with this ADA website checklist.\nWhat is Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act was published in 1990. It’s a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination of people on the basis of their disabilities. It also encourages organizations, institutions, businesses and other establishments to provide accommodations to people with disabilities so they can have the same level of access to services as everyone else.\nThe law was later amended in 2008 to fit the conditions of modern society. The amendment broadened the term “disability”, extending the act’s protection to a larger demographic.\nThere’s a lot of misconceptions about ADA compliance. This is mainly because it’s relatively new in the web world and many agencies and developers have little to no experience in implementing it correctly. Here’s the facts:\n- Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act is being interpreted to include websites as “places of public accommodation”.\n- Websites with significant inaccessible components can be seen as discriminatory against persons with disabilities, in violation of Title III of the ADA.\n- The ADA is a strict liability law which means there are no excuses/defenses for violations (e.g. ignorance, web developer is working on it, etc.).\n- No current legal prescription exists for web accessibility but WCAG 2.0 AA has been commonly referenced as a guide.\n- Newly published Web Accessibility Standards (WAS) make accessibility easier.\n- Plaintiff’s lawyers are filing ADA lawsuits as fast as they can.\nADA Website Compliance vs. Website Accessibility\nBefore I start, let’s clear up two terms that are closely intertwined but distinct: ADA website compliance vs. website accessibility.\nThe law that primarily governs accessibility is The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Even though it doesn’t mention websites anywhere, Title III of the ADA has been been interpreted by US courts to apply to websites.\nFor our websites to be ADA compliant, they need to be accessible. Website accessibility can mean two things depending on the context:\n- the process of making your website so that its content and functions are accessible to those with disabilities, or\n- how accessible your website is.\nIn other words, ADA is the legal side, are you in compliance with the law? And accessibility is the technical or developmental side, how well can persons with disabilities access your website?\nADA Website Checklist\nWeb Accessibility Standards (WAS)\nThe technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are grouped under three levels: A, AA and AAA. Each conformance level has an increasingly higher standard of accessibility. WCAG 2.0 was designed with three levels in order to provide more flexibility for different situations. For example, an internal policy in a government department may require the highest possible standard of accessibility – that would be Level AAA. In other situations, it may be enough to meet level AA requirements of the ADA website checklist.\n# Level A Compliance\nLevel A of WCAG 2.0 is the most basic level of web accessibility. If you meet Level A of the ADA website checklist and stop there, you’re unlikely to be compliant with the ADA. That’s because Level A leaves many barriers in place for people with disabilities. These barriers are not onerous to remove.\n- Images have alternate text that can be read by screen reader software.\nAlternate text tags allow users to interpret page content without seeing images.\n- Recorded video content includes captions.\nText captions are an important alternative to audio and allow the hearing impaired to use content.\n- Video or audio-only content is accompanied by text transcript or description.\nLike captions, a text description can also communicate what a video or audio clip is about. This can be in the form of a paragraph around the video.\n- Links are provided to media players required to view content.\nIf a media player like Flash Player is needed to use content, there should be a link to where the software can be downloaded.\n- Headings are presented in logical order.\nMain headings (h1) come before smaller subheadings (h2, h3 and so on).\n- “b” and “i” tags are replaced with “strong” and “em.”\n“Strong” and “emphasis” tags can specify more than just visual changes like “bold” and “italics” to web browsers.\n- There are no empty links or heading tags.\nEmpty links and headings make for sloppy code and can confuse users of screen reading software.\n- Presentation does not rely solely on color.\nPresentation that relies solely on color is inaccessible to the visually impaired. Information should be conveyed using broad, easily-interpreted techniques.\n- Automatically-played audio does not occur or can be stopped.\nIt is strongly recommended that audio does not play automatically. However, if audio plays, a keyboard user should be able to stop it.\n- The keyboard can be used to navigate the site.\nKeyboard access is crucial for visually-impaired users. The keyboard should be capable of meeting all functionality on the site.\n- Keyboard focus is never stuck on one particular page element.\nWhen proceeding through a website using the keyboard, keyboard focus should not get locked to any position. Focus should keep moving with each tap.\n- Time limits provide notifications to the user.\nIf a user has limited time to do something, they should be warned before time expires. This can be in the form of a pop-up or other notification.\n- Automatically scrolling or blinking content can be stopped.\nAny page element that automatically moves or changes should be able to be stopped in a certain position.\n- No strobe effects or rapidly flashing colors occur on the site.\nFlashing colors are generally considered to be bad practice as they are very disruptive, especially for users with epilepsy.\n- “Skip navigation” functionality allows keyboard users to quickly access content.\n“Skip to content” functionality is often accessed with the Tab key and allows a user to skip to the main body of a page. Especially useful with screen reading software, it ensures the user does not have to move keyboard focus through the full length of every page.\n- Page titles clearly and succinctly describe page content.\nPage titles usually appear in the top of the browser window and communicate the main idea of a page. They should be of reasonable length, closer to a sentence or less rather than a paragraph of text.\n- Buttons and links are clearly and logically named.\nButtons and links are “action items” the user can interact with, causing something to happen. The action that occurs should be predictable, clearly communicated, and never a surprise.\n- The language of each page is identified in code.\nLanguage code in the header of each page marks what language the code is written and meant to be read in.\n- Elements receiving focus do not change content in a substantial way.\nSometimes, keyboard focus changes the appearance of a page element. For example, hovering a mouse over a link might change the link’s text color, or giving an element keyboard focus might make it larger. This change should not significantly affect the layout or readability of the page.\n- Invalid form input is identified to the user.\nIf the user enters invalid information into a form control, they should be notified of the issue. For example, when filling out an email address form, an email address must be entered. If an invalid email address is entered, the user should know of the problem.\n- Forms have labels and legends that can be read by screen reader software.\nEvery form input should have a label to describe what type of information should be entered into it. Additionally, a legend can be used to group multiple form inputs.\n- There are no major validation errors.\nThe website passes W3C HTML validation with no major problems.\n# Level AA Compliance\nLevel AA is a happy medium that most businesses currently strive for. Level AA conformance satisfies all Level A criteria and more, while still allowing for more flexible design choices, making this level not too light but not too restrictive in its effect on your site design. This is the most popular level of conformance most projects strive for in the ADA website checklist.\n- Live video or audio content includes captions.\nLive streaming video or audio is accompanied by captions or ongoing text descriptions.\n- Contrast ratio between text and page backgrounds is at least 4.5-to-1.\nColor contrast between readable and background elements should be sufficient for reading. This is a core design element that matters for everyone, especially the visually impaired.\n- Text on pages can be resized to 200% while still maintaining form.\nWhen zooming in on a page and enlarging text, page elements must accommodate the new sizing. Text resizing cannot drastically change page layout or negatively affect usability.\n- Images are not used where text can achieve the same purpose.\nText is highly accessible and should be used whenever text can successfully communicate an idea. Images should only be used where necessary.\n- Pages on the site can be accessed in multiple ways.\nA user looking for a page should be able to find that page in more ways than one. For example, the navigation bar, site map, and search function can all move users through the site.\n- Keyboard focus is visible and clear.\nAs keyboard focus moves down the page, highlighted elements should appear noticeable enough such that the user knows where they are focused.\n- The language of content is identified in code with any language changes.\nAny section of a page presented in a language other than the site’s primary language should identify the language of that section.\n- Menus and buttons are used consistently regardless of the user’s location in the site.\nMenus and buttons should appear with the same presentation and order regardless of where the user is on the site. This consistency is especially critical for main navigation areas.\n- Users are given suggestions on how to solve input errors.\nForm input errors the user receives should be shown with a useful suggestion on how to resolve the error.\n- An error prevention technique is used whenever the user is entering sensitive data.\nForms transmitting sensitive information such as financial or legal data should have some degree of error prevention. This means either: the form submission can be reversed; data is checked and returned to the user if anything is found to be invalid; or a final confirmation is offered.\n- Underlined text that does not provide a link is removed.\nUnderlined text universally suggests “this is a link.” Therefore, underlined text that does not link is misleading and should be removed. Italics can be a great alternative.\n- Redundant links on the same page are eliminated or minimized.\nMultiple links to the same location from the same page make screen reading software read the links multiple times. Often a page can be restructured such that a link is not needed more than once.\n# Level AAA Compliance\nIt is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.\nAccording to the World Wide Web Consortium, which develops WCAG 2.0,\n“It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.*” In other words, some requirements in the Level AAA ADA website checklist, like sign language interpretation for live web events, may not always be easily put into place.\n- Give visitors an alternative option for live video.\n- Don’t use any time limits.\n- Let users browse without interruption.\n- Provide explanations for any abbreviations.\n- Use headers to break up large blocks of content.\n- Give users options when it comes to how the screen is presented.\n- Provide explanations of difficult or complex words.\nWrite for reading level of 9 years of school and avoid or explain all jargon.\n- Tell users where they are on the page.\n- On forms, validate input and allow input to be changed without exception.\n- Provide instruction for completing tasks, especially forms.\n- Elements on the site do not change unless the end-user asks.\n- If re-authentication is necessary, data entered is saved.\n- Allow users to customize their view.\n- Contrast is at least 7:1 relative to the background.\n- Provide sign language translations for videos."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ead0e008-3992-4646-86b7-fb6d60e61325>","<urn:uuid:ff850862-b036-4454-b483-6608cfd19b5b>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Can garden sage and clary sage both be used as culinary herbs in Mississippi gardens?","answer":"While garden sage (Salvia officinalis) is listed as a suitable culinary herb for Mississippi gardens, growing 20-32 inches tall and providing leaves for seasoning, clary sage (Salvia sclarea) is not listed among the recommended herbs for Mississippi gardens. Clary sage is mainly used in aromatherapy rather than cooking.","context":["Herb Gardens for Mississippi\nHerbs are an enjoyable and useful addition to the Southern garden. In addition to the beauty of their foliage and flower, incorporating herbs into the landscape provides benefits to both the gardener and backyard wildlife.\nBy following a few simple tips, successful herb gardens can be easily added to an existing landscape. This guide provides information on how to successfully establish an herb garden and the plant types suitable to Mississippi.\nWhat is an Herb Garden?\nHerb gardens have been around for as long as humans have cultivated plants for their own needs. Babylonian clay tablets from 3000 B.C. discuss plants being used for medicine, and the importation of useful plants from other regions. China, Egypt, India, and Assyria also have early written records of plants being used for medicine and other human needs. Our current definition of an herb garden originates from European gardens that have incorporated plants for medicine, fragrance, cooking, utility, and beauty. Early American gardens continued this tradition by utilizing these useful plants from Europe and Asia, and also those found locally.\nRather than the gardening definition of an herb as being a perennial or annual non-woody plant, herb gardens actually emphasize all useful plants ranging from trees, shrubs, groundcovers, perennials, and annuals -- to mosses, ferns, and fungi. Plants for herb gardens are selected according to their use to the gardener. Typically these plants contain certain alkaloids, bitters, essential oils, gums, glycosides, mucilage, saponins, tannins, minerals, or vitamins that are chosen for specific needs.\nPlanning an Herb Garden\nWhen implementing an herb garden one should consider the amount of time that the gardener has to maintain the area. If just a few favorite plants are used on an occasional basis it may be advantageous to grow them in a few well-placed containers or an existing garden bed. The development of a larger separate herb garden can be time consuming with regular weeding, watering, and fertilizing chores.\nSelecting a Site\nMost herb plants require a sunny site with well-drained organic soils. The area selected should receive at least six hours of direct sun each day. Also, many herbs fail in clay soil types or during extremely wet weather conditions. Because of this, most herb gardeners prefer to develop raised beds or by using containers. Select a good potting mix that includes peat, vermiculite, and perlite; avoid using pine bark mixes that disintegrate easily and create waterlogged soil conditions. Since certain herbs vary in their pH preferences, it is best to maintain a slightly acidic soil condition (6.0 to 6.5) to satisfy most herbs. Alkaline loving plants, such as Mother of Thyme (Acinos) prefer a high pH, which may be provided by localized lime applications. For ease of care to the garden, consider placing the herb garden near available water outlets or within proximity to the kitchen.\nTypes of Herb Gardens\nHerbs can be incorporated in a variety of ways into the home landscape. Valued for their fragrance, flower, grace, and flavor; herbs can be incorporated into existing flowerbeds, containers, or even traditional raised herb beds. Early American homes often featured a 'kitchen garden' that utilized vegetables and herbs in rectangular garden plots. These plots were conveniently located near the kitchen area and were often fenced to deter animals. Elaborate knot gardens used box or other dwarf evergreens to line the bed edges and to provide a strongly organized form. Since most herbs are deciduous, including evergreen elements will provide winter interest to the garden.\nDesigning the Herb Garden\nHerb gardens should reflect the period of the house or the gardener's tastes. Formal herb gardens are based upon well-defined patterns and geometric shapes, and are particularly suited to antebellum or traditional architecture. Since herbs vary in their shape and form, formal patterns help to provide garden structure to irregular plant forms.\nInformal gardens offer the opportunity to mix herbs with perennials, bulbs, and vegetables. Since some herbs are known to repel certain insect pests or even weeds, companion plantings provide for an exuberance of flower color and leaf texture. When mixing plants, it is important to know the maximum growth heights of plants to avoid loss of sunlight. Always locate shorter growing plants to the front of the garden bed with taller plants to the back.\nDrawing a Plan\nOnce the appropriate site is selected, it is beneficial to design a plan for the herb garden. Developing a plan on paper allows the designer to experiment and consider different schemes for maximum effect. Use graph paper and use each square as a certain measurement, such as six inches, to represent the herb bed. Remember to include the locations of nearby existing site items such as the house, patios, fences, trees and water faucets. Include paths into the plan in order to service the garden area. Brick on sand paths can be incorporated into the garden to provide direct access to the herbs and to help divide the garden into individual planting areas. Incorporate seating elements such as benches or chairs and locate these in areas where the gardener can enjoy being in or viewing the garden.\nOnce the form of the garden is determined, selecting the appropriate plants and locations is considered. Research the growing requirements of each desired species, and make sure that the soils and site are compatible. Group plants that require certain conditions together -- such as moisture loving plants, alkaline loving plants, or shade preferring plants -- for ease of maintenance. Combine plants that complement or contrast each other in leaf texture, leaf color, or flower color for striking designs. Increasing the diversity of plants in the herb garden will ensure a diverse range of flowering times, fruiting times, and harvest times.\nHerbs suitable for Mississippi\nGarden herbs vary in their cold tolerance, heat tolerance, moisture tolerance, soil preference, and fertilizer needs. Over-fertilization should be avoided to prevent rangy or excessive growth. In wet climates, such as near the Mississippi Gulf Coast where hurricanes or weather systems can produce extended rainfalls, soil drainage should be maximized or plants should be selected accordingly. Also, heat tolerant plants will perform better in the zone 9 area of Mississippi, while cool tolerant plants are well-suited to zone 7 in the north.\nThe following is a select list of herbs that have been found to perform well in Mississippi. There are numerous cultivars available that may offer further design or environmental opportunities.

This is the same sage that in most modern households gathers dust for most of the year, only to be brought out in the fall to season the Thanksgiving dinner, usually used with too heavy a hand, explaining its unpopularity with cooks during the rest of the year. Sage is one those extraordinary, ordinary herbs whose longstanding and familiar use leads us to greatly underestimate it. The uses of sage outside of the kitchen range from the mundane to the mystical, from a cure for the common cold to the psychoactive effects of Salvia divinorum and Salvia apiana in ceremonial and religious celebrations.\nThe tradition of using sage in the culinary arts of Thanksgiving began with the early American colonists,7 Sage is an excellent digestive herb when used for seasoning on meals of rich meats and fowl. The colonists also considered sage a valuable remedy for colds and fevers in the harsh New England winters. There is something very grounding and relaxing about a hot cup of sage tea with lemon, sipped slowly while the winter holds court outside your warm home. The cold and sniffles seem to melt away in the fragrant steam. Sage has excellent antibacterial and astringent properties, which explains it popular use in gargles for sore throats, gingivitis and sore gums. A strong sage tea or tincture diluted with water can be used. (Grieve, Maud)\nSage is an excellent natural disinfectant and deodorizer, drying perspiration and helping to eliminate body odor. Extracts of sage are used in personal skin care for its capacity to heal the skin as well. (White, Linda B. M.D)\nSage is a well regarded herb for women and can be especially helpful for relieving the hot flashes of menopause, and slowing heavy menstrual bleeding. (Gladstar, Rosemary) Sage is also a good herbal tea for drying up breast milk for weaning. Fernie, W.T. M.D Chinese medicine uses red sage, Salvia miltiorrhiza, combined with dan-gui (dong quai), to regulate menstrual flow. (Foster, Steven and Yue chongxi)\nUsing sage to darken greying hair comes down to us from the gypsies, and I can personally attest to the fact that it works. What I like about it is the subtle effect, just a gradual darkening that doesn't leave you with ugly gray roots. Sage also leaves the hair feeling soft and shiny, and the scalp invigorated. Sage does not stop at making you look younger, it can also help prevent those \"senior moments\" as well. Both clinical studies and traditional wisdom agree that sage (Salvia officinalis) or Spanish sage (S. lavandulifolia) has positive effects on memory and concentration in both older people with cognitive problems and younger people with ADD. 1\nPreparation Methods & Dosage :Sage can be used fresh or dried both as a culinary herb and medicinal herb. Sage can be taken as a tea, and the infusion can used externally as a skin and hair rinse, and as a gargle for sore throats. Liquid extracts can be diluted with water and easily applied to teeth and gums. The essential oil is used sparely, and is never ingested. White sage is burned as incense in Native American ceremonies.\nSage : Essential Oil Profile\nSage oil is occasionally used in perfumery in herb-type, spicy, and masculine scents. The undiluted essential oil can cause skin irritations and should never be taken internally.\nThe Chinese have long valued sage for its healing properties. Red sage or dan-shen Salvia miltiorrhiza is one of many Chinese species in the genus, and is a very commonly used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine to relieve pain after childbirth and regulate menstruation. Combined with dan-gui, it is used to regulate suppressed menstrual flow.\nKoehler's Medicinal-Plants 1887\nSage is a shrubby perennial herb of the mint family native to the Mediterranean. There are over 500 varieties of sage, and most are medicinally useful. They grow throughout the tropical and temperate zones and many of them have medicinal and culinary value. Of the hundreds of species of sage, only a handful are used in cooking. Culinary varieties include golden garden sage, dwarf garden sage, and the sweet pineapple sage.\nRegional Traditions :European *\nHow to Grow Sage\nCur moriatur homo cui Salvia crescit in horto? “ Why should a man die whilst Sage grows in his garden?”There are over 900 salvia species, about 80 or so are cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes.

Sage was a sacred ceremonial herb of the Romans and was associated with immortality, and was also said to increase mental capacity. The Greek Theophrastus classified sage as a \"coronary herbe\", because it flushed disease from the body, easing any undue strain on the heart. In the middle ages, people drank sage tea to treat colds, fevers, liver trouble, epilepsy, memory loss and many other common ailments. Sage was held to be a major medical herb by the French, because of it's anti-bacterial properties.\nSage has also been used as a beauty aid. Early Greeks drank, applied or bathed in sage tea. Turkish women used sage as a natural hair dye for gray hair, and it still recommended for use in dark hair.\nThe early colonists considered sage almost as essential a spice as salt and pepper, and its use in the culinary arts of Thanksgiving have become an American tradition. Sage tea was a valuable remedy for colds, fevers in the harsh New England winters. John Josselyn noted sage in his diaries noted it in New England.

{"question":"What recent developments have improved platinum-based catalyst efficiency while reducing costs in both industrial applications?","answer":"Recent developments include Johnson Matthey's Advanced Coating Technology (ACT), which creates a thin platinum layer on gauze surfaces, improving activation and reducing light-off time by 45%. Additionally, they developed Eco-Cat systems that reduce installed platinum group metal weight by 40-50% while maintaining efficiency. Meanwhile, researchers developed alternative catalysts using cobalt, which is 900 times cheaper than rhodium, combined with platinum. The cobalt-platinum catalysts, particularly those with 2% cobalt content, effectively break N-O bonds and convert nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water vapor, providing a more cost-effective solution.","context":["Johnson Matthey Technol. Rev., 2017, 61, (3), 183\nOne Hundred Years of Gauze Innovation\nPlatinum gauzes for nitric acid manufacture celebrate a centenary\nIn the century since the first platinum gauze for nitric acid production was made by Johnson Matthey, the demand for nitric acid has increased considerably with its vast number of applications: from fertiliser production to mining explosives and gold extraction. Throughout the significant changes in the industry over the past 100 years, there has been continual development in Johnson Matthey’s gauze technology to meet the changing needs of customers: improving efficiency, increasing campaign length, reducing metal losses and reducing harmful nitrous oxide emissions. This article reviews the progress in gauze development over the past century and looks at recent developments.\nJohnson Matthey Plc recently celebrated a centenary since making its first platinum gauze pack (Figure 1), sold to the UK Munitions Invention Department in October 1916 for £25 to make nitric acid for explosives during the First World War. The two 4″ × 6″ (approximately 101 × 152 mm) woven gauzes were made with 0.065 mm diameter wire, woven in a square mesh with 80 meshes per linear inch.\nIn the 1930s small amounts of rhodium began to be included in the gauzes to prevent losses of platinum while increasing the strength and conversion efficiency.\nPalladium catchment gauzes were introduced in the 1960s for platinum recovery, offering economic benefits. These were initially palladium-gold, but as the price of gold increased it was replaced by nickel.\n1996 saw the invention of knitted gauzes (Figures 2 to 4), which allowed a diverse range of structures and alloys to be used in the gauze packs, giving a better metal distribution and contact area. This considerably improved conversion efficiency and overall plant performance while also reducing manufacturing time compared to woven gauzes. This technology, pioneered by Johnson Matthey, became the industry standard.\nA few years later gauze packs were developed with Johnson Matthey’s proprietary Advanced Coating Technology (ACTTM), reducing the time required to reach maximum production. Later in 2006 the company partnered with Yara International ASA, Norway, to supply its abatement catalyst to minimise harmful nitrous oxide emissions released during nitric acid production.\nIn the same year, the catalyst and catchment were combined for the first time through Eco-CatTM systems. This combines platinum group metal (pgm) with complex ternary alloys and knit structures. Compared to conventional gauze alloys, it uses palladium in a controlled manner to replace some of the platinum, exploiting its metal recovery properties to catch platinum that is lost from the gauze during ammonia oxidation. This system has shown an increased performance compared to standard catalyst packs, and (subject to plant operating parameters) offers nitric acid manufacturers benefits including: extended campaign lengths by 50–100%; maintained or improved average conversion efficiency; a reduction in installed pgm weight by 40–50%; a reduction in installed platinum weight by 30–40%; reduced metal losses by approximately 30–50%; and reduced nitrous oxide emissions.\nThe improved performance of Eco-CatTM technology compared to standard gauze packs is demonstrated in Table I, showing the increase in campaign length and nitric acid production when using an Eco-CatTM system in a medium pressure plant.\nCase Study: Reducing the Cost of Nitric Acid Production\nRecently, Johnson Matthey worked with one customer to create a tailored Eco-CatTM system to solve its three main requirements: increasing average conversion efficiency, reducing the installed pgm content of the gauze packs and reducing metal losses. A progressive approach was taken to customising the gauze pack for the customer’s specific plant conditions using in-depth analytical data.\nDetailed examination of gauze samples from the first installed Eco-CatTM system uncovered an operational issue related to the plant design that was impacting the gas flow over the catalyst. Upon measuring the relative gas flow variations in the burner, it was found to be higher in certain areas. This was causing faster depletion of the gauze in these regions and therefore resulting in more platinum movement, while also adversely affecting the ammonia conversion efficiency.\nThe solution drew upon a vast range of gauze structures and their mechanical properties, addressing the regional flow issues in the burner while also considering one of the customer’s key requirements of reducing the installed pgm content. As a result, the customer noticed an improvement in the conversion efficiency.\nAnalysis from previous campaigns along with the producer’s data allowed the design of the catalyst to be improved through tailored wire diameters and knit structures. This optimised the reaction zone while also further reducing the installed pgm content.\nFaster Light Off\nA key goal for most nitric acid producers is to reduce the time required to reach peak conversion efficiency. In-house laboratory research into how peak efficiency is reached has found that platinum is volatilised during normal operation and forms cauliflower-like structures on the wire, which increases catalytic surface area. ACTTM allows a thin layer of platinum to be sprayed onto the surface of selected gauze layers to improve the gauze pack’s activation, resulting in faster light-off (Figure 8).\nThis technology has been shown to improve the early performance of the gauze packs in several plants when used in the top layers, but Johnson Matthey has recently been investigating how ACTTM coatings can further improve light-off and conversion efficiency.\nUsing the company’s in-house ammonia oxidation facilities, data on light-off, selectivity and long-term performance have been analysed to improve the design of the gauze pack. Initial trials of ACTTM coated gauzes in two different knit structures (Nitro-LokTM gauze and Hi-LokTM gauze) both showed a 45% reduction in light-off temperature compared to the uncoated gauze (Figure 9).\nFundamental to the design improvement is understanding how the gauze changes with time. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown the ACTTM coating forming a series of discrete islands on the gauze, each of which locally increases the surface area and becomes a focus point for light-off (Figure 10). Inspection of the samples from the trials has also shown the ACTTM coating restructuring (Figure 11) much earlier than expected; a change to the ACTTM coating placement or weight has the potential to make a significant improvement on the time taken to reach peak conversion efficiency.\nThis increased understanding of the mechanisms behind the coating and how this reduces the time to reach peak conversion efficiency has exciting implications for nitric acid plants, allowing the position and weight of the ACTTM coating to be tailored to minimise costs for producers.\nAlong with catalyst, catchment and abatement solutions that Johnson Matthey supplies to the nitric acid industry, complex models of the reaction system can be provided using its fundamental chemical and physical properties alongside proprietary data. Through this knowledge and modelling of the burner, more information can be found on the selectivity of ammonia conversion, in particular the extent and type of reaction.\nThe complex model of the burner has been built from extensive experience of gauze design along with known process conditions using spent gauze analysis, test rig data and historical plant data. This provides an in-depth understanding of how gauzes change over time and how this impacts the overall conversion efficiency. It can also help to identify where efficiency losses may be occurring; once this is found different sensitivities can be investigated to optimise the process, resulting in maximum plant conversion efficiency. Compared to a process model that is theoretically derived, this model provides more accurate and valid data through the dynamic kinetic model of the burner.\nThe detailed kinetic model allows predictions to be made for the optimal knit structures and alloy compositions for a campaign, for example looking at the gauze restructuring which is closely linked to the catalyst performance, where an increase in active surface area can improve the conversion efficiency. The model can also relate specific plant conditions to metal losses, which can reduce costs for the producer and again improve conversion efficiency of the burner. Any findings from the model can then be compared to experimental observations from gauze analysis.\nThis robust gauze model overcomes difficulties producers have historically faced in directly measuring conversion efficiency and selectivity, where high gas temperatures and testing conditions of the sampling point make it challenging to obtain a representative gas sample over the gauzes. This makes it an extremely useful tool in optimising the overall plant operation.\n100 years after making the first gauze catalyst, Johnson Matthey now offers a full service package for nitric acid manufacturers: catalyst, catchment, N2O abatement and containment engineering, technical analysis, plant cleaning to recover metal through a partnership with R S Bruce Metals and Machinery Ltd, UK, and process simulation through a partnership with ProSim SA, France.

A research group at Lehigh University led by Charles Lyman, professor of materials science and engineering, has developed catalysts that convert the harmful nitrogen oxides emitted from coal- and gas-fired power plants to nitrogen and water vapor.\nUnlike other methods of converting nitrogen oxides (NOx), the low-cost nanoparticle-based catalysts developed by Lyman’s group do not use ammonia.\nNOx is a generic term for nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The oxides, which are responsible for smog and acid rain, are produced when nitrogen and oxygen react in the air during combustion, especially at high temperatures.\nThe use of catalysts for pollution control in power plants is not new. A technique called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) can convert 95 percent of NOx to nitrogen and water—but with a catch.\n“Conventional SCR requires another toxic gas, ammonia, to carry out the reduction,” says Rick Herman, a senior research scientist who works with Lyman. “In addition, these catalysts only perform well at high temperatures.”\nFinding the best preparation technique\nLyman and Herman sought first to improve the performance of a platinum-rhodium nanoparticle-based catalyst that uses hydrogen, rather than ammonia, as a reducing agent. This catalyst works at much lower temperatures.\n“Choosing the correct catalyst preparation procedure was critical to ensuring that all these criteria were met,” says Paul Dimick, a Ph.D. candidate in chemical engineering working with Lyman.\nTo obtain the desired microstructure, researchers sequentially impregnated an alumina support with aqueous solutions of platinum and rhodium chlorides. Then they applied a series of thermal treatments to convert the metal chlorides into active bimetallic nanoparticles.\n“This procedure was chosen so that the desired microstructure would be achieved under reaction conditions,” says Dimick.\nWhen the researchers examined the prepared catalysts with Lehigh’s high-resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, they found nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2 nanometers (nm) well-dispersed on the alumina support. One nm is one billionth of a meter.\nIn-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the N-O chemical bond in a catalyst containing 5-percent rhodium was broken as soon as the molecule made contact with the nanoparticle. In a catalyst of 10-percent rhodium, however, the NO molecules tended to adhere to clusters of rhodium atoms present on the surface, which could potentially inhibit the desired reaction. Catalyst performance data also showed that the catalyst containing only 5-percent rhodium exhibited a much higher activity.\nCobalt’s low-cost advantage\nRhodium, however, is rare and expensive. It now trades at around $2,400 per troy ounce after exceeding $10,000 in 2008. To reduce NOx emissions more cheaply, the researchers turned to cobalt, which is 900 times less expensive than rhodium.\n“Cobalt is also capable of breaking the N-O bond,” says Lyman. “It forms a solid solution with platinum at low concentrations and finds its way to the surface of a nanoparticle under reaction conditions.”\nThe preparation of cobalt-platinum catalysts is almost identical to that of rhodium-platinum. The researchers merely substituted metal nitrates for chlorides.\nWhile all catalysts containing less than 5-percent cobalt were found to be capable of reducing NOx to nitrogen and water vapor, the 2-percent cobalt catalyst performed best. “In-situ FTIR spectroscopy revealed that the 2-percent catalyst was the only one capable of immediately breaking the N-O bond,” says Dimick.\nThe same methodology has now been applied to a nickel-platinum catalyst system with equally promising results."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5e886304-f81f-4bf2-a375-fe20e34c8fc5>","<urn:uuid:0a9fe3e7-71ea-4d8c-934a-7ab0e7fd1c06>"],"error":null}

Iron salts, while increasing ethanol selectivity, significantly reduce the activity of the rhodium catalyst, resulting in space-time-yields about 4 times lower than iron-free rhodium catalysts. In contrast, zirconium as a cocatalyst substantially improves both ethanol selectivity and space-time-yield, achieving 343 g/l of ethanol compared to only 31 g/l with the basic rhodium catalyst. This aligns with Le Chatelier's Principle, which states that when a system at equilibrium experiences a change, it will shift to counteract that change to establish a new equilibrium.","context":["Send the link below via email or IMCopy\nPresent to your audienceStart remote presentation\n- Invited audience members will follow you as you navigate and present\n- People invited to a presentation do not need a Prezi account\n- This link expires 10 minutes after you close the presentation\n- A maximum of 30 users can follow your presentation\n- Learn more about this feature in our knowledge base article\nLe Chatelier's Principle\nTranscript of Le Chatelier's Principle\nFor example: CO + 2 H2 <=> CH3OH\nSuppose we were to increase the concentration of CO in the system.

When the reaction is exothermic (H is negative), we include heat as a product, and, when the reaction is endothermic (H is positive), we include it as a reactant. An increase in pressure causes the reaction to shift to the side with fewer moles of gas and a decrease in pressure causes the reaction to shift to the side with more moles of gas. There is no effect on a reaction where the number of moles of gas is the same on each side of the chemical equation.\nThe number of moles of gas on the left and right side of a reaction should be noted.\nFor example: N2 + 3 H2 <=> 2 NH3 H = -92kJ mol-1\n4 moles:2 moles\nEquipment Method Control Measure and record the quantitative data required for the calculations to determine the volume of gas released at 25oC and 100kPa.

Some reactions are reversible.\nThis means that in a forward reaction, the reactants form products.\nHowever the reverse reaction may occur causing the products to form the reactants again. Reversible Reactions Reversible reactions are shown with arrows going in both directions as shown above. Equilibrium Systems In an equilibrium system, two reactions take place at the same time in both directions.Equilibrium occurs when the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the reverse reaction. Equilibrium Disturbance If a system's equilibrium is disturbed, the equilibrium system will shift and the system will eventually return to a new equilibrium.

In each test the reactor is charged with 100 ml of the catalysts defined below. After flushing the apparatus with nitrogen, first a pressure of 100 bar is obtained with a synthesis gas consisting of 49% by volume of CO, 49% by volume of H.sub.2, 1% by volume of CO.sub.2, 1% by volume of N.sub.2 and minor amounts of other components and the reactor is heated to 275 heating and during the course of the test 450 normal liters of synthesis gas having the aforesaid compositions are added to the cycle gas over the suction side of the compressor and the mixture is passed over the catalyst. The gas mixture leaving the reactor is cooled to about +5 fractions are collected in the receiver. After the addition of fresh synthesis gas, the non condensed residual gas is returned to the reactor via the compressor. To maintain the pressure and to remove by-products part of the residual gas is branched of as exhaust gas via a pressure regulating valve. All catalysts defined below are tested by this method. The table below indicates the duration of the tests, the space-time-yields of oxygen-containing C.sub.2 -compounds per liter of catalyst and hour as well as the selectivities for ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid (in mol % of CO, calculated on reacted CO).

However, addition of iron salts reduces the activity of the rhodium catalyst considerably. According to Table 1 of DE-AS No. 2,503,204 the space-time-yields with iron-containing rhodium catalysts are about 4 times lower than that of an iron-free rhodium catalyst used for comparison. With regard to the economy of a process such a decrease in the yield with regard to the formation of oxygen-containing C.sub.2 -compounds is extremely unsatisfactory.\nFrom U.S. Pat. No. 4,096,164 it is known that the selectivity with respect to the formation of alcohols can be generally increased by adding molybdenum or tungsten to rhodium-containing catalysts. However, use of these two cocatalysts does not result in a substantially increased formation of ethanol since larger amounts of methanol, propanol and butanol are formed.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to improve the ethanol selectivity of rhodium catalysts, by minimizing the formation of other compounds such as methanol, propanol and butanol without realizing a decrease in the space-time-yield of ethanol.\nIt has now been found that the ethanol selectivity and space-time-yield of ethanol can be substantially improved by using rhodium catalysts additionally containing, applied onto a carrier, at least one of the elements zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, platinum, chromium and mercury.\nThe present invention thus provides a process for the manufacture of ethanol by reaction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen in the presence of a supported rhodium catalyst, which comprises using as cocatalyst at least one of the elements zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, platinum, chromium and mercury.\nThe discovery that the composition of the reaction product can be shifted by the use of the aforesaid elements in favor of ethanol with a simultaneous increase in the space-time-yield is surprising.\nIn addition to ethanol, which is formed with a high selectivity in the process of the invention, smaller amounts of other oxygen-containing C.sub.2 -compounds are formed, such as acetaldehyde and acetic acid and other products which can be formed from these compounds in a secondary reaction, for example by esterification, acetalization or condensation. Compounds of the latter type are, inter alia, ethyl acetate and the diethyl acetal of acetaldehyde. The proportion of other oxygen-containing compounds having three or more carbon atoms in the molecule is very low and generally it is below 5 mol %, calculated on reacted carbon monoxide. The total selectivity for oxygen-containing C.sub.2 -compounds, including the products converted into ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde diethyl acetal, is up to 81%, calculated on the reacted carbon monoxide. The remainder of the carbon monoxide is converted into the aforesaid products having 3 and more carbon atoms and in addition essentially into methane and other gaseous hydrocarbons and a small proportion of carbon dioxide.\nFor synthesis of the catalyst used in the process of the present invention, salts or complex compounds of rhodium can be used, for example chlorides, bromides and iodides as well as double salts of rhodium with alkali metal halides, for example dipotassium-trichlororhodate. There are also suitable complex compounds containing, besides rhodium and halogen, complex-forming ligands, such as trialkyl-phosphines, triaryl-phosphines, ethylene diamine, pyridine, carbon monoxide, olefins or water. Compounds of this type are, for example, tristriphenylphosphine-rhodium-I-chloride, -bromide- or iodide, tristriphenylphosphine-rhodium-III-chloride, dichloro-bisethylene-diamine-rhodium-I-chloride, trisethylenediamine-rhodium-III-chloride, bis-tri-o-tolyl-phosphine-rhodium-II-chloride, carbonyl-bistriphenylphosphine-rhodium-I-bromide or dicesiumcarbonyl-pentachlororhodate-III. In addition, compounds of rhodium can be used in which they are bound to a carrier by ion or complex bonds, such as zeolites and ion exchangers which have been exchanged with rhodium halides.\nAs a cocatalyst in the process of the invention there is used at least one of the elements zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, platinum, chromium and mercury applied onto the carrier in the form of their salts or complex compounds. Zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, chromium or mercury are preferred and more preferably hafnium, chromium or mercury are used. The elements can be used in the form of simple inorganic or organic salts, for example the chlorides, bromides, nitrates, formates, acetates, preferably, however, the chlorides. The oxides, hydroxides or carbonates can also be used, provided that they are converted into the aforesaid salts by a treatment with mineral acids or carboxylic acids. Especially suitable complex compounds are chloro-complexes of rhodium of the formula M.sub.m [RhCl.sub.6 ].sub.n in which M denotes the element of the cocatalyst, in the case of chromium, for example, the complex Cr[RhC1.sub.6 ].2H.sub.2 O, which can be obtained by reacting chromium chloride with rhodium chloride at 100\nComplexes of the aforesaid type can be applied onto the carrier by impregnation. Because of the poor solubility of some complexes it is often advantageous to impregnate the carrier with a solution of rhodium-III-chloride and one or several chlorides of the elements named as cocatalysts in acetic acid and subsequently to heat the treated carrier to a temperature of 100 pores. Alternatively, the element acting as cocatalyst can be applied to the carrier first or it can be incorporated into a skeleton substance, for example a carrier material containing a silicate or aluminum oxide, for example silicic acid, aluminum oxide or aluminum silicate. A further advantageous method consists in binding the cations of the elements acting as cocatalysts by means of ion exchange to a cation exchanger which can also be used as carrier for the rhodium and which is stable under the reaction conditions, for example natural or synthetic aluminum silicates known as molecular sieves. Suitable catalysts can also be obtained when the carrier is impregnated in the reverse order of succession, i.e. first with a rhodium compound and then with the respective cocatalyst. The catalyst efficiency with an unchanged high selectivity for ethanol can be further improved by adding other promoters, especially magnesium.\nSuitable catalyst carriers are the usual carrier materials having different specific surfaces. Carriers having a specific surface in the range of from 50 to 1,000 m.sup.2 /g are preferred. Suitable materials are, for example, silicic acid, natural or synthetic silicates of elements of groups II to VIII of the Periodic Table (that is, for example, the silicates of magnesium, calcium, aluminum, manganese), furthermore aluminum dioxide, thorium dioxide, zeolites and spinels. Silicic acid and silicates are preferred.\nFor the manufacture of the catalysts the carrier material is impregnated with the active components either simultaneously or successively. When rhodium-III-salts are used, a subsequent treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide or methanol proved advantageous. This reduction can be carried out in a separate apparatus or in the reactor itself. In general, the temperatures applied in the reduction are below 300 275 not with the undiluted reducing gases but with a gas mixture additionally containing an inert gas, for example nitrogen, carbon dioxide or a noble gas.\nIt is likewise possible to produce the carrier material in the presence of the active components, for example by concomitant precipitation of the active components with silicates.\nThe concentration of rhodium and cocatalyst in the catalysts can vary within wide limits. In general, a catalyst contains 0.1 to 20% by weight of rhodium and 0.1 to 25% by weight of cocatalyst, preferably 1.0 to 10% by weight of rhodium and 0.1 to 20% by weight of cocatalyst.\nTo carry out the process of the invention a gas mixture wholly or substantially consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and possibly containing other components such as nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, or methane is passed over the catalyst. The molar proportion of carbon monoxide to hydrogen can be varied in wide limits. Molar proportions of from 5:1 to 1:5 and especially 3:1 to 1:3 are preferred. In general, the reaction temperatures are in the range of from 175 375 reaction pressure ranges from 1 to 300 bar, preferably 20 to 200 bar.\nTemperature and pressure should be adjusted in such a manner that a high selectivity for the oxygen-containing compounds is ensured while the exothermal formation of methane which is favored by elevated temperatures is kept low. Therefore, high pressures and low temperatures will be preferred. The conversion of carbon monoxide should not exceed 50%, in general, since a higher conversion may readily lead to the formation of an increased amount of byproducts consisting not only of methane, carbon dioxide and gaseous hydrocarbons but also of liquid hydrocarbons of higher molecular weight and oxygen-containing products.\nThe process is preferably carried out in the gaseous phase. Conventional fixed bed reactors can be used in which, for a satisfactory dissipation of heat, the catalyst is used in thin layers. Reactors with moved catalyst bed or fluidized bed reactors can also be used.\nAlternatively, the reaction of synthesis gas can be carried out in the presence of a suspension of the solid and finely dispersed catalyst in inert media and/or reaction products.\nAccording to an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out in the gaseous phase in an apparatus with gas circulation from which, after separation of the condensible reaction products, the unreacted gas mixture is recycled into the reactor.\nThis mode of operation is particularly economic. Due to the fact that the fresh gas is diluted with the recycled residual gas having a lower hydrogen content, higher reaction temperatures can be used so that higher space-time-yields are obtained with an unchanged selectivity. As apparatus with gas circulation those with internal or external gas cycle can be used.\nThis is a continuation, of application Ser.

{"question":"Can you explain how hydrangeas perform in different light conditions, and what are the specific pruning requirements for the paniculata variety?","answer":"Hydrangeas can thrive in light shade, receiving about four to six hours of direct sunlight daily. In light shade conditions, varieties like Hydrangea macrophylla 'Blaumeise' produce huge blue violet flowers, while 'Amethyst' displays clusters of pale pink to pale purple flowers. For Hydrangea paniculata specifically, it requires as much light as possible during early spring, though some afternoon shade is beneficial during hot summers to prevent burning. Morning sunlight is encouraged. Regarding pruning, Hydrangea paniculata should be pruned in summer and fall after leaf sprouting. Dead or sickly branches should be removed immediately, and deadheading can be done at any time to maintain appearance and encourage new blooms. Notably, Hydrangea paniculata is unique as it's the only hydrangea variety that can be pruned into a tree shape.","context":["Shade is a shifty character, with a number of elusive and subjective descriptors, most commonly: light, partial, full, dappled, open, and deep. But what do these terms really mean? Every gardener is likely to contend with a range of distinct light levels found around the garden—whether beneath a heavy tree canopy or in an open area on the north side of the house. A regional perspective matters a good deal: what one gardener might view as full sun in the Pacific Northwest could be considered partial shade in Southern California. This year, Great Plant Picks tackles the question of plants that thrive in shade in our region, as experienced by gardeners in the Northwest, with the 2012 theme: Made in the Shade.\nGreat Plant Picks (GPP) is an educational program administered by the Elisabeth C Miller Botanical Garden in Seattle. GPP is developing a comprehensive palette of outstanding plants for the maritime Pacific Northwest landscape. The program depends upon the expertise of professional horticulturists from botanic gardens and nurseries and the experience of designers in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia to select plants that are best suited for that area. There are now over 850 GPP selections, many of which will thrive in some degree of shade.\nMany plants have adapted to various levels of shade; a few grow best under only one type of shade, but others thrive under various degrees of light. To help sort it all out, the GPP team has established concise definitions for the various degrees of shade and an assortment of plants that will thrive in each of those conditions.\nLight shade offers conditions for the broadest range of plants to thrive. These areas receive about four to six hours of direct sunlight every day. This light intensity allows for many shade-tolerant plants to flower at their peak, including exceptional cultivars of woody plants such as witch hazel (Hamamelis), Hydrangea, mountain laurel (Kalmia), Magnolia, Pieris, Rhododendron, and Stewartia, and herbaceous perennials like barrenwort (Epimedium), Helleborus, Primula, and Trillium. The witch hazels, for instance, are cherished for their exquisitely fragrant, spidery flowers that appear during winter. One vigorous witch hazel selection, H. xintermedia ‘Arnold Promise’, has large, clear yellow flowers and reddish centers and is a particularly prolific bloomer.\nThe popularity phenomenon of hybrid hellebores (Helleborus xhybridus) expands each year in the Pacific Northwest, and it is easy to see why. This charismatic, winter-blooming perennial features nodding blossoms of pure white, glowing yellow, pink, rose, black purple, or bright apple green, bringing cheer to gray, rainy days and lifting the spirits of many gardeners throughout the region.\nA number of hydrangeas are perfect for light shade and provide a floral focal point in the summer landscape. The lovely Swiss lacecap cultivar Hydrangea macrophylla ‘Blaumeise’ is laden with huge blue violet flowers, while H. macrophylla ‘Amethyst’ is an excellent, classic mophead hydrangea, with clusters of pale pink to pale purple flowers. The old cultivar H. macrophylla ‘Mariesii’ is one of the best lacecap types, with a profusion of delicate and graceful, pale lavender blue florets surrounding a center of small lacey flowers of a deeper lavender purple.\nOpen shade and light shade are often thought to be interchangeable designations, but there are distinct differences between them. An area of open shade is fully exposed to the sky but with little or no direct sunlight. This usually occurs when a structure or building blocks any sunlight, but there is no foliage canopy above to block the sun. This is one of the best locations to grow plants with golden foliage; their leaves remain richly colored, with no risk of burning from intense sunlight. Golden full moon maple (Acer shirasawanum ‘Aureum’) is a first-rate and highly sought-after small tree with golden foliage. In mid-spring, the buds open to reveal intense, bright lemon yellow leaves. This glowing display is dazzling during the typically gray days of spring. As the leaves mature, their color softens to chartreuse in early summer.\nHostas (Hosta) thrive in open shade, with robust leafy growth and plentiful late-summer blooms. A number of cultivars have been selected for 2012, including an assortment of sizes and leaf colors. On the smaller side is ‘Red October’—quite distinctive with its red petioles supporting blue green leaves. ‘Halcyon’ and ‘Blue Angel’, with strikingly blue leaves, reach two feet and three feet tall, respectively. Three selections sport leaves with white margins and green centers, all medium in size: ‘Francee’, ‘Minuteman’, and ‘Patriot’. In the same size category, but with the leaf coloration reversed, is ‘Loyalist’.\nGardening under conifers is a way of life in the Northwest. One of the best woodland shade conditions is dappled light, where the ground plane receives about two to three hours of sunlight filtered through the branches of the canopy above. When you look up into the canopy, between one-quarter and one-third of the sky remains visible through the foliage. Although many woodland favorites, such as rhododendrons, grow well here, their flowering is reduced due to the limited amount of sunlight reaching them. Consequently, foliage and good design play a significant role in creating a beautiful woodland garden.\nConifers are often limbed up, resulting in the need for a lower canopy of medium and small trees to add interest and establish a human scale in the landscape. Maples can be a great choice for this purpose: Acer triflorum offers interesting rough bark and great fall color, even in the shade; A. tegmentosum ‘Joe Witt’ brightens the area with brilliant green bark heavily striped with chalky white. For flowers and fruit in such situations, the beautifully layered branches of Cornus kousa var. chinensis ‘Milky Way’ are covered with starry white flowers in early summer and dangling red, strawberry-like fruits in early fall.\nFerns grow exceedingly well in dappled shade. One of the most sought-after in recent years is Himalayan maidenhair fern (Adiantum venustum), a gentle groundcover that spreads slowly. Its delicate fronds have an airy appearance; perhaps most enchanting is the manner in which the small fronds unfurl in late winter, with a warm, bronze blush that matures to a fresh spring green. Japanese painted fern (Athyrium niponicum var. pictum) brightens up dappled corners with its dramatic foliage: a range of silvers and reds are overlaid on the green fronds, making each leaf a work of art, according to GPP selection committee member Maurice Horn, of Joy Creek Nursery.\nIt is difficult to separate deep shade from the dry conditions that often accompany it. This type of shade is usually the result of an almost impenetrable overhead canopy of trees, permitting less than one-quarter of the sky to be visible; little or no direct sunlight reaches the ground. Such a dense canopy of trees will naturally have a dense root system that competes for any moisture in the soil. Few plants grow well in this situation, but there are several GPP recommendations that are tough enough to survive. Foliage rules here rather than flowers, so it is best to focus on plants with appealing leaves or a striking form.\nSeveral native plants are well equipped to thrive in dry shade. Cascade Oregon grape (Mahonia nervosa) is a low, loose groundcover with pinnately compound, emerald-green leaves, the leaflets being spiny, coarse, and evergreen. Our western wild ginger (Asarum caudatum) is an understory plant with bold, heart-shaped leaves that are fully evergreen and release a spicy, ginger-and-citrus fragrance when crushed. Its European counterpart (A. europaeum) has distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that are also evergreen and a glossy dark green. The flowers of both are distinctive; watch for them peeking out from among the leaves in late winter.\nFor some height, add the reliable Japanese aralia (Fatsia japonica), with shiny, evergreen, palmate leaves on shrubs that will reach five feet or more in height, even in deep shade. The lobed leaves can reach sixteen inches across and provide valuable textural contrast in the shade garden. If you like something a little weird, try the curious XFatshedera lizei ‘Anne-mieke’, a rare hybrid between Japanese aralia and English ivy (Hedera helix). This vine-like shrub adds a subdued, golden yellow color to the deep shade garden, with glossy, dark green, eight-inch-wide leaves that are splashed with two-toned gold in the center. When happy, it can produce small clusters of white flowers in the fall, but don’t worry about unwanted seedlings, as it is completely sterile.\nAll of these plants and more can be found on the Great Plant Picks website: www.greatplantpicks.org. The website has recently been completely revised and will be launched in time for the Northwest Flower and Garden Show, in February 2012. New features have been added to help gardeners find useful lists of plants for difficult situations like shade; gardeners will also be able to create their own unique lists of plants for their specific cultural conditions and landscape needs.\nGreat Plant Picks for Made in the Shade\n*new for 2012\nAcer griseum (2-9, 14-21)\nAcer palmatum ‘Katsura’ (2-10, 12, 14-24)\nAster divaricatus (now Symphyotrichum divaricatus) (1-10, 14-21)\n—white wood aster\nAthyrium filix-femina ‘Frizelliae’ (1-9, 14-24)\nAthyrium ‘Ghost’ (1-9, 14-24)\nCampanula lactiflora ‘Prichard’s Variety’ (1-9, 14-24)\nCampanula poscharskyana ‘Blue Waterfall’ (1-12, 14-24)\nCornus controversa ‘June Snow’ (4-9, 14, 18, 19)\nCorylopsis spicata (3b-7, 14-17)\nEnkianthus campanulatus ‘Red Bells’ (2-9, 14-21)\nEpimedium ‘Yubae’ (syn. ‘Rose Queen’) (2-9, 14-17)\nGentiana asclepiadea (2-6, 14-17)\nHamamelis xintermedia ‘Jelena’ (3-7, 15-17)\n—hybrid witch hazel\n*Hosta ‘Gold Standard’ (1-10, 14-21)\n*Hosta ‘Halcyon’ (1-10, 14-21)\n*Hosta ‘Praying Hands’ (1-10, 14-21)\n*Hosta sieboldiana var. elegans (1-10, 14-21)\nHydrangea anomala subsp. petiolaris (2-21)\nHydrangea macrophylla ‘Merritt’s Supreme’ (3b-9, 14-24)\nHydrangea paniculata ‘Tardiva’ (1-21)\nLeptinella squalida ‘Platt’s Black’\nMagnolia sieboldii (4-9, 14-24)\nOmphalodes verna (2-9, 14-21)\nPieris japonica ‘Sarabande’ (2b-9, 14-17)\n—pieris, lily-of-the-valley shrub\nPieris japonica ‘White Cascade’ (2b-9, 14-17)\n—pieris, lily-of-the-valley shrub\nPrimula ‘Guinevere’ (1-24)\nPrimula japonica (2-6, 15-17)\nPulmonaria ‘Benediction’ (1-9, 14-17)\nRhododendron ‘Blue Boy’\nRhododendron ‘Hachmann’s Charmant’\nRhododendron schlippenbachii (3-7, 14-17)\nSambucus nigra f. laciniata (2-7, 14-17)\n—cutleaf black elder\nStachyurus praecox (4-6, 14-17)\nStewartia pseudocamellia (4-6, 14-17, 20, 21)\nTrillium grandiflorum (1-6)\n—great white trillium, white wakerobin\nTrillium chloropetalum (4-9, 14-17)\nTrillium ovatum (2-7, 14-17)\nTsuga diversifolia (2-7, 17)\n—northern Japanese hemlock\n*Vancouveria hexandra (4-7, 14-17)\nAcer crataegifolium ‘Veitchii’ (3-6, 14-17)\n—variegated hawthorn maple\nActinidia kolomikta (male form) (1-9, 14-17)\n—variegated kiwi vine\nAsplenium trichomanes (2-6)\nAthyrium otophorum (3-9, 14-24)\n—eared lady fern\nBegonia grandis subsp. evansiana (3-24)\nCamellia williamsii ‘Donation’ (4-9, 12, 14-24)\nCarex oshimensis ‘Evergold’ (3-9, 14-24)\n—variegated Japanese sedge\nCephalotaxus harringtonia (4-9, 14-17)\n—cowtail pine, plum yew\nDaphne odora ‘Aureomarginata’ (4-10, 12, 14-24)\n—variegated winter daphne\nDarmera peltata ‘Nana’ (2-7, 14-20)\n—dwarf umbrella plant\nDicentra ‘Luxuriant’ (1-9, 14-24)\n—fringed bleeding heart\nDryopteris wallichiana (4-6, 14-17)\n—Wallich’s wood fern\n*Hakonechloa macra ‘Beni-kaze’ (2b-9, 14-24)\n—Japanese forest grass\nHelleborus foetidus (2b-9, 14-24)\n—spring vetch, spring bush pea\nOsmunda regalis ‘Purpurascens’ (1-9, 14-17)\n—purple-tinged royal fern\nRodgersia podophylla (2-9, 14-17)\nSanguinaria canadensis f. multiplex\n—miniature London pride\n—false Solomon’s seal\nAcer circinatum ‘Monroe’ (2b-6, 14-17)\n—cutleaf vine maple\nActaea racemosa (syn.

Because they are easy to maintain experienced gardeners and newcomers alike can add hydrangeas to their gardens. Of course there are many varieties of hydrangeas with a great deal of flexibility in terms of their flowers. The hydrangea paniculata, or panicle hydrangea, is a unique specimen for its beautiful panicle like blooms. Caring for them is easiest done by following this simple guide:\nHydrangea paniculata prefer pH levels between 5.8 and 6.2. It is recommended that you use moderate to high fertilization for this particular variety. The soil pH level will not influence the color of the flowers but you do need to make sure you have proper soil pH level so that you can avoid any type of iron deficiency in the foliage.\nIf you are going to grow your plants in pots and you want to move them at any point into their first set of pots or you want to move them from your garden into pots for the winter you can do so once they reach an appropriate size. If you want to move them to protect them from the open environment to make sure that you protect the stems and the roots while transferring them and be sure to move the plants into an area with good air circulation.\nThis particular hydrangea requires moderate to moist watering. You want to water the plants thoroughly without oversaturating them. It’s important to keep the soil consistently moist but never wet it too much for the duration of the growth cycle.\nThe hydrangea paniculata performs best when it is planted in porous, well-drained soil. If you are growing this type of shrub it’s recommended that you add compost to your soil mixture to help it with that water retention. You can also add pine bark to increase the weight and the stability of your mixture as it will help prevent the soil from compressing over time which will increase the longevity of your shrub. If you need to alter the pH level of the soil you can always add different nutrition in the form of fertilizer to your planting medium.\nDuring the beginning of Spring, this plant should be given as much light as possible throughout the day. It’s important that you properly space out your hydrangea paniculata such that they do not cover one another and prevent one another from acquiring the necessary sunlight. If you plant them too close together and they are not properly spaced, the plants will naturally try to stretch out and you’ll have to prune them more often. This is particularly problematic if you are trying to cultivate the plant as a form of natural wall or shrub.\nDuring the summer heat, it may be beneficial to provide a bit of light shading, especially in the afternoons. If you live in an area that has very hot summers be cognizant of this and make sure to plant in an area where your hydrangea will get afternoon shade. Morning sunlight is typically perfectly acceptable and in fact, encouraged for this type of shrub but in the afternoon too much direct sunlight can burn the plant.\nTrimming and pruning\nIf you want to create a more tightly bound plant appearance you can always prune and trim appropriately. It is best to prune the hydrangea in the summer and fall after the leaves have sprouted. If you notice that there are dead or otherwise sickly branches you can prune those off immediately so that they don’t continue to derive nutrients from the plant. With regard to the blooms, you can deadhead at any time. Deadheading is a process where you simply clip away the old blooms once they have reached maturity. This is something that helps to keep the appearance of the plant attractive while simultaneously helps to redistribute energy to forming new flowers throughout the season.\nIt is important that when you are growing these hydrangeas you provide for proper spacing and adequate air flow. It is always best to grow them in an open environment. you can help to control the height and the strength of the stems by leaving adequate space and when you do go to prune the plant annually, make sure you remove any branches that might be rubbing across one another so that you can help strengthen the overall plant and prevent them from damaging one another.\nPests and diseases\nWhen you are a growing hydrangea paniculata, aphids and spider mites are the most prevalent of insects you will see. You should keep your eyes peeled for these pests in April and May and be sure to spray preventatively during those two months to prevent an outbreak in June or July. The middle of summer is when spider mites grow actively so it is best to take preventative measures. The problem with pests like aphids is that once they are on your plant or shrub you have to be sure you destroy every single one throughout the entire plant otherwise they will come back in full force.\nFun fact: Hydrangea paniculata is the only form of hydrangea that you can prune into the shape of a tree."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8b8f2c11-b977-4086-9fdb-3db39ca88a4a>","<urn:uuid:6dc429c3-9ed9-4669-8ab2-d2f6d9342456>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do adverse weather conditions affect SAR trackers compared to Coast Guard helicopter crews when conducting rescue operations? Can you explain the specific challenges each face?","answer":"SAR trackers and Coast Guard helicopter crews both face distinct weather-related challenges. For SAR trackers, heavy or long-lasting rains are their primary natural enemy as they can obliterate tracks and signs. However, trackers can work effectively in most other weather conditions. For Coast Guard helicopter crews, icy conditions (14-35 degrees Fahrenheit with visible moisture) pose significant challenges. They must deal with ice buildup on rotor blades, limited visibility, and low flight ceilings. Their operations require precise visual navigation, and they must carefully manage fuel consumption when using anti-ice systems and heaters. While helicopters have specialized equipment like blade deicing systems to combat these conditions, they may be grounded if visibility drops below one mile or ceiling drops below 300-400 feet.","context":["Who We Are\nWe are Search And Rescue (SAR) volunteers who have additional training focused on tracking. Tracking requires many hours of practice and a detail-oriented personality. The identification of “sign” often means crawling on the ground inspecting the dirt, plants and stones that may have been disturbed by the passage of the search subject. SAR Trackers are trained in search techniques as well as mantracking. They often are members of SAR units that have simply taken on a specialty just as other members have become dog handlers or members of a technical climbing team.\nThe use of tracking in Search And Rescue has gained popularity in the past few years for several reasons. One of those reasons is because mantracking has proven to be a valuable resource that may help shorten the search. Another reason is the increased availability of tracking certifications and training, thus making trained mantrackers more available as a resource.\nSearch Managers can make use of mantrackers to identify the Direction of Travel and narrow the search area significantly. In some cases, mantrackers can follow a subject through areas or in conditions that search dogs cannot. These are examples of why the use of tracking in SAR is valuable.\nNot all conditions allow for fast and efficient tracking, just as not every search can be concluded quickly by bringing in a helicopter. For example if the weather is bad, a helicopter often cannot fly. Conditions affect all SAR resources: dogs, air support, ground personnel and technical climbing teams. This is why it is important for a SAR unit to have as many different resources available as possible. The SAR Manager can utilize the resource that fits the conditions and situation. Fortunately, trackers can work in most weather conditions – heavy or long-lasting rains are the only natural enemies of the SAR tracker.\nSince many SAR trackers are also trained in search techniques there is an added bonus: even if the conditions are not good for tracking, the mantracker is still a resource for the SAR Manager as a searcher. It is also a good idea for all SAR personnel to obtain at least an awareness of tracking. Searchers may come across tracks at anytime during a search and unless they can recognize the significance of those tracks and protect them from being destroyed, the tracks cannot become another clue that aids in the successful outcome of the search. The ‘tracking aware’ searcher can alert the SAR Manager of the tracks found, and a more experienced mantracker can examine the ‘sign’ to determine how significant it is and perhaps find more clues that will help in the overall effort.\nSAR trackers can be an asset to any SAR team; and mantracking is another skill that can be used to increase the chances of success on many searches.\nWhat We Do\nIdeally, an experienced mantracker will be called to the Last Known Point of the missing person as soon as possible – before any of the existing “sign” is disturbed or obliterated. This will allow the mantracker to collect detailed information about the footwear impressions left by the subject. This information is crucial for the mantracker and may mean the difference between successfully following a subject and going nowhere.\nAfter collecting and recording all of the available information from the scene, the tracker will begin following the sign to determine the direction of travel. Sometimes this means following the sign all the way to the lost person. Often the path indicates a general direction that was taken and other teams can move into the identified area and begin searching. If this is done by another tracking team it is called “sign-cutting”. This practice allows for a methodical approach to be taken in the fastest possible manner. If another tracking team is not available, then the area can be searched using normal search techniques. Either way, the search area is significantly reduced which increases the odds of finding the subject quickly.","Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Andrew Champagne sits in the open door of the MH-60 Jayhawk at Air Station Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Jan. 19, 2017. Champagne was in the middle of going through the flight mechanic syllabus checklist to become a fully qualified flight mechanic. U.S. COAST GUARD PHOTO BY PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS NICOLE J. GROLL Coast Guard paints picture of hazardous work February 15, 2017 on News, Waterfront By P.O. 3rd Class Nicole J. Groll Editor’s Note: Throughout the year, the Coast Guard sends its men and women out to assist mariners in hazardous situations. Some of that assistance comes by air. BOURNE, Mass. — Freezing rain? Teeth-chattering temperatures? Limited visibility? Coast Guard aircrews are still ready to fly. At Air Station Cape Cod, aviation maintenance and electronic technicians work around the clock to ensure the MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters are ready to launch. But there is one thing the maintenance crews and pilots cannot control — winter weather. “The weather here is worse than the two tours I did in Alaska, icy and bitter cold,” said P.O. 2nd Class Andrew “Sully” Sullivan, an aviation electronic technician who transferred to Cape Cod from Sitka, Alaska. “Icy weather conditions are considered 14 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit or below with visible moisture in the air,” said Lt. Tyler Dewechter, a Jayhawk helicopter pilot at Air Station Cape Cod. When the forecast calls for visible moisture, the risk of flying gets more challenging for the pilots and crew. Visible moisture can limit the pilots’ ability to fly as high as required in order to use the aircraft’s instruments. According to Dewechter, the difficulty with flying around Cape Cod is that these conditions often occur at all altitudes. The air base is landlocked and none of the runways extend into a body of water where there would be fewer obstacles in the flight path. “To safely fly, we need to have a 300- to 400-foot ceiling and at least a one mile visibility,” Dewechter said. According to Lt. Ben Wolhaupter, another Jayhawk pilot, a flight ceiling is when the sky is covered by at least 80 percent cloud coverage and is measured by the height of the layer of clouds above the ground. “For example, if one looks outside on a foggy day, the ground to the line of fog is called the ceiling,” Wolhaupter said. According to Dewechter, Cape Cod’s cold weather often requires precise visual navigation under very low ceilings and low visibility to safely navigate from the airfield to the scene of a search and rescue case. Depending on the weather, pilots can either rise above the moisture in the air or fly under it thanks to joint policies and procedures or the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration in order to fly during search and rescue cases in severe weather that would ground commercial aircraft. The Jayhawk is also the only search and rescue helicopter in the Coast Guard’s fleet from Maine to northern New Jersey able to deal with the icy weather because it is equipped with both engine anti-ice and blade deicing systems. Both anti-ice systems are spread out on the outside of the helicopter and around parts of the rotor blades, windshield and engines. Sullivan said the anti-ice detector for the engines is mounted on the starboard engine and provides information to the anti-icing system. The blade deicing system is in the rotor head and tail rotor and it activates only if enough ice has accumulated. “Ice buildup adds extra weight and changes the aerodynamics of the helicopter,” said P.O. 3rd Class Jeremy Reed, another aviation electronics technologist at the air base. Reed said wires run along the rotor blades and an electronic pulse is sent out when there is ice buildup, melting it and keeping the blades in working order. When the system is activated, the pulse hits two blades at a time to not upset the helicopter’s weight. “If all four blades are done at the same time, it could knock the helicopter out of the sky,” Sullivan said. A Jayhawk helicopter crew generally includes two pilots, a flight mechanic and an aviation survival technician. The flight mechanic is qualified on all the components of the helicopter necessary to keep it flying. During a normal flight, the side door remains closed, but during a rescue operation it is open so the flight mechanic can operate the hoist. In order to keep warm and battle the winds of the rotor blades, the flight mechanic wears multiple layers of clothing. “We know we are going to be cold and wet,” said Reed. “Between the rotor blades pushing heavy winds down on us to the sea spray being kicked up because of the winds from the blades, it is inevitable.” Flight mechanics may wear up to three layers under their aircrew dry coverall. This suit has rubber neck and wrist seals to keep the aviator warm and the water out. It doesn’t replace having the helicopter’s heater running though. “We are willing to sweat to make sure our aircrew stays warm,” Dewechter said. The pilots do not have to worry about the cold weather coming in from the open door during operations; they are protected in the cockpit. However, in addition to flying in the frigid conditions, pilots have to make sure there is enough fuel to return home when the anti-ice system or heat is flowing through the aircraft. “Under standard flying conditions the heat and anti-ice system cannot run at the same time,” Dewechter said. The pilots and crew must consider weight and fuel consumption. The weight of individuals in the helicopter consumes a set number of fuel gallons. Running the heaters for the crew and survivors consumes additional fuel as well. According to Dewechter, difficult decisions must be made to balance the need for the anti-ice system and the additional fuel burn of the auxiliary power unit on the helicopter to warm survivors pulled from the water. But that’s not the only challenge where fuel is concerned. “When icing conditions are present certain locations are no longer available for landing and close attention must be paid to fuel management and weather conditions in order to make sure we can land safely following a rescue,” Dewechter said. When an aircrew is returning from an off-shore search and rescue case and freezing rain is pounding down on the helicopter, the crew knows the anti-icing systems will keep the ice to a minimum for a safe return home. Coast Guard aircrews are trained and know what to do and how to perform their missions in the ever changing and always challenging New England weather."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1d615099-6659-49a1-a0d5-26cd57a5f727>","<urn:uuid:d6ec32af-b51a-4881-ab4f-83988ef10d6b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the monitoring and support systems differ between DelAgua's cook stoves in Rwanda and wodtke's wood-burning stoves?","answer":"DelAgua implements a comprehensive tracking system where each stove is scanned and registered to specific households, with 5,000 community health workers conducting monitoring visits every six months to ensure proper operation and provide ongoing support throughout the stove's 10-year lifespan. This monitoring system helps optimize stove usage and maximize carbon issuance. In contrast, wodtke's stoves rely on built-in technical systems for monitoring and control, such as the Air Control thermal regulation system with temperature sensors and capillary systems that automatically adjust air flow, requiring minimal user intervention and eliminating the need for external monitoring.","context":["At least one million households in Rwandan rural areas use environmentally friendly cook stoves donated by DelAgua, a British social enterprise involved in carbon emissions reduction. The stoves are distributed through DelAgua's carbon credit project called Tubeho Neza (“Live Well”), launched in 2012 in partnership with the government of Rwanda. As a carbon market project developer, DelAgua started with a modest goal of donating 2,000 stoves. Now, its staff can donate 2,000 stoves in two hours. With a target of donating 2.3 million stoves by the end of 2023, Tubeho Neza project is one of the world’s largest cook stove projects. The stove has a 10-year life span and reduces the amount of wood used for cooking by 71 per cent, addressing critical climate and health challenges at large scale. On project completion, DelAgua says the stoves will be reducing carbon emissions by over 8.6 million tonnes annually and saving some 64 square kilometres of forestry every year. As they celebrated the project’s 10th anniversary on Wednesday, October 26 in Rwamagana District, DelAgua staff donated the 1 millionth stove, marking a milestone in their emission reduction model. “I have used the stove for eight years now, and one of the most significant changes is the small amount of wood I use for cooking,” said Chantal Muhongerwa, a resident of Rwamagana District who has used the stove for eight years. “Cooking beans would take three to four hours, but with the stove it takes one hour. I used to suffer from sinusitis, but with the stove the respiratory disease has disappeared,” she added. An independent study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that DelAgua’s stove could reduce child mortality by about 47 per cent through its smoke reduction, making it much safer and also more efficient than a three stone fire. The DelAgua stove requires small pieces of twig, which rural families can gather without encroaching on forestry. It is designed to be used outdoors, cutting household air pollution. The stove, incorporating the vital long term education and support programme provided throughout the 10-year life of the stove, costs $80 (about Rwf80,000). This is a key differentiator compared to other types of clean cook stove projects and accounts for the extraordinary success rates of Tubeho Neza. Independent audits show that 99% of the other stoves are in use 2 years after distribution. The DelAgua stoves are made in Kenya and imported duty-free, thanks to a government tax exemption. Each recipient is registered and receives an instructional poster with the DelAgua stove. The stove is scanned and registered to a household so it can be tracked throughout its lifespan which ensures ongoing household support, optimises stove usage and maximises the carbon issuance that funds this programme. To distribute the stoves to households, DelAgua staff work with 5,000 community health workers, who also do monitoring visits every six months to ensure proper operation of the stoves and provide. The carbon project developer aims to employ 5,000 more community health workers over the next year to reach its distribution target. “One of the biggest benefits for families who use the stove is that it reduces the amount of fuel. Rather than using ten bundles of wood, you use three bundles. So that saves a lot of money for households if they buy the wood or reduces the time spent collecting it,” said Neil McDougall, Chairman of DelAgua Group. “Tubeho Neza is the biggest stove project in Africa. And by the time we finish this project with 2.3 million stoves – one in every rural household in Rwanda – we will be the first project in the world where the country has an improved cooking stove in every rural household.” McDougall appreciated the support of the Rwandan government in ensuring the project succeeds. “We want to be the partner of choice for the government in rural communities and are actively working on new projects such as community clean water projects,” he said. Jeanne d’Arc Mujawariya, the Minister of Environment said the DelAgua’s project contributed to Rwanda's endeavour in reduction of carbon emissions. “Reducing 2/3 of our wood consumption is equivalent to a 2/3 reduction in emission,” said Mujawamariya. “We encourage the beneficiaries of the stoves to use them appropriately and keep them well because these will in turn improve their lives for 10 years.” She added that the government is working with DelAgua on the development of solar cook stoves for the future benefit of Rwandans and the environment.","CO2 neutral heating with wood logs\nWood-burning stove with integrated water heat exchanger and very high efficiency (over 85%). 70% of the thermal energy is fed through the buffer storage system (min. 500l) into the heating cycle. Stored energy can be released from the buffer at any time and as needed. Only 30% of the nominal thermal output is radiated directly into the room. This means the stove can also be used in low-energy or passive houses.\nThermal discharge safety device, thermowell, air vent, fill and discharge valves are integrated into the stove.\nThis wood-burning stove has been granted a General Construction Authority Certification for room-air-independent operation by the DIBt (German Institute for Building Technology).\nFor room-air-independent operation, the combustion air supply must use a duct leading outdoors or be connected to an exhaust air flue.\nThis stove is ideally suited for installation in highly insulated buildings such as low-energy or passive houses in combination with a controlled home ventilation system.\nOf course, this wood-burning stove can also be operated using room air for combustion, which does not require air supply from outdoors.\nwodtke HiClean-Filter technology works without any complex additional components. With innovative filter materials and a well-thought-out air supply, emissions and fuel consumption are effectively reduced, while the stove's efficiency and heat exchange are increased significantly.\nThe depth filter made of ceramic foam and positioned above the combustion chamber retains the particles generated primarily during the initial phase of combustion. After the ignition temperature is exceeded, these are burnt, leaving the filter clear after each combustion phase. The filter also retains combustion gases for a longer period of time at a significantly higher temperature in the combustion chamber, leading to noticeably better combustion.\nModern wood-burning stoves need to be fast, creating thermal energy as quickly as possible and providing the cosy home atmosphere users expect. This requires a well-thought-out combustion chamber geometry and the right stove materials to ensure optimal heat yield and output. Intelligently located convection openings ensure energy is used efficiently and that radiant thermal energy reaches your entire living area.\nIn addition, many users prefer a system that stores heat, then emits it over a long period of time. Soapstone of different weights is a classic choice for heat storages of this type; soapstone can be used to cover large sections of the side of a stove, or as a small decorative panel.\nThe wodtke heat storage module is a new innovation.\nA massive storage block absorbs heat from the combustion chamber, then slowly emits it into the room as radiant heat. In this way, the stove ensures that you will enjoy the joy of heat and warmth for many hours.\nwodtke Air Control regulates the combustion air supply for an optimal combustion process. The system requires no valves or gates. This significantly increases operating comfort and eliminates user error. All users need to do is regularly refill the fuel supply.\nAir Control thermal regulation is based on a hydraulically activated control valve connected to a temperature sensor through a capillary system. Thanks to Air Control, the right quantity of combustion air is delivered to the right area of the combustion chamber. At the beginning, when the system is still cold, the fire needs a large quantity of primary air in order to quickly start a clean combustion process. This combustion air must be fed through the grate from below. As the system heats up, the thermal oil in the temperature sensor expands, slowly closing the control valve. This process automatically closes the primary air duct. Afterwards, the combustion air is fed downwards to the flame as secondary air and as an 'air curtain' for the window. This AWS air wash system effectively delays soiling of the viewing window."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:54b94829-30e9-490d-9323-03f82c952807>","<urn:uuid:7bd467d0-1474-4d04-b928-8cff7c0203bc>"],"error":null}
